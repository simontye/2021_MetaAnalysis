In a laboratory experiment, we evaluated the relative importance of competition and predation from juvenile and adult brown trout, respectively, on foraging performance of groups of three stone loaches. We observed loach consumption rate, time spent inactive, and aggressive interactions between juvenile trout and loach in artificial stream sections. The controlled experiments were complemented by examining stone loach population densities in natural systems as functions of juvenile and adult trout. In the laboratory experiments, increasing numbers of competitors decreased prey availability, which ultimately led to lower consumption rates for loach. Loach responded to predation risk by increasing time being inactive, thereby decreasing consumption rates. However, there were no effects of juvenile trout competitors on loach consumption rates in treatments with adult trout presence, suggesting no additive effect of predation and competition on loach foraging success. Partial regressions of loach and trout densities in natural streams revealed a positive relationship between juvenile trout and loach, and a negative relationship between adult trout and loach. Our laboratory and field data thus suggest that predation is a limiting factor for loach success, and predator presence could mediate species coexistence at high interspecific densities.","[Nilsson, Erika; Persson, Anders; Nilsson, P.

We found that both predation and interspecific competition greatly reduced the survivorship of larvae and the number of larvae emerging into adulthood. Treatments with both predators and competitors had fewer larvae transitioning among instars and into adulthood but not in an additive way. In addition, mosquito larvae in the presence of predators and competitors took two days longer to emerge than where predators and competitions were absent. Our work provides evidence that biotic interactions, such as predation and competition: can strongly regulate the number or mosquito larvae by reducing the number of larvae that survive through instars and to emergence and by increasing the generation time.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Knight, TM (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,"Goss, Charles/R-7296-2019",,,,,42,50,51,2,32,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,SANTA ANA,"PO BOX 87, SANTA ANA, CA 92702 USA",1081-1710,,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

Interspecific competition between mature dominant prey and mature sub-dominant prey species are considered, and three discrete time delays are incorporated into the model due to maturation time for sub-dominant prey, dominant prey and predator species, respectively. Positivity and boundedness of solutions are analytically studied. By utilizing some comparison arguments, an iterative technique is proposed to discuss permanence of solutions. Furthermore, existence of positive periodic solutions is investigated based on continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory. By constructing some appropriate Lyapunov functionals, sufficient conditions for global stability of the unique positive periodic solution are analyzed. Numerical simulations are carried out to show consistency with theoretical analysis obtained in this paper.","[Liu, Chao; Zhang, Qingling] Northeastern Univ, Inst Syst Sci, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaomin] Northeastern Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China","Liu, C (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Inst Syst Sci, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",liuchao@mail.neu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61104003]; Liaoning Excellent Talents in University [LJQ2014027]; Hebei Province Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [F2015501047]; Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao [XNK201301]; Hong Kong Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;  [61273008]","Authors gratefully acknowledge anonymous reviewers and editors' valuable comments.

The Lotka-Volterra interspecific competition model was used in order to calculate the degree of interaction between the two bacterial populations (beta(Ah/APC) and beta(APC/Ah), respectively, the interspecific competition coefficients of APC on Aeromonos hydrophila and vice-versa). Afterwards, the Lotka-Volterra equations were applied as tertiary predictive model,taking into account, simultaneously, the environmental fluctuations and the bacterial interspecific competition. This approach allowed to obtain a best fitting to the observed mean growth curves with a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.09 for Aeromonas hydrophila and 0.28 for APC.

J,"Buzzard, PJ",,,,"Buzzard, Paul J.",,,Cheek pouch use in relation to interspecific competition and predator risk for three guenon monkeys (Cercopithecus spp.),PRIMATES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cercopithecus; cheek pouches; guenons; interspecific competition; predator risk,BEHAVIOR; CHIMPANZEES; DIANA; ASSOCIATIONS,"Forest guenons (Cercopithecus spp.) are often found in polyspecific associations that may decrease predator risk while increasing interspecific competition for food. Cheek pouch use may mitigate interspecific competition and predator risk by reducing the time spent in areas of high competition/predator risk. I investigated these ideas in three forest guenons: Campbell's monkey (Cercopithecus campbelli), spot-nosed monkey (C. petaurista), and Diana monkey (C. diana). I present 13 months of scan sample data from Tai Forest, Cote d'Ivoire, including 3,675, 3,330, and 5,689 records of cheek pouch distention, to quantify cheek pouch use, for Campbell's, spot-nosed, and Diana monkeys, respectively. Cheek pouches are often used to hold fruit, so I first predicted that the most frugivorous species, Diana monkeys, would have the most cheek pouch distension. Spot-nosed monkeys ate the least amount of fruit over the study period and had the least distended cheek pouches, suggesting the importance of frugivory in relation to cheek pouch distension for this species. This was not a sufficient explanation for Campbell's monkeys; Campbell's ate fruit less than Diana monkeys, but had more distended cheek pouches, suggesting that cheek pouch use was not simply a reflection of high frugivory. From the interspecific competition hypothesis, I predicted that Campbell's monkeys would have more distended cheek pouches than Diana and spot-nosed monkeys, and more distended cheek pouches when associated with Diana because Campbell's monkeys have the highest potential for interspecific competition with dominant Diana monkeys. From the predator risk hypothesis, I predicted that Campbell's would have more distended cheek pouches when not associated with highly vigilant Diana monkeys. Campbell's monkeys had the most distended cheek pouches overall, but had more distended cheek pouches when not in association with Diana, suggesting the greater importance of predator risk rather than interspecific competition in Campbell's cheek pouch use.","Columbia Univ, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10027 USA; NYCEP, New York, NY USA","Buzzard, PJ (corresponding author), 10388 N 1st St, Altamont, IL 62411 USA.",cercopithecus@hotmail.com,,,,,,28,12,13,0,16,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0032-8332,1610-7365,,PRIMATES,Primates,OCT,2006,47,4,,,,,336,341,,10.1007/s10329-006-0188-6,,,6,Zoology,Zoology,101YO,WOS:000241777700007,16645704,,,,2021-09-21,

In the first part, the animals of two species are assumed to move on a two-dimensional array of spatial patches with local interactions of competition. In particular, we study the case of mutual exclusion To do this, we performed numerical simulations. Initially, the two competing species occupy complementary areas in an array of patches with a small common zone. Numerical simulations show that under particular conditions corresponding to sufficiently strong competition, one species goes extinct and the other invades the whole set of spatial patches. In this spatial version of a model of competition, a wave of extinction is created and propagates, The aim of this work is to study the formation of this extinction wave and its properties. Numerical simulations of our 2-D competition model show that with time, the length of the sympatry zone stabilizes and moves at a constant velocity. We obtain the asymptotic length of the sympatry band and its velocity as functions of the degree of competition between the two species. We also study a model of selective predation when a predator attacks the two competitors differently. We relate these spatial models to the case of two sibling bird species H. icterina and H. polyglotta.","LAB ECOL,F-21004 DIJON,FRANCE","AUGER, P (corresponding author), UNIV LYON 1,BIOL POPULAT LAB,CNRS,URA 24O,43 BD 11 NOVEMBRE 1918,F-69622 VILLEURBANNE,FRANCE.",,,"Auger, Pierre/0000-0003-2066-8174",,,,49,8,8,0,2,GAUTHIER-VILLARS,PARIS,"S P E S-JOURNAL DEPT, 120 BD ST GERMAIN, F-75006 PARIS, FRANCE",1146-609X,,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

Here, we examine how the density of an IG predator can affect feeding group size, IG egg predation, and the growth responses of IG prey. We used laboratory feeding trials and outdoor mesocosm experiments to study interactions between a social intraguild predator (larvae of the wood frog; Rana sylvatica) and its prey (spotted salamander; Ambystoma maculatum). Larvae of R. sylvatica could potentially affect A. maculatum by consuming shared larval food resources or by consuming eggs and hatchlings. However, successful egg predation requires group feeding by schooling tadpoles. We established from five to 1,190 hatchlings of R. sylvatica in mesocosms, then added either 20 A. maculatum hatchlings to study interspecific competition, or a single egg mass to examine IGP. Crowding strongly suppressed the growth of R. sylvatica, and IGP was restricted to the egg stage. In the larval competition experiment, growth of A. maculatum was inversely proportional to R. sylvatica density. In the predation experiment, embryonic mortality of A. maculatum was directly proportional to the initial density of R. sylvatica and the mean number of tadpoles foraging on egg masses. IGP on eggs reduced A. maculatum hatchling density, which accelerated larval growth. Surprisingly, the density of R. sylvatica had no overall effect on A. maculatum growth because release from intraspecific competition via egg predation was balanced by increased interspecific competition. Our results demonstrate that the density of a social IG predator can strongly influence the nature and intensity of interactions with a second guild member by simultaneously altering the intensity of IGP and intra- and interspecific competition.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Petranka, JW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Hts, Asheville, NC 28804 USA.",petranka@unca.edu,,,,,,37,17,19,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,641,649,,10.1007/s00442-006-0398-z,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,056OG,WOS:000238533400011,16514532,,,,2021-09-21,

In our model, the successful rate for a predator to prey depends on the individual ability to prey and the two interacting clusters sizes, and the size of a cluster is determined by the aggregation degree between individuals. Experimental results show that only one species can survive when competition occurs on one niche. And which species can survive ultimately depends on the relative relationship between the average individual ability to prey and the aggregation degree between it and its competing species. If competing species have identical values for the average individual ability to prey and the aggregation degree, the species that can survive is determined at random. Therefore, Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle is correct, but the causes of competing species to survive are different. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although appropriate for modelling events that occur at discrete time points, they are also routinely used to model biological processes that take place continuously. We report on a study comparing predictions of discrete time CA models to those of their continuous time counterpart. Specifically, we investigate how the decision to model time discretely or continuously affects predictions regarding long-run population sizes, the probability of extinction and interspecific competition. We show effects on predicted ecological outcomes, finding quantitative differences in all cases and in the case of interspecific competition, additional qualitative differences in predictions regarding species dominance. Our findings demonstrate that qualitative conclusions drawn from spatial simulations can be critically dependent on the decision to model time discretely or continuously. Contrary to our expectations, simulating in continuous time did not incur a heavy computational penalty. We also raise ecological questions on the relative benefits of reproductive strategies that take place in discrete and continuous time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a series of laboratory experiments with a freshwater assemblage consisting of two predators that differd in their foraging modes ( a crayfish, Procambarus sp., and the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis) and their prospective anuran prey (tadpoles of the narrow-mouthed toad, Gastrophyrne carolinensis, and the squirrel treefrog, Hyla squirella). We examined whether competition occurs within and between these two prey species and, if so, whether the non-lethal presence of predators alters the outcome of competitive interactions. We also asked whether the two species of prey differ in their susceptibility to the two types of predators and whether interspecific differences in predator avoidance behavior might account for this variation. Our results indicated that Gastrophyrne was a stringer competitor than Hyla at high densities of surviving conspecifics that metamorphosed. However, the presence of mosquitofish did not alter the outcome of this competition, nor did either type of predator affect the density-dependent responses of Gastrophryne. In laboratory foraging trials, the number of tadpoles of each species that was killed, but not completely consumed by mosquitofish, was similar for Gastrophryne and Hyla. Yet, significantly more individualsof Gastrophryne than of Hyla were killed and completely eaten by mosquitofish at the end of the experiment. The two species of prey did not differ in their spatial avoidance of either type of predator, suggesting that this behavior did not play a significant role in the differential vulnerability of the prey to predation. By reducing the abundance og G. carolinensis, the potential exists for predators, such as mosquitofish to ameliorate this species' competitive impact on other species. In this way, predators may promote coexistence of species withi some assemblages of amphibians.","Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA","Walls, SC (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Natl Wetlands Res Ctr, Biol Resources Div, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA.",,,,,,,53,9,9,1,18,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,EMPORIA,"EMPORIA STATE UNIV, DIVISION BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 1200 COMMERCIAL ST, EMPORIA, KS 66801-5087 USA",0018-0831,,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,MAR,2002,58,1,,,,,104,118,,10.1655/0018-0831(2002)058[0104:IDISTC]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Zoology,Zoology,527EB,WOS:000174172700009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Although recently resurrected as an organizing force in arthropod communities on plants, there is still general agreement that resource competition among herbivores is reduced by predators. Here we show the reverse: predators induce interspecific resource competition among herbivores. We found that thrips larvae (Frankliniella occidentalis) use the web produced and inhabited by the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a refuge from predation by the phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus curumeris. Thrips larvae prefer clean plant parts, but move into the web upon perceiving volatile cues associated with thrips and predators. This behaviour leads to lower predation risk, but also to reduced developmental rate and lower production of thrips larvae due to competition with spider mites. In addition, thrips larvae consume spider-mite eggs. Thus, predators induce interspecific competition and intraguild predation among herbivores within refuge space, even when host plants have an overall green appearance.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Systemat & Populat Biol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Pallini, A (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Anim, BR-36571000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545",,,,30,61,65,2,31,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

When both species were analysed together, and for D. longispina alone, there were weak negative relationships between mean population density and population variability. Interspecific competition resulted in lower population densities and higher population variability. Extinct populations had lower densities and were also more variable than persisting ones. There was still an effect of population variability on extinction probability after the effect of density on population variability had been accounted for. Hence, the effects of population density and variability on population persistence were partly independent of each other. The effects of size-selective predation on population persistence were more species-specific and not directly related to density or variability. Since the effects of species interactions on persistence were large, we suggest that it is likely that population vulnerability analyses not incorporating effects of interspecific interactions are often misleading.","UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN; SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, DEPT ECOL & ENVIRONM RES, S-75007 UPPSALA, SWEDEN","BENGTSSON, J (corresponding author), UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL, NERC, CTR POPULAT BIOL, SILWOOD PK, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,41,28,28,1,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1995,101,4,,,,,397,406,,10.1007/BF00329418,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QT597,WOS:A1995QT59700001,28306954,,,,2021-09-21,

Ecological theory on the trophic impacts of invasive fauna on native competitors is equivocal. Whilst increased interspecific competition can result in coexisting species having constricted and diverged trophic niches, the competing species might instead increase their niche sizes to maintain energy intakes. Empirical experiments can test invasion theory on competitive interactions and niche sizes across different spatial scales and complexity. 2. The consequences of increased interspecific competition from a model alien fish Leuciscus idus were tested on two taxonomically and trophically similar native fishes, Squalius cephalus and Barbus barbus. Competitive interactions were tested in tank aquaria using comparative functional responses (CFRs) and cohabitation trials. The consequences of these competitive interactions for the trophic niche sizes and positions of the fishes were tested in pond mesocosms. 3. Comparative functional responses revealed that compared to B. barbus, L. idus had significantly higher attack and consumption rates; cohabitation trials revealed B. barbus growth rates were depressed in sympatry with L. idus. For L. idus and S. cephalus, differences in their functional response parameters and growth rates were not significant. 4. Pond mesocosms used stable isotope metrics to quantify shifts in the trophic niche sizes of the fishes between allopatry and sympatry using a substitutive experimental design. Isotopic niches were smaller and more divergent in sympatric paired species than predicted by their allopatric treatments, suggesting trophic impacts from interspecific competition. However, an all-species sympatric treatment revealed similar niche sizes with allopatry. This maintenance of niche sizes in the presence of all species potentially resulted from the buffering of direct competitive effects of the species pairs by indirect effects. 5. Experimental predictions from tank aquaria assisted the interpretation of the constricted and diverged trophic niches detected in the paired-species sympatric treatments of the pond mesocosms. However, the all-species sympatric treatment of this experiment revealed greater complexity in the outcomes of the competitive interactions within and between the species. These results have important implications for understanding how alien species integrate into food webs and influence the trophic relationships between native species.","[Britton, J.

Within antagonist interactions, predation refers to a predator attacking and feeding on a prey while competition is an interaction where individuals compete for a common resource. Worldwide distributions of long-finned pilot whales and killer whales rarely overlap, and they are not known to feed on the same preys. However, in this study, we described the interactions between long-finned pilot whales and killer whales in the Strait of Gibraltar. The former was seen pursuing away the latter in all observations. The main hypotheses for the cause of these interactions are predation or competition. To test both hypotheses, movement patterns and isotopic niches of both species were investigated in the Strait of Gibraltar through satellite tagging and stable isotopes, respectively. Satellite tracks showed no overlap between one tagged pilot whale and one tagged killer whaler's distributions during 21 days. Similarly, Euclidian distances between centroids of Bayesian standard ellipse areas of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were significantly different from zero, showing different isotopic niches for each species. This shows that no competition for the resources should exist between both species in the Strait of Gibraltar and that they do not feed on each other, suggesting that the interactions would not be related to predation. A possible historical presence of marine mammal-eating killer whales in the area, today disappeared, could explain the antipredator defense mobbing-like behavior of pilot whales observed in the Strait.","[De Stephanis, R.; Gimenez, J.] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, GEMA, Seville 41092, Spain; [Esteban, R.; Gauffier, P.; Verborgh, P.] CIRCE Conservat Informat & Res Cetaceans, Cadiz 11390, Spain; [Garcia-Tiscar, S.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, Madrid, Spain; [Sinding, M-H.

Indirect interactions between competition and predation, such as keystone predation, can influence both invasion success and the impact of an invasive species on resident competitors. The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald) has been established within the North American range of the indigenous competitor Aedes triseriatus (Say) and indigenous mosquito predator Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett). The effects of Tx. rutilus predation on competition between Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus were tested in laboratory microcosms. Consistent with a prior study, there was minimal evidence of competitive asymmetry between Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus, with similar effects of intraspecific versus interspecific interactions on both species. Tx. rutilus predation caused high mortality of both Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus, and minimized the effects of density-dependent competition. Ae. japonicus females that survived predation had larger adult body sizes than those in treatments without predators. Ae. triseriatus females that survived Tx. rutilus predation were larger and developed quicker than individuals in treatments without predators. Intraspecific competition and predation negatively affected the finite rate of population increase for Ae. j. japonicus, but only affected individual fitness correlates for Ae. triseriatus, indicating that the overall population performance of the invader ismoresensitive to these interactions than the native species. Based on these results, we predict that predation is likely to be an important barrier to the establishment and spread of Ae. j. japonicus in tree holes in North America.","[Freed, T.

Predation has been claimed to increase, decrease, or have little effect on, the strength, impact or importance of interspecific competition. There is confusion about both the meaning these terms and the likelihood of, and conditions required for, each of these outcomes. In this article we distinguish among three measures of the influence of predation on competitive outcomes: short-term per capita consumption or growth rates, long-term changes in density and the probability of competitive coexistence. We then outline various theoretical mechanisms that can lead to qualitatively, distinct effects. of predators,. The qualitative effect of predators can depend both on the mechanism of competition and on the definition of competitive strength/impact. In assessing the empirical literature, we ask: (1) What definitions of competitive strength/impact have been assumed? (2) Does strong evidence exist to support one or more of the possible mechanisms that can produce a given outcome? (3) Do biases in the choice of organism or manipulation exist, and are they, likely, to have influenced the conclusions reached? We conclude by discussing several unanswered questions, and espouse a stronger interchange between empirical and theoretical approaches to this important question.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON, Canada; Univ Texas, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; Univ Munich, Dept Zool, Munich, Germany; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","Chase, JM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jchase@pitt.edu,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Nisbet, Roger M/B-6951-2014; Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X; Richards, Shane/0000-0002-9638-5827; Grover, James/0000-0003-2425-6927",,,,97,469,477,6,357,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

I quantified the effects of predation and competition on the growth and survival of two temperate reef fishes, Lythrypnus dalli and Coryphopterus nicholsii, in field experiments in which I manipulated the densities of the two species and the abundance of predators (using exclosure cages) on small replicate patch reefs. I also evaluated the influence of predators on the behavior of the two species to help interpret the mechanisms of any predatory influences on growth or survival. Predation was much more important than competition (inter- or intraspecific) in Lythrypnus. For Corphopterus, neither competition nor predation were particularly important. Behaviorally, both species responded to predators by reducing foraging rate and hiding. This altered behavior, however, had no repercussions for growth or survival of Coryphopterus!. In contrast, Lrthrypnus grew more slowly and suffered greater mortality when exposed to predators. Interspecific competition did not significantly influence either species. Intraspecific competition did not affect the growth of Coryphopterus, but survival tended to be lower at high densities. Growth of Lythrpnus was depressed by intraspecific competition, but survival was not, except that, in the presence of predators, survival was density dependent. In contrast to the historical emphasis placed on the role of competition, this study indicates that predation can be more important than competition in determining patterns of abundance of some reef fishes. For example, predators not influenced foraging of both Lythrpnus and Coryphopterus us, but they also reduced growth and survival of Lythrpnus and therefore appear to help maintain the marked habitat segregation between the two species. only.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Biol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Steele, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol, 621 Circle Dr S,Box 951606, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",masteele@ucla.edu,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917",,,,51,39,40,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,222,232,,10.1007/s004420050511,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700028,28308456,,,,2021-09-21,

We used grazing time among species as an indication of potential interspecific competition and predicted that grazing time on an open pasture would decrease if deer other than conspecifics were present or entered the pasture. We used 710 observational records in our analyses: 409 for white-tailed deer, 225 for fallow deer (Dama dama), 66 for red deer (Cerous elaphus), and 10 for roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). The time that white-tailed, fallow, and roe deer spent grazing was not affected by whether the pasture was harvested or whether any deer were present when the focal animal entered. We observed a strong tendency for grazing time by red deer to be directly related to the numbers of whitetails or female fallow deer visible before red deer entered the pasture. Grazing time of white-tailed and fallow deer increased if the focal deer was joined by another animal. For white-tailed and fallow deer, the and-predatory strategy of joining a group may have been balanced by avoiding the most competitive classes of animals. Our results suggest that interspecific cooperative behavior, rather than interspecific competition, occurs among these sympatric cervids.","Res Inst Anim Prod, Ethol Grp, CZ-10401 Prague, Czech Republic; Univ Georgia, Daniel B Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Bartos, L (corresponding author), Res Inst Anim Prod, Ethol Grp, POB 1, CZ-10401 Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,14,32,32,1,35,WILDLIFE SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2197 USA",0022-541X,,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

In field experiments, I varied densities of one or both isopod species in enclosures in which food and virus presence were also manipulated. I estimated the effects of intra- and interspecific competition, additional food, and virus infection on both the survival of P. scaber and the prevalence of the virus. In uninfected populations, intraspecific and interspecific competition negatively affected isopod survival, although food resources had no effect. In infected treatments, interspecific competition produced higher levels of virus prevalence than did intraspecific competition. Virus infection and reduced food interacted to produce higher overall mortality in interspecific competition treatments than in intraspecific competition treatments. The lack of significant effect of food on competition suggests that interference interactions rather than resource competition predominated. This mechanism is supported by a laboratory study in which total food availability was controlled. These results indicate that competition and parasitism interacted to produce the observed mortality patterns, and that ignoring mortality due to the virus would produce apparent interspecific competition. The data suggest that the impact of P. laevis on P. scaber involves both direct and indirect effects.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720",,,,,,,,49,76,78,0,57,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1992,73,2,,,,,507,514,,10.2307/1940756,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HK464,WOS:A1992HK46400010,,,,,2021-09-21,

In four different sets of analyses that took account of habitat stratum, habitat type and activity pattern on competition and predation pressure, significant differences were found in the extent to which American carnivore families potentially encounter other carnivores. Members of largely omnivorous families, Canidae and Ursidae, co-occur with a greater proportion of potential competitors than members of families with more specialized diets. We found that members of the Mustelidae family may reduce competition by being arboreal or aquatic, and that members of the Procyonidae and Mephitidae are potentially under great predation pressure but the former reduce this threat by being arboreal whereas Mephitidae likely reduce predation through advertising noxious secretions. In one analysis, conspicuous species with both contrasting facial and body colouration co-occurred with more potential predators than other less striking species of carnivore suggesting that intraguild predation is an evolutionary driver of contrasting coat colouration in carnivores. These quantitative analyses suggest that several facets of carnivore niche occupation and morphology have evolved in response to intraguild pressures.","[Hunter, J.; Caro, T.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Hunter, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jshunter@ucdavis.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System,"Data were gleaned from NatureServe in collaboration with Bruce Patterson, Wes Sechrest, Marcelo Tognelli, Gerardo Ceballos, The Nature Conservancy - Migratory Bird Program, Conservation International - CABS, World Wildlife Fund - US, and Environment Canada - WILDSPACE.

Following its recent invasion of eastern Asia, the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) co-inhabits maize fields with native lepidopteran herbivores, such as the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura. Here, drawing upon laboratory and field studies, we demonstrate how late-instar S. frugiperda larvae directly prey upon S. litura immature stages and competitively displace them from the maize whorl. Individual maize plants did not mediate the above interactions, with herbivore-damaged leaves not affecting the development rate of either species. In the field, ecological niches of S. frugiperda and S. litura overlapped, with species-specific occupancy rates of whorl-stage leaves (vegetative phase) and ears or tassels (reproductive phase) exceeding 70% and 90%, respectively. Field cage trials showed that S. frugiperda larvae either preyed upon or repelled S. litura larvae from maize plants, routinely resulting in more than 90% mortality of the latter. Field visits and cage studies in Yunnan (SW China) also revealed how-within an approx. 1-year time period-S. frugiperda has become a dominant species in local maize fields and co-infestation of both herbivores on the same plant is rare. Overall, our work shows how the invasive S. frugiperda exhibits a clear competitive advantage over native lepidopterans and could replace certain species within local agroecosystems. This study not only unveils the mechanistic causes of rapid ecological shifts within S. frugiperda-invaded cropping systems, but may also guide subsequent monitoring and management interventions.","[Song, Yifei; Wyckhuys, Kris A.

Coexistence theory for two competing species posits that intraspecific density dependence should be stronger than interspecific density dependence. Great tits and blue tits are two bird species that compete for food resources and nesting cavities. On the basis of long-term monitoring of these two competing species at sites across Europe, combining observational and manipulative approaches, we show that the strength of density regulation is similar for both species, and that individuals have contrasting abilities to compete depending on their age. For great tits, density regulation is driven mainly by intraspecific competition. In contrast, for blue tits, interspecific competition contributes as much as intraspecific competition, consistent with asymmetric competition between the two species. In addition, including age-specific effects of intra- and interspecific competition in density-dependence models improves predictions of fluctuations in population size by up to three times.","[Gamelon, Marlene; Vriend, Stefan J.

In the Loire Basin, France, a major restocking effort has been carried out on the Allier River to reduce the wild population decline. This study aimed at investigating the trophic insertion of hatchery-reared salmon parr and whether they compete for resources with native fish species. For this purpose, two riffles located in the upstream and downstream parts of the restocked area have been surveyed monthly following the initial 0+ salmon fry release. 0+ parr densities remained high upstream, with autumnal values greater than those recommended to maximise smolt production. In contrast, downstream densities declined to weak values despite a faster increase in size, probably mainly due to summer temperatures rising above the discomfort threshold. By analysing the vulnerability to predation of ingested invertebrate prey, we highlighted the role of habitat constraints in driving most of the different fish species to a likely opportunistic utilisation of available food resources. As a result, species such as stone loaches and barbel juveniles exhibited narrow trophic niches and high overlaps with 0+ parr. Nonetheless, both abundant prey resources and spatial or temporal habitat segregation have limited interspecific competition, enabling competitive coexistence of sympatric species, except for barbel juveniles in certain circumstances. Therefore, our findings suggest that future restocking programmes should carefully consider the thermal and hydraulic conditions regarding further smolt production as well as their general trophic context, according to the potential inconvenience of restocked salmon fry arrival relative to native species.","[Floury, Mathieu] Ctr Lyon Villeurbanne, Irstea, UR RiverLy, 5 Rue Doua,CS 20244, F-69625 Villeurbanne, France; [Colombet, Jonathan; Desvilettes, Christian] Univ Clermont Auvergne, LMGE, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Colombet, Jonathan; Desvilettes, Christian] CNRS, UMR 6023, LMGE, Aubiere, France","Floury, M (corresponding author), Ctr Lyon Villeurbanne, Irstea, UR RiverLy, 5 Rue Doua,CS 20244, F-69625 Villeurbanne, France.",mathieu.floury@irstea.fr,,"Floury, Mathieu/0000-0002-4952-5807",FEDER Loire; Loire-Bretagne Basin Water Authority,FEDER Loire; Loire-Bretagne Basin Water Authority,,80,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

By causing large reductions in native prey, invasive predators may modify native species interactions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment in The Bahamas to investigate the possibility that the invasive Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) alters competition between planktivorous fairy and blackcap basslets (Gramma loreto and Gramma melacara, respectively). Competition between these coral-reef fishes is known to have symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species, whereby the feeding positions under reef ledges and growth rates of these individuals are hindered. Following baseline censuses of local populations of competing basslets, I simultaneously manipulated the abundance of lionfish on entire reefs, and the abundance of basslets in local populations under isolated ledges within each reef, resulting in three treatments: unmanipulated control populations of both basslets, reduced abundance of fairy basslet, and reduced abundance of blackcap basslet. For eight weeks, I measured the change in biomass and feeding position of 2-5cm size classes of each basslet species and calculated the growth rates of similar to 2cm individuals using a standard mark-and-recapture method. Experimental populations were filmed at dusk using automated video cameras to quantify the behavior of lionfish overlapping with basslets. Video playback revealed lionfish hunted across all ledge positions, regardless of which basslet species were present, yet lionfish differentially reduced the biomass of only juvenile (2cm) fairy basslet. Predation reduced the effects of interspecific competition on juvenile blackcap basslet as evidenced by corresponding shifts in feeding position toward coveted front edges of ledges and increases in growth rates that were comparable to the response of these fish in populations where competition was experimentally reduced. Thus, an invasive marine predator altered the outcome of interspecific competition via differential predation, which tipped the balance of competition between native prey species from symmetrical to asymmetrical effects on juveniles. This study reveals a newly demonstrated context in which predation can indirectly facilitate prey, further broadening our understanding of the interactive effects of predation and competition in the context of invasive species.","[Kindinger, Tye L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Kindinger, Tye L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.; Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",tkinding@ucsc.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This study is a chapter from the author's doctoral dissertation (committee: M.

Dynamics of any local population depends upon attributes of the local habitat. Although, use of refuge habitat by prey population can reduce their risk of predation, refuge use may also involve cost such as increased interspecific and intraspecific competition within the refuge patch. Surveys in the Sunderban mangrove ecosystem show that two detritivorous prey fishes Liza parsia and Liza tade coexist in nature by using refuges with the presence of the predator fish population Lates calcarifer. In view of such observations in mind, a three component model conceiving of two competing prey and one predator is considered in the present study with the inclusion of Holling type-II response function incorporating a fraction of prey refuge. The geographic position of these refuge patches tend to determine the population of prey residing in these patches which ultimately leads to the interspecific competition inclusion between prey. Here, we have differentiated the geographic position of the refuge patch into five different cases, for example, disjoint refuge patch (no competition between refuge prey population), partially overlapping refuge patch (competition between non-refuge and partially refuge prey population), only one prey refuge patch (competition between one prey population entirely and non-refuge prey population of the other) and common refuge patch (competition between both refuge and non-refuge prey in and out of the common patch). Equilibrium abundance of each population and the stability criterion are absolutely motivated by the interspecific competition strategies by both prey due to their patch selection. Mathematical results and numerical results support these hypothesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Studying these interactions under fluctuating food availability, while taking habitat characteristics into account, offers a quasi-experimental setup to determine the relative impact of con-and heterospecifics on reproductive success of predators. We analyzed the settlement decisions and reproductive success of Eurasian Pygmy Owls (Glaucidium passerinum) in the presence of both breeding conspecifics and their competitor and intraguild predator, Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus), under fluctuating abundance of their primary prey (voles). We used detailed data, collected across 11 years in a large study area (1300 km(2)), on the spatial and temporal variation of habitat characteristics in all available nesting sites, local densities of both species, and vole abundance. We found that Pygmy Owls strongly avoided breeding close to conspecifics but did not avoid Tengmalm's Owl nests. Nest box occupation of Pygmy Owls was positively correlated to the proportion of old spruce, mature and old pine forests, and farmlands, and occupation probability was higher at high vole abundance and in areas occupied in previous years. Pygmy Owl avoidance of conspecifics decreased when voles were abundant. At high conspecific density, Pygmy Owls showed lower hatching success and delayed hatching date, in agreement with the observed spatial avoidance. Finally, even though breeding Pygmy Owls did not spatially avoid Tengmalm's Owls, the density of heterospecifics correlated with low hatching and fledging success in Pygmy Owls. This suggests short term fitness costs when living close to competitors, even when lethal effects of intraguild interactions are subtle. Our results suggest that joint costs of exploitative and interference competition by Tengmalm's Owls, as well as intraguild predation, were lower than those induced by intraspecific competition only. This result might be due to the similar body size between the species considered, Tengmalm's Owls being only twice as large as Pygmy Owls. Interactions among con-and heterospecifics can therefore modify the spatial settlement and reproductive success of individuals on a landscape scale, also within the predator guild.","[Morosinotto, Chiara; Villers, Alexandre; Thomson, Robert L.; Varjonen, Rauno; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Villers, Alexandre] Univ Rochelle, CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UMR7372, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Thomson, Robert L.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa","Morosinotto, C (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",chimor@utu.fi,"Morosinotto, Chiara/AAK-5266-2020; Villers, Alexandre/W-8184-2019; Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Morosinotto, Chiara/0000-0002-9172-894X; Villers, Alexandre/0000-0003-3050-4106","Center for International Mobility (CIMO [TM-07-4819]; Finnish Cultural Foundation-South Ostrobothnia Regional fund; Turku University Foundation; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Biological Interactions Graduate School; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [138049, 123379, 136717, 250709]","The two-first authors (C.

Interspecific competition is often asymmetrical and the smaller carnivore is usually affected the most. We investigated the behavioural responses of two native species, the larger Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the smaller spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) to each other's odour and to that of an introduced predator, the feral cat (Felis catus), in north-west Tasmania, Australia. We used an experimental array of camera traps, in which carnivore scats were added as treatments. Behavioural responses exhibited by devils and quolls are indicative of a dominant predator-mesopredator relationship and suggest the potential for interspecific competition. The larger predator, the devil, was as vigilant at quoll odour as at control camera traps, but showed decreased vigilance at cat odour and did not avoid cat or quoll odours. The smaller predator, the spotted-tailed quoll, increased its vigilance near devil odour compared to control camera traps but did not avoid it. This experiment shows that assessing the behavioural responses of sympatric carnivores to each other's odour can help understand predator interactions and reveal the potential for interspecific competition. Understanding these interactions is crucial in managing and conserving carnivores. Animals navigate through an environment full of faecal odours left by predators, competitors and conspecifics. These odours provide information on both the immediate presence and the indirect risk of encountering a predator or an aggressive competitor. Tasmania's largest predator, the Tasmanian devil, coexists with the smaller spotted-tailed quoll and the introduced feral cat. We tested the behavioural responses of Tasmanian devils and spotted-tailed quolls to each other's faecal odour and to cat faecal odour. Behavioural patterns exhibited by predators in this experiment are indicative of a dominant predator-mesopredator relationship and suggest the potential for interspecific competition.

We studied relationships between interspecific competition and predation risk in Ponto-Caspian invasive gammarid crustaceans: Pontogammarus robustoides and Dikerogammarus villosus. We hypothesized that a stronger competitor D. villosus would displace P. robustoides from a preferred habitat, but the frequency of this displacement would be reduced in the presence of a higher fish predator, the racer goby. We studied gammarid preferences for stone or sand substrata in 24-h pairwise-choice tests in single-species or mixed-species treatments, at 2 densities (12 or 24 individuals per tank), in the presence or absence of a predator. D. villosus displaced P. robustoides from the stone habitat, even at the low density. As P. robustoides tested separately preferred stones at both densities, its displacement resulted from active avoidance of a stronger competitor even when the substratum was not actually a limited resource. The presence of a predator reduced the number of instances of displacement of P. robustoides by D. villosus, allowing the weaker species to stay on its preferred substratum. Nevertheless, the presence of D. villosus still increased fish predation on P. robustoides. The presence of a predator modifies relationships between prey organisms, allowing a weaker competitor to stay in its preferred habitat. Thus, anti-predator responses of prey organisms may have cascading effects on the functioning of the community, affecting habitat choice and competition among species.","[Jermacz, Lukasz; Dzierzynska, Anna; Poznanska, Malgorzata; Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Kakareko, Tomasz] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Hydrobiol, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Jermacz, L (corresponding author), Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",lukasjermacz@gmail.com,"Poznanska, Malgorzata/H-6261-2014; Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Jermacz, Lukasz/B-8728-2017","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Jermacz, Lukasz/0000-0001-9182-116X; Poznanska-Kakareko, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7224-3093; Kakareko, Tomasz/0000-0001-5054-7416","National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland [2012/05/B/NZ8/00479, 2013/09/N/NZ8/03191]",Our study was supported by the grants of the National Science Centre No. 2012/05/B/NZ8/00479 and 2013/09/N/NZ8/03191.,,68,18,18,1,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

By alleviating interspecific competition among prey, predators may promote biodiversity, but the precise mechanisms of how predators alter competition have remained elusive. Here we report on a predator-exclosure experiment carried out in a tropical intertidal ecosystem, providing evidence for a three-level trophic cascade induced by predation by molluscivore Red Knots (Calidris canutus) that affects pore water biogeochemistry. In the exclosures the knots' favorite prey (Dosinia isocardia) became dominant and reduced the individual growth rate in an alternative prey (Loripes lucinalis). Dosinia, a suspension feeder, consumes suspended particulate organic matter (POM), whereas Loripes is a facultative mixotroph, partly living on metabolites produced by sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria, but also consuming suspended POM. Reduced sulfide concentrations in the exclosures suggest that, without predation on Dosinia, stronger competition for suspended POM forces Loripes to rely on energy produced by endosymbiotic bacteria, thus leading to an enhanced uptake of sulfide from the surrounding pore water. As sulfide is toxic to most organisms, this competition-induced diet shift by Loripes may detoxify the environment, which in turn may facilitate other species. The inference that predators affect the toxicity of their environment via a multi-level trophic cascade is novel, but we believe it may be a general phenomenon in detritus-based ecosystems.","[van Gils, Jan A.; van der Geest, Matthijs; Jansen, Erik J.; de Fouw, Jimmy; Piersma, Theunis] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Govers, Laura L.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Piersma, Theunis] Univ Groningen, CEES, Anim Ecol Grp, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","van der Geest, M (corresponding author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.",matthijs.van.der.geest@nioz.nl,"Piersma, Theunis/D-1871-2012; van Gils, Jan/B-5544-2008; van der Geest, Matthijs/A-4744-2013; Govers, Laura/B-8838-2011","van Gils, Jan/0000-0002-4132-8243; van der Geest, Matthijs/0000-0002-9837-3803; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",NWO-WOTRONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [W.01.65.221.00],"We are grateful to the staff of the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin for allowing us to work and stay in the area under their management.

Because the Gray Wolf with the GPS collar and his mate were first-time breeders and were attempting to establish a territory space of their own, we speculate that, based on the available evidence, this observation most likely represents a case of non-parental infanticide that fits the predictions of the resource competition hypothesis.","[Latham, A.

Moreover, how spatial habitat heterogeneity affects the persistence of interacting invasive and native species is also poorly understood. Here we show how the persistence of a native prey (water vole, Arvicola terrestris) is determined by the spatial distribution of an invasive prey (European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus) and directly infer how this is defined by the mobility of a shared invasive predator (American mink, Neovison vison). This study uniquely demonstrates that variation in habitat connectivity in large-scale natural landscapes creates spatial asynchrony, enabling coexistence between apparent competitive native and invasive species. These findings highlight that unexpected interactions may be involved in species declines, and also that in such cases habitat heterogeneity should be considered in wildlife management decisions.","[Oliver, Matthew; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose; Lambin, Xavier] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland","Lambin, X (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland.",x.lambin@abdn.ac.uk,"Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011; Oliver, Matthew/I-4511-2012; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/D-6454-2014","Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/0000-0001-6425-637X",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/E006434/1]; Marie Curie FellowshipEuropean Commission [HPMF-CT-2002-01813],"This project was supported by a grant from the Natural Environment Research Council (NE/E006434/1) and a Marie Curie Fellowship to JJL-L (HPMF-CT-2002-01813).

A laboratory experiment showed that the competitive interactions between the two shrimps were qualitatively altered in the presence of a predator. H. geniculatus was competitively superior in the absence of the predator, while the presence of the predator acted to lower activities of both species, resulting in a reduced intra- and interspecific interference competition. Based on the experimental data on the behavioral changes, we constructed a model for population dynamics of the shrimp community, and examined the conditions for coexistence of the prey species in terms of their recruitment rates and death rates in the presence and absence of predator.

In addition, predator presence alone can also have non-consumptive effects on prey species, potentially influencing their interspecific interactions and thus the structure of entire assemblages. The performance of potential prey species may, therefore, depend on both the presence of predators and competitors. We studied habitat use and food consumption of a marine mesograzer, the amphipod Echinogammarus marinus, in the presence/absence of a fish mesopredator and/or an amphipod competitor. The presence of the predator affected both habitat choice and food consumption of the grazer, indicating a trade-off between the use of predator-free space and food acquisition. Without the predator, E. marinus were distributed equally over different microhabitats, whereas in the presence of the predator, most individuals chose a sheltered microhabitat and reduced their food consumption. Furthermore, habitat choice of the amphipods changed in the presence of interspecific competitors, also resulting in reduced feeding rates. The performance of E. marinus is apparently driven by trait-mediated direct and indirect effects caused by the interplay of predator avoidance and competition. This highlights the importance of potential non-consumptive impacts of predators on their prey organisms. The flexible responses of small invertebrate consumers to the combined effects of predation and competition potentially lead to changes in the structure of coastal ecosystems and the multiple species interactions therein.","[Beermann, Jan; Gutow, Lars] Alfred Wegener Inst, Dept Funct Ecol, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, POB 120161, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Beermann, Jan; Boersma, Maarten; Carolina Peralta, Ana] Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Postbox 180, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany; [Beermann, Jan] Helmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers, Oldenburg, Germany; [Boos, Karin] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Leobener Str 8, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Boersma, Maarten] Univ Bremen, FB2, D-FB2 Bremen, Germany; [Carolina Peralta, Ana] Univ Simon Bolivar, Marine Biol Lab, Caracas, Venezuela","Beermann, J (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Dept Funct Ecol, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, POB 120161, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany.; Beermann, J (corresponding author), Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Postbox 180, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany.; Beermann, J (corresponding author), Helmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers, Oldenburg, Germany.",Jan.Beermann@awi.de,"Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013; Brichtova, Ana Carolina Peralta/AAX-3669-2020","Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X; Beermann, Jan/0000-0001-5894-6817",Nippon Foundation-POGO Centre of Excellence,"ACP was financially supported by the Nippon Foundation-POGO Centre of Excellence.

We suggest that the main cause for the population crash was winter starvation caused by (1) over-hunting of reindeer Rangifer tarandus populations, and thus reduced carcass availability in the mountains, and (2) increased interspecific competition for these carcasses because of increased invasion of red foxes Vulpes vulpes from lower altitudes. The failure of arctic fox populations to recover, despite increasing reindeer populations in the mid 1900s, can be explained by a concurrent strong increase in red fox numbers. Analyses of countywide hunting statistics from Norway 1891-1920 suggest that there actually was an increase in red fox numbers in the period of arctic fox decline, and that the increase in reindeer populations from the 1920s to the 1950s was accompanied by a new increase in red fox numbers. We conclude that restoring arctic fox populations most likely will require a substantial and lasting reduction of red fox populations.","Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Selas, V (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, PO Box 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",vidar.selas@umb.no,"Vik, Jon Olav/B-9350-2008","Vik, Jon Olav/0000-0002-7778-4515",,,,36,16,17,0,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Herein, we explore how fish predation and competition interact to drive this change in crayfish species composition. In outside pools, we conducted selective predation experiments exposing crayfish to largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, to quantify patterns of crayfish vulnerability. To determine how interactions among crayfish influence susceptibility, we quantified shelter use and behavioral interactions among crayfish in aquaria and outside pools. At equal size, O, virilis was more susceptible to fish predation than either of the invaders, O. rusticus and O. propinquus; the two invaders were equally susceptible to predation. However, sizes of these crayfish in the field are O. virilis > O. rusticus > O. propinquus. Because fish predators prefer small crayfish, at unequal size, small O. propinquus were more vulnerable to predation than large O. rusticus. Thus, O. rusticus can replace O. propinquus due to natural size differences. Although O. virilis grows larger than the invaders, it was more susceptible even when 3 mm larger. We hypothesized that O. virilis, although large, participated in behaviors that increased its risk to predation. When provided with unlimited shelters, all three species increased refuge use under predatory risk. When shelters were limiting and fish present, O. virilis was excluded from shelters by invaders. O. virilis also participated in risky behaviors, such as increased activity and swimming. Both agonistic interactions with congeners and approaches by largemouth bass increased risky behaviors in O. virilis. In addition, O. virilis was innately less aggressive than invaders. Given these behaviors, O. virilis was consumed at high rates and would be eventually replaced in lakes. In northern Wisconsin lakes, fish predation and crayfish-crayfish competition interact to influence crayfish replacements. Based on our results, largemouth bass predation modifies the outcome of interference competition among the three crayfishes and, in turn, competitive interactions among the crayfishes influence susceptibility to fish predation. We predict that O. virilis should suffer high mortality to fish predation in the presence, rather than in the absence, of the two invading species. Our results support the hypothesis that, in areas of sympatry where predators are selective and prey species compete, predation and competition interact to determine community structure.",,"GARVEY, JE (corresponding author), OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,AQUAT ECOL LAB,COLUMBUS,OH 43210, USA.",,"Garvey, Jim/A-4919-2012; Langerhans, R.

Highly complex habitats, for example, may reduce predation and competition, allowing more individuals living together in a certain area. However, the strength and direction of such interactions can differ strongly and are context dependent. Furthermore, as habitat characteristics are rapidly changing due to anthropogenic impacts, it becomes increasingly important to understand such interactions. Here, we studied the interactive effects of predation and competition on common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) recruitment, growth and survival under different habitat characteristics in the Wadden Sea, one of the world's largest intertidal ecosystems. In a predator-exclosure experiment, we manipulated cockle densities (100 vs. 1000 individuals m(-2)) and shorebird predation at two sites differing in habitat characteristics, namely at the wake of a blue mussel bed (Mytilus edulis) and at an adjacent sandy site. We found that recruitment was higher in the mussel-modified habitat, most likely due to reduction of hydrodynamic stress. Although bird predation strongly reduced recruit density, the combined effects still yielded more recruitment at the vicinity of the mussel bed compared to the sandy area. Furthermore, we found that high cockle densities combined with high densities of other potential prey (i.e. mussels) at the mussel-modified site, mitigated predation effects for adult cockles. Apart from these positive effects on adults, mussel-modified habitat reduced cockle growth, most likely by reducing hydrodynamics in the wake of the mussel bed and by increasing inter-specific competition for food. Our study experimentally underpins the importance of habitat characteristics, competition and predation in interactively structuring intertidal communities.","[de Fouw, Jimmy] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van der Zee, Els M.] Altenburg & Wymenga Ecol Res, Suderwei 2, NL-9269 TZ Veenwouden, Netherlands; [van Gils, Jan A.; van der Veer, Henk W.; Piersma, Theunis; van der Heide, Tjisse] Univ Utrecht, NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Eriksson, Britas Klemens; Olff, Han; Piersma, Theunis; van der Heide, Tjisse] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Weerman, Ellen J.] Univ Appl Sci, HAS Den Bosch, Onderwijsblvd 221, NL-5223 DE sHertogenbosch, Netherlands; [Donadi, Serena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources SLU Aqua, Stangholmsvagen 2, SE-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden","de Fouw, J (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",j.defouw@science.ru.nl,"van der Heide, Tjisse/M-3000-2013; Eriksson, Britas Klemens/D-8601-2015","Eriksson, Britas Klemens/0000-0003-4752-922X; Donadi, Serena/0000-0002-8920-9630; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",NWO grant of the 'Nationaal Programma Zee-en Kustonderzoek' [839.08.310],"thank T.

Most studies have focused on the effect of large invasive fishes such as salmonids, whereas the effect of smaller fish on amphibians has been seldom investigated. We experimentally studied effects of the invasive Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) on pygmy newts (Triturus pygmaeus), a species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We set up outdoor mesocosms in Doana National Park with native aquatic flora and invertebrate fauna, and containing larval newts at two experimental densities. Density of larval newts was also crossed with presence or absence of mosquitofish, either free-swimming or caged, in order to distinguish consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Increased density of coexisting larval newts did not reduce their survival, but reduced their growth and development. Newt survival and size at metamorphosis were dramatically reduced in the presence of free-swimming mosquitofish, whether at low or high fish densities. Caged mosquitofish, however, had no effect on larval newts. In laboratory trials, mosquitofish preyed more efficiently on insect larvae than did larval pygmy newts, highlighting the high competitive potential of mosquitofish. This was confirmed by the depletion of zooplankton that free fish caused in the experimental outdoor mesocosms. Our study suggests that invasive mosquitofish exert a high negative impact on coexisting newt populations. Such effects can be explained by a combination of direct predation, injuries caused by predation attempts, and intense competitive exploitation of common food resources.","[Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Ave Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain; [Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Cabrera-Guzman, E; Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Ave Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain.",elisa.cabrera_guzman@okstate.edu; igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RDI [SEV-2012-0262, SO-07]; CONACYT (ConsejoNacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia deMexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [204202]","We thank Lola Asencio, Rosa Arribas, Pablo Burraco, Rafael Carmona, Sara Castro, Carmen Fernandez, Pilar Fernandez, Ana Herrero, Maria Leon, Raquel Lopez and Daniel Moen for help in the field or in the laboratory.

The environments ranged along two parallel gradients of rainfall amount and predictability, from low (desert) to moderate (semi-steppe batha) to high (Mediterranean grassland and mountain, the latter also experiencing frost stress). The target barley plants grew under one of five densities (0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 surrounding plants per bucket) of either barley from the same population or oats (A vena sterilis) from a neutral population. The traits examined included estimates of fitness, reproductive traits, and resource allocation. The effect of intraspecific competition was stronger than interspecific competition at a high increment of neighbor density (from 4 to 32 neighbors). There was no difference in interspecific competitive responses of plants originating in the four environments at any neighbor density increments, but intraspecific competitive responses of the four ecotypes consistently differed at low competitive intensity (4 neighbors). The superior competitors were the plants originating from Mediterranean grassland, the most favorable with respect to rainfall and abiotic stress (i.e., drought or frost) environment. The plants from the mountain environment, which is highly productive and predictable with respect to rainfall but experiences severe frost stress, were the poorest competitors. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that there is no relationship between competitive ability and environmental favorability. High competitive ability appears to be a distinct property of plants living in favorable environments (i.e., productive, predictable, and without abiotic stress) corresponding to the competitive strategy of the C-S-R model. However, in less productive and/or predictable environments, or under conditions of severe abiotic stress, plant features other than ability to tolerate low water or nutrient levels may be more important, with reduced competitive ability as a trade-off.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Inst Appl Res, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel","Volis, S (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Inst Appl Res, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",volis@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"Ward, David/E-9814-2010",,,,,51,3,4,0,15,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0792-9978,2223-8980,,ISR J PLANT SCI,Isr.

Although interspecific competition is based on two mechanisms, exploitation of resources and physical interference, trade-off studies largely consider only species' ability to exploit resources. Using a mesocosm experiment, we examined the trade-off between interference competition ability and susceptibility to predation in larvae of two newt species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. In the presence of heterospecifics, L.vulgaris larvae slowed somatic growth and developmental rates, and experienced a higher frequency of injuries than in conspecific environments which suggests asymmetrical interspecific interference. During short-term predation trials, L.vulgaris larvae suffered higher mortality than I.alpestris. Larvae of the smaller species, L.vulgaris, had both lower interference and antipredator performance than the larger I.alpestris, which suggests a lack of trade-off between interference competition ability and predator susceptibility. We conclude that interference competition may produce a positive rather than negative relationship with predation susceptibility, which may contribute to the elimination of subordinate species from common habitats.","[Hlouskova, Monika; Krsakova, Veronika] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Brno, Czech Republic; [Balogova, Monika] Safarik Univ, Fac Sci, Inst Biol & Ecol, Kosice, Slovakia; [Gvozdik, Lumir] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno, Czech Republic","Gvozdik, L (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno, Czech Republic.",gvozdik@brno.cas.cz,"Gvozdik, Lumir/G-1178-2014","Gvozdik, Lumir/0000-0002-6495-2233","Grantova Agentura Ceske RepublikyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-07140S, 17-15480S]","Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky, Grant/ Award Number: 15-07140S and 17-15480S",,80,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Secondary metabolism also can be costly, as it shunts energy and intermediates from primary metabolism. In Pseudomonas spp., secondary metabolism is controlled by the GacS-GacA global regulatory system. Intriguingly, spontaneous mutations in gacS or gacA (Gac(-) mutants) are commonly observed in laboratory cultures. Here we investigated the role of secondary metabolism in the accumulation of Gac(-) mutants in Pseudomonas protegens strain Pf-5. Our results showed that secondary metabolism, specifically biosynthesis of the antimicrobial compound pyoluteorin, contributes significantly to the accumulation of Gac(-) mutants. Pyoluteorin biosynthesis, which poses a metabolic burden on the producer cells, but not pyoluteorin itself, leads to the accumulation of the spontaneous mutants. Interspecific competition also influenced the accumulation of the Gac(-) mutants: a reduced proportion of Gac(-) mutants accumulated when P. protegens Pf-5 was cocultured with Bacillus subtilis than in pure cultures of strain Pf-5. Overall, our study associated a fitness trade-off with secondary metabolism, with metabolic costs versus competitive benefits of production influencing the evolution of P. protegens, assessed by the accumulation of Gac(-) mutants. IMPORTANCE Many microorganisms produce antibiotics, which contribute to ecologic fitness in natural environments where microbes constantly compete for resources with other organisms. However, biosynthesis of antibiotics is costly due to the metabolic burdens of the antibiotic-producing microorganism. Our results provide an example of the fitness trade-off associated with antibiotic production. Under noncompetitive conditions, antibiotic biosynthesis led to accumulation of spontaneous mutants lacking a master regulator of antibiotic production. However, relatively few of these spontaneous mutants accumulated when a competitor was present. Results from this work provide information on the evolution of antibiotic biosynthesis and provide a framework for their discovery and regulation.","[Yan, Qing; Chang, Jeff H.; Loper, Joyce E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Lopes, Lucas D.; Andreote, Fernando D.] Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Shaffer, Brenda T.; Kidarsa, Teresa A.; Stockwell, Virginia O.; Loper, Joyce E.] ARS, Hort Crops Res Lab, USDA, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Vining, Oliver; Philmus, Benjamin; McPhail, Kerry L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Song, Chunxu; Raaijmakers, Jos M.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Microbial Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands","Loper, JE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.; Loper, JE (corresponding author), ARS, Hort Crops Res Lab, USDA, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",loperj@science.oregonstate.edu,"Andreote, Fernando Dini/B-8499-2012; Lopes, Lucas Dantas/AAC-4149-2019; Raaijmakers, Jos M/D-1574-2014; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Andreote, Fernando Dini/0000-0002-9883-9968; Raaijmakers, Jos M/0000-0003-1608-6614; Philmus, Benjamin/0000-0003-2085-0873; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-67019-30192]; College of Pharmacy start-up funds; Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,"This work was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive grant 2011-67019-30192 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (to J.E.L.), College of Pharmacy start-up funds (to B.P.), and by a fellowship from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (to J.M.R.).",,62,17,17,0,13,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",2150-7511,,,MBIO,mBio,JAN-FEB,2018,9,1,,,,,,,e01845-17,10.1128/mBio.01845-17,,,18,Microbiology,Microbiology,FY6XN,WOS:000427006300026,29339425,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

We analysed nest-site characteristics, breeding success and competitive interactions between two apex predator populations. Whereas the Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus has nested in the Judean Foothills (Israel) for a long time, the Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus has only invaded the nesting habitat of the Short-toed Eagle during their breeding season in the last two decades. These two recently sympatric species have similar nesting ecology and frequently use the same nests. They are therefore expected to compete over nesting sites and territories. We analysed interspecific interactions between these two species by combining information from comprehensive observational, experimental, GIS analysis and remote sensing data, deriving 65 variables to characterize the nest- sites used and the breeding success in 381 breeding attempts over four consecutive breeding seasons. To assess interspecific and intraspecific territorial behaviour and aggressiveness, stuffed Long-legged Buzzards and Short-toed Eagles were presented close to nests. Nestsite characteristics overlapped substantially between species, and Long-legged Buzzards occupied 21% of all Short-toed Eagle nests. Intraspecific aggression rates among Long-legged Buzzards were higher than their interspecific aggression rates with Short-toed Eagles and also higher than intraspecific aggression among Short-toed Eagles. Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle breeding densities (1.59 +/- 0.11 and 2.96 +/- 0.11 pairs per 10 km(2), respectively) are likely to be the highest across their respective breeding distributions, with a maximum productivity of 0.96 +/- 0.01 and 0.56 +/- 0.05 (young fledged/breeding pair) for Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle, respectively. Intraspecific interactions among both species play an important role in determining their breeding success and the spatial distribution of nesting sites. Our results suggest that interspecific competition over nesting sites and territories between both species, and the potential dominance of Long-legged Buzzard, has both direct and indirect impacts on the spatial and demographic distribution of Short-toed Eagles due to the recent establishment of Long-legged Buzzard territories in the Judean breeding area.","[Friedemann, Guilad; Leshem, Yossi; Kerem, Lior] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Bar-Massada, Avi] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, Qiryat Tivon, Israel; [Izhaki, Ido] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Fac Nat Sci, Haifa, Israel","Friedemann, G (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.",gilad.fridman@gmail.com,"Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF); Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel); Smaller-Winnikow Foundation; Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA); Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI); Rieger Foundation (USA); Raptor Research Foundation (RFF); International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel); Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel),"This research was supported by the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel), Smaller-Winnikow Foundation, Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI), Rieger Foundation (USA), Raptor Research Foundation (RFF), The International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel) and Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel).

Predation risk affects interspecific competition by decreasing foraging activity and relative competitive ability. Predation risk is determined by predators' prey choice and prey responses, both of which can be influenced by temperature. Temperature is especially important for larval prey and can result in a trade-off between predator-induced decreases in foraging activity and growth. Interspecific competition must also be examined in relation to intraspecific density-dependent competition; weaker interspecific competition leads to coexistence of competitors. 2. This study explored how temperature (15 and 25 degrees C) could affect a focal species, larvae of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, by examining prey choice in a shared predator (mosquitofish; Gambusia holbrooki) and the effects of predation risk on interspecific competition with Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles. Intraspecific density-dependent competition in C. quinquefasciatus at these temperatures was also examined. 3. At 25 degrees C, G. holbrooki consumption of both C. quinquefasciatus and L. peronii increased; however, the effects of interspecific competition on mosquito survival did not decrease with L. peronii exposure to predation risk. The relationship between intraspecific density-dependent competition and interspecific competition was temperature-dependent, with competitive dominance of L. peronii at 25 degrees C. Male and female mosquitoes had different temperature-dependent responses, indicating sex-specific intrinsic responses to starvation and differential selection pressures. At 25 degrees C, females were susceptible to interspecific competition by L. peronii, while males were susceptible to intraspecific competition. 4. The use of competitors as biological controls has implications for mosquito disease transmission, and these results suggest that control effectiveness may be modified by climate change.","[Grigaltchik, Veronica S.; Seebacher, Frank] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Webb, Cameron] Univ Sydney, Dept Med Entomol, Westmead, NSW, Australia; [Webb, Cameron] Westmead Hosp, Pathol West ICPMR Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia","Grigaltchik, VS (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",vgri9756@uni.sydney.edu.au,,"Webb, Cameron/0000-0003-1029-5140; Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140102773],"This work was funded by a Discovery Grant to FS from the Australian Research Council (DP140102773).

Coexistence of predators that share the same prey is common. This is still the case in size-structured predator communities where predators consume prey species of different sizes (interspecific prey responses) or consume different size classes of the same species of prey (intraspecific prey responses). A mechanism has recently been proposed to explain coexistence between predators that differ in size but share the same prey species, emergent facilitation, which is dependent on strong intraspecific responses from one or more prey species. Under emergent facilitation, predators can depend on each other for invasion, persistence or success in a size-structured prey community. Experimental evidence for intraspecific size-structured responses in prey populations remains rare, and further questions remain about direct interactions between predators that could prevent or limit any positive effects between predators [e.g. intraguild predation (IGP)]. Here, we provide a community-wide experiment on emergent facilitation including natural predators. We investigate both the direct interactions between two predators that differ in body size (fish vs. invertebrate predator), and the indirect interaction between them via their shared prey community (zooplankton). Our evidence supports the most likely expectation of interactions between differently sized predators that IGP rates are high, and interspecific interactions in the shared prey community dominate the response to predation (i.e. predator-mediated competition). The question of whether emergent facilitation occurs frequently in nature requires more empirical and theoretical attention, specifically to address the likelihood that its pre-conditions may co-occur with high rates of IGP.","[ten Brink, Hanna; Mazumdar, Abul Kalam Azad; Huddart, Joseph; Persson, Lennart; Cameron, Tom C.] Umea Univ, S-90742 Umea, Sweden; [Cameron, Tom C.] Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","Cameron, TC (corresponding author), Umea Univ, S-90742 Umea, Sweden.",tcameron@essex.ac.uk,"Brink, Hanna ten/R-3606-2019; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012; Cameron, Tom/H-9555-2012","Brink, Hanna ten/0000-0001-6772-7229; Cameron, Tom/0000-0002-5875-1494",Marie Curie Intra-European FellowshipEuropean Commission [275873]; Erasmus; Umea University,"This work was funded by a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship to TCC (FANTI-SIZE, 275873), Erasmus travel grants (HTB, JH) and by Umea University (LP, MAKA).

In systems where predators regulate prey abundance, it is reasonable to assume that differential patterns of habitat use by prey species represent adaptive responses to spatial variation in predation. However, patterns of habitat use also reflect interspecific competition over habitat. Collared (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) and brown (Lemmus trimucronatus) lemmings represent such a system and possess distinct upland tundra versus mesic meadow habitat preferences consistent with interspecific competition. Yet, we do not know whether this habitat preference might also reflect differences in predation risk or whether the two species differ in their behavioral tactics used to avoid predation. We performed experiments where we manipulated putative predation risk perceived by lemmings by increasing protective cover in upland and meadow habitats while we recorded lemming activity and behavior. Both lemming species preferentially used cover more than open patches, but Dicrostonyx was more vigilant than Lemmus. Both species also constrained their activity to protective patches in upland and meadow habitats, but during different periods of the day. Use of cover and vigilance were independent of habitat, suggesting that both species live in a fearsome but flattened landscape of fear at Walker Bay (Nunavut, Canada), and that their habitat preference is a consequence of competition rather than predation risk. Future studies aiming to map the contours of fear in multi-prey-predator systems should consider how predation and competition interact to modify prey species' habitat preference, patch use, and vigilance.","[Dupuch, Angelique] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Dupuch, Angelique; Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Halliday, William D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",Douglas.Morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Canada's International Polar Year program Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable EcoSystems; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Department of Indian and Northern Affairs; Northern Scientific Training Program; Polar Continental Shelf Project (Natural Resources Canada)Natural Resources Canada,"We thank Canada's International Polar Year program Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable EcoSystems, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, Northern Scientific Training Program, and Polar Continental Shelf Project (Natural Resources Canada), for financial and logistical support.

Strategies should be different for indirect resource competition (exploitation, e.g., foraging and avoidance behaviour) than for direct interspecific interference (e.g., aggression, vigilance, and nest guarding). We studied the effects of resource competition and nest predation in sympatric small mammal species using semi-fossorial voles and shrews, which prey on vole offspring during their sensitive nestling phase. Experiments were conducted in caged outdoor enclosures. Focus common vole mothers (Microtus arvalis) were either caged with a greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) as a potential nest predator, with an herbivorous field vole (Microtus agrestis) as a heterospecific resource competitor, or with a conspecific resource competitor. Results: We studied behavioural adaptations of vole mothers during pregnancy, parturition, and early lactation, specifically modifications of the burrow architecture and activity at burrow entrances. Further, we measured pre- and postpartum faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) of mothers to test for elevated stress hormone levels. Only in the presence of the nest predator were prepartum FCMs elevated, but we found no loss of vole nestlings and no differences in nestling body weight in the presence of the nest predator or the heterospecific resource competitor. Although the presence of both the shrew and the field vole induced prepartum modifications to the burrow architecture, only nest predators caused an increase in vigilance time at burrow entrances during the sensitive nestling phase. Conclusion: Voles displayed an adequate behavioural response for both resource competitors and nest predators. They modified burrow architecture to improve nest guarding and increased their vigilance at burrow entrances to enhance offspring survival chances. Our study revealed differential behavioural adaptations to resource competitors and nest predators.","[Liesenjohann, Monique; Liesenjohann, Thilo; Eccard, Jana Anja] Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med, Dept Nat Sci Biochem, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Liesenjohann, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",monique.liesenjohann@uni-potsdam.de,"Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008","Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [ec361/4-1],"We thank Prof. Fritz Trillmich for providing his laboratory at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, for the FCM extractions and Elke Hippauf for technical support with the extractions.

Researchers have frequently examined the roles of competition and predation in terrestrial or semi-aquatic communities of salamanders, but have rarely examined the influence of these factors between these communities. We conducted mesocosm and laboratory behavioral experiments (1) to test hypotheses, derived from by a previous laboratory study, in a semi-natural setting and (2) to formulate new hypotheses regarding novel species-pair combinations. Our mesocosm experiments did not support a previous hypothesis of predation by Desmognathus fuscus (a semi-aquatic species) on Plethodon cinereus (a terrestrial species), but did support a prediction that P cinereus would avoid D. fuscus. We predicted that behavioral experiments between pairs of semi-aquatic species would demonstrate predatory behavior by D. fuscus toward E. cirrigera and aggressive behavior by D. ochrophaeus toward Eurycea cirrigera; we did not find strong evidence for either predation or aggression. This finding was surprising given the similar activity patterns and dietary habits of these species. Although we predicted that Desmognathus might influence local distributions of heterogeneric salamanders through interspecific aggression in a manner similar to that seen within this genera, we found that both D. fuscus and D. ochrophaeus displayed much less aggression than expected. However, D. juscus, in particular, appears to induce avoidance behavior in both P. cinereus and E. cirrigera without evidence of predation or excessive aggression, indicating that interference competition may be an important factor in structuring plethodontid communities.","Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA","Ransom, TS (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Gilmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",tsr6a@virginia.edu,,,,,,48,8,8,0,14,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,NOV,2006,143,,11,,,,1357,1382,,10.1163/156853906778987524,,,26,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,127BR,WOS:000243560800004,,,,,2021-09-21,

We used manipulated resource patches (seed trays) covered with cages with two adjustable species-specific gates (either opened or closed to the bigger-dominant species, but always opened to the subordinate one). We recorded species tracks around and on the seed trays and giving-up densities (GUDs) of seeds in the trays after each night of foraging. G. a. allenbyi depleted seed patches to a lower level whenever G. pyramidum was given the opportunity to forage on the seed trays (i.e., present on the grid). This result held regardless of whether G. pyramidum was actually present at a particular station. We suggest that competition from G. pyramidum occurs both directly by interference, in which G. a. allenbyi is forced to be active in the late part of the night, and indirectly by exploitation via resource depletion by G. pyramidum in the early part of the night. The results suggest that interspecific competition from G. pyramidum reduces seed availability and the richness of the environment for G. a. allenbyi enough to affect the marginal value of energy for G. a. allenbyi individuals and cause them to experience lower costs of predation and manifest lower GUDs.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84993 Sede Boqer, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Kotler, BP (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sde Boqer Campus, IL-84993 Sede Boqer, Israel.",kotler@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,46,20,20,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Interactions among predators can disrupt, facilitate, or augment biological pest control. We estimated the relative strengths of cannibalism and interspecific predation in a maize-aphid-coccinellid predator system. We know from previous work that Adalia bipunctata females tend to oviposit at the top of the plant near large aphid aggregations and that Coleomegilla maculata females tend to oviposit at the bottom of the plant far from large aphid aggregations. We used this information to design experiments to estimate the relative strength of cannibalism and interspecific predation. At high aphid densities, eggs at the top of the plant, near aphids, were preyed upon more than eggs at the bottom of the plant, far from aphids. This result implies that A. bipunctata suffers greater egg mortality than C. maculata. Tn part, this was due to the foraging pattern of A. bipunctata and also the large populations of aphidophagous predators that develop as a result of the large aggregations of aphids at the top of the maize plant. In predator-enclosure experiments, A. bipunctata searched primarily near large aggregations of aphids and therefore fed more on eggs at the top of plants near large aggregations of aphids. C. maculata searched throughout, yet tended to feed on more eggs at the bottom of the plant. This demonstrated that for both species the effect of cannibalism was equal to or stronger than that of interspecific predation. These findings suggest that species-specific oviposition behaviors largely determined the relative strength of cannibalism and interspecific predation. Cannibalism and interspecific predation can be analyzed as interference competition. Using competition theory, we were able to make predictions about coccinellid species' joint impact on aphids and species dominance.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Ctr Community Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Schellhorn, NA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Schellhorn, Nancy/B-6716-2009",,,,,50,83,85,0,34,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Two mechanisms have been advanced by which a decrease in growth may increase the mortality of young predators: (1) increased time during which juvenile predators are susceptible to gape-limited predation and (2) increased susceptibility to starvation. To study the effects of competition from a prey fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) on the recruitment of a piscivorous fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis), roach were introduced in two of four small adjacent unproductive lakes inhabited by natural populations of perch. We thereafter studied the diet, growth, and survival of the new-born cohorts of perch during a 13-mo period. Growth and survival of larval perch were not affected by roach whereas during the latter part of the growing season, growth and condition of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch were negatively affected by roach. The growth retardation of YOY perch in roach-treatment lakes coincided with a shift in diet from free-swimming zooplankton to benthic cladocerans and chironomids, which in turn was related to a stronger decline in pelagic zooplankton resources in these lakes. The small size and poor condition of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes resulted in almost all these perch dying from starvation during the winter and subsequent spring. There was a tendency for there to be higher densities of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes, possibly due to a strong die-off of adult perch in these lakes that in turn may have reduced cannibalism in these lakes. The results from an enclosure experiment on intra-cohort competition among YOY perch, however, suggested that the discrepancy in growth of YOY perch between the lakes was mainly due to direct competition from roach for the zooplankton resource. Temporal variation in competition intensity and in duration of periods for growth and energy gain (e.g., summer) vs. periods of only energy loss (e.g., winter) are suggested to have major effects on juvenile predator growth and subsequent recruitment to the adult stage through competitive juvenile bottlenecks, and thus to affect overall community dynamics. The relative importance of size-dependent winter starvation mortality compared to mortality caused by gape-limited predators as a mortality agent on juveniles is hypothesized to increase with latitude. Whole-lake experiments lend themselves both to testing the importance in natural systems of mechanisms previously identified at small spatial and short temporal scales, and also to identifying important mechanisms that cannot be studied at smaller scales.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,,,,94,121,127,1,43,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1998,79,6,,,,,2153,2167,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2153:CPAPJB]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,116YM,WOS:000075752700026,,,,,2021-09-21,

It has been suggested that E. willamettei may be beneficial in vineyards because it may have a negative impact: an the more damaging T, pacificus through their shared predator or through some form of interspecific competition, We conducted field and greenhouse experiments to determine the relative effects of these interactions between the two herbivores on the population dynamics of T, pacificus in 'Thompson Seedless' grape vineyards. We also used the field data to generate a functional relationship for the combined impact of E. willamettei and M. occidentalis on T, pacificus. 2, Predation and predator-mediated apparent competition were the only factors affecting T, pacificus densities in the field experiment, The addition of the predatory mite M, occidentalis alone resulted in a significant reduction in T, pacificus densities, while the addition of E, willamettei alone had little impact on T, pacificus densities. The greatest reductions in T. pacificus densities occurred in plots where both the predatory mite M, occidentalis and E, willamettei were added, The predatory mite occurred earliest and increased at the greatest rate in plots where it was released along with E. willamettei. From April to June, M. occidentalis abundance was positively correlated with E. willamettei abundance while T. pacificus abundance in July and August was negatively correlated with M. occidentalis abundance in the period April to June. 3, Under greenhouse conditions, the addition of E. willamettei to T. pacificus vines resulted in a marked decrease in T pacificus population growth rate. In contrast, doubling T. pacificus abundance in the absence E willamettei did not affect T. pacificus population growth rate, indicating that interspecific competition is more important than intraspecific competition in determining T. pacificus abundance, 4, Contrary to the greenhouse data and other studies in 'Zinfandel' vineyards, we found no evidence that E, willamettei competed with T, pacificus in the absence of predation in a Thompson Seedless vineyard. We suggest that the outcome of interactions between E, willamettei and T. pacificus may be affected by grape cultivar, growing region, a combination of cultivar and region-specific differences, or size and timing of vine infestations with E, willamettei. 5, In Thompson Seedless vineyards, ville infestation with E, willamettei would be most useful in increasing the effectiveness of the predatory mite M. occidentalis in controlling T, pacificus, primarily through an elevated predatory mite abundance prior to the development of large T, pacificus populations.",,"Hanna, R (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,"Wilson, Lloyd T/E-9971-2011",,,,,40,28,28,0,14,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo, body mass approximate to 2700 g), Ural Owls (Strix uralensis, 900 g), and Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus, 130 g) coexist in Fennoscandia and feed mainly on small rodents. Predation may play an important role in interactions among these owl species, because Eagle Owls and Ural Owls can kill Tengmalm's Owls but cannot enter the small entrance hale of Tengmalm's Owl nest boxes. We asked (i) whether predation risk and interspecific competition due to Eagle Owls and Ural Owls reduced breeding density and fitness of Tengmalm's Owls, and (ii) whether these interactions increased intraspecific competition for safe nesting sites among Tengmalm's Owls. We manipulated breeding densities of potentially competing owls by erecting nest boxes, the control being boxes in areas where breeding attempts of competing owl species were absent. Control nest boxes in areas with no Eagle Owl and Ural Owl territories, and nest boxes within Eagle Owl territories, were used by breeding Tengmalm's Owls more than nest boxes within Ural Owl territories. Most breeding attempts of Tengmalm's Owls near Ural Owls failed during the courtship period. The observational data revealed that breeding frequency of Tengmalm's Owls was reduced and the mean start of egg laying was delayed by 11 d within 2 km of Ural Owl nests. In addition, male Tengmalm's Owls at these nests were younger and paired more often with short-winged (i.e., young and generally subdominant) females than when farther away from Ural Owl nests. Our results suggest that inexperienced male Tengmalm's Owls are forced to establish their territories in the vicinity of Ural Owls where they often paired with subdominant females. The areas near Ural Owl nests are suboptimal habitats fdr Tengmalm's Owls, whereas those near Eagle Owls are not. We conclude that predatory and competitive interactions from Ural Owls decrease the breeding population size of Tengmalm's Owls by reducing the suitable habitats.

While temporal resource partitioning has long been hypothesized to reduce the negative effects of interspecific competition, empirical evidence suggests that time may not often be an axis along which animal species routinely subdivide resources. Here, we present evidence to the contrary in the world's most biodiverse group of animals: insect parasites (parasitoids). Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis of 64 studies from 41 publications to determine if temporal resource partitioning via variation in the timing of a key life-history trait, egg deposition (oviposition), mitigates interspecific competition between species pairs sharing the same insect host. When competing species were manipulated to oviposit at (or near) the same time in or on a single host in the laboratory, competition was common, and one species was typically inherently superior (i.e. survived to adulthood a greater proportion of the time). In most cases, however, the inferior competitor could gain a survivorship advantage by ovipositing earlier (or in a smaller number of cases later) into shared hosts. Moreover, this positive (or in a few cases negative) priority advantage gained by the inferior competitor increased as the interval between oviposition times became greater. The results from manipulative experiments were also correlated with patterns of life-history timing and demography in nature: the more inherently competitively inferior a species was in the laboratory, the greater the interval between oviposition times of taxa in co-occurring populations. Additionally, the larger the interval between oviposition times of competing taxa, the more abundant the inferior species was in populations where competitors were known to coexist. Overall, our findings suggest that temporal resource partitioning via variation in oviposition timing may help to facilitate species coexistence and structures diverse insect communities by altering demographic measures of species success. We argue that the lack of evidence for a more prominent role of temporal resource partitioning in promoting species coexistence may reflect taxonomic differences, with a bias towards larger-sized animals. For smaller species like parasitic insects that are specialized to attack one or a group of closely related hosts, have short adult lifespans and discrete generation times, compete directly for limited resources in small, closed arenas and have life histories constrained by host phenology, temporal resource subdivision via variation in life history may play a critical role in allowing species to coexist by alleviating the negative effects of interspecific competition.","[Hood, Glen Ray; Blankinship, Devin; Doellman, Meredith M.; Feder, Jeffrey L.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Galvin Life Sci Ctr 100, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hood, Glen Ray] Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 5047 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA","Hood, GR (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Galvin Life Sci Ctr 100, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.; Hood, GR (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 5047 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",glenrayhood@wayne.edu,,,Entomological Society of America; Indiana Academy of Science; Sigma Xi; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF-IGERT GLOBES Fellowship from the University of Notre Dame; NSF-GLOBES REU Fellowship from the University of Notre Dame; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Agriculture NIFA program,"We thank G.

Because interspecific and exploitative competition for suitable ledges may have a vital influence on the survival and reproduction of Verreaux's Eagles (Aquila verreauxii) and Chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), an investigation into the reciprocal rock-ledge usages by the two species will improve our understanding of this trait. In this study, we used camera traps stationed at four eagle nests to study interspecific interactions at nest sites. At the first two eagle nests, no baboons were recorded, and two young birds fledged successfully. At the third nest, the baboons only slept on the nest once the fledgling successfully left the nest. At the fourth nest, the eagles did not breed and the birds (eight visits) and baboons (three visits) used the nest interchangeably over a 28-day period. Whereas the cliff-ledge provided a secure nest site for the Verreaux's Eagles in the breeding season, for Chacma baboons sleeping on an inaccessible ledge may limit predation by terrestrial predators (e.g. by leopard Panthera pardus). This alternating usage of cliff ledges suggests that the two species probably co-use this limited cliffside resource to increase their own fitness.","[Malan, G.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Nat Conservat, Pretoria, South Africa; [Padayachee, K.] Univ Cape Town, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Padayachee, K.] KaiNav Conservat Fdn, Johannesburg, South Africa","Padayachee, K (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, Rondebosch, South Africa.; Padayachee, K (corresponding author), KaiNav Conservat Fdn, Johannesburg, South Africa.",kailen@kainavconservation.org,,"Malan, Gerard/0000-0002-6261-4513",National Research Foundation; Birdlife Northern Gauteng; The Sean Williams Living Creatures Trust; KaiNav Conservation Foundation; Department of Nature Conservation of the Tshwane University of Technology,"We thank all the land-downers that provided us with access to the eagle nests on their properties, and to Pieter and Natasja Saunders from the Wonderboom Urban Black Eagle Project and Walter Nesser from Vulpro for assisting with setting up of the nest cameras along the Magaliesberg.

We placed paired germinated and ungerminated acorns of Quercus mongolica on 30-cm high platforms to exclude potential interspecific competition of the predominant larder hoarders Apodemus peninsulae and Myodes rufocanus, to investigate seed dispersal by a predominant scatter-hoarder, Tamias sibiricus, in the field in north-eastern China. Our results showed that T. sibiricus ate more acorns in situ in the absence of interspecific competition. In the presence of interspecific competition of A. peninsulae and C. rufocanus, however, more acorns were scatter-hoarded by T. sibiricus. Regardless of interspecific competition, germination of acorns showed no significant effects on seed dispersal patterns, inconsistent with the seed perishability hypothesis that animals avoid hoarding seeds with high perishability. Exclusion of interspecific competition, though relatively increasing the per capita seed abundance, appears to reduce seed dispersal, scatter-hoarding and seedling establishment. Therefore, we propose that moderate interspecific competition rather than competition exclusion may benefit seed scatter-hoarding and seedling establishment.","[Deng, Yinhua; Yi, Xianfeng] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ju, Mengyao; Yi, Xianfeng] Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qufu, Shandong, Peoples R China","Yi, XF (corresponding author), Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",ympclong@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31760156]; Young Talents Invitation Program of Shandong Provincial Colleges and Universities,Funding for this study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31760156) and the Young Talents Invitation Program of Shandong Provincial Colleges and Universities.

This hypothesis was recently formalised in an agonistic character displacement (ACD) model which predicts that species should evolve to defend territories against heterospecific rivals above a threshold level of reproductive interference. To test this prediction, we parameterised the model with field estimates of reproductive interference for 32 sympatric damselfly populations and ran evolutionary simulations. Asymmetries in reproductive interference made the outcome inherently unpredictable in some cases, but 80% of the model's stable outcomes matched levels of heterospecific aggression in the field, significantly exceeding chance expectations. In addition to bolstering the evidence for ACD, this paper introduces a new, predictive approach to testing character displacement theory that, if applied to other systems, could help in resolving long-standing questions about the importance of character displacement processes in nature.","[Grether, Gregory F.; McEachin, Shawn] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Drury, Jonathan P.] Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, Durham, England; [Okamoto, Kenichi W.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Biol, St Paul, MN USA; [Anderson, Christopher N.] Dominican Univ, Dept Biol Sci, River Forest, IL 60305 USA","Grether, GF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",ggrether@g.ucla.edu,"Okamoto, Kenichi/AAA-3763-2021; Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011","Okamoto, Kenichi/0000-0002-1889-4538; ","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1020586, DEB-1213348, DEB-1457844, DEB-1722607]; UC MEXUS","The comments of five anonymous reviewers led to substantial improvements in the manuscript.

We analyzed cases of interspecific aggression between crows (American Crow [Corvus brachyrhynchos] and Northwestern Crow [C. caurinus]) and ravens (Common Raven [C. corax]) using similar to 2,000 citizen scientist observations of interspecific aggression between crows and ravens from across North America. Crows and ravens may attack one another for nonadaptive reasons, because they compete with each other for food and space, or because they are nest predators of each other. We report 3 main results. First, although ravens are much larger than crows, crows chased and attacked ravens in similar to 97% of observations. We observed this strong asymmetry in the direction of interspecific aggression throughout North America. Second, crow aggression toward ravens was most frequent during the crows' nesting season (similar to March-May), but also occurred in other seasons. Third, crows typically attacked ravens in small groups, with relatively few observations of aggression in one-on-one contests. The pattern of seasonality in crow attacks on ravens suggests that nest predation by ravens is an important factor driving interspecific aggression from crows. Aggression also occurred outside the breeding season, particularly in the winter, indicating either that crows compete with ravens for resources at this time of year or that crows preemptively harass potential nest predators in advance of the breeding season. This study is an example of how citizen scientists can contribute to the study of behavioral interactions of birds at a continental scale.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Miller, Eliot T.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA","Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",freeman@zoology.ubc.ca,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1523695]; Banting Canada [379958]; Biodiversity Research Centre at the University of British Columbia; Cornell Lab of Ornithology,"This research was supported by postdoctoral fellowships to B.G.F. from the National Science Foundation (Award No. 1523695), Banting Canada (No. 379958), and the Biodiversity Research Centre at the University of British Columbia, and to E.T.M. from the Rose Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

Using data on forest-dwelling hawks from Finland, we addressed the impact of an IG predator, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis (goshawk), on the breeding of an IG prey, the common buzzard Buteo buteo. We hypothesized that the subordinate common buzzard avoids breeding in the proximity of goshawks and that interspecific competitors, mainly Strix owls, may also disturb common buzzards by competing for nests and food. Our results show that common buzzards more frequently occupied territories with a low IG predation threat and with no interspecific competitors. We also observed that common buzzards avoided territories with high levels of grouse, the main food of goshawks, possibly due to a risk of IG predation since abundant grouse can attract goshawks. High levels of small rodents attracted interspecific competitors to common buzzard territories and created a situation where there was not only an abundance of food but also an abundance of competitors for the food. These results suggest interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes which influence the interactions between avian predator species. We conclude that the common buzzard needs to balance the risks of IG predation and interference competition with the availability of its own resources. The presence of other predators associated with high food levels may impede a subordinate predator taking full advantage of the available food. Based on our results, it appears that interspecific interactions with dominant predators have the potential to influence the distribution pattern of subordinate predators.","[Bjorklund, Heidi; Santangeli, Andrea; Valkama, Jari] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist Luomus, POB 17, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Bjorklund, Heidi; Santangeli, Andrea; Blanchet, F.

Herbivorous white-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys leucurus) employ an unusual strategy to reduce interspecific competition: they kill, but do not consume, herbivorous Wyoming ground squirrels (Urocitellus elegans) encountered in the prairie dog territories. Results from a 6-year study in Colorado, USA, revealed that interspecific killing of ground squirrels by prairie dogs was common, involving 47 different killers; 19 prairie dogs were serial killers in the same or consecutive years, and 30% of female prairie dogs killed at least one ground squirrel over their lifetimes. Females that killed ground squirrels had significantly higher annual and lifetime fitness than non-killers, probably because of decreased interspecific competition for vegetation. Our results document the first case of interspecific killing of competing individuals unrelated to predation (a) among herbivorous mammals in the wild, and show that IK enhances fitness for animals living, under natural conditions.","[Hoogland, John L.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Appalachian Lab, 301 Braddock Rd, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA; [Brown, Charles R.] Univ Tulsa, Dept Biol Sci, 800 South Tucker Dr, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA","Hoogland, JL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Appalachian Lab, 301 Braddock Rd, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA.",hoogland@al.umces.edu,"Hoogland, John/AAC-9808-2021; Hoogland, John/B-3950-2015",,Colorado Parks and Wildlife; Denver Zoological Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"Colorado Parks and Wildlife, the Denver Zoological Foundation and the National Science Foundation provided financial support.",,54,13,13,1,51,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2945,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Bacteria reached similar abundance and growth rate in monocultures, but in co-cultures, two strains (Acidovorax sp. and Massilia sp.) displayed significantly higher numbers and growth rates. These potential cross-feeding benefits were also supported by a high nutritional versatility of the two strains. In contrast, Hydrogenophaga sp. was seemingly less competitive or even inhibited by co-cultivation, and Limnohabitans planktonicus displayed striking abundance fluctuations. The latter two strains were least versatile in the uptake of different carbon sources and thus suffered more from interspecific competition. Moreover, remarkable strain-specific responses appeared when bacteria experienced increasing loss rates due to grazing and/or raised dilution rates. Limnohabitans planktonicus developed no successful defence strategy and was close to extinction. Massilia sp. formed grazing-resistant filaments exclusively at low dilution, but was highly reduced at increased flow-through. Acidovorax sp. was selectively ingested, but compensated grazing losses with accelerated growth rates and formed (co-)aggregates together with Hydrogenophaga sp. to escape predation at high flow-through. These species-specific interactions, growth responses and defence strategies strongly modulate mixed microbial assemblages and the microbial food web.","[Salcher, Michaela M.; Simek, Karel; Kasalicky, Vojtech] Biol Ctr CAS, Inst Hydrobiol, Na Sadkach 7, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Salcher, Michaela M.; Ewert, Claudia; Posch, Thomas] Univ Zurich, Limnol Stn, Kilchberg, Switzerland","Salcher, MM (corresponding author), Biol Ctr CAS, Inst Hydrobiol, Na Sadkach 7, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",michaelasalcher@gmail.com,"Salcher, Michaela/B-9970-2012; Kasalicky, Vojtech/F-8578-2014; Salcher, Michaela M/A-1141-2013; Kasalicky, Vojtech/AAC-2903-2021; Simek, Karel/F-8930-2014; Simek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021","Salcher, Michaela/0000-0003-1063-6523; Kasalicky, Vojtech/0000-0002-9132-8321; Salcher, Michaela M/0000-0003-1063-6523; Kasalicky, Vojtech/0000-0002-9132-8321; Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761",Swiss National Science Foundation as part of the European Science Foundation EUROCORES Programme EuroEEFG [SNF grant] [31EE30-132771]; Swiss National Science Foundation [SNF grant]Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [138473]; Czech Science Foundation [CSF grant] [13-00243S],"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation as part of the European Science Foundation EUROCORES Programme EuroEEFG [SNF grant number 31EE30-132771], by the Swiss National Science Foundation [SNF grant number 138473], and by the Czech Science Foundation [CSF grant number 13-00243S].",,62,8,8,1,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0168-6496,1574-6941,,FEMS MICROBIOL ECOL,FEMS Microbiol.

In this study, we used a manipulative experiment to test the effects of habitat degradation on competition between two planktivorous, coral-dwelling damselfishes, Chrysiptera parasema and Dascyllus melanurus. Experimental reefs were constructed with either healthy (100% live) or degraded (10% live) Acropora longicyathus coral, stocked with varying densities of these two fish species, and monitored for two months. On healthy habitat, the mortality of C. parasema was density dependent, and increased substantially in the presence of the dominant interspecific competitor D. melanurus. In contrast, on reefs where habitat was degraded, C. parasema mortality was highly variable, density independent, and was no longer influenced by the presence of dominant competitor D. melanurus. Behavioral observations revealed that agonistic interactions for both species increased with density on degraded habitat, but not on healthy habitat. In addition, on degraded reefs, both species displayed a reduced association with reef habitat and ventured further away from shelter with increasing densities of the dominant competitor D. melanurus. These results suggest that reduced habitat quality can have such a profound effect on reef fishes, that it eliminates density-dependent mortality and competitive dominance hierarchies, thereby substantially altering the mechanisms that structure reef fish communities.","[Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Bostrom-Einarsson, L (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",lisa.bostromeinarsson@my.jcu.edu.au,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/B-5436-2015; Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011; Bonin, Mary/H-3433-2012","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/0000-0003-4814-9552; Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Bonin, Mary/0000-0001-7249-0887","Australian Research Council through the Center of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia","We are grateful to E.

We document interspecific dominance and nest habitat selection by two pika-burrow nesting Montifringilla species, white-rumped snowfinches M. taczanowskii (WRS), and rufous-necked snowfinches M. ruficollis (RNS), which commonly inhabit alpine meadows in the northeastern Tibetan plateau. Relative to the critical point (< 0.60) for coexistence, high overlaps (0.68-0.86) between the two species in egg-laying date, nest site distribution and nesting burrow attributes suggested strong interspecific competition over these niches. This is also predicted by the ratios of inter-species body mass (1.4) and linear dimensions (1.1-1.2) below the minimum value (2.0 and 1.3) for stable coexistence of closely related species. Larger-sized WRS was behaviorally dominant over pikas and over small-sized RNS. Being dominant, WRS established nesting territories in areas with moderately steep slopes from which they required most of the food resources during the breeding season; in contrast, RNS exhibited no territoriality and had to nest at margins between WRS's territories and fed at dispersed sites. For the same reason, WRS mainly used active, and RNS used inactive, pika burrows. The asymmetric competition over nesting habitats could contribute to the relatively high nesting success and breeding density of the superior species. We argue that there is a spectrum in interspecific competition strength, from stable coexistence to complete exclusion along a gradient of increased environmental harshness, and the guild of the two snowfinch species is at a mediate position of the spectrum.","[Zeng, Xianhai; Lu, Xin] Wuhan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Zool, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","Lu, X (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Zool, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",luxinwh@163.com,,,"National Sciences Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30425036, 30670337]","We are grateful to N.

Whereas considerable research has focused on effects of interspecific competition on threatened carnivore populations, here we examine the effects of interspecific competition on the most abundant large carnivore in Africa, the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta. Specifically, we compared two populations of spotted hyenas to examine the sources of variation in fitness, including effects of competition with lions Panthera leo. Hyenas living in Amboseli National Park and the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, were monitored from 2003 to 2005 and 1988 to 1992, respectively. Females reproduced at significantly higher rates in Amboseli, due to shorter lactation periods, though neither juvenile survival nor litter size differed between populations. Differences in reproduction were estimated to result in 24% greater lifetime reproductive success among Amboseli than among Mara females. We then tested alternative ecological hypotheses to explain these differences in fitness measures between populations. We found little support for hypotheses suggesting that population differences were due to variation in prey availability or dispersion, or to intraspecific competition either within or between hyena groups. Our results were most consistent with the hypothesis that population differences were due to variation in interspecific competition with lions. Hyenas in Amboseli lived at lower lion density, enjoyed higher rates of food intake despite less abundant prey, and scavenged more food from lions than did Mara hyenas. Our results indicate that competition with lions operated primarily via food competition, rather than direct killing, to generate the fitness differences.","[Watts, H. E.; Holekamp, K.

Recent advancements, however, in our understanding of indirect (plant- and enemy-mediated) interactions challenge the historical paradigms of competition. Thus, in the context of this rapidly developing field, we re-evaluate the evidence for interspecific competition in phytophagous insects using a meta-analysis of published studies. Our analysis is specifically designed to test the assumptions underlying traditional competition theory, namely that competitive interactions are symmetrical, necessitate spatial and temporal co-occurrence, and increase in intensity as the density, phylogenetic similarity, and niche overlap of competing species increase. Despite finding frequent evidence for competition, we found very little evidence that plant-feeding insects conform to theoretical predictions for interspecific competition. Interactions were highly asymmetrical, similar in magnitude within vs. between feeding guilds (chewers vs. sap-feeders), and were unaffected by the quantity of resources removed (% defoliation). There was mixed support for the effects of phylogeny, spatial/temporal separation, and the relative strength of intra- vs. interspecific competition. Clearly, a new paradigm that accounts for indirect interactions and facilitation is required to describe how interspecific competition contributes to the organization of phytophagous insect communities, and perhaps to other plant and animal communities as well.","Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Kaplan, I (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",ikaplan@umd.edu,,,,,,81,352,361,0,272,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Mathematical method: We built the population dynamics equation of Batesian mimicry under Lotka-Volterra competition. By means of the phase plane analysis, we examine the dynamics and equilibria in comparison with the four unique phase planes of the Lotka-Volterra competition model with no mimicry. Key assumptions: Both the benefit of mimicry for a palatable species mimicking a distasteful model species and the cost for the model are dependent on their frequencies relative to each other. The mortality of the model by predation increases as the frequency of the mimic increases, while the mortality of the mimic decreases as the frequency of the model increases. Predictions: The mimetic species in general benefits from mimicry depending on the adult predatory mortality. The assemblage of the model and mimetic species reaches different equilibria depending on whether the benefit of the mimic or the cost of the model increases under interspecific competition. The most complicated phase plane appears between stable co-existence of the assemblage and survival of the mimetic species only, depending on the initial conditions. Conclusion: The benefit of the mimic and the cost of the model are key factors in determining the evolutionary process of Batesian mimicry.","Shinshu Univ, Dept Biol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; Shizuoka Univ, Dept Syst Engn, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan; Chiba Univ, Marine Biosyst Res Ctr, Kamogawa 2995502, Japan; SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Asami, T (corresponding author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Biol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",asami99@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,28,5,5,0,21,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

The research presented here uses a survey, foraging observations, and a manipulative field experiment that test the included-niche competition hypothesis as a mechanism structuring the distribution of a generalist grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum, along a food-resource gradient. A field survey of 10 old fields revealed a step-like reduction in M. femurrubrum abundance as the proportion of grass cover in the fields exceeded 60%. Furthermore, M. femurrubrum abundance and the abundance of a potential competitor, the grass specialist Chorthippus curtipennis, were negatively correlated among the fields. Experimental foraging observations showed that M. femurrubrum was a polyphagous feeder that preferred grass and consumed less grass in the presence of C. curtipennis. The pattern of grasshopper distribution and foraging data support an included-niche competition hypothesis. However, in a field experiment that manipulated C. curtipennis presence and absence and the composition of vegetation in which competition might occur, growth and mortality rates in M. femurrubrum did not respond to C. curtipennis competition. Performance was predicted to be lowest in grass-dominated conditions, those corresponding to the locations when M. femurrubrum does not exist. Instead, growth rates were highest and mortality rates were lowest in grass-only treatments. While the survey and foraging observations support the included-niche hypothesis, the experiments suggest that interspecific competition in adult grasshoppers is not the cause of the grasshopper distribution pattern. Similar experiments in western North American prairies indicate that interspecific competition can be important and that foraging ecology can be a good indicator of the interaction. This study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge about interspecific competition's role in organism distributions. It demonstrates that geographic similarity in natural history need not lead to a similar importance of limiting factors.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Beckerman, AP (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Inst Biol Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",a.p.beckerman@stirling.ac.uk,"Beckerman, Andrew P/D-3020-2011","Beckerman, Andrew P./0000-0002-4797-9143",,,,54,25,28,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,948,957,,10.2307/177169,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500007,,,,,2021-09-21,

To date, however, researchers have not considered the possibility that individuals may simultaneously differ in their ability to compete for resources and their susceptibility to predation. Such differences might be expected to occur as a consequence of differences in body size, morphology or behaviour. Here, we develop a model to investigate the effects of differences in competitive ability and mortality risk on the equilibrium distribution of competitors across habitats. For simplicity, we consider the case of two competitor types competing for resources in an environment containing two habitats: a productive, but risky habitat and a less productive, safer habitat. In general, the model predicts that when individual mortality risk is independent of the density of competitors within a habitat, competitor types will tend to be assorted by competitive ability, with the competitor type experiencing the higher ratio of mortality risk across the habitats occurring predominantly in the safer, but less productive habitat. In contrast, when individual mortality risk within a habitat is diluted by competitor number, the model predicts that both competitor types will tend to aggregate in the same habitat, with the chosen habitat depending on which competitor type experiences the higher ratio of mortality risk across the habitats. When good competitors experience a higher ratio of mortality risk than poor competitors, both competitor types will tend to aggregate in the risky, but productive habitat. However, when poor competitors experience the higher ratio of mortality risk, both competitor types will tend to aggregate in the safer, but less productive habitat. Because our model can be applied to both intra- and interspecific resource competition, its results suggest a new potential mechanism for the co-existence of competitor types within a habitat.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Grand, TC (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",grand@zoology.ubc.ca,,,,,,62,59,60,0,16,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

We tested the hypothesis that competitive ability and vulnerability to predation are primarily products of behaviour using larvae of three container-dwelling mosquitoes. 2. Aedes aegypti was more active, spent more time browsing, more time at the bottom and less time resting than did Aedes triseriatus. These differences lead to the prediction that A. aegypti is a more effective forager and competitively superior to A. triseriatus. 3. In the presence of the predator Toxorhynchites rutilus, A. aegypti spent more time thrashing, less time resting, more time at the bottom and less time at the surface than did Ai triseriatus. These differences lead to the prediction that A. aegypti is more vulnerable to predation than A. triseriatus. 4. Survival time with T. rutilus was significantly lower for A. aegypti than for A. triseriatus, confirming the prediction of greater short-term (minutes) vulnerability of A. aegypti. 5. When exposed to T. rutilus (hatch to adult), cohorts of A. aegypti usually failed to produce adults, but cohorts of A. triseriatus always produced adults. At high Aedes density, predation by T. rutilus indirectly lowered development time and increased adult mass and estimated finite rate of increase for A. triseriatus, probably due to release from density dependence. These patterns confirm the prediction of greater vulnerability of A, aegypti. 6. For both Aedes species, survivorship and estimated finite rate of increase were not differentially affected by interspecific vs. intraspecific competition. Estimated finite rates of increase achieved when in competition gave no indication of a strong competitive advantage for either species. For female A. aegypti, mass at adulthood and development time were more detrimentally affected by intraspecific vs. interspecific competition. For A. triseriatus, development time was more detrimentally affected by interspecific vs. intraspecific competition. These results provide, at best, only weak support for the predicted competitive advantage for A. aegypti. 7.

We investigated the population dynamics and competitive interactions of two Daphnia species in Gull Lake, Michigan. In each of 3 yr D. pulicaria was always common, while D. galeata mendotae became abundant only in late summer. The summer invasion of D. galeata mendotae was associated with a decline in abundance of D. pulicaria in some, but not all years. Decline of D. pulicaria was strongly predicted by the loss of oxygen from deep water during summer, which resulted in greater spatial overlap between the species, and by changes in the quality of the phytoplankton resources. We employed in situ enclosures to manipulate the density of each species and quantify the intensity of intra- and interspecific competition. Repeated competition experiments demonstrated that the relative exploitative ability of the species reversed from early to late summer. Strong interspecific competition was often observed, but its strength varied with juvenile or adult stage, and with season. Daphnia pulicaria juveniles were always affected strongly by interspecific effects: while D. galeata mendotae juveniles were impacted largely by intraspecific effects. The relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition on adults reversed from early to late summer for each species. The magnitude of intra- and interspecific effects on D. pulicaria adults was similar during early summer, but by late summer interspecific effects were much stronger than intraspecific effects. The reverse was true for D. galeata mendotae adults; interspecific effects greatly decreased in late summer. This seasonal shift in the nature of competitive interactions provides an explanation for seasonal succession in this Daphnia assemblage.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,WK KELLOGG BIOL STN,E LANSING,MI 48824","HU, SXS (corresponding author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,E LANSING,MI, USA.",,,,,,,94,88,91,0,47,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1995,76,7,,,,,2278,2294,,10.2307/1941702,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RX362,WOS:A1995RX36200028,,,,,2021-09-21,

Orconectes rusticus, an invading crayfish species, is replacing O. propinquus and O. virilis in northern Wisconsin lakes. We test the hypothesis that periodicity of species interactions influences invasion success. Specifically, we test whether the intensity of interspecific competition varies on a diel cycle as a function of predation risk from visually feeding fishes. We tested for competitive exclusion in experimental pools (1.4 m in diameter) by determining habitat use of the three crayfishes in single- and three-species treatments. The pools contained equal area habitats of cobble, open sand, macrophytes in organic sediments (muck), and macrophytes in sand. In single-species treatments, all three species preferred cobble habitat during the day with a secondary preference for muck-macrophyte habitat. In three-species relative to single-species pools, O. rusticus increased daytime use of cobble habitat while O. virilis and O. propinquus reduced use of cobble and increased use of muck-macrophyte and sand-macrophyte habitats, respectively. Crayfish were evenly distributed among habitats at night. All three crayfishes altered habitat use between night and day, consistent with the need to forage at night and seek refuge from predation during the day. Results of a laboratory experiment giving crayfish the choice of feeding in the open or hiding in clean cobble in the presence and absence of a predator showed that crayfish chose habitat on the basis of food availability when predation risk was low and on the basis of shelter availability when risk was high. Data from experiments were consistent with habitat use observed in single-and mixed-species lakes, supporting our hypothesis that the interaction of competition with diel fluctuations in predation risk contributes to the ongoing O. rusticus invasion.","UNIV NOTRE DAME,DEPT BIOL SCI,NOTRE DAME,IN 46556",,,"Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021",,,,,44,120,123,1,29,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1994,75,7,,,,,2118,2126,,10.2307/1941615,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PK129,WOS:A1994PK12900025,,,,,2021-09-21,

Existing overlap indices do not account for the size-/stage-structured nature of these populations. In this paper I present new overlap indices that use information about the sizes of individuals that co-occur in time and space to predict the potential for interactions in size-structured guilds. An index of the opportunity for competition (IOC) calculates the frequency with which similar size classes of two species encounter each other, whereas an index of the opportunity for intraguild predation (IOP) calculates the frequency of encounters among disparate size classes of the same two species. To illustrate that these indices are more appropriate for size-structured populations than conventional indices, I calculated overlap, IOP, and IOC for all species pairs in a diverse assemblage of dragonfly larvae. The new indices revealed size-specific patterns of overlap that were not detected by the conventional index, including that (1) some species with high overlap values should interact mainly as competitors, others mainly as intraguild predators, and many as both competitors and predators, (2) subtle differences in phenology and/or size-specific shifts in habitat distribution can lead to the potential for asymmetric interspecific interactions, (3) some species with low pairwise IOP and IOC values are nonetheless vulnerable to the effects of diffuse competition or intraguild predation, (4) seasonal segregation reduces competitive overlap but at the same time increases the opportunity for intraguild predation. The indices are general in form and should be useful for analyzing distributional data for any size-structured assemblage in which the type and intensity of interaction varies as a function of relative size.",,"WISSINGER, SA (corresponding author), ALLEGHENY COLL,DEPT BIOL,MEADVILLE,PA 16335, USA.",,,,,,,83,126,140,1,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,1992,73,4,,,,,1431,1444,,10.2307/1940688,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JE984,WOS:A1992JE98400025,,,,,2021-09-21,

Habitat use of dace and chub overlapped both years but showed differences from smallmouth bass. Additionally, smallmouth bass habitat use differed greatly between years, as young smallmouth bass were found in uncharacteristically fast flowing habitat in 2018 and predominantly in more typical slow flowing habitat in 2019. This use of fast flowing habitat in 2018 appears to be influenced by the high overall fish density, especially for smallmouth bass. Diet composition, studied in 2018, overlapped significantly between the three species in riffle habitat and overlap became less significant in run and pool habitat where smallmouth bass fed increasingly on fish prey. We therefore suggest that the interactions between smallmouth bass and dace and chub shift from predominantly predation in slow flowing habitat to resource competition in faster flowing habitat.","[Peterson, Miles, I] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Technol, 6 Ro Nishinagano, Nagano 3808544, Japan; [Kitano, Satoshi] Nagano Environm Conservat Res Inst, Nagano 3810075, Japan","Peterson, MI (corresponding author), Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Technol, 6 Ro Nishinagano, Nagano 3808544, Japan.",milesipeterson@gmail.com,,,"Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism","We thank the Koshoku and Josho Fisheries Cooperatives for their agreement to allow sampling of fish in the Chikuma River.

Both Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stepehensi are container breeding mosquitoes and co-exist which may result in larval competition. In this study, interspecific competition between the above two species has been monitored under the laboratory conditions. Methods: Three sets of experiments were conducted with different stages of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi larvae. First two experiments were set up with I/II instar and III/IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi respectively in the ratios of 20:20, 20:40 and 40:20 in plastic bowls. For third set of experiment 20 IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti were put with equal number of I instar larvae of An. stephensi. Results: In the presence of food, 12.5-15 % mortality was recorded in I/II stage larvae of Ae. aegypti while in An. stephensi mortality ranged from 21-55%. Pupation commenced from Day 6 onwards in Ae. aegypti while in An. stephensi it commenced from Day 11 onwards. In the absence of food, there was no pupation in both the species but Ae. aegypti survived up to longer duration (7.5-18.5 days with 50% mortality) in comparison to An. stephensi (2-7 days with 50% mortality). When younger stages of An. stephensi (I/II) were put together with older stages of Ae. aegypti (III/IV) in the presence of food, pupation was completed in 85% Ae. aegypti population while there was 100% mortality in An. stephensi population. Interpretation & conclusion: The better survival and development of Ae. aegypti than An. stephensi under the same conditions exhibits interspecies competition showing competitive advantage of Ae. aegypti over An. stephensi. Further research is required to have a thorough understanding of the interaction between these two container inhabiting mosquito species in the nature.","[Haq, S.; Kumar, Gaurav; Dhiman, Ramesh C.] ICMR Natl Inst Malaria Res, Sect 8, New Delhi 110077, India","Dhiman, RC (corresponding author), ICMR Natl Inst Malaria Res, Sect 8, New Delhi 110077, India.",r.c.dhiman@gmail.com,"Dhiman, Ramesh/P-3836-2016","Dhiman, Ramesh/0000-0001-9844-9970",,,,25,0,0,0,0,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0972-9062,,,J VECTOR DIS,J.

However, ecological interactions are notoriously difficult to measure in extinct populations, hindering our understanding of how the outcomes of interactions such as competition vary in time and influence long-term evolutionary changes. Here, the outcomes of spatial competition in a temporally continuous community over evolutionary timescales are presented for the first time. Our research domain is encrusting cheilostome bryozoans from the Wanganui Basin of New Zealand over a ca 2 Myr time period (Pleistocene to Recent). We find that a subset of species can be identified as consistent winners, and others as consistent losers, in the sense that they win or lose interspecific competitive encounters statistically more often than the null hypothesis of 50%. Most species do not improve or worsen in their competitive abilities through the 2 Myr period, but a minority of species are winners in some intervals and losers in others. We found that conspecifics tend to cluster spatially and interact more often than expected under a null hypothesis: most of these are stand-off interactions where the two colonies involved stopped growing at edges of encounter.

Hence, competition is often considered to be one of the primary determinants of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. In this paper, we investigate how the native Vespa crabro and the recently introduced Vespa velutina show some degree of niche differentiation that potentially minimizes their interspecific competition, the two dimensions investigated here being seasonal activity patterns and preferences for food. These two species share common characteristics: they are closely related, live in the same areas, belong to the same guild (predators), exploit the same kind of food sources, and exhibit a similar annual life cycle. Considering all these similarities, interspecific competition may occur if the two species exhibit identical seasonal phenologies. Our data show that their seasonal phenologies overlap to some extent probably due to biological constraints common to Vespinae. The shifts in time observed here allow the hornet species to not directly compete for food sources at the same time. It does not however exclude indirect competition, especially in a 'first-come, first-served' fashion.","[Monceau, K.; Maher, N.; Bonnard, O.; Thiery, D.] INRA, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, ISVV, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France; [Monceau, K.; Maher, N.; Bonnard, O.; Thiery, D.] Univ Bordeaux, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, Bordeaux Sci Agro, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France","Thiery, D (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, ISVV, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France.",thiery@bordeaux.inra.fr,,"Monceau, Karine/0000-0003-3786-1835",France Agrimer [797/2007-2010]; Region AquitaineRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine; INRA,"This research was financially supported by France Agrimer # 797/2007-2010, a grant from Region Aquitaine and INRA.

Research focusing on lethal interactions among vertebrate top predators has used several terms with a broad sense, and also introduced new terminology. We analysed the published literature with reference to the main underlying concepts and the use of terminology and its ecological context. The most frequently used terms in the literature were predation', intraguild predation', interference competition', and interspecific killing'. Most studies presented evidence of the killing of the victim (77%), but information regarding its consumption was not given in 48% of cases. More than half of the analysed studies (56%) had no solid information on the degree of competition between interacting species. By reviewing definitions and their underlying assumptions, we demonstrate that lethal interactions among large vertebrate predators could be designated using four termspredation', intraguild predation', interspecific competitive killing', and superpredation'without the need to employ additional terminology that may increase confusion and misuse. For a correct framework of these lethal interactions it is critical to assess if the kill is consumed, if the victim is indeed a competitor of the killer, and if the prey is a high-order predator. However, these elements of the framework are simultaneously the most common constraints to studies of lethal interactions, since they often require a great effort to obtain. The proper use of terms and concepts is fundamental to understanding the causes behind lethal interactions and, ultimately, what is actually happening in these complex interactions.","[Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao E.] Univ Evora, Dept Biol, LabOr Lab Ornithol, Inst Ciencias Agr & Ambientais Mediterran,Nucleo, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Penteriani, Vincenzo] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41092, Spain; [Penteriani, Vincenzo] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Zool Museum, FI-20014 Helsinki, Finland; [Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland","Lourenco, R (corresponding author), Univ Evora, Dept Biol, LabOr Lab Ornithol, Inst Ciencias Agr & Ambientais Mediterran,Nucleo, Ap 94, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",ruifazendalourenco@gmail.com,"Rabaca, Joao Eduardo/A-7851-2011; Lourenco, Rui F/B-7148-2012","Lourenco, Rui F/0000-0001-7694-0478; Rabaca, Joao E./0000-0002-2196-3709","FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [BPD/78241/2011]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [123379, 136717, 250709]","We thank S.

Each of them is governed by dynamics that involve a deterministic linear decrease as a function of the time t and an additive noise term which instantaneously mimics the fluctuations of T, pH and aw. The choice of a suitable parameter accounting for the interaction of LAB on L. monocytogenes as well as the introduction of appropriate noise levels allows to match the observed data, both for the mean growth curves and for the probability distribution of L. monocytogenes concentration at 168 h.","[Giuffrida, Alessandro; Ziino, Graziella; Panebianco, Antonio] Univ Messina, Dipartimento Sanita Pubbl Vet, Sect Inspect Food Anim Origin, Polo Univ Annunziata, I-98168 Messina, Italy; [Valenti, Davide; Spagnolo, Bernardo] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Tecnol Relat, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Valenti, Davide; Spagnolo, Bernardo] Univ Palermo, CNISM, Unita Palermo, Grp Interdisciplinary Phys, I-90128 Palermo, Italy","Giuffrida, A (corresponding author), Univ Messina, Dipartimento Sanita Pubbl Vet, Sect Inspect Food Anim Origin, Polo Univ Annunziata, Viale Annunziata, I-98168 Messina, Italy.",agiuffrida@unime.it,"Spagnolo, Bernardo/F-6973-2014; Valenti, Davide/K-9228-2015","Spagnolo, Bernardo/0000-0002-6625-3989; Valenti, Davide/0000-0001-5496-1518; GIUFFRIDA, Alessandro/0000-0001-7906-2076",,,,66,59,59,2,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1438-2377,1438-2385,,EUR FOOD RES TECHNOL,Eur.

Diffuse competition has traditionally been studied within taxonomically similar groups, although distantly related intraguild species are likely also to compete to some degree. (2) We assessed diffuse competition between mammalian and reptilian predators at sites in central Australia over 24 years. Specifically, we investigated the effect of dasyurid marsupial abundance on the diet breadth of three groups of lizards (nocturnal dietary generalists, diurnal dietary generalists and dietary specialists). (3) Nocturnal generalist lizards had progressively narrower diets as dasyurid abundance increased. The diet breadth of diurnal generalist lizards was unaffected by overall dasyurid abundance, but was restricted by that of the largest dasyurid species (Dasycercus blythi). Ant- and termite-specialist lizards were unaffected by dasyurid abundance. (4) Diffuse competition, mediated by interference, between dasyurids and nocturnal generalist lizards appears to have strong effects on these lizards, and is the first such between-class interaction to be described. Diffuse interactions may be widespread in natural communities, and merit further investigation among other disparate taxon groups that occur in the same ecological guilds.","[Dickman, Christopher R.; Greenville, Aaron C.; Wardle, Glenda M.; Bytheway, Jenna P.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia","Dickman, CR (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.",chris.dickman@sydney.edu.au; aaron.greenville@sydney.edu.au; glenda.wardle@sydney.edu.au; jenna.bytheway@sydney.edu.au,"; Greenville, Aaron/G-9718-2013","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; Bytheway, Jenna/0000-0003-4033-9538; Greenville, Aaron/0000-0002-0113-4778","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0988535, DP140104621]","This research was funded by the Australian Research Council, with grant numbers DP0988535 and DP140104621 awarded to C.R.D.",,106,0,0,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,SEP,2020,12,9,,,,,,,355,10.3390/d12090355,,,16,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OF5ZT,WOS:000581286100001,,gold,,,2021-09-21,

Wavyleaf basketgrass [Oplismenus undulatifolius (Ard.) P. Beauv.] is a perennial, shade-tolerant grass species that has been recently introduced to the mid-Atlantic United States. Areas invaded by O. undulatifolius typically have low species richness, but it is unknown whether O. undulatifoius actively outcompetes other species or simply thrives primarily in species-poor habitats. This study used a greenhouse experiment to quantify interspecific competition in shade and sun among seedlings of O. undulatifolius; Japanese stiltgrass [Microstegium vimineum (Trin.) A. Camus], an invasive annual grass common in the region; and a mix of three native perennial grass species commonly used in restoring areas invaded by M. vimineum. In this experiment, shade did not significantly affect growth or competitive ability. Interspecific competition irrespective of shade had a negative effect on growth of all species, but O. undulatifolius was affected to a much greater degree than either M. vimineum or the native grass mix. These results suggest that, at least under these conditions, O. undulatifolius is a weak interspecific competitor and may be capable of forming dense monotypic stands only in areas that already have low species diversity. In the mid-Atlantic region, postagricultural legacies and overabundant deer populations, which lead to depauperate understories, may be a major facilitator of O. undulatifolius invasion in forests.","[Kepner, Cody; Beauchamp, Vanessa B.] Towson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA; [Kepner, Cody] USDA APHIS, Plant Germplasm Quarantine Program, Beltsville, MD USA","Beauchamp, VB (corresponding author), Towson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",vbeauchamp@towson.edu,,,Towson University Undergraduate Research Committee; Fisher College of Science and Mathematics; National Biological Honors Society,"We thank Ernst Conservation Seeds for the donation of native seed used in this study.

By conducting aquarium experiments, the habitat occupancy of P. fluviatilis was documented in the presence and absence of a predator (pike Esox lucius; size: 25.4 +/- 2.1 cm) and a potential competitor (ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus; size: 14.1 +/- 0.3 cm) fish species. Two P. fluviatilis individuals generally shared the same habitat. In the presence of a conspecific, P. fluviatilis favoured the structurally more-complex, artificial macrophyte habitat over the less-structured rock and sand habitat, which in turn were used equally. In the predator- and competitor treatments, P. fluviatilis seemed to adapt their habitat use to the habitat occupancy of E. lucius and G. cernuus in the Macrophyte vs. Rock and, in the predator treatment, also in the Macrophyte vs. Sand habitat combination, by increasingly occupying a habitat that was used less by the predator or competitor species, respectively. This behaviour suggests that P. fluviatilis tried to avoid the other fish species by choosing a, in some cases less preferred, predator- or competitor-free habitat. This study emphasizes the importance of biological interactions illustrated by the potential of predation risk and competition to structure fish communities by influencing habitat use at small spatial scales.","[Henseler, Christina; Nordstrom, Marie C.; Tornroos, Anna; Snickars, Martin; Bonsdorff, Erik] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Environm & Marine Biol, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland","Henseler, C (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Dept Environm & Marine Biol, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland.",christina.henseler@abo.fi,"Nordstrom, Marie C./C-8956-2012","Nordstrom, Marie C./0000-0001-5763-1813; Henseler, Christina/0000-0001-9777-7753; Snickars, Martin/0000-0001-9168-7474",Abo Akademi University Foundation; Horizon 2020 (European Union),Abo Akademi University Foundation; Horizon 2020 (European Union),,55,2,2,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

Their distinct cell sizes and nutrient utilization strategies may lead to dominance of one over the other at varying nutrient levels. In this study, Microcystis aeruginosa and Synechococcus sp. were chosen as representative organisms of micro- and pico-cyanobacteria, respectively. A series of nitrate and ammonia conditions (0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mg N L-1) were designed in mono- or co-cultured systems, respectively. Growth rates of the two species were calculated and fitted by the Monod and Logistic equations. Furthermore, the interspecific competition was analyzed using the Lotka-Volterra model. In mono-cultures, the two cyanobacteria displayed faster growth rates in ammonia than in nitrate. Meanwhile, Synechococcus sp. showed faster growth rates compared to M. aeruginosa in lower N groups (<= 0.5 mg N L-1). However, in the highest nitrate treatment (2.5 mg N L-1), M. aeruginosa achieved much higher biomass and faster growth rates than Synechococcus sp.. In co-cultures, Synechococcus sp. dominated in the lowest N treatment (0.02 mg N L-1), but M. aeruginosa dominated under the highest nitrate condition (2.5 mg N L-1). Based on the analysis of Raman spectra of living cells in mono-cultures, nitrate (2.5 mg N L-1) upgraded the pigmentary contents of M. aeruginosa better than ammonia (2.5 mg N L-1), but nitrogen in different forms showed little effects on the pigments of Synechococcus sp.. Findings from this study can provide valuable information to predict cyanobacterial community succession and aquatic ecosystem stability.","[Tan, Xiao; Gu, Huihui] Hohai Univ, Coll Environm, Key Lab Integrated Regulat & Resource Dev Shallow, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Yinlan; Zhong, Jiajia] Univ Adelaide, Inst Photon & Adv Sensing, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Parajuli, Keshab] Univ Melbourne, Fac Med Dent & Hlth Sci, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Hu, Jianyong] Zhejiang Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Inst Water Resources & Ocean Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Tan, X (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Environm, Key Lab Integrated Regulat & Resource Dev Shallow, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tanxiao1030@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31470507]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019B14014]; National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project [2017ZX07603]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (TAPP),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470507), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019B14014), the National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project (2017ZX07603), the Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), and the Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (TAPP).

In some polluted water bodies, phenol has become one of the typical aromatic contaminants. Such water bodies are inescapably influenced by nutrients from human activities, and also suffer from nuisance cyanobacterial blooms. While phenolic pollution threatens water safety and ecological balance, algal cells are ubiquitous and sensitive to pollutants. Therefore, effects of phenolic pollution on interspecific competition between a bloom-forming cyanobacterium and other common alga merit quantitative investigation. In this study, the effects of phenol on Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa, a bloom-forming cyanobacterium) and Chlorella pyrenoidosa (C. pyrenoidosa, a ubiquitous green alga) were analyzed in mono- and co-cultures. The two species were exposed to a series of phenol treatments (0, 2, 20, and 200 mu g mL(-1)). Population dynamics were measured by a flow cytometer and analyzed by the Lotka-Volterra model. The results showed that M. aeruginosa was more sensitive to phenol (EC50 = 80.8 +/- 0.16 mu g mL(-1)) compared to C. pyrenoidosa (EC50 = 631.4 +/- 0.41 mu g mL(-1)) in mono-cultures. M. aeruginosa won in the co-cultures when phenol was below or equal to 20 mu g mL(-1), while C. pyrenoidosa became the dominant species in the 200 mu g mL(-1) treatment. Photosynthetic activity was measured by a fluometer. Results showed phenol significantly impacted the photosynthetic activity of M. aeruginosa by inhibiting the acceptor side of its photosystem II (PSII), while such inhibition in C. pyrenoidosa was only observed in the highest phenol treatment (200 mu g mL(-1)). This study provides a better understanding for predicting the succession of algal community structure in water bodies susceptible to phenolic contamination. Moreover, it reveals the mechanism on photosynthetic responses of these two species under phenolic stress.","[Tan, Xiao; Dai, Kaiwen; Duan, Zhipeng; Hu, Yue] Hohai Univ, Coll Environm, Key Lab Integrated Regulat & Resource Dev Shallow, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Parajuli, Keshab] Univ Melbourne, Fac Med Denistry & Hlth Sci, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Hang, Xiaoshuai] Minist Ecol & Environm, Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Nanjing 210042, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Tan, X (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Environm, Key Lab Integrated Regulat & Resource Dev Shallow, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tanxiao@hhu.edu.cn; algaegroup@163.com; kparajuli@student.unimelb.edu.au; hxs@nies.org; duanzhipeng@hhu.edu.cn; 1714060112@hhu.edu.cn,,"Duan, Zhipeng/0000-0001-8053-7868",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31470507]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019B14014]; National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project [2017ZX07603]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (TAPP),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470507), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019B14014), the National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project (2017ZX07603), the Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), and the Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (TAPP).",,42,3,3,4,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The Lotka-Volterra model was applied to estimate the interspecific competition between them. Results showed that the growth of L. fissa was significantly suppressed in both bi-algal and tri-algal cultures, and the maximum cell densities in co-cultures were only between 21% and 69% of that in mono-culture. L. fissa outcompeted P. micans; however, its effects on S. costatum and C. marina were generally less than the effects of their intraspecific competitions based on the competition coefficients. Contrarily, the inhibitory effects of S. costatum and C. marina on L. fissa were much greater. S. costatum outcompeted the other three species in all co-cultures, and its competition coefficients on the other species were more than 10000 times higher than the opposite. The growth of C. marina was suppressed by S. costatum; however, it outcompeted L. fissa and P. micans. The growth of P. micans was most strongly inhibited in co-cultures, and the maximum cell densities in co-cultures were less than 15% of that in mono-species culture. The results suggested that L. fissa had few advantages in the interspecific competition. The adaptation to low salinity and the utilization of organic phosphorus might be the important reasons for L. fissa to take the competitive predominance in brackish estuarine environments.","[Wang Zhaohui; Zhao Jianggang; Xiao Lin; Lin Langcong] Jinan Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Key Lab Eutrophicat & Red Tide Prevent Guangdong, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Wang, ZH (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Key Lab Eutrophicat & Red Tide Prevent Guangdong, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",twzh@jnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41476132],This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41476132).,,43,1,1,1,31,OCEAN UNIV CHINA,QINGDAO,"5 YUSHAN RD, QINGDAO, 266003, PEOPLES R CHINA",1672-5182,1993-5021,,J OCEAN U CHINA,J.

In the current study, we evaluated the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) accumulation in P. haitanensis and U. lactuca under OA conditions, as well as the interspecific competition between these two algae. We found that, under mono-culture conditions, OA significantly enhanced the growth of both P. haitanensis and U. lactuca and markedly increased the soluble carbohydrate (SC) content and C/N ratios in P. haitanensis, but reduced its soluble proteins (SP) content. In U. lactuca, OA reduced its SP content, but increased C/N ratios, while its SC content was not significantly affected. Under biculture conditions, the rapid growth of U. lactuca and its comparatively more efficient use of nutrients resulted in insufficient available N sources for P. haitanensis. Biculture with U. lactuca increased SC but declined SP content. This also resulted in some membrane injuries that were indicated by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and depressed growth in P. haitanensis.

Effects on predators and competitors could, however, be a concern as Anopheles gambiae s.l. is preyed upon in all life stages. We overview the literature and assess the strength of the ecological interactions identified. Most predators identified consume many other insect species and there is no evidence that any species preys exclusively on any anopheline mosquito. There is one predatory species with a specialisation on blood-fed mosquitoes including An. gambiae s.l.. Evarcha culicivora is a jumping spider, known as the vampire spider, found around Lake Victoria. There is no evidence that these salticids require Anopheles mosquitoes and will readily consume blood-fed Culex. Interspecific competition studies focus on other mosquitoes of larval habitats. Many of these take place in artificial cosms and give contrasting results to semi-field studies. This may limit their extrapolation regarding the potential impact of reduced An. gambiae numbers. Previous mosquito control interventions are informative and identify competitive release and niche opportunism; so while the identity and relative abundance of the species present may change, the biomass available to predators may not.","[Collins, C.

We parameterised our model with these metabolic traits derived from six species of freshwater phytoplankton and tested its ability to predict the outcome of competition in all pairwise combinations of the species in a factorial experiment, manipulating temperature and nutrient availability. The model correctly predicted the outcome of competition in 72% of the pairwise experiments, with competitive advantage determined by difference in thermal sensitivity of growth rates of the two species.

The significance of competition amongst the prey is investigated by testing a variety of distributions of the relative intraspecific and interspecific competition. We also study the influence this has on the survival and population size of predator phenotypes with a variety of foraging strategies. Our results indicate that the distribution of competition amongst prey is of little significance, provided that intraspecific is stronger than the interspecific, and that it is typically preferable for a predator to adopt a foraging strategy that scales linearly with prey population sizes if it is alone. In an environment of multiple predator phenotypes, the least or most-focused predators are most likely to persist, dependent on the feeding parameter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report results of two years of field surveys along a latitudinal gradient (21 degrees N to 31 degrees N) in southern China, to determine the species structure of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides community. We also performed a replacement series experiment (mono and mixed) to evaluate the effects of elevated temperature on the competitiveness of A. philoxeroides with the native co-occurring species Digitaria sanguinalis. In the field survey, we found that the dominance of A. philoxeroides increased with increasing of latitude gradient while cover of D. sanguinalis decreased. In monospecific plantings, artificial warming reduced the length of D. sanguinalis roots. In mixed plantings, warming reduced both A. philoxeroides abundance and D. sanguinalis stem length when A. philoxeroides was more prevalent in the planting. Warming also significantly reduced D. sanguinalis biomass, but increased that of A. philoxeroides. In addition, elevated temperatures significantly reduced the relative yield (RY) of D. sanguinalis, particularly when A. philoxeroides was planted in higher proportion in the plot. These results suggest that the invasiveness of A. philoxeroides increased with increasing latitude, and that warming may increase the effectiveness of its interspecific competition with D. sanguinalis. Hence, under global warming conditions, the harm to native species from A. philoxeroides would increase at higher latitudes. Our findings are critical for predicting the invasiveness of alien species under climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we build a game-theoretical model, based on an evolutionary algorithm, to study the influence of ecological factors on the temporal patterns of presence at waterholes in the herbivore community. In this model, we incorporate the specific features of arid environments, namely, the important hydric losses endured by individuals exposed during the warmest hours of the day, and competition for access to water, both within and between species. We also consider the presence of ambushing predators around waterholes, particularly during dark hours. In response to this predation regime, our model predicts a strong aggregative tendency in herbivores. The number of groups, however, is variable, as well as the time these groups choose to attend the waterhole, even if the total number of individuals is fixed. The reason is a multiplicity of possible evolutionarily stable strategies, corresponding to different responses to the trade-off between the advantages of grouping, in terms of risk dilution, and its costs, in terms of increased competition. This variety of possible behavioural responses affects, in turn, the moments when the waterhole is occupied, and the moments when the different species meet each other. In general, herbivores also respond to predation threat by avoiding coming to waterholes after dusk. However, the cumulative effects of a relatively high level of predation during the day and a high level of interspecific competition for access to water may induce an important presence of herbivores at the waterhole at night. Our predictions are discussed in the light of existing empirical studies.

To generalize this well-known criterion to multiple competing species, one must take into account both the distribution of interaction strengths and community structure. Here we derive a multispecies generalization of the two-species rule in the context of symmetric Lotka-Volterra competition and obtain explicit stability conditions for random competitive communities. We then explore the influence of community structure on coexistence. Results show that both the most and least stabilized cases have striking global structures, with a nested pattern emerging in both cases. The distribution of intraspecific coefficients leading to the most and least stabilized communities also follows a predictable pattern that can be justified analytically. In addition, we show that the size of the parameter space allowing for feasible communities always increases with the strength of intraspecific effects in a characteristic way that is independent of the interspecific interaction structure.

The organisms studied were two microzooplankton (MZP) predators competing for the phototrophic dinoflagellate prey Scrippsiella trochoidea. Since the smaller dinoflagellate predator Gyrodinium dominans was also potential prey for the larger predator, the tintinnid ciliate Favella ehrenbergii, the experimental system included the probability of intraguild predation (IGP). The development of the three species was studied in set-ups containing either one of the two predators or both together with their prey. The IG predator F. ehrenbergii grew at a mean rate of 0.77 d(-1) independent of the presence of the IG prey G. dominans. High grazing of the IG predator on the smaller IG prey was detected in treatments containing only the two predators. However, when all three species were present, the IG prey displayed significantly higher growth rates (0.42 d(-1)) compared to treatments containing only the IG prey as predator (0.32 d(-1)). The results of further experiments allowed the exclusion of mechanical or chemical signals induced by the IG predator being responsible for the observed increase in growth rate of IG prey. Live observations revealed that the IG predator rejected a significant proportion of its S. trochoidea catch after initial uptake. This behavior led to an immobilization of around 26% of the caught cells. We tested if this prey immobilization by the IG predator facilitated prey uptake by the IG prey and thus could be potentially responsible for the higher growth rates of the IG prey. Indeed, the smaller predator selected positively for immobilized prey and reacted with higher grazing and growth rates. Consequently, the IG prey benefitted from this commensalism between IG predator and IG prey and the strength of this pattern predominated IGP in our model system. As both predators co-occur in the same environment their feeding relationship could increase exploitation efficiency of common mobile prey items. Furthermore, such commensalism potentially opens a loophole for a stable coexistence of MZP predators despite their competition.","[Loeder, Martin Guenther Joachim; Boersma, Maarten; Kraberg, Alexandra Claudia; Aberle, Nicole; Wiltshire, Karen Helen] Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany","Loder, MGJ (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, POB 180, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany.",Martin.Loeder@awi.de,"Aberle, Nicole/C-7366-2014; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013; Wiltshire, Karen H./N-9494-2017","Aberle, Nicole/0000-0003-3254-5710; Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X; Kraberg, Alexandra/0000-0003-2571-2074",Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research,"This study was part of a PhD thesis at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research and we are grateful for the funding.

Circumstantial evidence suggests that intense competition for host species may exist not only within but also between species. So far, however, few studies have demonstrated whether the interspecific competition really occurs in the system of avian brood parasitism and how the nature of brood parasitism is related to their niche evolution. Using the occurrence data of five avian brood parasites from two sources of nationwide bird surveys in South Korea and publically available environmental/climatic data, we identified their distribution patterns and ecological niches, and applied species distribution modeling to infer the effect of interspecific competition on their spatial distribution. We found that the distribution patterns of five avian brood parasites could be characterized by altitude and climatic conditions, but overall their spatial ranges and ecological niches extensively overlapped with each other. We also found that the predicted distribution areas of each species were generally comparable to the realized distribution areas, and the numbers of individuals in areas where multiple species were predicted to coexist showed positive relationships among species. In conclusion, despite following different coevolutionary trajectories to adapt to their respect host species, five species of avian brood parasites breeding in South Korea occupied broadly similar ecological niches, implying that they tend to conserve ancestral preferences for ecological conditions. Furthermore, our results indicated that contrary to expectation interspecific competition for host availability between avian brood parasites seemed to be trivial, and thus, play little role in shaping their spatial distributions and ecological niches.

In the single-species culture experiments, high M. aeruginosa concentrations favored the population growth of Moina irrasa but strongly inhibited that of Daphnia carinata. Small-bodied M. irrasa was predominant over large-bodied D. carinata regardless of the presence of the colonial M. aeruginosa in the mixed cultures. The per capita cumulative number of ephippia and the percentage of ephippia containing D. carinata resting eggs both increased from under 0 to 10mg/L M. aeruginosa in the single-species culture but decreased in the mixed culture. However, the per capita cumulative ephippia number of M. irrasa in the mixed culture was higher than those in the single-species culture at the high M. aeruginosa levels. The effects of M. aeruginosa, interspecific competition, and their combination on the per capita cumulative ephippia numbers of the two cladocerans were significant. The occurrence of ephippia was related to the higher population density of the two species. Our results suggest that interspecific competition inhibits the ephippium production and resting egg formation of the large-bodied cladocerans (D. carinata) in the presence of colonial M. aeruginosa.","[Shao, Yuan-Qi; Deng, Dao-Gui; Meng, Mei-Ru; Zhang, Xiao-Li; Li, Fang] Huaibei Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Huaibei 235000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Shao, Yuan-Qi] Anhui Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China","Deng, DG (corresponding author), Huaibei Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Huaibei 235000, Anhui, Peoples R China.",dengdg@chnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31070387, 31370470]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31070387], [grant number 31370470].",,34,5,5,1,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0270-5060,2156-6941,,J FRESHWATER ECOL,J.

Territory quality is thought to be a product of physical habitat characteristics (i.e., habitat quality) and the density of competitors yet these relationships are rarely demonstrated. Occupancy rates, or how often a territory has been used since its establishment, are often used as a proxy for habitat quality. We tested the utility of occupancy rates as a proxy of habitat quality by comparing it with reproductive output in eastern bluebirds (Sialia slabs). We then tested the extent to which occupancy rates are influenced by physical habitat quality (land cover via remote sensing), aggressive interspecific competition with tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), and the individual quality of the breeding birds. We found that occupancy was the best predictor of reproductive output although female age and habitat openness also contributed to reproductive success. Habitat openness and competition with tree swallows best predicted site occupancy. Bluebirds appeared to avoid settling in areas of higher interspecific competition with tree swallows, but when bluebirds settled in areas of higher interspecific competition, physical (spatial) habitat quality was a good predictor of settlement location. Thus, our results suggest that although historical occupancy of territories is an accurate and easy-to-measure proxy of reproductive output, the realized habitat quality is a product of the tradeoffs between spatial habitat quality and interspecific competition. Here, we show that aggressive interspecific competition interacts with spatial habitat to influence settlement. A better understanding of how these variables influence settlement and productivity may better enable the management of source, rather than sink, habitats.","[Jones, John A.; Harris, Morgan R.; Siefferman, Lynn] Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, 572 Rivers St, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Jones, JA (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, 572 Rivers St, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",jonesja2@appstate.edu,,"Jones, John/0000-0003-2615-1248","Appalachian State's Research Institute for Environment, Energy, and Economics (RIEEE)","We thank our volunteer field crew: Patrick Latimer and Stephanie Stegemoller.

Here, intra- and interspecific competition in B. tabaci and F. occidentalis was determined under controlled experiments. The results showed that intraspecific competition was distinct in F. occidentalis and that the co-occurrence of B. tabaci had a strong effect on F. occidentalis, resulting in a decrease in oviposition. Significant intraspecific competition was found in B. tabaci, and the coexistence of F. occidentalis had limited effect on the oviposition of B. tabaci. In a selective host plant preference experiment, both F. occidentalis and B. tabaci preferred eggplants most, followed by cucumbers and tomatoes. On cucumber plants, B. tabaci was predominant, whereas on eggplant and tomato plants, F. occidentalis and B. tabaci exhibited comparative competitive abilities during the initial stage. However, over time, higher numbers of B. tabaci than that of F. occidentalis were found on the two host plants. Our in vitro and potted plant experiments indicate that B. tabaci is competitively superior to F. occidentalis, which might help to explain their differential distribution patterns in China.","[Wu, Qing-Jun; Hou, Wen-Jie; Li, Fei; Xu, Bao-Yun; Xie, Wen; Wang, Shao-Li; Zhang, You-Jun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Vegetables & Flowers, Dept Plant Protect, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Wu, QJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Vegetables & Flowers, Dept Plant Protect, 12 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wuqingjun@caas.cn,"Zhang, Youjun/AAY-7948-2020","Zhang, Youjun/0000-0003-3508-6695",National Technology Support Program [2012BAD19B06]; Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [201103026]; Beijing Leafy Vegetables Innovation Team of Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [blvt-15],"We thank Prof. X.

Yet this pattern of patch use also can be caused by dominant interspecific competitors. We develop a simple theory of this form of apparent predation risk that describes the patch use of an optimal forager confronted with dominant individuals. The theory predicts that subordinate animals should increase their use of safe foraging patches as the density of nearby dominants increases. We tested the theory with meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We used dyadic encounters to confirm that meadow voles are dominant over red-backed voles. We then evaluated their respective foraging patterns in pairs of covered and open patches in 4 adjacent subgrids in an old-field enclosure. Subordinate red-backed voles foraged indifferently between covered and open patches when few meadow voles were present. Red-backed voles increased their use of both patches as the number of nearby meadow voles increased. Giving-up densities were lowest, and harvesting efficiency highest, in covered patches when the number of nearby meadow voles was high. These results document competition between the 2 species and suggest that vigilance toward dominant meadow voles magnifies the risk experienced by red-backed voles in open patches. Investigators assessing foraging behavior between safe and risky patches might misinterpret the competitive effect as predation risk unless they 1st account for competition among foraging individuals.","[Halliday, William D.; Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Halliday, William D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Lakehead University,"We thank M.

One might therefore expect snail assemblages to be equilibrial and structured by interspecific interactions such as competition. If competition is strong and persistent throughout an assemblage, then it should manifest as density compensation (a negative correlation in population density between competitors) and be most pronounced for species pairs that are morphologically similar, as they should compete most strongly for resources. We assessed the degree to which terrestrial snails in the LEF exhibit density compensation, from both spatial and temporal perspectives. In general, density compensation was weak, especially from a spatial perspective. Moreover, the degree of density compensation was not significantly associated with dissimilarity in body size or shell shape. These results suggest that external factors such as predation or disturbance probably maintain population densities at low enough levels that the effects of interspecific competition do not become intense or persistent enough to mold patterns of assemblage structure for terrestrial snails.","[Bloch, Christopher P.] Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Bloch, CP (corresponding author), Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA.",cbloch@bridgew.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, DEB 0218039]","This research was supported by grants BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, and DEB 0218039 from NSF to the Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies, University of Puerto Rico, and to the International Institute of Tropical Forestry, USDA Forest Service, as part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Program in the Luquillo Experimental Forest.

The results indicated that elevated CO2 and Bt cotton both affected the population abundances of A. gossypii and biotype-Q B. tabaci when introduced solely (i.e., without interspecific competition) or two species coexisted (i.e., with interspecific competition). Compared with ambient CO2, elevated CO2 increased the population abundances of A. gossypii and biotype-Q B. tabaci as fed on Bt and nontransgenic cotton on 45 (i.e., seedling stage) and 60 (i.e., flowering stage) days after planting (DAP), but only significantly enhanced aphid abundance without interspecific competition on the 45-DAP nontransgenic cotton and 60-DAP Bt cotton, and significantly increased whitefly abundance with interspecific competition on the 45-DAP Bt cotton and 60-DAP nontransgenic cotton. In addition, compared with nontransgenic cotton at elevated CO2, Bt cotton significantly reduced biotype-Q B. tabaci abundances without and with interspecific competition during seedling and flowering stage, while only significantly decreasing A. gossypii abundances without interspecific competition during the seedling stage. When the two insect species coexisted, the proportions of biotype-Q B. tabaci were significantly higher than those of A. gossypii on Bt and nontransgenic cotton at the same CO2 levels, and elevated CO2 only significantly increased the percentages of biotype-Q B. tabaci and significantly reduced the proportions of A. gossypii on seedling and flowering nontransgenic cotton.

Alternatively, neutral theory predicts that community diversity can be maintained despite equivalent resource requirements among species. We examined interactions at three life history stages (germination, survival, and juvenile-adult growth) for three native and three exotic California annual species in a glasshouse experiment. We varied plant density and species composition in small pots, with pots planted with either intraspecific seeds or in a three species mix of intra- and interspecific neighbors. We saw a range of facilitative, neutral, and competitive interactions that varied significantly by species, rather than by native or exotic status. There were more competitive interactions at the emergence and juvenile-adult growth stages and more facilitative interactions for survival. Consequently, the relative strength of competition in intraspecific versus mixed-species communities depended on whether we considered only the juvenile-adult growth stage or the entire life history of the interacting plants. Using traditional analysis of juvenile-adult growth only, all species showed negative density-dependent interactions for final biomass production. However, when the net effect of plant interactions from seed to adult was considered, which is a prediction of population growth, two native species ceased to show negative density dependence, and the difference between intraspecific and mixed-species competition was only significant for one exotic species. Results were consistent with predictions of neutral, rather than niche, theory for five of six species.","[Leger, Elizabeth A.; Espeland, Erin K.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [Espeland, Erin K.] USDA ARS, Pest Management Res Unit, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Leger, EA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Mail Stop 186,1000 Valley Rd, Reno, NV 89512 USA.",eleger@cabnr.unr.edu; erin.espeland@ars.usda.gov,,"Espeland, Erin/0000-0001-8541-3610",,,,64,34,34,3,96,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,2010,208,2,,,,,333,345,,10.1007/s11258-009-9710-4,,,13,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,589VK,WOS:000277182100013,,,,,2021-09-21,

Growth of U. pertusa and G. filicina was inhibited by UV-B irradiation in mono-culture and specific growth rate (mu) declined as a result. Interspecific competition between U. pertusa and G. filicina was closely related to the initial weights when co-cultured. When initial ratios of U. pertusa (U) to G. filicina (G) were U:G=1.2:1 and 1:1, U. pertusa was the dominant algae. When the initial U:G ratio was 1:1.2, G. filicina was competitively dominant in the earlier stage, but U. pertusa grew faster, superseding G. filicina in the later stage. At initial ration U:G = 1:1.4, G. filicina was predominant. Under UV-B irradiation, the competitive ability of G. filicina was weakened and the interspecific competitive balance favored U. pertusa, which suggests that G. filicina was more sensitive to UV-B irradiation.

In May 2002, at the beginning of the experiment, the Cell number of P. donghaiense accounted for 55%-66% of the total and S. costatum. accounted for 32%-42%. The density of P. donghaiense and S. costatum, was over 95% and 1%-5% respectively in May 2003. The results of these three mesocosm experiments showed that the dominant species in this specific community varied with different nutrient availability. Under low-phosphate Conditions, the dominant species was P. donghaiense, while S. costatum, became dominant in phosphate-replete cases. The average growth rate (1. 08 d(-1)) of S. costatum in exponential growth phase was higher than that (0. 39 d(-1)) of P. donghaiense. In the mesocosm, S. costatum predominated in the mesocosm by its rapid growth. When phosphorus was depleted, the cell number of S. costatum dropped rapidly, while P. donghaiense Lu decreased more slowly. The results from mesocosm experiment may explain why: (1) P. donghaiense bloom usually occurs in May, when phosphate concentration is low; (2) the bloom of S. costatum appears in early spring and summer time, when nutrients increase with increasing Changjiang River (Yangtze River) runoff; (3) the bloom of S. costatum. is short and that of P. donghaiense Lu Call last more than a month in the East China Sea.","[Zhu Mingyuan; Xu Zongjun] Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Life Sci, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Zhu Mingyuan; Xu Zongjun; Li Ruixiang; Wang Zongling] State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Shi Xiaoyong] Ocean Univ China, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China","Zhu, MY (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Life Sci, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China.",zhumingyuan@fio.org.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [40490262, 3730114]; CEOHAB Research Project of National Key Basic Research Development ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2001CB409700]",The National Natural Science Foundation of China under contract Nos 40490262 and 3730114; the CEOHAB Research Project of National Key Basic Research Development Program (973) of China under contract No. 2001CB409700.,,28,7,14,1,19,CHINA OCEAN PRESS,BEIJING,"INTERNATIONAL DEPT, 8 DA HUI SHI, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA",0253-505X,,,ACTA OCEANOL SIN,Acta Oceanol.

In many cases data on species co-occurrence or resource use (prey or habitat) have been interpreted without a clear understanding of how, or even whether, phenotypic differences constrain performance to allow resource partitioning or how these constraints and the density of resources and competitors should shape resource selection by each species. Instead, predictions have been based on assumed constraints, possibly leading to conflicting results. One such controversy involves the role of bill morphology in mediating resource partitioning among dabbling ducks (Anas spp.). To determine whether incorrect assumptions may have contributed to this controversy, I constructed mechanistic models that predict filter-feeding performance for seven species of ducks directly from bill morphology and kinetics and compared these predictions to those of earlier studies that tested the bill morphology hypothesis. The models predicted that species should share a preference for their most pro. table (primary) prey while partitioning their less pro. table (secondary) prey by size. Consequently, ducks should forage in the same habitats and exhibit high overlap in prey size when competitor/resource ratios are either high or low. In contrast, earlier studies expected that resource partitioning should always be evident, which implicitly assumes that species partition their primary resources. The models also predicted that the ecological similarity of species in assemblages should increase as prey abundance and size variability declines, contrary to the expectations of an earlier study. A more consistent understanding of the mechanisms regulating assemblages of dabbling ducks, and other species, might emerge if patterns of resource use and species co-occurrence were predicted directly from a mechanistic understanding of how performance trade-offs affect resource selection in the context of varying resource and competitor densities.","[Gurd, D.

In the Iberian Peninsula, the introduced red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is an invasive species that is competing and displacing the endangered native Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa). We hypothesized that interspecific differences in antipredatory behavior might confer competitive advantages to introduced T. scripta. We examined whether interspecific differences in responses to predation risk affect the time that turtles remained hidden in the shell before using an active escape to water. Both turtle species adjusted hiding times by balancing predation threat, microhabitat conditions and the costs of remaining hidden. However, introduced T. scripta showed longer hiding times before escaping than native M. Leprosa, which, in contrast, switched from waiting hidden in the shell to escape to deep water as soon as possible. These interspecific differences might result from the risk of facing different types of predators in different microhabitats (land vs. water) in their original habitats. However, in anthropogenically altered habitats where predators have been greatly reduced, T. scripta may avoid potential costs of unnecessary repeated escape responses to water (e.g. interruption of basking). These behavioral asymmetries could contribute to the greater competitive ability of introduced T. scripta within anthropogenically disturbed environments.","[Polo-Cavia, Nuria; Lopez, Pilar; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol & Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",jose.martin@mncn.csic.es,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014; , Nuria/L-5372-2014; Lopez, Pilar/K-6221-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Lopez, Pilar/0000-0001-6577-1509",,,,51,48,54,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,2008,114,2,,,,,115,123,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01441.x,,,9,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,251SC,WOS:000252393300002,,,,,2021-09-21,

In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whole costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a trait-mediated interaction (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.","Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 96516 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Plant Soil & Insect Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Bolnick, DI (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",danbolnick@mail.utexas.edu,"Preisser, Evan/C-3469-2013; Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015","Preisser, Evan/0000-0002-8737-5619; Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296",,,,37,91,92,1,73,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2005,86,10,,,,,2771,2779,,10.1890/04-1249,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971DP,WOS:000232361800022,,,,,2021-09-21,

I reanalyzed previously published census data from an experiment in which populations of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans underwent competitive coevolution in one familiar and two novel environments, to specifically look for any evidence of a negative relationship between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates, and for any indication of short period cycling in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects. While there was considerable variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects over generations, among both populations and environments, there was no clear evidence supporting the genetic feedback hypothesis. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates were strongly positively correlated in novel environments, and uncorrelated in the familiar environment. Data from the familiar environment indicated that indices of competition of populations of the initially superior competitor, D. melanogaster, might be showing some cyclic behaviour, but I argue that this is likely to be transient, and not suggestive of sustained oscillatory dynamics predicted by the genetic feedback model.

We examined these processes in and among populations of field voles, sibling voles, bank voles and common shrews in western Finland, using spatially replicated trapping data collected four times a year during two vole cycles (1987-1990 and 1997-1999). Populations of the four species exhibited relatively strong interspecific temporal synchrony in their multiannual fluctuations. During peak phases, we observed slight deviations from close temporal synchrony: field vole densities peaked at least two months earlier than those of either sibling voles or bank voles, while densities of common shrews peaked even earlier. The growth rates of all four coexisting small mammal species were best explained by their own current densities. The growth rate of bank vole populations was negatively related to increasing densities of field voles in the increase phase of the vole cycle. Apart from this, no negative effects of interspecific density, direct or delayed, were observed among the vole species. The growth rates of common shrew populations were negatively related to increasing total rodent (including water voles and harvest mice) densities in the peak phase of the vole cycle. Sibling voles appeared not to be competitively superior to field voles on a population level, as neither of these Microtus voles increased disproportionately in abundance as total rodent density increased. We suggest that interspecific competition among the vole species may occur, but only briefly, during the autumn of peak years, when the total available amount of rodent habitat becomes markedly reduced following agricultural practices. Our results nonetheless indicate that interspecific competition is not a strong determinant of the structure of communities comprised of species exhibiting cyclic dynamics. We suggest that external factors, namely predation and shortage of food, limit densities of vole populations below levels where interspecific competition occurs. Common shrews, however, appear to suffer from asymmetric space competition with rodents at peak densities of voles; this may be viewed as a synchronizing effect.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,62,46,51,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2004,27,2,,,,,197,206,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2003.03684.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,808DK,WOS:000220549600008,,,,,2021-09-21,

The significant reduction in the transmission success of P. gallinaceum to mosquitoes, due to the co-infecting P. juxtanucleare, is predicted to have compromised its colonization of regions occupied by P. juxtanucleare and, thus, may have contributed to the restricted global distribution of P. gallinaceum.

Previous studies have suggested that these species have similar resource requirements and. as there is no temporal segregation in growth, we suggest that competition for below-ground resources should be intense. Classical competition theory predicts that, under stable conditions. coexistence of species with similar requirements can occur if intraspecific competition is more intense than interspecific competition. We therefore compared the competitive abilities of the two species under both inter- and intraspecific conditions, another determinant of coexistence in plant communities. 2 A 3-year experiment was conducted in a small homogeneous area and a separate 2-year experiment was conducted in a larger area. In both experiments, a hexagonal planting design was used to achieve all possible combinations of species and to control plant size and neighbourhood asymmetries at the start of the experiment. Half the target plants were grown within steel cylinders to reduce below-ground competition. 3 We found similar results in the two experiments. Plant biomass and seed production were always higher in plants growing with reduced competition, although seed production was quite variable. Relative competition intensity did not differ between intraspecific and interspecific competition. 4 Our results suggest that competition between these coexisting shortgrasses is intense, but do not support the prediction of a difference between intra- and interspecific competition.

Recent models examining the ways in which spatial pattern in the landscape will influence the outcome of species interactions assume a trade-off between colonization ability and competitive ability in the interacting species. We tested for differential colonization and competitive ability in two interacting species of wolf spider (Hogna helluo and Pardosa milvina) which co-occur in agricultural and early successional habitats in the eastern USA. We conducted our research in replicated experimental soybean plots in which we created islands of enhanced habitat by supplementing natural litter and enhancing weed growth. Our experimental manipulations were repeated once for each of the two spider species: (1) spiders added, (2) prey attractants (composted vegetable waste) added, (3) spiders and prey attractants added, and (4) one control, for a total of eight subplots. We replicated the experiment six times, three times each in conventionally tilled fields and conservation tilled fields. We censused these plots at the end of the summer and found that conspecific addition significantly elevated numbers of one species (H. helluo) but not the other (P. milvina). These findings were consistent with our predictions that H. helluo is limited in colonization ability when compared to P. milvina, The addition of prey attractants significantly elevated numbers of both species, but the effect was far stronger for the superior colonist (P. milvina). This indicates that P. milvina is able to track resource abundance (both habitat structure and prey), a trait correlated with colonization ability. We found no strong evidence for a negative effect of H. helluo addition on numbers of P. milvina, as would be predicted if H. helluo strongly competed with or significantly preyed upon P, milvina. Body condition of P, milvina was lowest in subplots with higher numbers of H. helluo, indicating that H. helluo may have influenced the foraging success of P. milvina. We also found a strong and unexpected effect of the context of the plots (background tillage regime) on numbers of P. milvina, with there being approximately twice the P. milvina in the subplots in conventionally tilled fields.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Marshall, SD (corresponding author), Hiram Coll, Dept Biol, JH Barrow Field Stn, Hiram, OH 44234 USA.",marshallsd@hiram.edu,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305",,,,36,56,58,0,37,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2000,81,12,,,,,3341,3349,,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,387QZ,WOS:000166134400008,,,,,2021-09-21,

In northern Wisconsin lakes, the invading crayfish Orconectes rusticus is replacing O. virilis, the native, and O. propinquus, a previous invader. We tested the impacts of interspecific competition for food and of nonconsumptive effects of predation by largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, on growth and mortality of these three species. In competition experiments, O. virilis grew less, and O. propinquus suffered increased mortality in the presence of O, rusticus relative to single-species treatments. Orconectes rusticus was unaffected by the presence of congeners. In experiments testing nonconsumptive effects of predation, O. virilis growth declined substantially in the presence of largemouth bass, O, rusticus growth declined slightly, and O. propinquus growth was unaffected. Mortality of all three crayfishes increased in the presence of largemouth bass, with O. virilis experiencing the greatest and O. rusticus the least mortality. To explore how competition, predation, and their interaction influence species replacements, we compared a fitness index (mortality/growth = mu/g) among species across biotic interaction domains: no interaction, intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, predation by fish, fish predation with competition, and predation risk with competition. In three of six domains, O. virilis and O. propinquus had somewhat similar mu/g, but reversals in I mu/g rank between O. virilis and O. propinquus among domains occurred. These reversals are consistent with lack of unidirectionality of species replacements observed where O. virilis and O. propinquus distributions overlap. In all four interspecific interaction domains, O. rusticus had the lowest mu/g (indicating greatest fitness), which is consistent with observed unidirectional replacement of O, propinquus and O. virilis by O. rusticus.

A study from southeastern Nigeria,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Osteolaemus tetraspis; Varanus niloticus ornatus; interspecific competition; Nigeria,CAIMAN-CROCODILUS; AUSTRALIA; HABITATS; DIETS,"Aspects of coexistence between the dwarf crocodile Osteolaemus tetraspis and the Nile monitor lizard Varanus niloticus were studied in swamp rain forests of south-eastern Nigeria, central Africa. Crocodiles were si,significantly smaller than monitor lizards. There was no significant sexual size dimorphism in the examined sample of Varanus, whereas the female size exceeded the male size in Osteolaemus. The food niche breadth was narrower in young than in adults of both species, and V. niloticus showed a narrower niche breadth than O. tetraspis. Crabs constituted the main prey type category for both species, whereas vertebrates were more rarely preyed upon. The diet composition of males and females was similar in V. niloticus, but it was different in O. tetraspis. The general diet composition of the two species was similar (78.2% of overlap), and even the habitats where these two species were found were similar. These interspecific similarities suggest that O. tetraspis and V. niloticus could be potential competitors in the freshwater ecosystems of the Nigerian rainforest. However, it is suggested that the main prey type for these species (crabs) is not limited in the environment, which may minimize interspecific competition. Interference competition can also occur between these species, as suggested by one case of direct predation of the one species (V. niloticus) towards the other species (O. tetraspis). A case of cannibalism was observed in V niloticus. This could indicate that intraspecific competition can be important for regulating the dynamics of monitor populations in the rainforests of south-eastern Nigeria.","Inst Environm Pollut Res, I-00133 Rome, Italy; Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Inst Environm Pollut Res, Via dei Cochi 48-B, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020; CAPIZZI, DARIO/O-6431-2019","Capizzi, Dario/0000-0003-0871-9602",,,,20,35,37,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0952-8369,,,J ZOOL,J.

The availability of small mammals in four different environmental types was also investigated by means of live-trapping and mark-and-recapture procedures. All snakes fed primarily on small mammals and lizards, whereas owls preyed essentially upon small mammals. A. noctua was also largely insectivorous. In general, diet composition of phylogenetically unrelated predators was similar (as shown by relatively high overlap estimates), and several prey taxa were eaten by all predators (including both owls and snakes). However, (i) interphyletic comparisons and (ii) multivariate statistical procedures revealed some interesting differences in predator diet composition. Owls were found to prey mainly upon small mammal taxa from semicultivated open grassy habitats, whereas snakes did so upon forest-associated small mammals. Correlation analyses confirmed this evidence. The potential for competition for food seems to be higher between phylogenetically related than between phylogenetically unrelated taxa, due to separation among groups in frequented macrohabitat and, possibly, also to daily activity rhythms. Food niche partitioning was more evident among owls than among snakes, in agreement with the fact that snakes, contrary to owls, are low-energy organisms that can survive on limited food resources.","UNIV ROMA LA SAPIENZA,DIPARTIMENTO BIOL ANIM & UOMO,I-00161 ROME,ITALY; CNR,CTR GENET EVOLUZIONIST,I-00161 ROME,ITALY",,,"CAPIZZI, DARIO/O-6431-2019; Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020","Capizzi, Dario/0000-0003-0871-9602",,,,71,55,59,1,18,GAUTHIER-VILLARS,PARIS,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS, FRANCE",1146-609X,,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

We tested experimentally whether such competition occurs between young-of-year (YOY) largemouth bass and their eventual prey, bluegill. In a divided experimental pond, target densities of YOY bass and juvenile bluegill were subjected to different densities of bass and bluegill neighbors to examine the dependence of juvenile growth on fish density and species composition. After 7 wk, clear differences in growth rates of both species existed across densities, Bass growth was reduced in the presence of both bass and bluegill neighbors, whereas bluegill growth was primarily affected intraspecifically. Bluegill had strong competitive effects on bass despite substantial resource partitioning between the two species. These effects were mediated through changes in the size-structure of important invertebrate prey in both open water and vegetation habitats. Data collected from a set of seven lakes in Michigan indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile bluegill and YOY bass is an important process in natural populations, However, once bass become piscivorous, bluegill become a significant resource for bass. As a result, bass populations are split into two functionally distinct stages that respond differently across a gradient of bluegill density. Because of the competitive stage between predator and prey, dynamics of the interaction differ from predictions based on classical predator-prey or competition theory.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,WK KELLOGG BIOL STN,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060; UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720","OLSON, MH (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,CTR LIMNOL,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,"Osenberg, Craig/M-9904-2013; Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013","Mittelbach, Gary/0000-0001-6971-9273; Osenberg, Craig/0000-0003-1918-7904",,,,62,138,142,1,61,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1995,76,6,,,,,1758,1771,,10.2307/1940708,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RQ248,WOS:A1995RQ24800006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Key populations were represented by thirteen model components and were aquatic insects; age-1 and age-2 crayfish (three species); age-1 and age-2 hellgrammites (Corydalus cornutus larvae); non-game fishes; age-0, age-1, and adult smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu); age-0, age-1, and adult rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris); and age-0, age-1 to age-3, and adult flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris). In this system, crayfish and hellgrammites are harvested to provide bait for the recreational fishery that extensively exploits the three predatory fish species. Predation and intraspecific regulation were represented with nonlinear algorithms, and linear terms represented fishery harvests. Interspecific competition among components occurred through predation on shared prey. Error analysis of the model suggested that predation was the most important mechanism in maintaining system structure (the disposition of biomass among system components). Further, the trophic relation between each component and its prey accounted for 34-64% of the variability in food web structure, whereas predation on each component explained 1-24% of food web structure variability. Therefore, so-called 'bottom-up' effects were more influential than 'top-down' effects. Interspecific competition and intraspecific regulation had secondary roles in maintaining New River food web structure, although intraspecific regulation was most important to aquatic insects, which were not predatory in our model. Both forms of competition are probably tempered by extensive predation and exploitation in the New River system. Exploitation was a secondary structuring agent to adult smallmouth bass, which experience a high rate of harvest in the New River.","VIRGINIA POLYTECH INST & STATE UNIV, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE SCI, BLACKSBURG, VA 24061 USA",,,"Orth, Donald J/X-8620-2018","Orth, Donald J/0000-0002-9236-0147",,,,83,5,5,0,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,OCT 21,1994,291,3,,,,,157,178,,10.1007/BF00014706,,,22,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,PR746,WOS:A1994PR74600002,,,,,2021-09-21,

We set up 3 types of experimental plots in the paddy fields where D. major predominated. The two plots contained single species of either D. japonicus or D. major, respectively, and one plot had both species in equal number. We compared the development and the reproductive performance between plots in each species. In D. japonicus, the number of eggs and early instar nymphs were significantly smaller in the plots containing both species than in the monospecific plots. However, the numbers of late instar nymphs and newly emerged adults were not significantly different between plots. The proportions of starved nymphs in both plots were larger than those in the D. japonicus's natural habitats. The final densities of adults in both plots were lower than those in the natural habitats. These results suggest that lower density of D. japonicus in these paddy fields is due to the lack of available food for nymphs rather than the effects of interspecific competition with D. major. In D. major, significant differences were not found in the number of eggs, each instar nymphs and adults.

On exposing pairs of triclad species to D. cephalotes, significantly more P. felina than Ph. vitta were consumed, whereas similar numbers were eaten in each of the other two triclad combinations. Cannibalism and interspecific predation by triclad species were not observed. It is concluded that predation is unlikely to have a major influence in determining the observed distribution and abundance of triclad species in a Welsh study stream which harbours low numbers of effective predators. The de Wit model of competition was used to examine the competitive relationships between Ph. vitta, and C. alpina and P. felina, using chironomids or tubificid worms as food. In mixed cultures of Ph. vitta and P. felina fed on tubificids a stable equilibrium existed within the range of relative densities used in the experiments, whereas Ph. vitta was competitively superior to C. alpina in cultures fed on each of the food types, and to P. felina fed on chironomids. However, in theory, an equilibrium could occur when 10 or 6-7 times as many Ph. vitta as P. felina and C. alpina respectively are in the culture, when intraspecific rather than interspecific competition would become more important. Where the three triclad species coexist in the Welsh study stream, they are in similar numbers. This could imply that food is not limiting, with no consequent interspecific competition, or that the laboratory experiments were too simplistic to allow any interpretation of the field situation.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUT BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,1,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR 15,1991,211,1,,,,,43,50,,10.1007/BF00008615,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,FG274,WOS:A1991FG27400005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Additionally, as temperatures increase, the body size of many ectotherms is decreasing. However, phenological and body size shifts are not occurring at the same rates across species, even in species that live in close proximity or have similar life history. Differing rates of phenological and body-size shifts may affect ecological interactions. We investigated whether shifts in phenology and body size had a predictable effect on interspecific competition. We tested three hypotheses. First, priority effects would indicate early arriving organisms gain a competitive advantage. Second, larger organisms would be competitively superior. Third, similarly sized organisms would compete more strongly. We manipulated aquatic larval conditions to create variation in wood frog (Rana sylvatica) size at and date of metamorphosis. Wood frogs were placed in terrestrial enclosures with unmanipulated juvenile American toads (Anaxyrus americanus) where we tracked amphibian growth over 3 months. Consistent with the size superiority hypothesis, initially smaller wood frogs did not compete as strongly with toads. However, the results of the phenological shift were the opposite of our priority effects prediction: early arrival by frogs increased toad mass. Our results could indicate that toads would experience fewer negative effects of competition with wood frogs that metamorphose earlier and smaller under climate change. Our study highlights the challenges of predicting how climate change will affect interspecific interactions and emphasizes the need to investigate the role of shifts in both phenology and body size.","[Rollins, Hilary B.; Benard, Michael F.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Rollins, HB (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",hbrollins@gmail.com,,"Benard, Michael/0000-0002-8585-3816; Rollins, Hilary/0000-0003-3253-1036",,,,76,0,0,6,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2020,193,3,,,,,749,759,,10.1007/s00442-020-04705-w,,JUL 2020,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MV3GZ,WOS:000547367100001,32654046,,,,2021-09-21,

Interference competition is when one species denies a competing species access to a resource. One mechanism of interference competition is aggression, which can result in altered space-use of a subordinate species due to the threat of harm, otherwise known as a 'landscape of fear'. Alternatively, subordinates might outcompete dominant species in resource-poor environments via a superior ability to extract resources. Our goal was to evaluate spatial predictions of the 'landscape of fear' hypothesis for a carnivore guild in Newfoundland, Canada, where coyotes recently immigrated. Native Newfoundland carnivores include red foxes, Canada lynx, and black bears. We predicted foxes and lynx would avoid coyotes because of their larger size and similar dietary niches. We used scat-detecting dogs and genetic techniques to locate and identify predator scats. We then built resource selection functions and tested for avoidance by incorporating predicted values of selection for the alternative species into the best supported models of each species. We found multiple negative relationships, but notably did not find avoidance by foxes of areas selected by coyotes. While we did find that lynx avoided coyotes, we also found a reciprocal relationship. The observed patterns suggest spatial partitioning and not coyote avoidance, although avoidance could still be occurring at different spatial or temporal scales. Furthermore, Newfoundland's harsh climate and poor soils may swing the pendulum of interspecific interactions from interference competition to exploitative competition, where subordinates outcompete dominant competitors through a superior ability to extract resources.","[Mumma, Matthew A.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Holbrook, Joseph D.] Montana State Univ, Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Rayl, Nathaniel D.; Zieminski, Christopher J.; Fuller, Todd K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Organ, John F.] US Geol Survey, Cooperat Fish Unit, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Organ, John F.] US Geol Survey, Wildlife Res Unit, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Mahoney, Shane P.] Conservat Vis LLC, St John, NF, Canada; [Mahoney, Shane P.] Govt Newfoundland & Labrador, Sustainable Dev & Strateg Sci, Dept Environm & Conservat, St John, NF, Canada; [Waits, Lisette P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA","Mumma, MA (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC, Canada.",matt.mumma@unbc.ca,,"Mumma, Matthew/0000-0003-1954-6524; Waits, Lisette/0000-0002-1323-0812","Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation (Sustainable Development and Strategic Science); Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation (Institute for Biodiversity, Ecosystem Science and Sustainability); Safari Club International Foundation","This study was funded by the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation (Sustainable Development and Strategic Science and the Institute for Biodiversity, Ecosystem Science and Sustainability) and the Safari Club International Foundation.

In this study, RTM and sperm form are compared across 15 species of gerbils, seven from the Tribe Taterillini and eight from the Tribe Gerbillini. Marked interspecific differences in RTM and sperm morphology were observed. However, the Gerbilliscus species with the largest RTM do not have a sperm head with an apical hook nor a longer sperm tail than other species with smaller RTM whereas, by contrast, in the Tribe Gerbillini, species where the sperm head lacks a hook have a relatively small testes mass. We thus suggest that in gerbils, unlike in murine rodents, high levels of postcopulatory sexual selection have not invariably resulted in the evolution of a spermatozoon with a long apical hook and long sperm tail.

Many freshwater ecosystems are resource-limited and both intra-and interspecific competitiveness is a common requirement to gain and defend resources necessary for reproduction. Although predation risk is an important selective force affecting behavioral decisions, little is known about the impact of predation risk on interspecific competition. Here, we investigate whether chemically mediated predation risk affects interspecific territorial aggression by the freshwater cichlid Pelvicachromis taeniatus. In our experiments, territorial P. taeniatus males were visually confronted with a territorial intruder: a heterospecific, sympatric cichlid (Benitochromis nigrodorsalis) which generally induced aggression in P. taeniatus. Predation risk for P. taeniatus was simulated by a concurrent release of conspecific chemical alarm cues. In control treatments, no chemical cues, dissolved heterospecific alarm cues, or aliquots of distilled water were provided during these aggressive encounters. The results show that interspecific aggression of territorial male P. taeniatus is significantly decreased under predation risk compared to the control treatments. This suggests that interspecific competition becomes less intense under concurrent predation risk. As this process could hinder competitive exclusion, predation risk may indirectly promote and stabilize biodiversity in natural ecosystems.","[Meuthen, Denis; Baldauf, Sebastian A.; Bakker, Theo C.

Specialized animal species are commonly affected by resource and interference competition with generalist and/or omnivorous competitors, so avoidance behavior could be expected. We hypothesize that specialist species may exploit broad range cues from such potential resource competitors (i.e., cues possibly common to various generalist and/or omnivorous predators) to avoid costly competition regarding food or reproduction, even in new species associations. We tested this hypothesis by studying short-term interactions between a native larval parasitoid and a native generalist omnivorous predator recently sharing the same invasive host/prey, the leaf miner Tuta absoluta. We observed a strong negative effect of kleptoparasitism (food resource stealing) instead of classical intraguild predation on immature parasitoids. There was no evidence that parasitoid females avoided the omnivorous predator when searching for oviposition sites, although we studied both long- and short-range known detection mechanisms. Therefore, we conclude that broad range cue avoidance may not exist in our biological system, probably because it would lead to too much oviposition site avoidance which would not be an efficient and, thus, beneficial strategy. If confirmed in other parasitoids or specialist predators, our findings may have implications for population dynamics, especially in the current context of increasing invasive species and the resulting creation of many new species associations.","[Chailleux, Anais; Wajnberg, Eric; Zhou, Yuxiang; Amiens-Desneux, Edwige; Desneux, Nicolas] Inst Sophia Agrobiotech, French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Chailleux, Anais] InVivo AgroSolut, F-75782 Paris, France; [Chailleux, Anais] Cirad, UPR HortSys, F-34398 Montpellier, France","Chailleux, A (corresponding author), Cirad, UPR HortSys, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",chailleux.anais@gmail.com,"Wajnberg, Eric/A-4862-2009; Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013","Wajnberg, Eric/0000-0002-6700-7114; Chailleux, Anais/0000-0001-5653-8019",ANRTFrench National Research Agency (ANR); InVivo AgroSolutions; French Ministry of Agriculture [10063],"We thank Anthony Droui for carrying out some of the experiments and helpful comments on the experimental design, Cecile Thomas and Philippe Bearez (INRA Sophia Antipolis) for the technical assistance, Meline Beal and Jacques Frandon (Biotop, InVivo AgroSolutions) for providing biological materials, ANRT and InVivo AgroSolutions for the funding to AC (Ph.D. fellowship) and the French Ministry of Agriculture for the funding to ND (CASDAR project 10063).

We experimentally examined interactions between two microparasites (entomopathogenic nematodes) isolated from sandy grassland soils of coastal California: Heterorhabditis marelatus (Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema feltiae (Steinernematidae). Heterorhabditis marelatus drives trophic cascades by attacking root- and stem-boring ghost moth caterpillars (Hepialus californicus, Hepialidae), thereby indirectly protecting bush lupine shrubs (Lupinus arboreus, Fabaceae). Extensive field surveys demonstrated sympatric overlap in microhabitat use under lupine canopies and similar mean prevalence of the two nematode species. Using a response-surface design in the laboratory, we varied relative and absolute microparasite densities to test for competitive outcomes within an evolutionary naive host, larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae), and within the native host Hepialus californicus. Independent of conspecific or interspecific density, S. feltiae dominated as expected over H. marelatus within the naive Galleria, but S. feltiae infected hosts at low frequency and showed lower reproductive fitness than H. marelatus within native Hepialus hosts. Contrary to studies that demonstrate the pairwise dominance of steinernematid over heterorhabditid species in laboratory hosts, host resistance to S. feltiae may provide a mechanism for coexistence of multiple microparasite species. We hypothesize that the ubiquitous field prevalence and rapid life history of S. feltiae imply its use of widespread, abundant but small-bodied hosts and indicate the lack of direct competition with H. marelatus in the Hepialus-Lupinus trophic cascade.","[Gruner, Daniel S.; Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kolekar, Arunima] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [McLaughlin, John P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Gruner, DS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0620475],"We thank Evan Preisser, Karthik Ram, the Gruner lab, and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on the manuscript; Betsy Harbert and Wei-Chen Hsu for technical assistance; and the National Science Foundation for financial support (DEB-0620475).

Coccinellids may interact indirectly by competing for shared resources and directly through intraguild predation. Prior studies have examined pairwise interactions among species and although several coccinellid species typically co-exist within habitats, multi-species interactions have rarely been investigated. To examine how aphid prey levels influence interspecific interactions among a multispecies assemblage, the exotic coccinellids, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) and Coccinella septempunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and a native coccinellid species, Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), were paired or placed in groups containing three heterospecific larvae and fed 2.4, 12.0, or 24.0 mg of aphids per larva daily. Larval survival, developmental time, and adult weight of individuals were measured. Greater amounts of prey typically resulted in increased adult weights and shorter developmental times. When Coleomegilla maculata and Coccinella septempunctata were paired Coleomegilla maculata had higher survival rates at low prey levels and Coccinella septempunctata had higher survival at mid- and high prey levels. When the three species were combined, Coccinella septempunctata and Coleomegilla maculata had similar survival rates (17%) at low prey levels; at mid- and high prey levels, Coccinella septempunctata survival increased (58-88%), but Coleomegilla. maculata survival remained similar (17-21%). Survival of H. axyridis was not affected by competitors. Even though intraguild predation occurs among these species; the responses to competitors varied based on prey level, coccinellid species, mid the number of interacting larvae.","[Moser, Susan E.; Obrycki, John J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Moser, SE (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, S-225 Agr Sci Ctr N, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",smoser@iastate.edu,,,,,,40,26,26,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0013-8746,1938-2901,,ANN ENTOMOL SOC AM,Ann.

HYMENOPTERA; FORMICA-FUSCA; WOOD ANTS; COMMUNITIES; INTERFERENCE; ASSEMBLAGES; TERRITORIES; POLYCTENA; MYRMICA; TAIGA,"Competitive interactions often play an important role in local community structure, and particularly so in ant communities. We test predictions derived from a competition model proposed for Scandinavian ant communities by comparing ant nest densities inside and outside fifty randomly-selected territories of competitively dominant wood ants within 30 km of Umea, northern Sweden. As predicted by the model, competitively-intermediate encounter species, as well as other territorial species, showed complementary occurrences with both studied wood ants, Formica aquilonia Yarrow and F. lugubris Zett.. In contrast, complementary abundances, i.e. lower density of competitively-inferior submissive species in the presence of wood ants, as predicted by the model, was not supported for all submissive species. Of the two studied wood ant species, the nest density of submissive species was negatively correlated only with F. aquilonia. Submissives as a group, as well as Myrmica-species, showed complementary abundances with F. aquilonia, but one Leptothorax and two Serviformica species had higher nest densities in the presence of this competitively-dominant species. We propose that, for Leptothorax, these deviations from the model predictions may be because of limited niche overlap with dominant wood ants, a small worker force and a timid behaviour which does not elicit aggression in wood ants. For the two Serviformica species, we propose a combination of protection against social parasites, inter-specific social control performed by F. aquilonia, and dominance relationships between competitively-inferior submissive species as reasons for the higher nest density inside F. aquilonia territories. Monogyny, and thereby smaller nests, lower worker force, smaller territory (as shown by this study) in F. lugubris, as compared to the polygyny in F. aquilonia, may also help explain the differences in their effects on subordinate species. Our analyses indicate that the linear competition hierarchy model proposed for Scandinavian ants accurately predicts the outcome of interaction between and community composition for dominant territorial and encounter species, but that it needs refinement with respect to the relationship between territorial and submissive species and the resulting community composition. Further studies are needed, especially addressing the complex relationships between these latter groups, and the effects of different competitively-dominant wood ants, to determine the mechanisms determining the outcome of these relationships and to more accurately predict community composition.","[Alinvi, O.; Bohlin, J.; Ball, J.

Results of many studies have indicated that interspecific competition restricts the use of foraging sites in mixed-species winter flocks. However predation is a significant mortality factor in these species, and predation risk might also restrict the selection of foraging sites. The Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) is the main diurnal predator of these small passerines during winter. Predation risk from the Pygmy Owl varies greatly with the availability of voles as alternative prey. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of predation risk on the use of foraging sites in coniferous forest tits during winter. I collected foraging data from Willow (Parus montanus) and Crested Tits (P. cristatus) during one winter when vole populations had crashed and another winter when vole density was high to see if predation risk affects the selection of foraging sites by these species. Both Willow and Crested Tits changed to foraging in the inner parts of coniferous trees after the vole populations had crashed and when the Pygmy Owls started to hunt the tits. Additionally, in both pine and birch Willow Tits moved towards the treetops under high predation risk. Since all the foraging shifts were towards sites that are regarded to be safest from predation risk, it seems that predation risk in addition to interspecific competition influences the use of foraging sites by tits in coniferous forest.",,"SUHONEN, J (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA, KONNEVESI RES STN, DEPT BIOL, SF-44300 KONNEVESI, FINLAND.",,,"Suhonen, Jukka/0000-0001-8546-8945",,,,40,141,144,5,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1993,74,4,,,,,1197,1203,,10.2307/1940490,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LD022,WOS:A1993LD02200024,,,,,2021-09-21,

The common sea star, Asterias rubens (Linneaus), is a dominant indigenous predator in rocky subtidal habitats in eastern Canada, affecting community structure through sustained consumption of bivalve prey, mainly blue mussel, Mytilus edulis (Linneaus). Yet, considerable spatial and dietary overlaps with the indigenous rock crab, Cancer irroratus (Say), and introduced green crab, Carcinus maeneas (Linneaus), together with comparatively lower mobility in A. rubens, suggest the latter is poorly fit to compete with both crabs for M. edulis. A laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions for variably-sized M. edulis between small and large, 3-week starved A. rubens, and large C. irroratus or C. maenas (in one-on-one sea star versus crab face-offs) from southeastern Newfoundland. Mussel consumption in starved A. rubens, as well as four components of its natural feeding behaviour, were quantified over 75-h trials in relatively cold (similar to 4 to 5.5 degrees C) seawater representative of the current northern limit of C. maenas' distribution in the northwestern Atlantic. Results showed that starved A. rubens (1) prioritizes consumption, upon contacting mussel prey, over non-feeding activities such as responding to physical contacts initiated by crabs; (2) alters consumption and feeding behaviour under prolonged exposure to C. irroratus; and (3) increases movement in presence of green crab, more so in large than small sea stars. Overall, findings demonstrate that A. rubens' foraging decisions vary ontogenetically and with competitor's identity. Observed differences in consumption and feeding behaviour in A. rubens exposed to familiar (rock crab) or unfamiliar (green crab) competitors also suggest timing and frequency of encounters with competitors have the potential to alter feeding patterns throughout an organism's lifetime.","[St-Pierre, Anne P.; Gagnon, Patrick] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ocean Sci Ctr, Dept Ocean Sci, 0 Marine Lab Rd, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Moreland, Hali R.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, 232 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada","St-Pierre, AP (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ocean Sci Ctr, Dept Ocean Sci, 0 Marine Lab Rd, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",apsp66@mun.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI-Leaders Opportunity Funds); Research & Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador (Ignite RD); Department of Biology of Memorial University of Newfoundland,"We are grateful to D.

The mechanisms by which native ungulates cope with the combined effects of competition, predation and human disturbance are poorly understood. Addressing this knowledge gap will help guide management and conservation plans for large mammal communities outside of strictly protected areas. We conducted animal counts on line transects and used a spatially explicit distance sampling model to test the influence of bottom-up effects (vegetation), top-down effects from African lion Panthera leo and spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta and human disturbance (livestock density, occupied human settlements) on native ungulate densities and distributions across a multiple-use rangeland in Kenya. We examined five species that varied in body morphology and foraging strategy, including two large-bodied grazers (zebra Equus quagga; wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus), two medium-bodied, mixed-feeders (Grant's gazelle Nanger granti; impala Aepyceros melampus) and one very large-bodied browser (giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi). Densities and distributions of all species varied across available land-use types, with bottom-up effects (vegetation) and human disturbance having the strongest overall effects. Responses varied by ungulate foraging strategy. Distributions of grazers and the browser (giraffe) changed seasonally, while distributions of mixed-feeders and a grazer (zebra) changed diurnally. At broad spatial scales, ungulates did not respond to long-term variation in predation risk though they have been shown to respond behaviourally to short-term variation in risk.Synthesis and applications. Our results revealed that native ungulates in this multiple-use rangeland occur at densities comparable to many flagship protected area populations. We attribute observed densities to spatial heterogeneity across this landscape that included variation in human land use (community conservation area, seasonal settlements and livestock grazing, permanent settlements) and vegetation (grassland, bushland, woodland) that changed through time (seasonally, diurnally). This variation allowed ungulates to carve out ecological niches while reducing exposure to the potential limiting effects of competition and human disturbance. For some species, securing access to forage resources and avoiding human disturbance may be associated with costs through increased risk of predation. Our research reveals the trade-offs native ungulates make to cope with changes in forage availability, human disturbance and predation risk, providing important insights to help guide native ungulate conservation efforts in multiple-use rangelands.","[Schuette, Paul; Creel, Scott] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, 310 Lewis Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Schuette, Paul] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Christianson, Dave] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Biol Sci East 325, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Schuette, P (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, 310 Lewis Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.; Schuette, P (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",pschuett@esf.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-0642393, IOS-1145749]; Cincinnati Zoo; Panthera Kaplan Graduate fellowship","We thank the Kenya Ministry of Science and Technology (Permit: NCST/RRI/12/1/MAS/03/7) and the Kenya Wildlife Service (Permit: KWS/CRA/5001) for permission to conduct this research.

Large carnivores have experienced substantial population and range declines across Africa, and future climate change is likely to amplify these threats. Hence it is important to understand how future environmental changes will affect their long- term habitat suitability and population persistence. This study aims to identify the factors limiting the distribution of the endangered African wild dog, Lycaonpictus, and determine how biotic interactions and changing climate and land cover will affect future range suitability. We use Species Distribution Models ( SDMs) to predict the current and future distribution of suitable conditions for L. pictus and its dominant competitor Pantheraleo. We show that range suitability for L. pictus is limited by climatic and land cover variables, as well as high niche and range overlap with P.leo. Although both species are predicted to experience range contractions under future climate change, L. pictus may benefit from release from the effect of interspecific competition in eastern and central parts of its range. Our study highlights the importance of including land cover variables with corresponding future projections and incorporating the effects of competing species when predicting the future distribution of species whose ranges are not solely limited by climate. We conclude that SDMs can help identify priority areas for the long-term conservation of large carnivores, and therefore should be used to inform adaptive conservation management in face of future climate change.","[Jones, Megan; Razgour, Orly] Univ Stirling, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Bertola, Laura D.] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, POB 9518, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Bertola, Laura D.] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol Lieden IBL, POB 9505, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Razgour, Orly] Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Razgour, Orly] Univ Southampton, Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Razgour, O (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.; Razgour, O (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.; Razgour, O (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",orly.razgour@gmail.com,"Bertola, Laura/U-5299-2019; Razgour, Orly/X-3478-2019; Razgour, Orly/B-9646-2011","Bertola, Laura/0000-0002-3445-0355; Razgour, Orly/0000-0003-3186-0313; Razgour, Orly/0000-0003-3186-0313","University of Stirling Impact Fellowship; Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) Independent Research Fellowship [NE/M018660/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M018660/2, NE/M018660/1] Funding Source: researchfish","We are grateful to H.

However, both the study and management of invasive prey have historically overlooked indirect effects. In southern California estuaries, introduction of the Asian nest mussel Arcuatula senhousia has been linked to profound changes in native bivalve assemblages, but the mechanisms of these interactions remain unclear. We performed three field experiments to assess the mechanisms of competition between Arcuatula and native bivalves, and evaluated the potential for Arcuatula to indirectly mediate native predator-prey dynamics. We found that Arcuatula reduces the diversity, abundance, and size of native bivalve recruits by preemptively exploiting space in surface sediments. When paired with native shallow-dwelling clams (Chione undatella and Laevicardium substriatum), Arcuatula reduces adult survival through overgrowth competition. However, Arcuatula also attracts native predators, causing apparent competition by indirectly increasing predation of native clams, especially for poorly defended species. Therefore, invasive prey can indirectly increase predation rates on native competitors by changing the behavior of shared native predators, but the magnitude of apparent competition strongly depends on the vulnerability of natives to predation. Interestingly, our results indicate that the vulnerability of invasive prey to predation can greatly exacerbate impacts on their native competitors. Our findings suggest that consideration of both direct and indirect effects of invasive prey, as well as native predator-prey relationships, should lead to more effective invasive species management.","[Castorani, Max C.

Since first discovered in 1997, ecological information about the Jocotoco Antpitta has begun to accrue; however, much remains to be learned about this rare species in its limited native range. The observations described here advance our knowledge of the behavioral ecology of this elusive species and contribute more broadly to our knowledge of interspecific competition in antpittas in general. We show that in avian systems in which playback experiments fail to detect competition, competition may still be prevalent, in this case manifesting in a nonvocal, physically aggressive interaction. We also raise new questions about the potential for temporal variation in interspecific competition in grallariids due to increased resource demands during nestling provisioning.","[Snow, Samuel S.; Musser, Jacob M.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Snow, Samuel S.; Field, Daniel J.; Musser, Jacob M.] Yale Univ, Div Vertebrate Zool, Peabody Museum Nat Hist, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Field, Daniel J.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Field, Daniel J.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Amer Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA","Snow, SS (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 208106, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",samuel.snow@yale.edu,,"Field, Daniel/0000-0002-1786-0352; Snow, Samuel/0000-0003-2890-4717",Yale University; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Smithsonian Predoctoral FellowshipSmithsonian Institution; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1122492],"We would like to thank our friends at the Fundacion de Conservacion Jocotoco and the Tapichalaca Biological Reserve for their admirable work to conserve these fascinating birds.

In particular, woodland-dependent birds are under threat across agricultural landscapes in Britain, North America and Australia, with their decline and extirpation attributed to the loss and fragmentation of habitat. Other native species have become over-abundant in response to anthropogenic landscape change and have strong interactive effects on avian assemblage structure. In eastern Australia, the hyper-aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) often dominates woodlands in agricultural landscapes through interspecific competition, resulting in declines of species richness of woodland-dependent birds. We aimed to determine the relative influence and importance of interspecific competition, in situ habitat structure and landscape structure for woodland-dependent bird species at the landscape level. We recorded species-specific landscape incidence of woodland-dependent birds in 24 agricultural-woodland mosaics (25 km(2)) in southern Queensland, Australia. We selected extensively cleared landscapes (10-23 % woodland cover) where fragmentation effects are expected to be greatest. We applied generalised linear models and hierarchical partitioning to quantify the relative importance of the landscape-level incidence of the noisy miner, mistletoe abundance, shrub cover, woodland extent, woodland subdivision and land-use intensity for the incidence of 46 species of woodland birds at the landscape-scale. The landscape-level incidence of the noisy miner was the most important explanatory variable across the assemblage. Both in situ habitat structure and landscape structure were of secondary importance to interspecific aggression, although previous research suggests that the increasing incidence of the noisy miner in fragmented agricultural landscapes is itself a consequence of anthropogenic changes to landscape structure. Species' responses to fragmentation varied from positive to negative, but complex habitat structure had a consistently positive effect, suggesting in situ restoration of degraded habitats could be a conservation priority. Landscape wide conservation of woodland-dependent bird populations in agricultural landscapes may be more effective if direct management of noisy miner populations is employed, given the strong negative influence of this species on the incidence of woodland-dependent birds among landscapes.","[Robertson, Oliver; Maron, Martine; Buckley, Yvonne; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Landscape Ecol & Conservat Grp, Brisbane, Qld 4067, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4067, Australia","Robertson, O (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Landscape Ecol & Conservat Grp, Brisbane, Qld 4067, Australia.",olyrobertson@gmail.com,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011; Buckley, Yvonne/B-1281-2008","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789; Buckley, Yvonne/0000-0001-7599-3201; McAlpine, Clive/0000-0003-0457-8144","Cotton CRCAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Birds Australia through the Stuart Leslie Bird Research Award",We thank the Robertson family and Andrew Hustwaite for assistance in the field.

The initial biomass varied as 0.33 and 0.22 mu g/ml for B. plicatilis and B. rotundiformis respectively. Experiments were performed at (25 +/- 1)degrees C. Population densities were enumerated and the medium was changed daily up to 8 d in the experiment. At the lowest food level tested, B. rotundiformis formed superior competitor than B. plicatilis, regardless of starting inoculation density. Generally when the food concentrations increased, B. plicatilis showed a greater increase in biomass than B. rotundiformis. B. rotundiformis formed the largest in population growth, regardless of increasing food concentrations. When grown alone, B. plicatilis reached peak abundances of (1.311 5 +/- 0.028) and (137.5 +/- 0.014) mu g/ml at low and high food densities respectively. The corresponding values of B. rotundiformis were 0.724 5 +/- 0.016 and 18.15 +/- 0.021. The adverse effects of B. rotundiformis on the peak abundances of B. plicatilis were observed at the lowest food level and higher initial density. The rate of population growth in controls varied from (0.792 +/- 0.162) to (1.482 +/- 0.132) mu m/d for B. plicatilis and (0.445 +/- 0.041) to (0.856 +/- 0.012) mu m/d for B. rotundiformis, depending on food level. When both species were introduced together, low food levels favoured higher abundance of B. rotundiformis than B. plicatilis, suggesting that increased population density of the smaller B. rotundiformis was more successfull than larger B. plicatilis in brackish waters. Our work reveals that available food (type and quantity) along with starting inoculation density had significant effect on the interspecific competition between marine sibling rotifer species in zooplankton community structure.","[Divya, S.

Resource competition and intra-guild predation (IGP) are important determinants of the structure of aphidophagous guilds. The likelihood and outcome of IGP is influenced by the density of extra-guild prey and the characteristics of the species involved. 2. The nature of intra-guild interactions between alien and indigenous coccinellids often determines the success of coccinellid invasions, as exemplified by Adalia bipunctata in Japan and Harmonia axyridis in North America and Europe. 3. Harmonia axyridis has negatively impinged on indigenous species in its introduced range, and its recent arrival in Britain poses a threat for members of native aphidophagous guilds. IGP and inter-specific competition between H. axyridis and British coccinellids are predicted to occur. However, the results of such interactions have been little studied. 4. Here we investigate the effects of different diets, designed to mimic possible conditions in the wild, on the survival, development, and adult size of H. axyridis and A. bipunctata. Results demonstrate a skew in the consequences of IGP between the two species: the supplementation of a limited aphid diet with non-conspecific eggs leads to a significant advantage for H. axyridis in respect of all parameters assessed, but gives no benefit to A. bipunctata. 5. We conclude that IGP of A. bipunctata by H. axyridis will contribute to the spread and increase of H. axyridis in Britain. 6. We further conclude that the skewed nature of IGP between A. bipunctata and H. axyridis at least in part explains the limited spread of A. bipunctata in Japan.","[Ware, Remy; Majerus, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England; [Yguel, Benjamin] ENFA, UMR Evolut & Diversite Biol 5174, Lab Agroecol, Castanet Tolosan, France","Ware, R (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England.",rlw29@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,50,44,47,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Because snails share similar diets, these interactions have been interpreted as the result of exploitative competition, but they could also result from intraguild predation. Here we present three experiments aimed at testing the hypothesis that interspecific interactions among three species of freshwater gastropod (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta and Stagnicola elodes) are mediated by intraguild egg predation. Foraging trials, conducted in a laboratory, showed that some snails readily prey on eggs, but the extent of egg predation depended on both the identity of the snail predator and the identity of the egg mass. Of the three species considered, Stagnicola had the largest effect on egg mortality and Physa had no effect on egg mortality. Foraging trials also showed that the eggs of Physa were the most vulnerable to predators and that the eggs of Stagnicola were largely invulnerable. A study conducted in large outdoor mesocosms assessed the occurrence of egg mortality in an environment of more extensive spatial scale and complexity. The results largely mirrored those of the laboratory study, with Stagnicola being the most voracious predator and the eggs of Physa being most vulnerable to predation. The reproductive success of Physa and Stagnicola raised in sympatry and allopatry was assessed in a mesocosm study conducted over three months. Recruitment of both species was depressed in sympatry, but patterns of growth in the survivors suggest contrasting mechanisms of suppression: Physa suppressed Stagnicola via exploitative competition, but Stagnicola suppressed Physa via egg predation. These experiments support the hypothesis that freshwater snail assemblages are structured by strong interspecific interactions and that a rich interplay of egg predation and interspecific competition underlie interactions among the members of this guild.","Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA","Turner, AM (corresponding author), Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA.",aturner@clarion.edu,,,,,,41,23,23,0,14,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2007,116,11,,,,,1895,1903,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15883.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,236BT,WOS:000251278700012,,,,,2021-09-21,

Using 16 spatially isolated live-coral reefs in the Bahamas, I examined how abundance of juvenile (recruit) and adult (non-recruit) fishes was affected by two factors: (1) structural habitat complexity and (2) the presence of predators and interference competitors. Manipulating the abundance of low and high complexity corals created two levels of habitat complexity, which was cross-factored with the presence or absence of resident predators (sea basses and moray eels) plus interference competitors (territorial damselfishes). Over 60 days, predators and competitors greatly reduced recruit abundance regardless of habitat complexity, but did not affect adult abundance. In contrast, increased habitat complexity had a strong positive effect on adult abundance and a weak positive effect on recruit abundance. Differential responses of recruits and adults may be related to the differential effects of habitat complexity on their primary predators. Sedentary recruits are likely most preyed upon by small resident predators that ambush prey, while larger adult fishes that forage widely and use reefs primarily for shelter are likely most preyed upon by large transient predators that chase prey. Increased habitat complexity may have inhibited foraging by transient predators but not resident predators. Results demonstrate the importance of habitat complexity to community dynamics, which is of concern given the accelerated degradation of habitats worldwide.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Almany, GR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Glenn.Almany@jcu.edu.au,,,,,,62,180,184,0,86,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2004,141,1,,,,,105,113,,10.1007/s00442-004-1617-0,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,849SC,WOS:000223560000012,15197644,,,,2021-09-21,

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Using a new factorial metaanalysis technique, we combined the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments to ask whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects and to compare the average effects of competition and predation. Across all studies, the effects of competition in the presence of predators were less than in the absence of predators, and the interaction between competition and predation for most response variables was statistically significant. Removal of competitors had much more positive effects on organisms' growth and mass than did exclusion of predators. Predator exclusion had much more beneficial effects on organisms' survival than did competition. The mean effects of competition and predation on density did not differ from one another. The results differed among trophic levels.

Observations during sample collection indicated that bullfrogs tended to be found in the water and green frogs tended to be on land within a few meters of the water's edge. This habitat difference was reflected in diet composition. The percentage of the diet composed of aquatic prey items was significantly higher for bullfrogs on three of four collection dates. Comparisons of adult and juvenile classes of the two species indicated interspecific diet similarity was negatively related to the body size difference between classes. Juvenile frogs were common in the diet of adult bullfrogs, but were almost never consumed by green frogs. The small size of frogs consumed by adult bullfrogs indicated that juvenile green frogs constituted the great majority of frogs eaten. Our results suggest that, because of differences in habitat and body size, the opportunity for substantial competition between these species is probably small, and is restricted to individuals of similar body size. The potential for predatory interactions, however, may be substantial, and is highly asymmetrical, with the interaction largely restricted to adult bullfrogs preying on juvenile green frogs.","DARTMOUTH COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,HANOVER,NH 03755","Werner, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,NAT SCI BLDG,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

The model that physicochemical conditions control the intertidal limits of establishment of seedlings was accepted for propagules stranding in the saltmarsh but rejected for those stranding on mudflats. No seedlings established on saltmarsh sediments but similar numbers of seedlings established within light gaps in adult mangrove stands and on intertidal mudflats. The model that interspecific interaction with freeliving macroalgae (Hormosira banksii) re-duces the establishment of seedlings on mudflats covered with macroalgae or in stands with a ground cover of macroalgae was accepted.

In the study area, Microtus densities fluctuated from ten to 100-fold and predator densities fluctuated more than ten-fold. M. epiroticus suffered more from predation than M. agrestis, probably because densities in M. epiroticus patches were higher than densities in M. agrestis patches making M. epiroticus more profitable prey for patch-searching predators. The proportion of M. epiroticus among all voles declined during the crash phase of the vole cycle, at least partly as a result of predation. Breeding female voles showed little spatial overlap and presumably competed for space at high densities. At low densities, interference competition through predators may have been more important than space competition. The proportion of the smaller species M. epiroticus in the total number of all voles increased rapidly with increasing vole densities. This could be due to more aggregated way of life which gives an advantage in competition for space. Predation reduced the time for space competition to short periods, and decreased periodically the proportion of the more successful competitor. Thus, the coexistence of the two vole species seemed to be predator-induced. In this sense predation was a more important factor.than interspecific competition.","UNIV TURKU,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,SF-20500 TURKU 50,FINLAND","NORRDAHL, K (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,P RAUTATIEKATU 13,SF-00100 HELSINKI 10,FINLAND.",,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,33,71,72,0,5,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1993,67,1,,,,,149,158,,10.2307/3545105,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KZ779,WOS:A1993KZ77900017,,,,,2021-09-21,

The communities consisted mainly of aquatic dipteran larvae. Community M was dominated by a filter feeder, Tripteroides tenax, which reached a high density despite a strongly aggregated distribution. Community K had five trophic groups: carrion feeders, filter feeders, detritus feeders, nipping predators and hooking predators, each including multiple species. The summed density of filter feeders in Community K remained much below the level attained by filter feeders in Community M. Niche differentiation within each trophic group with regard to pitcher age and feeding behaviour was not sufficient to allow species coexistence through niche separation alone. Aggregated distributions directly reduced interspecific encounters. Nevertheless, species belonging to the same trophic group commonly shared the same pitcher, because of high occurrence probabilities of dominant species and positive associations between some taxa (due mainly to similar occupancies by pitcher age). Predator coexistence in Community K may have been facilitated by self-limitation of the large predators through intraspecific cannibalism strengthened by aggregation. Prey coexistence, on the other hand, may have relied more on population suppression by predation, especially the selective removal of old instar Tripteroides.","UNIV MALAYA,DEPT ZOOL,KUALA LUMPUR 59100,MALAYSIA","MOGI, M (corresponding author), SAGA MED SCH,DEPT MICROBIOL,DIV PARASITOL,NABESHIMA,SAGA 849,JAPAN.",,"Yong, Hoi Sen/C-1548-2010","Yong, Hoi Sen/0000-0002-9832-8826",,,,64,40,41,1,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1992,90,2,,,,,172,184,,10.1007/BF00317174,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU052,WOS:A1992HU05200004,28313712,,,,2021-09-21,

The results of competition between the two species were asymmetrical. A. hendersoni larvae competed better against conspecifics than they did against A. triseriatus larvae. The reverse was true for A. triseriatus. Infection with Ascogregarina barretti (Vavra), a natural protozoan parasite of A. triseriatus, negatively affected development of A. hendersoni but had no effect on the natural host. Infected A. hendersoni larvae were more likely than uninfected larvae to compete poorly against A. triseriatus. Mortality of infected A. hendersoni was significantly higher than that of their uninfected counterparts, but infected survivors were not released from the effects of competition. Predation by fourth instar Anopheles barberi Coquillett was equal on prey larvae of both Aedes species. Surviving larvae were released from competition.

The influence of abundance measures, height, distance, and spatial arrangement of nonconiferous woody plants surrounding individual saplings was examined. Optimum neighborhood heights and radii were defined. The best interspecific competition index for predicting Douglas-fir height and stem diameter was total percent cover for all woody species within a 2.1-m radius. Visual estimates of neighbor cover were superior to objective measures of crown area. The cover of woody species equalling or exceeding the height of the tree provided the best prediction for tree height. Woody species cover equalling or exceeding one-half the height of the tree provided the best index for predicting stem diameter. Accounting for the spatial arrangement of neighboring woody plants did not improve the competition index. Interaction between the competition index and tree age indicated that the negative effect of interspecific competition on Douglas-fir size increased with time. The age-adjusted competition index accounted for 11% of the variation in height and 19% of the variation in stem diameter. Douglas-fir stem diameter was more sensitive to neighboring woody plants than was height.","OREGON STATE UNIV, COLL FORESTRY, DEPT FOREST SCI, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,51,81,82,0,15,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Interspecific prey competition and the degree of predator specialization are known to influence whether predators have competitive (i.e., (-,-)) or noncompetitive (i.e., (-,+) or (+,+)) indirect interactions. Much less is known about the population-level indirect interactions between pathogens that infect the same populations of host species. In this study, we use two-predator-two-prey and two-host-two-pathogen models to compare the indirect effects between predators with the indirect effects between pathogens. We focus on how the indirect interactions between pathogens are affected by the competitive abilities of susceptible and infected hosts, whether the pathogens are specialists or generalists, and the transmission pathway (direct vs. environmental transmission). In many cases, indirect effects between pathogens and predators follow similar patterns, for example, more positive indirect effects with increased interspecific competition between victim species. However, the indirect effects between pathogens can qualitatively differ, for example, more negative indirect effects with increased interspecific host competition. These contrasting patterns show that an important mechanistic difference between predatory and parasitic interactions (specifically, whether interactions are immediately lethal) can have important population-level effects on the indirect interactions between exploiters.","[Cortez, Michael H.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Duffy, Meghan A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Cortez, MH (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",cortez@bio.fsu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1748729, DEB-2015280]","We thank Patrick Clay and the reviewers for helpful comments on the paper.

At high latitudes, close to or beyond the polar circles, uninterrupted midsummer daylight may pose a challenge to the circadian rhythms of otherwise nocturnal species, such as eagle owls Bubo bubo. By non-invasive field methods, we studied eagle owl activity in light of their interactions with their main prey the water vole Arvicola amphibius, and their competitor the white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla during continuous midsummer daylight on open, treeless islands in coastal northern Norway. We evaluated circadian rhythms, temporal overlap, exposure, and spatial distribution. The owls maintained a nocturnal activity pattern, possibly because slightly dimmer light around midnight offered favourable hunting conditions. The eagles were active throughout the 24-h period as opposed to the strictly diurnal rhythm reported elsewhere, thus increasing temporal overlap and the potential for interference competition between the two avian predators. This may indicate an asymmetry, with the owls facing the highest cost of interference competition. The presence of eagles combined with constant daylight in this open landscape may make the owls vulnerable to interspecific aggression, and contrary to the available literature, eagle owls rarely exposed themselves visually during territorial calls, possibly to avoid detection by eagles. We found indications of spatial segregation between owls and eagles reflecting differences in main prey, possibly in combination with habitat-mediated avoidance. Eagle owl vocal activity peaked in the evening before a nocturnal peak in visual observations, when owls were active hunting, consistent with the hypothesis of a dusk chorus in nocturnal bird species. The owls may have had to trade-off between calling and foraging during the few hours around midnight when slightly dimmer light reduced the detection risk while also providing better hunting conditions","[Eriksen, Ane; Wabakken, Petter] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol Agr Sci & Biotechnol, Evenstad, Norway","Eriksen, A (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol Agr Sci & Biotechnol, Evenstad, Norway.",ane.eriksen@inn.no,"Eriksen, Ane/H-2773-2013","Eriksen, Ane/0000-0002-9073-8812",Norwegien Environment Agency; Inland Norway Univ. of Applied Sciences,This study was funded by the Norwegien Environment Agency and the Inland Norway Univ. of Applied Sciences.,,49,2,2,3,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

Several factors are known to affect the choice of oviposition site by aphidophagous hoverflies. The decisions of ovipositing females about where to lay their eggs are even more important in insects whose newly hatched offspring have limited dispersal ability, such as most aphidophages. In this study, we focused on the oviposition responses of two generalist aphidophagous syrphids (Eupeodes luniger and Episyrphus balteatus) toward host plant-aphid combinations differing in sinigrin content and the presence of intra- and interspecific competitors. The oviposition preference of Eupeodes luniger was significantly influenced in a reverse manner by the presence of intraguild competitors and also by the sinigrin content of host plants (P < 0.0001 for both factors). Likewise, the overall proportion of eggs laid by female Episyrphus balteatus was greater on aphids with relatively low levels of sinigrin.

We investigated determinants of ecological structure in a species assemblage of 4 closely related primate species of the family Cheirogaleidae (Microcebus berthae, Microcebus murinus, Cheirogaleus medius, Mirza coquereli) in western Madagascar by extensive line transect surveys across spatial and temporal heterogeneities with the specific goal of elucidating the mechanisms stabilizing competitive coexistence of the two mouse lemur species (Microcebus spp.). Results: Interspecific competition between the mouse lemurs was indicated by negative spatial associations in degraded habitat and by habitat partitioning along anthropogenic disturbance gradients during dry seasons with resource scarcity. In non-degraded habitat, intraguild predator M. coquereli, but not C. medius, was negatively associated with M. murinus on the population level, whereas its regional distribution overlapped spatially with that of M. berthae. The species' interspecific distribution pattern across spatial and temporal heterogeneities corresponded to predictions for agent-mediated coexistence and thus confirmed M. coquereli's stabilizing impact on the coexistence of mouse lemurs. Conclusions: Interspecific interactions contribute to ecological structure in this cheirogaleid assemblage and determinants vary across spatio-temporal heterogeneities. Coexistence of Microcebus spp. is stabilized by an agent-mediated spatial storage effect: M. coquereli creates refuges from competition for M. berthae in intact habitat, whereas anthropogenic environments provide M. murinus with an escape from resource competition and intraguild predation. Species persistence in the assemblage therefore depends on the conservation of habitat content and context that stabilizing mechanisms rely on. Our large-scale population level approach did not allow for considering all potential functional and stochastic drivers of ecological structure, a key limitation that accounts for the large proportion of unexplained variance in our models.","[Schaeffler, Livia; Kappeler, Peter M.] German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany; [Schaeffler, Livia] Univ Gottingen, Dept Ecoinformat Biometr & Forest Growth, Busgen Inst, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Saborowski, Joachim] Univ Gottingen, Dept Ecosystem Modelling, Busgen Inst, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Schaffler, L (corresponding author), German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany.",livia.schaeffler@mfn-berlin.de,,,German Primate Center (DPZ); Primate Conservation (PCI); Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation,"This study was completed with financial support from the German Primate Center (DPZ), Primate Conservation (PCI), Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation fund administered by Conservation International (CI), Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWTC) and with authorization by the CAFF/CORE committee and the National Association for the Management of Protected Areas (ANGAP).

However, the indirect effects of such biological interactions are poorly known because of the difficulties in measuring predation risk in nature. We addressed this issue by assessing the effect of asymmetrical competition among brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and two superior non-piscivorous competitors, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and white sucker (Catostomus commersonii), on the predation risk of a brook trout prey, northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos). We determined the spatio-temporal patterns of relative predation risk of dace with tethering experiments in 11 lakes containing either only brook trout and dace (n = 5), or brook trout, dace, chub, and sucker (n = 6). The diel pattern of the relative predation risk and the overall relative predation risk of dace were not significantly different in lakes with or without brook trout competitors. However, we observed a significant shift in the relative predation risk from the lower pelagic to the upper pelagic and littoral zones in the presence of brook trout competitors. This study highlights the fact that the outcome of interactions can vary in space and that care should be used when extrapolating the results of small-scale experiments or coarse-scale estimates to the whole ecosystem.","[Dupuch, Angelique; Bertolo, Andrea; Magnan, Pierre] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Interact Bassins Versants Ecosyst Aquat, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Dill, Lawrence M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Evolutionary & Behav Ecol Res Grp, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Dupuch, A (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",angelique.dupuch@uqo.ca,"Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019","Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163; Bertolo, Andrea/0000-0002-6018-816X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"We thank Julie Adams, Maryse Blanchette, Come Garceau, Annie Jacob, Kathy-Andree Laplante-Albert, Maxime Leveille, Rachel Massicotte, Aurore Perot, Daniel Pouliot, Raphael Proulx, Evelyne Roy, and Sylvain Theleme for their assistance at various stages of this research as well as Daniel Boisclair, Laure Devine, and Jim Grant for their comments on earlier versions of this paper.

This relationship is most evident at persistent kills where dominant competitors are attracted to both the carcass (as a free meal) and to the killers (as potential prey). Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are frequent victims of kleptoparasitism, and cubs, and sometimes adults, are killed by lions (Panthera leo) or spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Between 1980 and 2002, we observed 639 kills made by cheetahs in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. These kills were often visited by scavengers, including relatively innocuous species such as vultures and jackals and potentially dangerous species, like spotted hyenas and lions. We used cheetah behavior at kills to test a number of predictions about how cheetahs should minimize risk at kill sites given they face an increased risk of predation of themselves or their cubs. In particular, we examined the propensity of cheetahs of different age/sex classes to hide carcasses after making a kill, vigilance at kills, and the delay in leaving after finishing feeding with respect to ecological factors and scavenger presence. The behavior of single females at kills did not suggest that they were trying to avoid being killed, but the behavior of males, often found in groups, was in line with this hypothesis. In contrast, the behavior of mother cheetahs at kills appeared to be influenced greatly by the risk of cubs being killed. Our results suggest that cheetahs use several behavioral counterstrategies to avoid interspecific predation of self or cubs.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; Tanzania Wildlife Res Inst, Arusha, Tanzania","Hunter, JS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jshunter@ucdavis.edu,"Durant, Sarah M/AAB-9659-2019","Durant, Sarah M/0000-0003-0724-0878",,,,50,47,47,1,81,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Throughout much of their ranges, California mussels are far more abundant than are gooseneck barnacles and previous investigators have cited morphologic constraints and interactions between these species to explain this disparity. Surfbirds Aphriza virgata (Gmelin) and gulls, primarily western gull Larus occidentalis Audubon and glaucous-winged gull Larus glaucescens Naumann, occur each winter in flocks of greater-than-or-equal-to 40-100 individuals along the coast of California. On their wintering grounds, they feed almost exclusively in the intertidal zone and consume large numbers of gooseneck barnacles. A bird-exclusion experiment showed that winter feeding by shorebirds and gulls significantly reduced the abundance of Pollicipes barnacles in plots accessible to birds compared to plots from which birds had been excluded. However, predation by birds was found to be both spatially and temporally patchy. Predation by birds may account for the distribution and abundance of gooseneck barnacles along the coast of northern California.

It is spreading in south-west Iberia where it is the dominant corixid in pennanent, saline wetlands, where it may have excluded halotolerant native corixid species. In the Donana wetland complex in south-west Spain, it is abundant in temporary, brackish ponds but almost absent from temporary fresh ponds where the native S. lateralis is the dominant corixid. We conducted an outdoor experiment to test whether the alien is intolerant of low salinities, or if it can be competitively excluded by the native species S. lateralis. We established single species tanks for each species in semi-natural conditions, as well as mixed species tanks and controls lacking corixids. Trichocorixa verticalis was able to complete its life-cycle at a low salinity of 2 g/l. Compared to S. lateralis, it showed higher daily adult mortality and nymph production, but a shorter generation time. When mixed together, both species had lower adult mortality than in the alone treatment, suggesting they can coexist. Adult abundance at the end of the experiment was highest for T verticalis, which performed better in mixed tanks whereas S. lateralis performed better alone. These results confirm that T. verticalis can tolerate freshwaters and suggest that its rarity in these ponds in nature is due to other ecological factors such as dispersal limitation, poor adaptation to fluctuating water levels, or the effects of ectoparasitic water mites known to prefer the alien as a host.","[Carbonell, Jose Antonio; Cespedes, Vanessa; Green, Andy J.] EBD CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Coccia, Cristina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile; [Coccia, Cristina] Univ Santo Tomas, Santiago, Chile","Carbonell, JA (corresponding author), EBD CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",jcarbonell@ebd.csic.es; ecovanekimi@gmail.com; crcoccia@uc.cl; ajgreen@ebd.csic.es,"Cespedes, Vanessa/AAF-6316-2019; Green, Andy J/A-5189-2008","Cespedes, Vanessa/0000-0002-9399-8791; Green, Andy J/0000-0002-1268-4951","Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa, Junta de Andalucia project [P10-RNM-6262]; Programa Estatal de Promocion del Talento y su Empleabilidad en I+D+I -Juan de la Cierva-Formacion programme postdoc contract from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) [FJCI2017-31709]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN)Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [SVP-2013-067595]; Conicyt/Fondecyt Iniciation grant [11180668]","This research was supported by the Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa, Junta de Andalucia project (P10-RNM-6262) to AJG, a Programa Estatal de Promocion del Talento y su Empleabilidad en I+D+I -Juan de la Cierva-Formacion programme postdoc contract (FJCI2017-31709) from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) to JAC, a Severo Ochoa predoctoral contract (SVP-2013-067595) from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) to VC, and a Conicyt/Fondecyt Iniciation grant (11180668) to CC.",,39,3,3,0,0,REGIONAL EURO-ASIAN BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS CENTRE-REABIC,HELSINKI,"PL 3, HELSINKI, 00981, FINLAND",1798-6540,1818-5487,,AQUAT INVASIONS,Aquat.

Both species are known to compete directly through egg cannibalism and indirectly through the density-dependent release of allelopathic chemicals. To better characterize these indirect interactions, recent work has focused on quantifying the per-capita effects of intraspecific chemical competition. However, the effects of interspecific chemical competition in this system have not previously been estimated. We used experimental microcosms to examine how interspecific chemical secretions affected the reproductive activity and development time of laboratory populations of T. castaneum and T. confusum. We created replicated habitats containing flour medium that had been occupied and chemically 'conditioned' by one of the two beetle species across a range of densities, then examined how beetles of the other species responded in terms of the number of eggs laid by females and, separately, the development time of offspring. We found that T. castaneum fecundity was reduced when beetles experienced flour conditioned by T. confusum. In contrast, fecundity of T. confusum was largely unaffected by flour conditioned by T. castaneum. Additionally, we found that interspecific conditioning decreased development times for beetles of both species, particularly the development of larvae to pupae. Our results indicate that interspecific chemical competition impacts the life history of Tribolium species and suggests that models incorporating chemical competition may more accurately describe the biology of flour beetle communities.","[Bullock, Marissa; Legault, Geoffrey; Melbourne, Brett A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Legault, Geoffrey] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Coker Hall,120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Legault, G (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.; Legault, G (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Coker Hall,120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",legault@unc.edu,,"Legault, Geoffrey/0000-0003-2136-587X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1457660],"M.B. and G.L. conceived of the project.

We conducted a multilandscape analysis of two widely distributed, threatened large carnivore competitors to offer insight into coexistence strategies and assist with species-level conservation. We evaluated how interference competition affects occupancy, temporal activity and population density of a dominant competitor, the lion (Panthera leo), and its subordinate competitor, the leopard (Panthera pardus). We collected camera-trap data over 3years in 10 study sites covering 5,070km(2). We used multispecies occupancy modelling to assess spatial responses in varying environmental and prey conditions and competitor presence, and examined temporal overlap and the relationship between lion and leopard densities across sites and years. Results showed that both lion and leopard occupancy was independent ofrather than conditional ontheir competitor's presence across all environmental covariates. Marginal occupancy probability for leopard was higher in areas with more bushy, hideable habitat, human (tourist) activity and topographic ruggedness, whereas lion occupancy decreased with increasing hideable habitat and increased with higher abundance of very large prey. Temporal overlap was high between carnivores, and there was no detectable relationship between species densities. Lions pose a threat to the survival of individual leopards, but they exerted no tractable influence on leopard spatial or temporal dynamics. Furthermore, lions did not appear to suppress leopard populations, suggesting that intraguild competitors can coexist in the same areas without population decline. Aligned conservation strategies that promote functioning ecosystems, rather than target individual species, are therefore advised to achieve cost- and space-effective conservation.","[Miller, Jennifer R.

The consequences of omnivory have been studied theoretically, but empirical studies are still lacking. Omnivory is nevertheless common in nature and omnivorous predators coexist with specialists in many ecosystems, even when they are intraguild predators. This type of association is also common in agroecosystems in which biological control strategies are used. Our study provides an example of the outcome of such an association in the context of biological control of the invasive pest Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera) in a tomato agroecosystem. The two natural enemies involved, that is, a specialist (Stenomesius japonicus (Hymenoptera) parasitoid) and an omnivore (Macrolophus pygmaeus (Hemiptera) predator), were able to coexist for 3months in our experimental cages in the absence of metacommunity mechanisms (i.e., emigration and recolonization), contrary to theoretical expectations. However, they negatively affected each other's population dynamics. We found that spatial resource segregation was not a mechanism that promoted their coexistence. Regarding pest control, the specialist and omnivorous natural enemies were found to exhibit complementary functional traits, leading to the best control when together. Mechanisms that may have promoted the coexistence of the two species as well as consequences with regard to the inoculative biological control program are discussed.","[Chailleux, Anais] ISRA UCAD IRD, Biopass, Dakar, Senegal; [Chailleux, Anais] CIRAD, UPR HortSys, Montpellier, France; [Chailleux, Anais] InVivo AgroSolut, Paris, France; [Droui, Anthony; Bearez, Philippe; Desneux, Nicolas] Univ Cote dAzur, INRA French Natl Inst Agr Res, CNRS, UMR 1355 7254,Inst Sophia Agrobiotech, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France","Chailleux, A (corresponding author), IRD Joint Res Ctr, Biopass, Dakar, Senegal.",chailleux.anais@gmail.com,"Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013","Chailleux, Anais/0000-0001-5653-8019",ANRTFrench National Research Agency (ANR); InVivo AgroSolutions; French Ministry of Agriculture [10063]; CASDAR project [10063],"ANRT; InVivo AgroSolutions; French Ministry of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 10063; CASDAR project, Grant/Award Number: 10063",,80,10,11,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

These interactions are usually asymmetrical as larger predators dominate in aggressive encounters. Smaller predators are forced to balance the conflicting demands of obtaining food while reducing the risk of a confrontation. We tested the behavioural responses of 16 wild captured stoats (Mustela erminea) to the presence of a feral cat (Felis catus) and a ferret (Mustela furo), which we refer to as larger predators due to their superior body size. Stoats were released individually into an outdoor arena and nocturnal activities were recorded on infra-red video cameras. On treatment nights, one of the larger predators was placed inside a segregated holding cage on one side of the arena, while an empty cage was placed on the opposite side as a control. A stoat's daily food allocation was divided into two equal portions, one placed in front of each holding cage to form a food patch. Stoats' perception of risk was assessed by comparing behaviour in the risky patch (close to the caged predator) versus the safe patch (close to the empty cage). Stoats harvested less food at the risky patch. They avoided the area containing the larger predator, both spatially and temporally, and increased vigilance at the risky patch. The results show that stoats alter their foraging behaviour due to perceived interference competition when they encounter larger predators. Understanding trophic interactions between invasive species will help to inform conservation decisions and maximise the effectiveness of management intervention.","[Garvey, Patrick M.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Glen, Alistair S.; Pech, Roger P.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",pgar874@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,"Glen, Al/0000-0002-7777-7630","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE); University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship","We wish to thank Mick Clout, Manpreet K.

Not only can carnivores influence prey community composition, they might also impact the populations of other carnivores. The goal of the current study was to assess the role of IGP and IK as significant forces influencing carnivoran assemblages in South America. To this end, we compiled the available records on 35 species of terrestrial carnivorans in the subcontinent, to investigate the potential and actual extent of IGP/IK as widespread ecological forces. We considered potential intraguild predators those having > 20 % range overlap and body mass 2-5.4 times greater than that of other guild members and likely-potential intraguild predators those that, in addition, were also hypercarnivorous. The potential number of intraguild predators for those species evaluated ranged from zero to 18 (mean = 5.35 +/- SE 0.74). IGP/IK events (n = 116) included 52 pairs of Neotropical carnivorans, 13 of which were killers and 25 were victims. Confirmed intraguild predator species (n = 13) accounted for 37.1 % of the assemblage, nearly the same value predicted to be likely potential predators (n = 14). IGP and IK were highly associated with the hypercarnivorous felids, whereas victim species were most often the omnivorous procyonids and skunks. The results indicate jaguars, pumas, and ocelots as the species most likely to have significant impact on the guild. IGP and IK are not random and reflect widespread interactions that influence carnivoran community structure in South America.","[de Oliveira, Tadeu G.] Univ Estadual Maranhao, Dept Biol, BR-65055150 Sao Luis, MA, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Tadeu G.] Inst Procarnivoros, BR-65076270 Sao Luis, MA, Brazil; [Pereira, Javier A.] Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Div Mastozool, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","de Oliveira, TG (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maranhao, Dept Biol, Cidade Univ Paulo 6,CP 09, BR-65055150 Sao Luis, MA, Brazil.",tadeu4@yahoo.com; javipereira@yahoo.com,"Oliveira, Tadeu/M-6095-2016","Oliveira, Tadeu/0000-0002-8760-3159; Pereira, Javier A/0000-0002-0346-739X",,,,87,58,62,1,82,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1064-7554,1573-7055,,J MAMM EVOL,J.

It is therefore tempting to assume that they might be involved in a competitive interaction, with potential implications for the habitat use and growth of brown trout (Salmo trutta). We conducted artificial-stream experiments to test whether a putative competitor, Alpine bullhead (Cottus poecilopus), had an effect on the habitat use of under-yearling (0+) and yearling (1+) trout. We hypothesised that (i) 1+ trout would be competitively superior to 0+ trout, forcing the younger fish to suboptimal habitats, and that (ii) bullhead might affect the habitat use and prey selection of 0+ trout but less so that of 1+ trout. Against our predictions, no effect of bullhead was found on the habitat use of either age class of brown trout. Instead, yearling trout seemed to force bullheads to suboptimal microhabitats with high current velocities. Presence of yearlings also decreased the growth of under-yearling fish and caused a shift in their diet composition. These findings suggest that competitive interactions may not limit the coexistence of brown trout and bullheads in boreal rivers. Intraspecific interactions between trout age classes may be more important, with potentially detrimental effects on the growth and overwintering success of 0+ trout.","[Louhi, Pauliina; Muotka, Timo] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Louhi, Pauliina; Maki-Petays, Aki] Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Huusko, Ari] Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, FIN-88300 Paltamo, Finland; [Muotka, Timo] Finnish Environm Inst, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland","Louhi, P (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, PL 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",pauliina.louhi@oulu.fi,,,Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank the late Petri Kreivi, who gave a great effort in collecting the data used in this study.

In order to understand the influence of interspecific competition on food caching behavior of sympatric rodents, we investigated food hoarding patterns of two sympatric rodent species, buff-breasted rat (Rattus flavipectus) and Chinese white-bellied rat (Niviventor confucianus), and compared their responses and adjustment in hoarding behavior under interspecific competition. The results showed that: (1) the buff-breasted rat larder hoarded seeds only, while Chinese white-bellied rat hoarded seeds in both larder and scatter forms: (2) two species of rodents both larder hoarded more seeds when competitors were present: and (3) the Chinese white-bellied rats adjusted their seed hoarding from scatter to larder when competitors were introduced, which reduced the seed availability. Therefore, we concluded that rodents would adjust their food hoarding strategy when interspecific competitors were present, and this may produce a different effect on the fate of seeds and the recruitment of plants.

Food-resource and competition/predation mechanisms are among the most influential factors controlling population ecology. Balancing the effects of bottom-up control by food resources and top-down control by competition/predation can trigger compensatory responses leading to changes in species ecology within the limit of their plasticity. These effects have been well studied in simple controlled conditions, but predicting their outcome is difficult for natural populations in genuine ecosystems because of the heterogeneity of environmental conditions and the complexity of biotic interactions. We investigated the ecological response in terms of feeding habits and population parameters of the stream-dwelling predator, Siphonoperla torrentium, to modifications of its prey abundance and of competition/predation mechanisms induced by a gradient of acidification. We conducted a 1-y survey in a set of 3 streams showing very similar abiotic conditions except for their acidification status. Despite significantly lower potential prey availability and higher potential intraspecific competition in the most acidic stream compared to neutral streams, the proportion of prey in the diet of S. torrentium did not differ across streams. However, S. torrentium was less aggregated, and had higher secondary production, longer larval development, and smaller adult size in the most acidic stream than in the less acidic streams, results suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Our study design did not permit us to differentiate the importance of the biotic factors involved, but the study contributes to our understanding of the importance of conjugated biotic effects on population ecology.","[Tixier, Guillaume] Environm Canada, Natl Water Res Inst, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada; [Felten, Vincent; Guerold, Francois] Univ Metz, Lab Interact Ecotoxicol Biodiversite Ecosyst, UFR Sci FA, F-57070 Metz, France","Tixier, G (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Natl Water Res Inst, 867 Lakeshore Rd,POB 5050, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada.",gtvoi@hotmail.com; vincent.felten@univ-metz.fr; guerold@univ-metz.fr,,"FELTEN, Vincent/0000-0003-2601-7225",,,,65,3,4,0,25,SOC FRESWATER SCIENCE,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710 USA",2161-9565,,,FRESHW SCI,Freshw.

These interaction types may overlap and vary with the season and life-history state of individuals. We studied effects of competition and potential nest predation by common shrews (Sorex araneus) on lactating bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in two seasons. The species coexist and may interact aggressively. Additionally, shrews can prey on nestling voles. We studied bank vole mothers' spatial and temporal adaptations to shrew presence during summer and autumn. Further, we focused on fitness costs, e.g. decreased offspring survival, which bank voles may experience in the presence of shrews. In summer, interference with shrews decreased the voles' home ranges and they spent more time outside the nest, but there were no effects on offspring survival. In autumn, we found decreased offspring survival in enclosures with shrews, potentially due to nest predation by shrews or by increased competition between species. Our results indicate a shift between interaction types depending on seasonal constraints. In summer, voles and shrews seem to interact mainly by interference, whereas resource competition and/or nest predation by shrews gain importance in autumn. Different food availability, changing environmental conditions and the energetic constraints in voles and shrews later in the year may be the reasons for the varying combinations of interaction types and their increasing effects on the inclusive fitness of bank voles. Our study provides evidence for the need of studies combining life history with behavioural measurements and seasonal constraints.","[Liesenjohann, Monique; Liesenjohann, Thilo; Eccard, Jana A.] Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Trebaticka, Lenka; Haapakoski, Marko; Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Trebaticka, Lenka; Haapakoski, Marko; Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Metapopulat Res Grp, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Liesenjohann, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",monique.liesenjohann@uni-potsdam.de,,"Haapakoski, Marko/0000-0003-0901-6319",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [ec361/4-1],This study was supported by the German Science Foundation (grand to JAE ec361/4-1).,,74,17,17,0,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

In single species rearing, the number of larvae of both species decreased during the latter developmental stages, mainly due to cannibalism. When prey was abundant, the survival of both species improved; however, in mixed species rearing, the mortality of C. septempunctata brucki due to cannibalism or intraguild predation was higher than in single species rearing, whereas the mortality was lower in H. axyridis. Consequently, the survival of C. septempunctata brucki decreased while that of H. axyridis improved. In addition, in the 18 intraguild predation events observed, H. axyridis was always the intraguild predator and C. septempunctata brucki was its prey. Thus, when these two species co-exist in the field, H. axyridis is likely to be an important intraguild predator of C septempunctata brucki. In addition, when prey is scarce, it is likely that cannibalism and intraguild predation become more important factors in the intra and interspecific relationships of these two species.","[Sato, Satoru; Shinya, Katsuhiro; Yasuda, Hironori] Yamagata Univ, Dept Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan; [Kindlmann, Pavel] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Dixon, Anthony F.

It is less known that prey can also kill vulnerable predator stages that present no danger to the prey. Since adult predators are expected to avoid places where their offspring would run a high predation risk, this opens the way for potential prey to deter dangerous predator stages by killing vulnerable predator stages. We present an example of such a complex predator-prey interaction. We show that (1) the vulnerable stage of an omnivorous arthropod prey discriminates between eggs of a harmless predator species and eggs of a dangerous species, killing more eggs of the latter; (2) prey suffer a minor predation risk from newly hatched predators; (3) adult predators avoid ovipositing near killed predator eggs, and (4) vulnerable prey near killed predator eggs experience an almost fourfold reduction of predation. Hence, by attacking the vulnerable stage of their predator, prey deter adult predators and thus reduce their own predation risk. This provides a novel explanation for the killing of vulnerable stages of predators by prey and adds a new dimension to anti-predator behaviour.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Sect Populat Biol, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Sect Populat Biol, POB 94084, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Janssen@science.uva.nl,"S., Magalhaes/B-9673-2012; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","S., Magalhaes/0000-0002-8609-7768; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,21,53,54,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

The purpose of this study was to examine this phenomenon. We tested the effects of an abiotic factor (pH) and two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition) on survival and growth to metamorphosis by larvae of two anurans (Hyla gratiosa and Hyla femoralis) in outdoor tanks. Two levels of pH (4.5 and 6.0) and three levels of density (0, 30, or 60 embryos per 580 L tank) of each species were arranged in a fractional factorial design and replicated three times. Larvae of H. gratiosa exhibited typical patterns of intraspecific density-dependent responses: as density increased, survival and size at metamorphosis decreased and larval period increased. The interactions of the abiotic factor and the biotic factors were complex in this experiment. The addition of H. femoralis at high pH caused decreased survival and increased larval period of H. gratiosa, but at low pH these negative effects were not detected. Variation in pH had no effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa. Interspecific competition from H. femoralis caused decreased size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa only at the high initial densities. Some of the responses of H. femoralis were different than those of H. gratiosa. In this species, intraspecific competition affected only the size at metamorphosis. Low pH increased the survival of H. femoralis, but had no effect by itself on any other trait. Increased conspecific density and pH interacted only in their effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. femoralis. Interspecific competition resulted in decreased size at metamorphosis but only increased larval period at the high initial densities. Interspecific competition at the high density interacted with pH to increase survival and size at metamorphosis at low pH in contrast to those results at high pH. Overall, the larval period was the response most strongly affected in H. gratiosa while for H. femoralis the size at metamorphosis was the most strongly affected. Hyla gratiosa had more negative impact on H. femoralis than vice versa. This may be due to the larger body size of H. gratiosa. Low pH enabled H. femoralis to compete more effectively, because the negative impact of H. gratiosa was lessened.

I tested for interspecific competition between these two species during a drought year when primary productivity in the prairie was unusually low. In late June 1989, 1 transferred young nymphs of P. nebrascensis among enclosed plots (each 550-900 m2) to produce three pairs of plots with grasshoppers removed or added. Pretransfer densities in the six plots were estimated at 6 nymphS/m2. Experimental transfers resulted in densities of P. nebrascensis in addition plots 2-3 times as large as in paired removal plots; significant differences in density between addition and removal plots persisted throughout the summer. Densities of O. speciosa in plots with P. nebrascensis removed or added did not differ significantly throughout the growing season of 1989, nor in early summer of 1990. Furthermore, growth and development of O. speciosa in these plots (as measured by rate of maturation, and adult femur length and mass in 1989) were not reduced in the presence of high densities of P. nebrascensis, nor was reproductive potential (measured as the ratio of young nymphs present in early summer 1990 to adults in late summer 1989). These results are similar to those of a previous experiment at the same site during 1987 when primary productivity was moderate. Even under the extreme conditions of 1989, with particularly high ratios of grasshoppers to available food resources, variation in P. nebrascensis density did not adversely affect populations of O. speciosa. These results contrast with recent results for sedentary phytophagous insects, but are consistent with the hypothesis that free-ranging insect herbivores may rarely experience interspecific competition for food resources.",,"EVANS, EW (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,LOGAN,UT 84322, USA.",,,,,,,49,25,32,0,17,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1992,73,3,,,,,1038,1044,,10.2307/1940178,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU767,WOS:A1992HU76700028,,,,,2021-09-21,

While the use of free water is influenced by physiological factors (e.g., species-specific water requirements, moisture in forage, temperature), nonphysiological factors, such as habitat characteristics and interspecific interactions, are also important. In fact, for species of concern, interspecific interactions and habitat can be important factors influencing their spatial and temporal use of the landscape and its resources. The kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) is a small carnivore considered to be a species of concern over much of its range, and two of the most important conservation challenges it faces are related to (1) habitat and (2) predation/competition by intraguild species. Our objective was to determine the influence of habitat characteristics, predators (bobcats [Lynx rufus], coyotes [Canis latrans]), and potential competitors (badgers [Taxidea taxus], gray foxes [Urocyon cinereoargenteus]) on the use of water by kit foxes. From June to September 2010-2012, we used remote cameras to monitor carnivores at 63 water sources in the Mojave Desert. We used zero-inflated mixed-effects models and a two-stage model selection analysis to evaluate the influence of habitat, predators, and competitors on spatial visits to water by kit foxes. We also assessed temporal avoidance of intraguild predators and competitors by kit foxes at water sources using a coefficient of overlap. We found that visual obscurity, overhead canopy cover, badgers, and coyotes influenced spatial visits of kit foxes. In addition, kit foxes exhibited strong temporal overlap with badgers and bobcats, moderate temporal overlap with gray foxes, and weak temporal overlap with coyotes. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the spatial and temporal use of water sources by kit foxes is dynamic, depending on habitat characteristics and the activity of intraguild predators and competitors.","[Hall, Lucas K.] Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA; [Larsen, Randy T.; McMillan, Brock R.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Knight, Robert N.] US Army Dugway Proving Ground, Environm Programs, Dugway, UT 84022 USA","Hall, LK (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",lhall12@csub.edu,,,Utah Division of Wildlife Resources [106298]; Utah Chapter of The Wildlife Society,"We would like to thank R.

This relationship is characterized by the fact that the prey species promotes the growth of the predator species which in turn inhibits the growth of the first species. The model is a three-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. With the same dilution rates, the model can be reduced to a planar system where the two models have the same local and even global behavior. The existence and stability conditions of all steady states of the reduced model in the plane are determined according to the operating parameters. Using the nullcline method, we present a geometric characterization of the existence and stability of all equilibria showing the multiplicity of coexistence steady states. The bifurcation diagrams illustrate that the steady states can appear or disappear only through saddle-node or transcritical bifurcations. Moreover, the operating diagrams describe the asymptotic behavior of this system by varying the control parameters and show the effect of the inhibition of predation on the emergence of the bistability region and the reduction until the disappearance of the coexistence region by increasing this inhibition parameter.","[Mtar, Tahani; Fekih-Salem, Radhouane] Univ Tunis El Manar, Natl Engn Sch Tunis, LAMSIN, Tunis 1002, Tunisia; [Fekih-Salem, Radhouane] Univ Monastir, Higher Inst Comp Sci Mandia, Mandia 5111, Tunisia; [Sari, Tewfik] Univ Montpellier, INRAE, Inst Agro, ITAP, Montpellier, France","Fekih-Salem, R (corresponding author), Univ Tunis El Manar, Natl Engn Sch Tunis, LAMSIN, Tunis 1002, Tunisia.; Fekih-Salem, R (corresponding author), Univ Monastir, Higher Inst Comp Sci Mandia, Mandia 5111, Tunisia.",thani.mtar@gmail.com; radhouene.fekihsalem@isima.rnu.tn; tewfik.sari@inrae.fr,,"FEKIH-SALEM, Radhouane/0000-0003-1168-4930","Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Technology; Euro-Mediterranean research network TREASURE","The first author thanks the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Technology for financial support and INRAE for hosting her in Montpellier during the preparation of this work.

In contrast, species adapted to more predictable (i.e., low variation) and higher energy environments may evolve greater fecundity over a shorter and faster-growing life. We tested whether this known interspecific pattern also occurs within a species. We compared life history traits of the ringed seal (Pusa hispida) in the Canadian High Arctic to those closer to the southern limit of the species' circumpolar distribution. We found that northern seals grew slower than southern seals (Brody growth coefficient), achieved a greater asymptotic body weight (82 and 69kg vs. 74 and 54kg female and male, respectively), reached sexual maturity later (6.1years vs. 4.5 years), had lower fecundity (1.8 years vs. 1.3 years interbirth interval), longer average lifespan (5 years vs. 3 years median age), and greater movements (1,269 vs. 681km). Mating systems also likely differed with northern seals showing morphological evidence of a promiscuous mating system with potential sperm competition as indicated by greater relative testes size. The northern region was also characterized by more unpredictable environmental timing of seasonal events, such as spring sea ice breakup. Life history variation between the intraspecific groups of seals appears to agree with interspecific patterns and provides a better understanding of how species' life history parameters shift in concert with environmental conditions.","[Ferguson, Steven H.; Yurkowski, David J.; Young, Brent G.; Zhu, Xinhua] Dept Fisheries & Oceans Canada, 501 Univ Crescent, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Ferguson, Steven H.; Yurkowski, David J.; Willing, Cornelia] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Willing, Cornelia] Univ Manitoba, Ctr Earth Observat Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Zhu, Xinhua; Fisk, Aaron T.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Muir, Derek C.

Resolving this knowledge gap is important for predicting the potential influence of global warming on forests, particularly on high-altitude trees, which are more sensitive to warming. In the present study, effects of intra- and interspecific competition on plant growth and associated physiological, structural and chemical traits were investigated in Abies faxoniana and Picea purpurea seedlings under control (ambient temperature) and elevated temperature (ET, 2 degrees C above ambient temperature) conditions for 2 years. We found that A. faxoniana and P. purpurea grown under intra- and interspecific competition showed significant differences in dry matter accumulation (DMA), photosynthetic capacity, nutrient absorption, nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) contents and leaf ultrastructure under ET conditions. ET increased leaf, stem and root DMA of both conifers under both competition patterns. Moreover, under ET and interspecific competition, P. purpurea had overall superior competitive capacity characterized by higher organ (leaf, stem and root) and total DMA, height growth rate, net photosynthetic rate, specific leaf area, water use efficiency (delta C-13), leaf and root N and NSC concentrations and greater plasticity for absorption of different soil N forms. Thus, the growth of P. purpurea benefitted from the presence of A. faxoniana under ET. Our results demonstrated that ET significantly affects the asymmetric competition patterns in subalpine conifer species. Potential alteration of plant competitive interactions by global warming can influence the composition, structure and functioning of subalpine coniferous forests.","[Yu, Lei; Xia, Zhichao; Li, Chunyang] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Song, Mengya] Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Korpelainen, Helena] Univ Helsinki, Viikki Plant Sci Ctr, Dept Agr Sci, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Niinemets, Ulo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 1, EE-51006 Tartu, Estonia; [Niinemets, Ulo] Estonian Acad Sci, Kohtu 6, EE-10130 Tallinn, Estonia","Li, CY (corresponding author), Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",licy@hznu.edu.cn,"Niinemets, Ulo/A-3816-2008; Li, Chunyang/D-6254-2013; Song, Mengya/AAQ-3494-2020","Niinemets, Ulo/0000-0002-3078-2192; Song, Mengya/0000-0003-4272-6857; li, chun yang/0000-0003-2895-2786; Yu, Lei/0000-0002-5504-0259; Korpelainen, Helena/0000-0002-7046-6995; Zhi-Chao, Xia/0000-0001-6715-8986",Talent Program of the Hangzhou Normal University [2016QDL020],This work was supported by the Talent Program of the Hangzhou Normal University (2016QDL020).,,94,10,10,14,105,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2019,39,8,,,,,1342,1357,,10.1093/treephys/tpz044,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,JH8ZC,WOS:000493055600007,30977829,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

However, communities include species in different trophic levels, and it is not yet known how the trophic level of the receiver influences the informative value of a call. Furthermore, no empirical study has yet tested how increased competition may influence the value of alarm calls for distinct receivers. Here, we identify the importance of alarm calls emitted by a small owl, the little owl (Athene noctua), on the structure of a cavity-nesting bird community including mesopredators and primary prey under variable levels of competition for nest holes. Competitors sharing top predators with the callers and prey of the callers interpreted alarm and non-alarm calls differently. Competitors chose preferentially alarm and non-alarm patches over control patches to breed, while prey selected alarm patches. In contrast, competition for nest sites affected habitat selection of prey species more than that of competitors of the callers. This study provides support for a changing value of alarm calls and competition for nest sites for distinct receivers related to niche overlapping among callers and eavesdroppers, therefore, calling attention to possible cascading effects by the use of information in natural communities.","[Parejo, Deseada] Univ Extremadura, Dept Anat Cellular Biol & Zool, Badajoz 06006, Spain; [Parejo, Deseada; Aviles, Jesus M.; Exposito-Granados, Monica] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria 04120, Spain","Parejo, D (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Anat Cellular Biol & Zool, Badajoz 06006, Spain.; Parejo, D (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria 04120, Spain.",dparejo@unex.es,"Exposito-Granados, Monica/K-1863-2019; Aviles, Jesus/K-3332-2014; Parejo, Deseada/L-3953-2014","Exposito-Granados, Monica/0000-0002-7996-2469; Aviles, Jesus/0000-0002-1463-8393; Parejo, Deseada/0000-0002-7368-2378","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Government of Extremadura [TA13002]","We are grateful to Jukka Forsman and Mikko Mokkonen for constructive and helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Here, we tested the hypotheses that (a) exotic woody shrubs would be superior belowground competitors for nitrogen in heterogeneous soil resulting from key aspects of root architecture and (b) larger plants would be superior belowground competitors. We tested these hypotheses using two native shrubs, Rubus allegheniensis and Viburnum dentatum, and two invasive exotic shrubs, Rubus phoenicolasius and Berberis thunbergii, all four of which can become abundant in plant communities in the eastern United States. We grew replicate plants from each species with interspecific competitors, with intraspecific competitors, and individually in a randomized layout in a greenhouse in two temporal blocks. Each experimental container had a central soil patch amended with N-15-labeled litter. We measured above-and belowground growth, root morphology, and nitrogen uptake to assess the effects of intra-and interspecific competition on plant growth and nitrogen uptake. All species grew better in the second temporal block, but we did not detect any differences in the competitive ability or root traits for exotic versus native species; rather, plant size was the key trait that predicted competitive effects. Both Rubus species, which capitalized on the extended growing season offered by our greenhouse conditions, were stronger competitors and typically larger plants than B. thunbergii and V. dentatum. Both Rubus species exerted measurable competitive effects on other species, resulting in decreased aboveground size of competitors by 50% or more relative to control plants, but did not routinely decrease N-15 uptake or root biomass of competitors. When competing with Rubus, leaf C:N ratios of all species except R. phoenicolasius were greater than when grown alone, suggesting that large Rubus plants did decrease the total nitrogen available to competitors. Our data suggest that belowground competitive ability in shrubs may be more closely associated with plant size and growth rate than plant origin. In addition, plant species that exhibit plastic growth phenology, such as those in the genus Rubus, may gain a competitive advantage during years with warmer autumn months by extending their growing seasons, facilitating their invasion and establishment in new habitats.","[Faillace, Cara A.; Caplan, Joshua S.; Grabosky, Jason C.; Morin, Peter J.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Caplan, Joshua S.] Temple Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Hort, Ambler, PA 19002 USA","Faillace, CA (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",c.faillace@gmail.com,"Caplan, Joshua S/AAF-2831-2019","Caplan, Joshua S/0000-0003-4624-2956; Faillace, Cara/0000-0002-9850-4957; Grabosky, Jason/0000-0003-4226-2888",United States Department of Agriculture-NIFA's Biology of Weedy & Invasive Species program [2009-35900-06016],"Many Rutgers University undergraduate students assisted with data collection.

Both experiments and quantitative modeling are fundamental to the design of sustainable agroecosystems and the optimization of crop production. We modeled communities of perennial crop mixtures by using a generalized Lotka-Volterra model, i.e., a model such that the interspecific interactions are more general than purely competitive. We estimated model parameters -carrying capacities and interaction coefficients- from, respectively, the observed biomass of monocultures and bicultures measured in a large diversity experiment of seven perennial forage species in Iowa, United States. The sign and absolute value of the interaction coefficients showed that the biological interactions between species pairs included amensalism, competition, and parasitism (asymmetric positive-negative interaction), with various degrees of intensity. We tested the model fit by simulating the combinations of more than two species and comparing them with the polycultures experimental data. Overall, theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experiments. Using this model, we also simulated species combinations that were not sown. From all possible mixtures (sown and not sown) we identified which are the most productive species combinations. Our results demonstrate that a combination of experiments and modeling can contribute to the design of sustainable agricultural systems in general and to the optimization of crop production in particular.","[Halty, Virginia; Valdes, Matias; Fort, Hugo] Univ Republica, Inst Fis, Fac Ciencias, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Tejera, Mauricio; Picasso, Valentin] Univ Republica, Dept Sistemas Ambientales & Prod Anim & Pasturas, Fac Agron, Garzon 780, Montevideo 12900, Uruguay; [Picasso, Valentin] Univ Wisconsin, Agron Deptartment, 1575 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Halty, V (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Inst Fis, Fac Ciencias, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay.",vhalty@fisica.edu.uy,"Tejera, Mauricio/AAQ-6973-2020","Tejera, Mauricio/0000-0003-1698-0501",ANII-INNOVAGRO [FSA 1-2013-1-13162]; ANII-SNI,"We thank Dr. Michael Huston, Subject Matter Editor of Ecological Applications, John Pastor and one anonymous referee for their insightful and helpful comments, which contributed to improve the quality of this paper.

The zonation occurring along elevation gradients, or at bioclimatic contact zones, offers a good opportunity to improve such understanding because the small scale at which the partitioning occurs facilitates inference based on experiments and ecological modelling. We studied the influence of abiotic gradients, habitat types, and interspecific competition in determining the spatial turnover between two pipit and two bunting species in NW Spain. We explored two independent lines of evidence to draw inference about the relative importance of environment and biotic interactions in driving range partitioning along elevation, latitude, and longitude. We combined occurrence data with environmental data to develop joint species distribution models (JSDM), in order to attribute co-occurrence (or exclusion) to shared (or divergent) environmental responses and to interactions (attraction or exclusion). In the same region, we tested for interference competition by means of playback experiments in the contact zone. The JSDMs highlighted different responses for the two species pairs, although we did not find direct evidence of interspecific aggressiveness in our playback experiments. In pipits, partitioning was explained by divergent climate and habitat requirements and also by the negative correlations between species not explained by the environment. This significant residual correlation may reflect forms of competition others than direct interference, although we could not completely exclude the influence of unmeasured environmental predictors. When bunting species co-occurred, it was because of shared habitat preferences, and a possible limitation to dispersal might cause their partitioning. Our results indicate that no single mechanism dominates in driving the distribution of our study species, but rather distributions are determined by the combination of many small forces including biotic and abiotic determinants of niche, whose relative strengths varied among species.","[Bastianelli, Giulia; Laiolo, Paola] Univ Oviedo, PA, CSIC, Res Unit Biodivers UO, Mieres, Spain; [Wintle, Brendan A.; Martin, Elizabeth H.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Seoane, Javier] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Terr Ecol Grp, Dept Ecol, Madrid, Spain","Bastianelli, G (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, PA, CSIC, Res Unit Biodivers UO, Mieres, Spain.",bastianelligiulia.uo@uniovi.es,"Laiolo, Paola/Q-3747-2019; Seoane, Javier/B-6833-2008; Laiolo, Paola/B-6566-2014","Laiolo, Paola/0000-0002-2009-6797; Seoane, Javier/0000-0001-9975-4846; Laiolo, Paola/0000-0002-2009-6797; wintle, brendan/0000-0002-4234-5950","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [BES-2012-053472, CGL2008-02749, CGL2011-28177, CGL2014-53899-P]; Fundacion BiodiversidadEuropean Commission; ARCAustralian Research Council [FT100100819]; REMEDINAL3-CM [P2013/MAE-2719]","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: BES-2012-053472, CGL2008-02749, CGL2011-28177 and CGL2014-53899-P; Fundacion Biodiversidad; ARC Future Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: FT100100819; REMEDINAL3-CM, Grant/Award Number: P2013/MAE-2719",,71,9,9,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Using molecular gut-content analysis, we investigated the relative frequencies of IGP by H. axyridis on the predatory flowerbug Anthocoris nemoralis Fabricius (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) and prey overlap for a shared prey, the lime aphid Eucallipterus tiliae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae), in Tilia x europaea crowns in urban parks. The frequency of IGP by H. axyridis was low: 2.7 % of larvae and 3.4 % of adults tested positive for A. nemoralis DNA. The presence of lime aphid DNA in predators was higher: 56.5 and 47.9 % of H. axyridis larvae and adults, respectively, contained E. tiliae DNA, whereas 60.8 % of adult A. nemoralis tested positive for aphid DNA. Incorporating insect densities revealed that the density of H. axyridis larvae had a strong negative effect on the likelihood of detecting aphid DNA in A. nemoralis. Prey overlap for E. tiliae was widespread in space (2-13 m height in tree crowns) and time (May-October 2011) which suggests that interspecific exploitative competition, mediated by predator life-stage, more so than IGP, is an important indirect trophic interaction between co-occurring H. axyridis and A. nemoralis. Whether exploitative competition equates to displacement of A. nemoralis populations requires further investigation. Our results emphasize the need to incorporate indirect interactions in studies of insect communities following invasion, not least because they potentially affect more species than direct interactions alone.","[Howe, Andy G.; Ravn, Hans Peter] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Pipper, Christian Bressen] Univ Copenhagen, Biostat Sect, Dept Publ Hlth, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Aebi, Alexandre] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Lab Biol Sol, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland","Howe, AG (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",andy@ign.ku.dk,"; Howe, Andrew/A-8259-2015","Pipper, Christian Bressen/0000-0003-0261-616X; Howe, Andrew/0000-0002-7460-5227",University of Copenhagen; Villum Fonden,"We are grateful to Lars Skipper (www.miridae.dk) for verifying the identity of mirids and EWH BioProduction ApS for provision of A. nemoralis; Gitte Jensen (DK), Renate Zindel and Mario Waldburger (Agroscope ART, CH) for technical assistance; and Peter Brown (UK) and Brecht Ingels (BEL) for collection of specificity samples.

In this work, we examined the role of abiotic conditions in shaping the structure of a simple agricultural community that is dominated by two species of predatory mites (i.e., Eusieus stipulatus and Eusieus scutalis) competing for resources. Population and community dynamics experiments were carried out at two abiotic conditions mimicking local climates in a Mediterranean region, to estimate the population cariying capacity (k) and interspecific competition (a) for each predatory mite species. Subsequently, we used this data to parameterize a competition model, thereby predicting species dominance at each abiotic condition. To test our model predictions, we sampled several orchards located in areas influenced by each of the local climates, to determine the abundance of each species of natural enemy. Results showed that the outcome of the competitive interactions between predatory mites was strongly affected by abiotic conditions, leading to temperature-dependent changes in the community structure. Furthermore, the pattern of species dominance found in the field agreed with the model predictions built upon our laboratory experiments. We therefore emphasize that, in a changing climate, if we are to guarantee the successful use of biocontrol agents, we need to account for the effect of temperature upon biotic interactions.

We identify when different indirect interactions arise between the predators, classifying interactions by predator responses to (1) slightly increased mortality in the other predator, (2) a slightly decreased population of the other predator, or (3) removal of the other predator. When interspecific prey competition is low, all methods predict negative indirect effects between predators, i.e., competitive interactions. Strong and/or highly asymmetric interspecific prey competition often produces at least one positive indirect effect between predators, i.e., mutualism or contramensalism. However, the three methods often disagree about the strength of and signs characterizing the indirect effects between predators, including cases where all three methods predict a qualitatively different interaction. These differences arise for a variety of reasons, including hydra effects (where a predator increases in abundance with increased mortality) and extinction of prey species following the removal of one predator. We also show that cyclic dynamics do not arise in our model when there is a single predator, but under strong interspecific prey competition, the indirect interactions between two predators can drive cyclic community dynamics. Similar phenomena are likely to occur in other food webs, and understanding them will be required to predict the impact of environmental change on the abundances of species in those webs.","[Abrams, Peter A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Cortez, Michael H.] Utah State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Cortez, MH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",michael.cortez@usu.edu,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1204401],"P.

Mites of the families Stigmaeidae and Phytoseiidae coexist in various agricultural crops, often promoting the biological control of pest mites. The aim of this work was to study the interactions of Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Phytoseiidae) and Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira (Stigmaeidae), in the presence or absence of B. phoenicis. Two experiments were carried out. In the first, a N. californicus female was placed in each leaf disc arena, with eggs of B. phoenicis and A. brasiliensis as food sources. In the second, an A. brasiliensis female was placed in each arena, with eggs of B. phoenicis and N. californicus as food sources. Adults of both predators were able to consume both types of eggs available as food sources, but they fed on considerably higher proportions of B. phoenicis than on eggs of the predator. Eggs of A. brasiliensis were not a suitable food source for N. californicus, which produced only 0.1 egg per female per day when only eggs of that species were present in the experimental unit. The results suggest that eggs of N. californicus were a suitable food source for A. brasiliensis, which oviposited 1.12 eggs per day, when only eggs of N. californicus were provided to the stigmaeid mite. The possible interactions among N. californicus, A. brasiliensis and B. phoenicis in citrus orchards are discussed.","[da Silva, Marcos Zatti; Sato, Mario Eidi] APTA, Inst Biol, Lab Acarol, BR-13001970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [da Silva, Marcos Zatti] Inst Biol, BR-13092543 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Leite de Oliveira, Carlos Amadeu] UNESP, Fac Ciencias Agr & Vet, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Nicastro, Roberto Lomba] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Energia Nucl Agr, Lab Irradiacao Alimentos & Radioentomol, BR-13400970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil","da Silva, MZ (corresponding author), Inst Biol, Rodovia Heitor Penteado Km 3-5, BR-13092543 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",makdsil@ig.com.br,"Sato, Mario/AAD-1386-2020","Sato, Mario/0000-0001-5947-7717","FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [Process 2008/52691-9, Process 2013/05829-3, Process 2009/08789-7]; CNPq-Brazil (The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)","The authors are thankful to FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation) for the financial support to this research (Processes 2008/52691-9 and 2013/05829-3) and for the Postdoctoral fellowship to Marcos Zatti da Silva (Process 2009/08789-7); also, thanks go to CNPq-Brazil (The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) for providing the research fellowship to the second author.

Flight distance, the distance at which animals flee in response to an approaching predator, is often used as a quantitative measure of animal risk assessment and is thus useful to examine predictions of optimal escape theory. However, applying this theory to a broader diversity of animals under more complex environmental conditions has been hampered by a paucity of data. In this study, I measure the flight distances of two freshwater turtles, the invasive Trachemys scripta elegans, and the native Emys marmorata, in an urban California water body to examine how flight distance is affected by time of day, initial visibility to the approaching predator, and the presence of conspecifics. I found that E.marmorata was more sensitive to predation risk than T.scripta and would flee earlier (at a greater distance). Time of day and the presence of conspecifics had no effect on E.marmorata's flight distance although visibility and the interaction between time and visibility did. Emys marmorata would flee earlier when visible, and in the afternoon visible turtles would flee earlier than non-visible turtles, but in the morning, visibility did not affect turtle flight distance. In contrast, T.scripta's flight distance was not affected by any measured variables, although this may be due to a lack of statistical power given the low sample size. This study demonstrates that multiple environmental characteristics influence risk assessment in turtles, and implies that interspecific differences in responses to predation threats may lead to increased competition for thermal resources between native and invasive ectotherms. This is a likely mechanism contributing to the negative impacts of T.scripta on native turtle populations, especially in urban environments.","Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","Costa, ZJ (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 W Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",zachariacosta@gmail.com,,,,,,51,5,5,0,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,JUL,2014,120,7,,,,,633,640,,10.1111/eth.12235,,,8,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,AJ3RJ,WOS:000337584600002,,,,,2021-09-21,

The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus has established in the North American range of the competitively superior resident congener, Aedes albopictus, and the predatory native mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. We tested predictions for two hypotheses of invasion success and species coexistence: keystone predation and spatial partitioning. We tested competition between A. japonicus japonicus and A. albopictus with or without T. rutilus in laboratory microcosms, and measured abundances of A. japonicus japonicus, A. albopictus, other resident competing mosquito species, and the presence of T. rutilus among tree holes and tires in metropolitan Washington, DC. In laboratory microcosms, A. albopictus was competitively dominant over A. japonicus japonicus, which is consistent with the few prior studies of competition between these two Aedes species. T. rutilus predation severely lowered performances of both Aedes species but more severely lowered A. japonicus japonicus performance than A. albopictus performance when all three species co-occurred, thus yielding no evidence for keystone predation. Consistent with the spatial partitioning hypothesis, A. japonicus japonicus was negatively correlated and independently aggregated with A. albopictus and all combined resident mosquito competitors and was not associated with T. rutilus among field containers. These results suggest that predation from T. rutilus and competition from A. albopictus are barriers to the spread of A. japonicus japonicus, but that A. japonicus japonicus may escape these interspecific effects by utilizing spatially partitioned container habitats.","[Freed, T.

Trees can respond to competitive pressure from neighbors by crown plasticity, thereby avoiding competition. We employed a high-resolution ground-based laser scanner to analyze the 3-dimensional extensions and shape of the tree crowns in a near-natural broad-leaved mixed forest in order to quantify the direction and degree of crown asymmetry of 15 trees (Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Carpinus betulus) in detail. We also scanned the direct neighbors and analyzed the distance of their crown centres and the crown shape with the aim to predict the crown asymmetry of the focal tree from competition-relevant attributes of its neighbors. It was found that the combination of two parameters, one summarizing the size of the neighbor (DBH) and one describing the distance to the neighbor tree (HD), was most suitable for characterizing the strength of the competitive interaction exerted on a target tree by a given neighbor. By summing up the virtual competitive pressure of all neighbors in a single competitive pressure vector, we were able to predict the direction of crown asymmetry of the focal tree with an accuracy of 96 degrees on the full circle (36 degrees). The competitive pressure model was equally applicable to beech, ash and hornbeam trees and may generate valuable insight into competitive interactions among tree crowns in mixed stands, provided that sufficiently precise data on the shape and position of the tree crowns is available. Multiple-aspect laser-scanning proved to be an accurate and practicable approach for analyzing the complex 3-dimensional shape of the tree crowns, needed to quantify the plasticity of growth processes in the canopy. We conclude that the laser-based analysis of crown plasticity offers the opportunity to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of canopy space exploration and also may produce valuable advice for the silvicultural management of mixed stands.

Predator-mediated coexistence occurs when predation allows competitors to coexist, due to preferential consumption of a superior competitor relative to an inferior competitor. Differences between the native treehole mosquito (Aedes triseriatus) and the co-occurring Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in anti-predatory larval behaviours account, in part, for the greater vulnerability of this invasive species to native predatory midge (Corethrella appendiculata). We test the hypothesis that stage-dependent differences in the sizes of A. albopictus and A. triseriatus larvae, relative to the size-limited C. appendiculata, contribute to differential consumption and the likelihood of predator-mediated coexistence of these competitors. 2. In all instars, larvae of A. triseriatus were larger than A. albopictus of the same stage. Third and fourth instar C. appendiculata selectively consumed late-stage A. albopictus in preference to same-stage A. triseriatus. Small, early-stage prey larvae did not differ in vulnerability to predation, but large, late-stage larvae differed significantly in vulnerability to predation, probably owing to size-limited predation by fourth instar C. appendiculata. This effect was less pronounced for third instar C. appendiculata. 3. Prey size, in conjunction with anti-predatory behavioural responses, alters the probability of predator-mediated coexistence. A stage-structured predation model showed that equally vulnerable early stages reduce the range of environmental conditions (productivities) in which predator-mediated coexistence is possible, increasing the likelihood of both competitive exclusion of the resident species or failure of the invasive to establish. These results underscore the importance of stage-dependent interspecific differences in predator-prey interactions for determining how predators may affect community composition.","[Alto, Barry W.; Lounibos, L.

Results were interpreted by using a competing risk analysis model, which uniquely enabled us to estimate the intrinsic patch-leaving decisions independently of external interruptions of foraging bouts by aggression. The experiment was conducted in two 1-ha field enclosures completely surrounded by rodent-proof fences and included allopatric (only Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) and sympatric (G. a. allenbyi and G. pyramidum) treatments. We predicted that increased food patch quality (i.e., habitat quality) should decrease intrinsic patch-leaving rates and increase rates of aggressive interactions involving the forager feeding in the patch (i.e., the occupant individual). We also anticipated that increasing population density should result in an increase in the rate of aggressive interactions involving the occupant individual. Our results supported the first two predictions, indicating a trade-off between foraging and aggression. However, the third prediction was realized only for G. a. allenbyi in allopatry. Furthermore, in allopatry, occupant G. a. allenbyi individuals with high competitive ranks were involved in aggressive interactions at lower rates than those with low competitive ranks. However, in sympatry, patch-use behavior of occupant G. a. allenbyi individuals was mainly influenced by aggressive behavior of G. pyramidum, which did not respond to their competitive rank. Thus, it should pay less for G. a. allenbyi to be aggressive in sympatric populations. The observed reduction in intraspecific aggression among individual G. a. allenbyi in the presence of G. pyramidum supports this assertion. We suggest that this reduction likely weakens the negative effect of intra- and interspecific density on the per capita growth rate of G. a. allenbyi. Because this would change the slope of the isocline of G. a. allenbyi, it could be an important mechanism promoting coexistence when habitat selection is constrained.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Ovadia, O (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",ofer.ovadia@yale.edu,"Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012","Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,34,26,26,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

We therefore examined the potential for interspecific competition across carnivores on one continent, Africa, by calculating, for each of 70 carnivore species, the number of other carnivore species that overlapped it in geographic range, habitat, and diet, and that could potentially kill the species in question. The average carnivore in Africa shares some of its geographic range and habitat with 26 other species suggesting competition could be pervasive. More specifically, carnivores may have to share food resources with 22 other carnivore species, on average, although the potential for food stealing is far lower. The average African carnivore may be vulnerable to predation by 15 other species although it. is unlikely to be eaten by other carnivores. These analyses indicate that exploitative competition and interspecific killing are of potential widespread importance for a large number of carnivores in Africa, rather than being restricted to a few selected carnivores highlighted in the current literature.

The wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) Hogna helluo (Walckenaer) and Pardosa milvina Hentz co-occur in soybean fields of south-west Ohio, U.S.A. As adults, Hogna is the larger species and has the competitive advantage in most interactions; due to differing phenologies, however, their size-classes frequently overlap and as such there is potential for shifts in competitive ability and intra-guild predation. The hypothesis that competitive interactions and intra-guild predation will favour Pardosa when Pardosa is similar-sized, or has a size advantage over Hogna, was tested in laboratory and field experiments. 2. Studies in laboratory arenas, pairing similar-sized individuals of these species and Hogna spiderlings with larger spiders of both species, revealed that intra-guild predation seldom occurs with similar-sized Hogna and Pardosa, however Pardosa will consume small Hogna individuals in laboratory arenas. 3. Field experiments involved stocking high densities (50 m(-) (2)) of Pardosa and Hogna in enclosures placed in soybean fields. In experiments with spiders of similar size, no interspecific effects were uncovered, but an intraspecific effect was found for Pardosa as its survival and weight gain were lower in the presence of more conspecifics. Large Hogna or Pardosa had no effect on the survival or weight gain of Hogna spiderlings. 4. Although Hogna is a better competitor as an adult, it has no advantage over Pardosa when their size-classes overlap, and Pardosa effects on Hogna may be inconsequential under field conditions. Therefore, the co-existence of these species is fostered by the fact that there are few negative interspecific interactions during their ontogeny.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Rypstra, AL (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 1601 Peck Blvd, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA.",,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305; Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732",,,,40,41,43,0,13,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

In contrast, there are a considerable number of general hypotheses that predict competitive ability as a function of a range of ecological traits, together with a suite of increasingly sophisticated models for competitive interactions between plant species. We re-analyse a data set on competition between all pairwise combinations of seven species and show that competition coefficients relate strongly to differences between the maximum sizes, root allocation, emergence time and seed size of species. Regressions suggest that the best predictor of competition coefficients is the difference in the maximum size of species and that correlations of the other traits with the competition coefficients occur through effects on the maximum size. We also explore the patterns of association between coefficients across the competition matrix. We find significant evidence for coefficient reciprocity (inverse relationships between the interspecific coefficients for species pairs) and transitivity (numerically predictable hierarchies of competition between species) across competition matrices. These results therefore suggest simple null models for plant community structure when there is competition for resources.","Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Freckleton, RP (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",robert.freckleton@zoology.oxford.ac.uk,"Watkinson, Andrew R/N-1649-2013; Freckleton, Rob P/B-6455-2013","Freckleton, Robert/0000-0002-8338-864X",,,,54,68,68,0,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Habitat segregation seems to be the major factor contributing to the coexistence of these two species: I. baltica is the dominant species among surface drift weed, whereas I. emarginata occurs mainly on the sea bed among accumulations of broken decaying algae. In laboratory cultures with food in excess, there is intense intra- and interspecific competition through direct interference. Single species cultures of both species thrive and rapidly attain an equilibrium population size which is about four times greater in I. emarginata than in I. baltica. In mixed-species cultures, I. baltica lacks a 'realized niche'; independent of starting densities, I. baltica is competitively excluded by I. emarginata within a short period of time. The crucial behavioural mechanism of interference is cannibalism (intraspecific competition) and mutual predation (interspecific competition). Both intra- and interspecific interference occur mainly through density-dependent control of juvenile mortality by cannibalistic /predatory adults. Experiments on the relative strengths of intra- and interspecific interference revealed strong asymmetries in competitive relationships: Intraspecific inhibitory effects in I. baltica are much greater than in I. emarginata; I. emarginata exerts much more inhibition on I. baltica than on itself, whereas I. baltica exerts much more inhibition on itself than on its congener I. emarginata. These asymmetries account for a complete competitive dominance of I. emarginata over I. baltica, and (according to the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition) inevitably result in competitive exclusion of I. baltica by I. emarginata. All types of asymmetry are due to the fact that juveniles of I. emarginata are much better protected from being cannibalized and preyed upon by conspecifics and heterospecifics, respectively, than juveniles of I. baltica. This protection is probably based on an active chemical defense mechanism that becomes ineffective immediately after death. The possibility is discussed that current interference competition is an important factor in maintaining habitat segregation in I. baltica and I. emarginata in the field. Extrapolation of the laboratory results to the field suggests an essentially unidirectional effect, with I. emarginata itself being largely unaffected by I. baltica but competitively excluding the latter from zones of potential overlap.

Our study encompassed a 10-yr time span (1983-1992) and included some of the highest and lowest flows in the last 58 years. We collected 16 seasonal samples which included data on: (1) habitat availability (total and microhabitat) and microhabitat diversity, (2) assemblage structure (i.e., the number and abundances of species comprising a subset of the community), and (3) microhabitat use and overlap. We classified habitat availability data on the basis of year, season, and hydrologic period. Hydrologic period (i.e., pre-drought [PR], drought [D], and post-drought [PO]) represented the temporal location of a sample with respect to a four-year drought that occurred during the study. Hydrologic period explained a greater amount of variance in habitat availability data than either season or year. Total habitat availability was significantly greater during PO than in PR or D, although microhabitat diversity did not differ among either seasons or hydrologic periods. There were significantly fewer high-flow events (i.e., greater than or equal to 2.1 m(3)/s) during D than in either PR or PO periods. We observed a total of 16 species during our investigation, and the total number of species was significantly higher in D than in PR samples. Correlation analyses between the number of species present (total and abundant species) and environmental data yielded limited results, although the total number of species was inversely correlated with total habitat availability. A cluster analysis grouped assemblage structure samples by hydrologic period rather than season or year, supporting the contention that variation in annual flow had a strong impact on this assemblage. The drought had little effect on the numerical abundance of benthic species in this assemblage; however, a majority of water-column species increased in abundance. The increased abundances of water-column species may have been related to the decrease in high-flow events observed during the drought. Such high-flow events are known to cause mortality in stream fishes. Microhabitat use data showed that species belonged to one of three microhabitat guilds: benthic, lower water column, and mid water column. In general, species within the same guild did not exhibit statistically distinguishable patterns of microhabitat use, and most significant differences occurred between members of different guilds. However, lower water-column guild species frequently were not separable from all members of either benthic or mid-water-column species. Variations in the abundance of potential competitors or predators did not produce strong shifts in microhabitat use by assemblage members. Predators were present in the site in only 9 of 16 seasonal samples and never were abundant (maximum number observed per day was 2). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that variability in both mean and peak flows had a much stronger effect on the structure and use of spatial resources within this assemblage then either interspecific competition for space or predation. Consequently, we suspect that the patterns in both assemblage structure and resource use displayed by fishes in Coweeta Creek arose from the interaction between environmental variation and species-specific evolutionary constraints on behavior, morphology, and physiology.","Univ Georgia, Daniel B Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Grossman, GD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Daniel B Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,85,236,247,2,93,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Based on increased mortality and lowered fecundity at higher densities, strong evidence for intraspecific competition exists for both species. Interspecific competition was weaker than intraspecific competition in this study. When interspecific competition existed, it was asymmetric in its effect, with the larger species (A. coloradus) negatively impacting the smaller one (A. deorum). Although there was little evidence for interspecific effects on mortality, egg production was impacted in a size-dependent, asymmetric manner between the two species. Significant density-dependent depression of available food was observed for A. coloradus, the larger species. Experiments were run at high densities (10-30 individuals per square meter), levels only irregularly reached under natural conditions (either in sporadic patches or overall about every 10-12 yr). Because naturally occurring densities are typically below the competitive threshold, interspecific competition between these two species may occur only intermittently.

The presence of a gene which regulates inter-individual distance, termed irritability (ir) is proposed and the model shows that individuals with a non-irritable (nir) genotype, through association with conspecifics and other species, will tend to form groups with a higher survival rate of individuals. Mixed species groups will have lower costs to individuals than monospecific ones since competition is not for all resources, usually only one. Benefits in predation avoidance, however, would be equal to those of monospecific groups of the same size and may exceed them, if one of the associating species has an effective anti-predator mechanism which can be exploited by others. Nir's will have a greater chance of interbreeding through spatial proximity and mate selection mechanisms and their offspring will also have a higher chance of survival by remaining within the aggregation rather than dispersing. Cultural transmission from parent to offspring of which aggregations are successful is postulated as playing a role in perpetuating certain aggregation types. This system is suggested as forming a basis on which processes such as kin selection and altruism could evolve.",,"RASA, OAE (corresponding author), UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ZOOL, PRETORIA 0002, SOUTH AFRICA.",,,,,,,76,7,7,0,21,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0028-2960,,,NETH J ZOOL,Neth.

Multiple ecological theories, including metabolic scaling theory (MST), predict crown morphology from first principles, but typically lack consideration of competition. The accurate quantification of crown morphology to test theoretical predictions, and the canopy interactions that could alter them, has historically been limited by the simplicity and associated error of traditional crown measurements. In this study, we calculate high-resolution two- and three-dimensional crown metrics from Terrestrial Laser Scanning data for 1,441 Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, Quercus faginea and Q. ilex trees from a water-limited forest community in central Spain and test height-crown metric scaling relationships. We demonstrate new TLS methods to define symmetric and asymmetric neighbourhood metrics based on tree height, crown size and neighbour projected crown area, and test the importance of neighbourhood genus diversity on crown morphology by separating competition from congeneric and heterogeneric neighbours. Competition negatively impacted all crown metrics except crown depth where only P. nigra showed sensitivity. Asymmetric competition was the strongest driver of pine crown morphology, but oaks were more sensitive to symmetric competition, in line with shade tolerance expectations. Congeneric competition reduced Q. faginea crown size and changed its shape, but we found no significant effects of heterogeneric neighbours. Most species and crown dimensions had height-crown scaling exponents below those predicted by MST, which may be due to water limitation effects. Pines and oaks showed large differences in crown depth to height scaling, with the former shallower and the latter deeper, in contrast to theoretical predictions. Synthesis. Our study is the first to demonstrate the ability of TLS to characterise crown morphology from leaf-wood separated clouds and competitive neighbour effects in a water-limited forest community, and to use TLS metrics to test ecological crown scaling theory. Most crown metrics scaled below theoretical predictions. Pines were more sensitive to competition by larger neighbours and oaks to crowding from all neighbours, with competition from neighbours of the same genus having a consistent negative effect.","[Owen, Harry J.

For this purpose, the use of functional traits, in theory, would allow for a direct evaluation of whether functional similarity generates compensatory dynamics or interspecific synchrony. Likewise, a trait-based approach is also needed to evaluate the effect of functional biodiversity on community stability. Using phytoplankton data from the Cana Brava Reservoir (Goi ' as State, Brazil), we tested whether interspecific synchrony depends on functional distance and whether variability in total abundance depends on community synchrony and functional diversity. We did not find a significant relationship between interspecific synchrony and functional distance. However, we found a predominance of positive correlations between pairs of species and a strong negative relationship between functional diversity and community variability. Our results suggest that interspecific synchrony cannot be reliably predicted by functional distance. Given the predominance of positive synchrony, we indirectly infer that environmental variations similarly controlled the dynamics of most species. Our findings also highlight the stabilizing role of functional diversity.","[da Silva, Matheus Nunes; Granzotti, Rafaela Vendrametto; Bortolini, Jascieli Carla; de Carvalho, Priscilla; Bini, Luis Mauricio] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Av Esperanca S-N,Campus Samambaia, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide] Univ Estadual Maringa, Nucl Pesquisas Limnol Ictiol & Aquicultura, Bloco H-90, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil","Bini, LM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Inst Ciencias Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Av Esperanca S-N,Campus Samambaia, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil.",nunes.ecoevo@gmail.com; rafaelagranzotti@gmail.com; jasci_biologa@hotmail.com; carvalhop@hotmail.com; luziac.rodrigues@gmail.com; bini@ufg.br,"Bini, Luis Mauricio/D-5865-2013; Granzotti, Rafaela Vendrametto/S-6523-2017","Bini, Luis Mauricio/0000-0003-3398-9399; Granzotti, Rafaela Vendrametto/0000-0002-4128-2468",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Level Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); MCTIC/CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [465610/2014-5]; FAPEGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Goias (FAPEG),"This research was partially funded by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Level Personnel (CAPES; scholarships to MNS and RVG) and Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq; grants to LMB and LCR).

In the case of one of Africa's most endangered mammals, the riverine rabbit Bunolagus monticularis, only environmental covariates of presence have been used to provide coarse predictions of their distribution. Two potential competitors, namely scrub hare Lepus saxatilis and cape hare L. capensis, have significant (> 90%) range overlap with the riverine rabbit, yet little is known about how these species interact. We used multispecies occupancy models, which model co-occurrence as a function of environmental variables, to assess the spatial response of riverine rabbits to both species of hare in Sanbona Wildlife Reserve, South Africa. We also examined temporal overlap between riverine rabbits and hares. Camera trapping data were collected from 150 camera traps distributed in clusters of 5 cameras at 30 independent sites, covering 223.24 km(2). Contrary to prior studies, we found that riverine rabbits were not restricted to riparian habitat, and that their occurrence was conditional on hare absence and was negatively affected by terrain ruggedness. Whilst hare occurrence was independent of terrain ruggedness, it was negatively affected by rabbit presence. Activity patterns revealed high temporal overlap between hares and rabbits (Delta = 0.828, CI = 0.745-0.940); however, neither species co-occurred at any given site. Our results suggest that conservation management has greatly underestimated the importance of competition with other lagomorphs in understanding riverine rabbit occurrence.","[Woodgate, Zoe; O'Riain, M.

Interspecific competition is a major structuring principle in ecological communities. Despite their prevalence, the outcome of competitive interactions is hard to predict, highly context-dependent, and multiple factors can modulate such interactions. 2. We tested predictions concerning how competitive interactions are modified by anthropogenic habitat disturbance in ground-foraging ant assemblages inhabiting fragmented Inter-Andean tropical dry forests in southwestern Colombia, and investigated ant assemblages recruiting to baits in 10 forest fragments exposed to varying level of human disturbance. 3. Specifically, we evaluated how different components of competitive interactions (patterns of species co-occurrence, resource partitioning, numerical dominance, and interspecific trade-offs between discovery and dominance competition) varied with level of habitat disturbance in a human-dominated ecosystem. 4. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the role of competitive interactions in structuring ground-foraging ant communities at baits varied with respect to habitat disturbance. As disturbance increased, community structure was more likely to exhibit random co-occurrence patterns, higher levels of monopolization of food resources by dominant ants, and disproportionate dominance of a single species, the little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata). At a regional scale, we found evidence for a trade-off between dominance and discovery abilities of the 15 most common species at baits. 5. Together, these results suggest that human disturbance modifies the outcome of competitive interactions in ground-foraging ant assemblages and may promote dominant species that reduce diversity and coexistence in tropical ecosystems.","[Achury, Rafael; Suarez, Andrew V.] Univ Illinois, Dept Entomol, Urbana, IL USA; [Achury, Rafael] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Chacon de Ulloa, Patricia] Univ Valle, Grp Biol Ecol & Manejo Hormigas, Cali, Colombia; [Arcila, Angela] Agrosavia Corp Colombiana Invest Agropecuaria, Mosquera, Colombia; [Suarez, Andrew V.] Univ Illinois, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Urbana, IL USA","Achury, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",rafaelachury@gmail.com,"achury, rafael/AAQ-7157-2020","Achury, Rafael/0000-0003-0435-3594",Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research InstituteAlexander von Humboldt Foundation [0192]; Center for Latin America and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) at the University of Illinois throughout the Tinker fellowship,"We thank Maria del Pilar Lopez, Paloma Bejarano, Christian Bermudez and Juan Carlos Abadia for their help in the field.

Interspecific prey aggregations or neighborhoods may therefore affect an individual's vulnerability to predation. We examined the influence of prey neighborhood structure (i.e., the densities and identities of prey neighborhoods) on spatial variation in predation in a multi-prey system with a primary apex predator. We combined GPS locations of lions (Panthera leo), kill-site surveys, and spatially explicit density estimates of five species of ungulates for which a significant level of predation was attributable to lions. In addition to the dual influence of predator activity and vegetation, predation risk was attributable to the structure of prey neighborhoods for at least two of the five species of prey. Along with traditionally recognized components of predation (the rate of predator-prey encounters and prey catchability), we encourage ecologists to consider how prey neighborhood structure influences spatial variation in predation risk.","[Ng'weno, Caroline C.; Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Ng'weno, Caroline C.; Kibungei, Alfred K.] Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Conservat Dept, Private Bag 10400, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Ford, Adam T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Goheen, JR (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jgoheen@uwyo.edu,,,"Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the FutureSchlumberger; Earthwatch Institute, Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International; Russell E.

Such knowledge might help us understand how species interact within communities and highlight scale-dependent ecological processes in play among species. Here, I propose to analyze the inter-annual variation of a species assemblage at different ecological levels. For this, I joined a two-stage modeling approach and a spatially explicit multivariate model to analyze the interspecies relationships among six species of pelagic seabirds from 2004 to 2015 in the Barents Sea. The large-scale (similar to 400km) pattern of interactions revealed by the analyses suggests a change in the composition of the seabird community along the climatic gradient from south to north. At medium-scale (similar to 300km), the community was split into two areas (i.e., Arctic and sub-Arctic areas) suggesting niche differentiation of Arctic and sub-Arctic species driven by resource partitioning and interference competition. At a small-scale (similar to 40km), species with different body sizes were positively associated suggesting facilitation for accessing food although the species with the smallest body size was negatively associated with the species involved in the facilitation process suggesting interspecific interference competition. Over the years, the large-scale patterns were persistent, suggesting niche establishment, while small-scale patterns were highly variable suggesting only ephemeral interactions among species. My study demonstrates that interspecific relationships are scale-dependent and play major roles in structuring community. Untangling how species are associated with different ecological levels over time is indispensable to better understand how community structure contributes to ecological system dynamics.","[Bellier, Edwige] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Framstredet 39, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Bellier, E (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Framstredet 39, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",edwige.bellier@uit.no,,"Bellier, Edwige/0000-0002-1184-0668",Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [WFR 185109],"This study was funded by the Norwegian Research Council (WFR 185109).

In order to investigate aspects of the interspecific competition between populations of X. laevis and X. gilli, an assessment of their niche differentiation was conducted through a comprehensive study on food composition and trophic niche structure at two study sites: the Cape of Good Hope (CoGH) and Kleinmond. A total of 399 stomach contents of X. laevis (n = 183) and X. gilli (n = 216) were obtained together with samples of available prey to determine food preferences using the Electivity index (E*), the Simpson's index of diversity (1 - D), the Shannon index (H'), and the Pianka index (O-jk). Xenopus gilli diet was more diverse than X. laevis, particularly in Kleimond where the Shannon index was nearly double. Both species were found to consume large amounts of tadpoles belonging to different amphibian species, including congeners, with an overall higher incidence of anurophagy than previously recorded. However, X. laevis also feeds on adult X. gilli, thus representing a direct threat for the latter. While trophic niche overlap was 0.5 for the CoGH, it was almost 1 in Kleinmond, suggesting both species utilise highly congruent trophic niches. Further, subdividing the dataset into three size classes revealed overlap to be higher in small frogs in both study sites. Our study underlines the importance of actively controlling X. laevis at sites with X. gilli in order to limit competition and predation, which is vital for conservation of the south-western Cape endemic.","[Vogt, Solveig; de Villiers, F.

One of currently two recognised species, P. farcimen, is often abundant prior to the diatom spring bloom. Recent field studies have revealed that P. farcimen and P. verruculosa have a period of overlap in their temperature ranges and thus their seasonal occurrences. Using laboratory cultures, we investigated the seasonal succession and growth of P. farcimen and P. verruculosa in both mono- and mixed-culture using the recently developed Pseudochattonella 'qPCR subtraction method', which for the first time allowed the simultaneous enumeration of these morphologically indistinguishable species in mixed assemblages. We examined how these species interacted over four different temperatures (5, 8, 11 and 15 A degrees C). The observed growth rates and cell yields varied with temperature revealing their preferred temperature optima. P. farcimen was able to achieve positive net growth over all temperatures, while P. verruculosa failed to grow below 11 A degrees C. Growth responses were statistically different between mono- and mixed-cultures with the outcome of these interactions being temperature-dependent. Nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and pH levels were also measured throughout the growth experiments to better understand how these factors influenced growth of both species. P. verruculosa was shown to be less sensitive to high pH as growth ceased at pH 9.1, whereas P. farcimen stopped growing at pH 8.4. Understanding the influence of abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, pH and competition) on growth rates allows for a better understanding and prediction of phytoplankton community dynamics.","[Eckford-Soper, Lisa K.; Daugbjerg, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Univ Pk 4, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Eckford-Soper, LK (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Univ Pk 4, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",lisa.eckfordsoper@bio.ku.dk,"Daugbjerg, Niels/D-3521-2014","Daugbjerg, Niels/0000-0002-0397-3073",Danish Strategic Research Council (project HABFISH),We thank Herdis Preil Damberg (Danish Meteorological Institute) for helping to provide the SST data.

Chemical signals can act as repellents or attractants and may therefore have applications for wildlife management. We devised a field experiment to investigate whether dominant predator (ferret Mustela furo) body odor would alter the behavior of three common mesopredators: stoats (Mustelaerminea), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), and ship rats (Rattus rattus). We predicted that apex predator odor would lead to increased detections, and our results support this hypothesis as predator kairomones (interspecific olfactory messages that benefit the receiver) provoked eavesdropping behavior by mesopredators. Stoats exhibited the most pronounced responses, with kairomones significantly increasing the number of observations and the time spent at a site, so that their occupancy estimates changed from rare to widespread. Behavioral responses to predator odors can therefore be exploited for conservation and this avenue of research has not yet been extensively explored. A long-life lure derived from apex predator kairomones could have practical value, especially when there are plentiful resources that reduce the efficiency of food-based lures. Our results have application for pest management in New Zealand and the technique of using kairomones to monitor predators could have applications for conservation efforts worldwide.","[Garvey, Patrick M.; Clout, Mick N.; Wyse, Sarah V.] Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Garvey, Patrick M.; Glen, Alistair S.] Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Wyse, Sarah V.] Royal Bot Gardens Kew, Wakehurst Pl, Haywards Heath RH17 6TN, W Sussex, England; [Nichols, Margaret] Lincoln Univ, Ctr Wildlife Management & Conservat, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Pech, Roger P.] Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.; Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",pgar874@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,"Wyse, Sarah/0000-0002-7015-8685; Glen, Al/0000-0002-7777-7630; Wyse, Sarah/0000-0002-0442-9950",,,,84,15,15,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Ecological theory predicts the trait that determines the resource holding potential (RHP), and hence the winner of encounter competition, is most often body size or mass. The difficulties of observing encounter competition in complex organisms in natural environments, however, has limited opportunities to test this theory across diverse species. We studied the outcome of encounter competition contests among mesocarnivores at deer carcasses in California to determine the most important variables for winning these contests. We found some support for current theory in that body mass is important in determining the winner of encounter competition, but we found that other factors including hunger and species-specific traits were also important. In particular, our top models were strength and hunger and size and hunger, with models emphasizing the complexity of variables influencing - outcomes of encounter competition. In addition, our wins above predicted (WAP) statistic suggests that an important aspect that determines the winner of encounter competition is species-specific advantages that increase their RHP, as bobcats (Lynx rufus) and spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) won more often than predicted based on mass. In complex - organisms, such as mesocarnivores, species-specific adaptations, including strategic behaviors, aggressiveness, and weapons, contribute to competitive advantages and may allow certain - species to take control or defend resources better than others. Our results help explain how interspecific competition shapes the occurrence patterns of species in ecological communities.","[Allen, Maximilian L.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Allen, Maximilian L.; Wittmer, Heiko U.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Allen, Maximilian L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Elbroch, L.

We conducted a replicated artificial stream experiment to evaluate competitive interactions among three common vertebrates. In this experiment, we measured change in body condition of salamanders in the black-bellied dusky complex (Desmognathus quadramaculatus/folkertsi) in the presence of two different fish species, Common Creek Chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and Coosa Darter (Etheostoma coosae). There was no statistically significant change in body condition between the control and darter present treatments. However, salamander body condition was significantly reduced in the presence of the creek chubs suggesting an asymmetric competitive interaction between those two species. While predation is often cited as a potential mechanism limiting the distribution of stream species, the role of interspecific competition may be just as vital. Overall, our results highlight that competition, and not solely predation, may explain why some stream salamanders are restricted to headwater reaches.","[Ennen, Joshua R.; Alford, Kathlina F.] Tennessee Aquarium Conservat Inst, 201 Chestnut St, Chattanooga, TN 37402 USA; [Davenport, Jon M.] SE Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA","Ennen, JR (corresponding author), Tennessee Aquarium Conservat Inst, 201 Chestnut St, Chattanooga, TN 37402 USA.",jre@tnaqua.org,"Davenport, Jon M/AAG-8457-2020","Davenport, Jon M/0000-0002-9911-2779",Aquarium and Zoo Facilities Association's Clark Waldram Conservation Fund,"We thank Christine Bock and Dave Collins of the Tennessee Aquarium for sharing space for our streams.

The main paradigms include the importance of abiotic conditions, predation risk, and competition as determinants of community structure. In this study, we investigated oviposition-site selection of two anuran species, Asiatic toads (Bufo gargarizans) and dark-spotted frogs (Pelophylax nigromaculata), which coexist in southwestern China. We sampled the abiotic and biotic attributes of 36 B. gargarizans breeding sites and 34 adjacent unused sites, and 30 P. Nigromaculata spawning sites and 36 nearby unused sites. Our results showed that these two anuran species differed in the use of the main habitat types. B. gargarizans selected larger spawning sites with low levels of disturbance, high dissolved oxygen content, and the presence of fish. Conversely, P. nigromaculata preferred smaller waterbodies that were shallow, clear, and free of fish and B. gargarizans tadpoles. We conclude that differential habitat use and differences in response to abiotic conditions, predation risk, and competition, contributes to facilitating local coexistence and high species diversity in pond communities.","[Yu, Tong Lei] Xinyang Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Zool, Xinyang 464000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yan Shu] China West Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Zool, Chengdu 637000, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Yu, TL (corresponding author), Xinyang Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Zool, Xinyang 464000, Henan, Peoples R China.",yutonglei_00000@163.com,,,,,,36,3,3,1,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-8354,2151-2485,,ANIM CELLS SYST,Anim.

While its occurrence is predicted to increase in the future, we have little understanding of mechanisms that underlie changes in the fish community associated with coral degradation. The present study uses a field-based experiment to examine how the intensity of interference competition between juveniles of two species of damselfish changes as healthy corals degrade through thermal bleaching. The mortality of a damselfish that is a live coral specialist (Pomacentrus moluccensis) increased on bleached and dead coral in the presence of the habitat generalist (Pomacentrus amboinensis). Increased mortality of the specialist was indirectly owing to enhanced aggression by the generalist forcing the specialist higher up and further away from shelter on bleached and dead coral. Evidence from this study stresses the importance of changing interspecific interactions to community dynamics as habitats change.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council [CE0561432],"We are grateful to the many people who assisted with various aspects of field and laboratory logistics: M.

Few studies, however, have addressed how relative susceptibility to predation influences such interactions. Here we examine the effect of chemical cues from the common shore crab Carcinus maenas on the foraging behavior of two common intertidal gastropod molluscs. Of the two model consumers studied, Littorina littorea is morphologically more vulnerable to crab predation than Gibbula umbilicalis, and it exhibited greater competitive ability in the absence of predation threat. However, Littorina demonstrated a greater antipredator response when experimentally exposed to predation cues, resulting in a lower level of foraging. This reversed the competitive interaction, allowing Gibbula substantially increased access to shared resources. Our results demonstrate that the susceptibility of consumers to predation can influence species interactions, and suggest that inter-specific differences in trait-mediated indirect interactions are another mechanism through which non-consumptive predator effects may influence trophic interactions.","[Mowles, Sophie L.; Rundle, Simon D.; Cotton, Peter A.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Mowles, Sophie L.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Loughborough, Leics, England","Mowles, SL (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",sophie.mowles@gmail.com,,"Cotton, Peter/0000-0002-4830-0868",,,,47,29,29,1,46,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"185 BERRY ST, STE 1300, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 17,2011,6,8,,,,,,,e23068,10.1371/journal.pone.0023068,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,810JJ,WOS:000294121300012,21857993,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

There has been considerable debate on the importance of competition in ecological communities, but its importance in structuring ant assemblages has often been uncritically accepted. Here, we briefly review field experiments examining competition in ant assemblages and use a removal experiment to test the effect of the classical territorial dominant ant, Formica aquilonia. Ants of this species group are thought to structure communities through a dominance hierarchy. 2. First, we used pitfall traps to compare the abundance of other ants in replicated sites with low and high densities of F. aquilonia. We found differences in community composition, in particular, Camponotus herculeanus was more common in low-density sites, in accordance with predictions. Differences in ant assemblages were not owing to differences in measured habitat variables. 3. We removed F. aquilonia from a set of high-density sites, using physical and chemical methods, and repeated these procedures at procedural control sites. One year after removal, abundances of F. aquilonia at removal sites were similar to those at low-density sites. However, the composition of other species did not change in response to F. aquilonia removal. Replication rates were identical in the mensurative and experimental components of this study, so this is unlikely to be owing to the analysis being insufficiently powerful. 4. We suggest three possibilities for the lack of difference. First, the study may have been too short term or small scale to detect differences. However, previous studies have shown effects on smaller spatial- and temporal-scales. Second, priority effects may be important in the successful colonisation by F. aquilonia. Thirdly, boreal ant assemblages may be too depauperate for redundancy in ecological roles and for competition to play an important structuring role. 5. We thus recommend that long-term large-scale experiments be considered essential if we are to distinguish between competing hypotheses in community ecology.","[Gibb, Heloise] La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Gibb, Heloise; Johansson, Therese] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Gibb, H (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",h.gibb@latrobe.edu.au,"Gibb, Heloise/B-8338-2013","Gibb, Heloise/0000-0001-7194-0620; Johansson, Therese/0000-0002-5864-2669",Formas (the Swedish Research Council)Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas,"We thank Ake Nordstrom, Melanie Monroe, Jenny Landin, Jon Andersson, Tim Dempster and Ylva Nordstrom for their valuable help with fieldwork.

Rhizosphere bacteria live in close contact to plant roots feeding on root exudates and rhizodeposits. By producing toxic exoproducts rhizobacteria may inhibit plant pathogens thereby functioning as biocontrol agents and increasing plant fitness. However, the evolutionary basis why rhizobacteria protect plants is little understood. To persist toxin production needs to improve the competitiveness of the bacteria themselves. 2. We investigated the importance of secondary metabolite production for the establishment of the model soil biocontrol bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 in the rhizosphere of rice. We compared the performance of this toxin-producing strain and its isogenic gacS deficient mutant defective in secondary metabolite production. The bacteria were added to the rhizosphere of rice, where they had to compete with the indigenous flora for resources and to resist predation by the protist Acanthamoeba castellanii. 3. Secondary metabolite production strongly enhanced the establishment of the inoculated bacteria by improving competitive strength and predator resistance. The fitness gain due to attenuation of predation exceeded that due to competition by a factor of 2-3, confirming the importance of grazing resistance for rhizosphere bacteria. 4. Biocontrol properties of Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria such as P. fluorescens therefore gain a new dimension. Toxicity primary plays a role in the interaction with competitors and especially predators, and not in the protection of the host plant. Thus, establishment and efficiency of biocontrol bacteria may be improved by fostering predator defence via toxin production.","[Jousset, A.; Scheu, S.; Bonkowski, M.] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Bonkowski, M.] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool Terr Ecol & Rhizosphere Res, D-50931 Cologne, Germany","Jousset, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",jousset@bio.tu-darmstadt.de,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015; Jousset, Alexandre/C-7607-2011; Bonkowski, Michael/C-3700-2013","Bonkowski, Michael/0000-0003-2656-1183",,,,34,58,62,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

This contrasts with the general view of size selection in invertebrate versus vertebrate predators, but is logically caused by the feeding mode of the notonectid, and the gape size limitation of the fish fry. The two predators also showed a dietary niche differentiation in terms of both prey selection and habitat choice. T. rendalli fed preferably on small species and size classes, whereas predation from A. sardea concentrated on large prey. Competitive interference was indicated when feeding on Ceriodaphnia, and niche partitioning when feeding on the two other species. The predatory pattern suggests long-lasting coexistence in the system.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Lindholm, M (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, POB 1027, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",markus.lindholm@bio.uio.no,"Hessen, Dag Olav/AAO-5877-2021; Hessen, Dag/F-4039-2011","Hessen, Dag Olav/0000-0002-0154-7847; ",,,,26,11,12,1,8,ZOOLOGICAL SOC SOUTHERN AFRICA,SCOTTSVILLE,"AFRICAN ZOOLOGY CIRCULATION OFFICE, UNIV KWAZULU-NATAL, SCHOOL BIOL & CONSERVATION SCI, P B X01, SCOTTSVILLE 3209, SOUTH AFRICA",1562-7020,,,AFR ZOOL,Afr.

Although this parasitoid became established, it did not exert any substantial control of P. citrella compared to the native Cirrospilus brevis Zhu, LaSalle and Huang which clearly predominated. To critically evaluate the results of the classical biological control program developed against P. citrella in Spain, we decided to test whether the observed field results concerning the exotic parasitoid Quadrastichus sp. and the indigenous C brevis could have been forecasted from laboratory assays. An assay focusing on competition between Quadrastichus sp. and C brevis was executed. The results obtained indicated that Quadrastichus sp. was an intrinsically superior competitor compared to C brevis, the latter species becoming extinct in the laboratory competition trial. Environmental factors, not present in the conducted laboratory study, probably account for the outcome in the field. Although our laboratory results could be considered misleading, more post-colonization studies are warranted in classical biological control programs and, in any case, pre-introduction studies should still be conducted.

The latter two hypotheses are versions of Tilman's R*-hypothesis, which suggests that the species that is able to survive under the lowest resource concentrations will win in competition, but they differ in the role of body size determining R*. We used a laboratory model system of four species of Daphnia commonly occurring in ponds and rock-pools in the northern temperate zone, D. magna, D. pulex, D. obtusa and D. longispina (in order of decreasing adult body size), and the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda as food. Life-table and competition experiments were focused on the factors explaining the good competitive ability of D. obtusa. One-, two-and four-species experiments were run without predation and under different predation profiles mimicking vertebrate and invertebrate predators. Life-history traits of D. obtusa under high food conditions at 20degreesC were measured and compared with previous measurements on the other three species. D. obtusa was the superior species in most situations, except under high invertebrate predation when the large D. magna was superior. The outcomes did not depend on the specific composition of the zooplankton community (two or four species present initially). Mean population sizes of all four species were higher in experiments with fewer species, indicating strong interspecific competition also under predation. D. obtusa had a higher intrinsic rate of increase (r) than the other three species studied. Therefore, our results mainly support the r-max-hypothesis. We suggest that a competitive hierarchy among the four Daphnia species may exist, but the relative positions of the species in the hierarchy may vary with environmental conditions like the type of predator present, food quality and quantity, and temperature. Competitive ability did not seem to be strongly related to body size.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Zool, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Milbrink, G (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Anim Ecol, Norbyvagen 18B, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",Goran.Milbrink@ebc.uu.se,"Bengtsson, Jan/AAF-2325-2021",,,,,52,6,7,0,24,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

The coastal estuaries of Washington State, USA, provide appropriate habitat fur recently introduced green crab, yet these areas are important nursery grounds for Dungeness crab and contribute greatly to the coastal crab fishery. Juvenile Dungeness crabs are dependent on limited intertidal epibenthic shell for refuge habitat during early benthic life and experience increased mortality on open sand and mud as a result of predation by fish and birds, Early juveniles throughout the subtidal are similarly at risk due to predation by fish and especially adult conspecifics. Laboratory experiments and infrared video observations revealed that juvenile green crab displace Dungeness crab of equal size from shelters during one-on-one competition. Green crab also consistently win nocturnal foraging trials in which the species compete for fresh, damaged clams. Field and laboratory enclosure experiments show that juvenile Dungeness crab emigrate from oyster shell habitat as a result of competition and predation by adult green crab, Depending on the extent to which the two species overlap, interactions with the dominant nonindigenous species could have a negative influence on juvenile Dungeness crab survival and could conceivably impact recruitment to the fishery. However, current evidence indicates that the distribution of green crab in Washington State is far removed from nursery areas of Dungeness crab. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In these areas populations of the native mud snail, Cerithidea californica, have declined precipitously. Since both species feed on epipelic diatoms, I hypothesized that the decline in Cerithidea was a result of exploitative competition with Batillaria. To test this hypothesis I manipulated snail densities in Bolinas Lagoon, California, to estimate their effects on, and responses to, food resources. For two size classes of each snail species I quantified (1) the effect of intraspecific density on food availability, and (2) the growth response of each size class to different food levels. These relationships were used to generate predictions of the exploitative competitive effect of each snail on the other species. These predictions were tested against direct measurements of the effect of interspecific competition on snail tissue growth using field experiments. The observed values of snail growth matched well the predicted relationships, suggesting that exploitative competition does occur. Although the two snails did not differ in their effect on resource levels at any experimental snail density, the introduced snail was always more efficient at converting limited resources to tissue growth. Similar results were obtained in three different experimental periods. Batillaria's enhanced resource conversion efficiency provides a sufficient explanation for its successful invasion and subsequent exclusion of Cerithidea. Theoretically, conversion efficiency of resources should be just as important as resource suppression and uptake to exploitative competitive ability, but it is rarely examined experimentally. By separating exploitative competition into its component parts, the protocol used here allowed identification of a seldom implicated mechanism that can affect invasion success.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Friday Harbor Marine Lab, 620 Univ Rd, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,104,220,227,1,92,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2000,81,5,,,,,1225,1239,,10.2307/177203,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,309XQ,WOS:000086795100004,,,,,2021-09-21,

But while there have been hundreds of papers on the mathematical properties of Lotka-Volterra models, there have been only a handful of papers that explore techniques for fitting these models to actual data, and no papers that explore the interface of experimental design and statistical inference when fitting LV equations to census data. In this paper we present a statistical analysis of Gause's experimental cultures of Paramecium aurelia and P. caudatum, using analytical methods based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. We compare the effectiveness of these two approaches in addressing several questions about competition from experimental data: Are the mutual effects of competing populations substantial? Are these competitive effects symmetrical? Are two populations expected to coexist or to eliminate each other by competition? We show that even a laboratory-derived data set with minimal variability can entail significant levels of uncertainty about the nature of the competitive interaction. We assess the errors involved in estimating the strength and symmetry of competition, and find that one's conclusions depend critically on assumptions about sources of variability in the data. We also estimate the probabilities of alternative dynamic behaviors for competing species. We use simulations to evaluate how particular experimental designs might improve our power to characterize the dynamic; outcome of competition.

We tested experimentally for interactions between mosquito larvae, Culiseta longiareolata, and green toad immatures, Bufo viridis, the two most abundant macrospecies of temporary pools in the Negev Desert, Israel. Since both appear to feed largely on periphyton, and since they co-occur in extremely high densities, competition for food may occur. 2. In artificial outdoor pools, we followed the fate of first-instar Culiseta larvae (50 per litre) and early-stage tadpoles (5 per litre) in the presence or absence of the other species over 1 month. These densities were well within the range of densities found in natural pools. We replicated each treatment five times. 3. Survival of neither species was affected by the other species. However, time to pupation in Culiseta was longer and pupal size was smaller in the presence of Bufo tadpoles. Similarly, tadpole weights were lower and the percentage of Bufo reaching metamorphosis by the end of the experiment was lower in the presence of Culiseta larvae. We attribute these mutual negative effects upon each other to interspecific competition. 4. Late-stage Culiseta larvae also preyed upon Bufo hatchlings in both field enclosure and laboratory experiments. This is the first demonstration of a mosquito larva as a natural predator of a vertebrate. The high predation rates indicate that Culiseta affects Bufo populations significantly via predation in nature. 5. These two surprising roles of a mosquito larva-a competitor and predator of a vertebrate-emphasize that how communities are organized may be misinterpreted by presuming particular roles for species based on taxonomic affiliation.","BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,BIOL CONTROL LAB,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL; UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUNITY ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","BLAUSTEIN, L (corresponding author), UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUNITY ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,58,53,63,2,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

When body size determines the outcome of competitive interactions between individuals, coexistence depends also on how resource use and the ability to compete for these resources change with body size. Testing coexistence theory in size-structured communities, therefore, requires disentangling the effects of size-dependent competitive abilities and niche shifts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the evolution of species- and size-dependent competitive asymmetries increased the likelihood of coexistence between interacting species. We experimentally estimated the effects of size-dependent competitive interactions on somatic growth rates of two interacting fish species, Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata and killifish Rivulus hartii. We controlled for the effects of size-dependent changes in the niche at two competitive settings representing the early (allopatric) and late (sympatric) evolutionary stages of a killifish-guppy community. We fitted the growth data to a model that incorporates species- and size-dependent competitive asymmetries to test whether changes in the competitive interactions across sizes increased the likelihood of species coexistence from allopatry to sympatry. We found that guppies are competitively superior to killifish but were less so in sympatric populations. The decrease in the effects of interspecific competition on the fitness of killifish and increase in the interspecific effect on guppies' fitness increased the likelihood that sympatric guppies and killifish will coexist. However, while the competitive asymmetries between the species changed consistently between allopatry and sympatry between drainages, the magnitude of the size-dependent competitive asymmetries varied between drainages.

Yet, little is known about their trophic ecology and their adaptive capacity to a changing environment. In this study, we used fatty acids (FA) analysed in the hepatopancreas and 813C and 815N stable isotopes analysed in the tail muscle of three spiny lobster species from the Seychelles coastal waters to (1) infer habitat use, dietary patterns and potential for resource competition and (2) investigate the effects of reef type and coral bleaching on their trophic niche metrics. We found that there was a potential for interspecific competition between the three species, shown by their high dietary overlap (mean FA niche overlap ranging from 71.2% to 99.5% for P. longipes and P. versicolor in P. penicillatus) and similar habitat use (813C value ranges). P. penicillatus, the largest of the three species, was more a generalist than the two other species (i.e., had a larger FA niche) and P. versicolor seemed to feed on smaller/earlier life stage prey than P. longipes (based on differences in 815N values). The potential for resource competition of Seychelles spiny lobsters appeared higher in granite than carbonate reefs, and in post-2016 coral bleaching reefs. Our results suggest that P. penicillatus could have a greater adaptive capacity to climate change due to its higher dietary plasticity and that competition between Seychelles spiny lobsters may increase in the future as the frequency and severity of bleaching events is predicted to increase with climate change.","[Sabino, Magali A.; Govinden, Rodney; Rose, Maria; Bodin, Nathalie] Seychelles Fishing Author SFA, Fishing Port, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Sabino, Magali A.; Bustamante, Paco] La Rochelle Univ, UMR CNRS 7266, Littoral Environm & Soc LIENSs, 2 Rue Olympe Gouges, F-17000 La Rochelle, France; [Pethybridge, Heidi] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Blamey, Laura] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Le Grand, Fabienne; Sardenne, Fany] Univ Brest, CNRS, IRD, Ifremer,LEMAR,IUEM, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Bustamante, Paco] Inst Univ France IUF, 1 Rue Descartes, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bodin, Nathalie] Inst Res & Dev IRD, Fishing Port, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Bodin, Nathalie] Sustainable Ocean Seychelles SOS, Beaubelle, Mahe, Seychelles","Bodin, N (corresponding author), Seychelles Fishing Author SFA, Fishing Port, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.",natbod@gmail.com,"Bustamante, Paco/G-5833-2011","Bustamante, Paco/0000-0003-3877-9390; Sabino, Magali/0000-0002-6649-9196; Bodin, Nathalie/0000-0001-8464-0213",Seychelles Government; European Fisheries Partnership Agreement (EU-FPA); Institute for Research and Development (IRD),"The present work is a contribution to the Seychelles Participatory Lobster Monitoring Programme (PLMP) led by the Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA), with the financial support of the Seychelles Government, the European Fisheries Partnership Agreement (EU-FPA), and the Institute for Research and Development (IRD).",,40,0,0,3,3,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0272-7714,1096-0015,,ESTUAR COAST SHELF S,Estuar.

Programs to control invaders are common but gauging the effectiveness of such programs using carefully controlled, large-scale field experiments is rare, especially at higher trophic levels. Experimental manipulations coupled with long-term demographic monitoring can reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of interspecific competition among apex predators and suggest mitigation options for invasive species. We used a large-scale before-after control-impact removal experiment to investigate the effects of an invasive competitor, the barred owl (Strix varia), on the population dynamics of an iconic old-forest native species, the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Removal of barred owls had a strong, positive effect on survival of sympatric spotted owls and a weaker but positive effect on spotted owl dispersal and recruitment. After removals, the estimated mean annual rate of population change for spotted owls stabilized in areas with removals (0.2% decline per year), but continued to decline sharply in areas without removals (12.1% decline per year). The results demonstrated that the most substantial changes in population dynamics of northern spotted owls over the past two decades were associated with the invasion, population expansion, and subsequent removal of barred owls. Our study provides experimental evidence of the demographic consequences of competitive release, where a threatened avian predator was freed from restrictions imposed on its population dynamics with the removal of a competitively dominant invasive species.","[Wiens, J.

The ubiquity of nitrogen (N) limitation across terrestrial environments is a driver of plant competition and the association of some plants with N-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) may alleviate competition with nonfixing plants. Conversely, when available soil N is elevated, competitive advantages imparted by rhizobia are hypothesized to decline because nonfixing species are able to acquire those nutrients readily. We manipulated competition, soil N, and soil microbial inoculation, employing the ground bean Amphicarpaea bracteata, a native annual N-fixing legume, and jewelweed Impatiens capensis, a native co-occurring nonfixing annual. We found that legume performance was negatively impacted by interspecific competition, but less so under lower soil N in both the greenhouse and field. The legume invested a greater proportion of resources in rhizobia when competing, but only under low N. Also consistent with predictions, a competition-by-microbial-inoculation interaction demonstrated that negative effects of competition were alleviated by rhizobia. Finally, we detected an interaction between inoculation and fertilization, whereby N addition resulted in increased performance for uninoculated legumes, but a small decline in performance for inoculated plants, the latter likely representing a cost of mutualism. Thus, several lines of evidence point to the legume-rhizobia mutualism being more beneficial under competition and limited soil N. Competing I. capensis, in contrast, benefited from N addition regardless of the addition of soil microbes. In a survey of natural populations, legume and rhizobia growth were positively correlated at population edges (where interspecific competition is expected to be higher, the mutualism is stronger), whereas at population centers we found no association. Isotopic evidence confirmed a higher degree of rhizobial N-fixation at population edges compared to centers. Taken together, our results demonstrate an important role for the largely private channel of nitrogen in legume competitive performance, but with the benefits imparted by rhizobia being predictably weaker at higher soil fertility. We speculate that alleviation of competitive impacts through resource partitioning is an important and yet largely overlooked aspect of the evolutionary ecology of legume-rhizobia interactions.","[Elias, J.

However, their validity in aquatic plants remains poorly understood, particularly in terms of variation in the water exchange rate (WER). Methods We compared competitive outcomes and variation in functional traits in two pairs of submerged macrophytes (Vallisneria natans vs. Myriophyllum aquaticum and V. natans vs. Myriophyllum spicatum) at three levels of WER using the replacement series method. Results We found that the relative competitive ability of V. natans consistently decreased with increasing WER and decreasing the planting proportion of V. natans. Under these conditions, V. natans experienced reduced plant nutrient content and the inhibition of dissolved carbon dioxide absorption, which eventually shifted this species from a stronger to weaker competitor. With increasing WER and decreasing the planting proportion of V. natans, the below-:above-ground biomass ratio and root diameter increased, while the root length and specific root length decreased, for V. natans. In contrast, all of these traits exhibited the opposite patterns for the co-cultured Myriophyllum species. In addition, the branch number per plant mass increased in V. natans but exhibited no change in co-cultured Myriophyllum species under the same conditions. Conclusions Our results indicate that WER affected the outcome of interspecies competition between submerged macrophyte species. Moreover, the relative competitive ability of each species within a pair was more strongly linked to species competition-trait hierarchy than to competition-trait similarity.","[Pan, Ying; Yuan, Duanyang; Wu, Qihang; Jin, Ling; Xie, Mingli; Gu, Yang; Duan, Changqun] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying; Yuan, Duanyang; Wu, Qihang; Jin, Ling; Xie, Mingli; Gu, Yang; Duan, Changqun] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Plateau Mt Ecol & Restorat Degrade, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Duan, CQ (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Duan, CQ (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Plateau Mt Ecol & Restorat Degrade, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",chqduan@ynu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [32071537, U2002208, 31670440, 31660169]; Key Project of Applied Basic Research Program of Yunnan Province, China [202001BB050021]; Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of China [202010673169]","We are grateful to Chenxing Jin and Chuanyu Che for assistance in the experiment.

Direct and indirect effects of native predators and competitors on invasive lionfish,CORAL REEFS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competition; Consumptive effects; Groupers; Non-consumptive effects; Invasive species control,RED LIONFISH; ECOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; FISHES; DRIVEN,"Biotic resistance is the ability of an ecological community to prevent or limit the establishment or success of non-indigenous species. Native species can confer resistance by outcompeting or directly consuming non-native invaders. The fear of being eaten could also limit invader success, but non-consumptive effects of native predators have rarely been documented as a source of biotic resistance. Here, we test whether native groupers on Caribbean coral reefs can promote biotic resistance to invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish through competition, consumption, and/or through non-consumptive effects. Stomach content analysis of more than 200 groupers, comprising five species, revealed no instances of predation on lionfish. To test for competitive and non-consumptive effects of groupers, we released tagged juvenile lionfish onto reef patches that varied in grouper densities and monitored lionfish behaviours over five weeks. At dawn, during peak grouper and lionfish hunting times, juvenile lionfish hid more on reefs with more grouper predators. Juvenile lionfish were also less active during the day on reefs with high grouper densities. Hiding and inactivity are incompatible with foraging and thus should result in lionfish eating fewer prey and having reduced somatic growth rates. Although there was no substantial effect of interspecific competition on lionfish behaviours, we found that lionfish swam greater distances with increasing densities of intraspecific competitors at dawn. We did not detect a cascading effect of grouper predators on smaller fishes, perhaps because the seasonal peak in prey fish recruitment masked the effects of lower lionfish predation. Fear of native predators by lionfish has the potential to reduce invader foraging success, although it might not fully mitigate the negative effects on native prey communities. Efforts to rebuild grouper populations throughout the Caribbean may still aid in controlling the lionfish invasion despite weak evidence of interspecific competition and lack of direct predation on lionfish, but further research is needed. At broader scales, our findings highlight that the global depletion of large predators can have implications beyond demographic effects on prey.","[Smith, Nicola S.; Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Smith, NS (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",nicolas@sfu.ca,,,Organization of American States Graduate Scholarship; Bullitt Foundation Environmental Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery grantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank Jocelyn Curtis-Quick, Fiona Francis, Kyla Jeffrey, Helen Yan, Emma Atkinson, and Adrienne Berchtold for assistance collecting data in the field.

So far, most published studies have focused on large carnivores and their prey, whereas little is known about medium and small-sized mammal communities. The European brown hare Lepus europaeus is a widespread species in Europe and is part of the diet of many birds of prey and mammalian carnivores of all sizes. Furthermore, competition with other herbivorous mammals at feeding sites has also been suggested. In an area in Central Italy, we have assessed spatiotemporal overlap among brown hare and its potential predators (red fox Vulpes vulpes, pine marten Martes martes, domestic cat Felis catus, and domestic dog Canis familiaris) and a competitor (roe deer Capreolus capreolus). We showed that, outside a fenced area excluding predators and competitors, brown hares become more nocturnal and more active on dark nights to limit encounters with predators, and that they adopt spatial partitioning to avoid competitors, as expected by ecological theory. Analysis of spatiotemporal partitioning is pivotal to shed light on interspecific coexistence. Most research effort has involved large-sized carnivores and their prey, whereas little attention has been devoted to lagomorphs. We assessed spatiotemporal overlap among the European brown hare Lepus europaeus and its potential competitors and predators through camera-trapping in an area in Central Italy. We estimated the interspecific patterns of the spatiotemporal activity rhythms of brown hares, its potential predators (the red fox Vulpes vulpes, the pine marten Martes martes, the domestic cat Felis catus, and the domestic dog Canis familiaris), and a competitor, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus. Brown hare activity was studied in natural conditions as well as in a fenced area that excluded terrestrial predators and competitors. Free-ranging hares developed a more nocturnal behavior to avoid diurnal predators (i.e., domestic carnivores and martens). Although high temporal overlap was observed between free-ranging brown hares and both red foxes (82%) and roe deer (81%), hares avoided fox by being more active on darkest nights, as well as avoided roe deer through spatial partitioning. We suggest that hares may adapt their spatiotemporal behavior to avoid potential predators and competitors.","[Viviano, Andrea] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Agr, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Mori, Emiliano] CNR, Ist Ric Ecosistemi Terr, Via Madonna del Piano 10, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Fattorini, Niccolo] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali & Polit ESP, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Mazza, Giuseppe] CREA Res Ctr Plant Protect & Certificat, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [Lazzeri, Lorenzo] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Panichi, Alessandra] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Biol, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Strianese, Luigi] Assoc Nazl Libera Caccia, I-58100 Grosseto, Italy; [Mohamed, Walid Fathy] Ain Shams Univ, Dept Biol & Geol Sci, Fac Educ, Cairo 11566, Egypt","Mori, E (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Ric Ecosistemi Terr, Via Madonna del Piano 10, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.",a.viviano@studenti.unipi.it; emiliano.mori@cnr.it; niccolo.fattorini@gmail.com; giuseppe.mazza@crea.gov.it; lazzerilorenzo12@gmail.com; alessandra.panichi@stud.unifi.it; info@elettronicastrianese.com; walidfathy2021@gmail.com,"Fattorini, Niccolo/AAJ-9976-2020; Mohamed, Walid Fathy/AAA-2455-2019; Viviano, Andrea/AAL-6744-2021","Fattorini, Niccolo/0000-0001-8022-7464; Mohamed, Walid Fathy/0000-0003-2028-4568; Mazza, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6644-1429; Viviano, Andrea/0000-0002-2970-3389; lazzeri, lorenzo/0000-0002-9556-6204",,,,92,3,3,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,FEB,2021,11,2,,,,,,,562,10.3390/ani11020562,,,11,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences",Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences,QM8ML,WOS:000622027200001,33669965,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Although interspecific relationship is one of the most important forces structuring plant communities, it remains a challenge to integrate long-term consequences at the plant community level. As an increasing number of studies have shown that maternal environment affects offspring phenotypic plasticity as a response to global environment change through transgenerational effects, we speculated that the transgenerational effect would influence offspring competitive relationships. We conducted a 10-year field experiment and a greenhouse experiment in a temperate grassland in an Inner Mongolian grassland to examine the effects of maternal and immediate nitrogen addition (N) and increased precipitation (Pr) on offspring growth and the interspecific relationship between the two dominant species, Stipa krylovii and Artemisia frigida. According to our results, Stipa kryloii suppressed A. frigida growth and population development when they grew in mixture, although immediate N and Pr stimulated S. kryloii and A. frigida growth simultaneously. Maternal N and Pr declined S. krylovii dominance and decreased A. frigida competitive suppression to some extent. The transgenerational effect should further facilitate the coexistence of the two species under scenarios of increased nitrogen input and precipitation. If we predicted these species' interspecific relationships based only on immediate environmental effects, we would overestimate S. krylovii's competitive advantage and population development, and underestimate competitive outcome and population development of A. frigida. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the transgenerational effect of maternal environment on offspring interspecific competition must be considered when evaluating population dynamics and community composition under the global change scenario.","[Li, Yang; Yue, Ming] Inst Bot Shaanxi Prov, Xian Bot Garden Shaanxi Prov, Cuihua Rd 17, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Yang; Yue, Ming] Shaanxi Engn Res Ctr Conservat & Utilizat Bot Res, Xian, Peoples R China; [Hou, Longyu; Yang, Liuyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yue, Ming] Northwest Univ, Key Lab Resource Biol & Biotechnol Western China, Xian, Peoples R China","Yue, M (corresponding author), Inst Bot Shaanxi Prov, Xian Bot Garden Shaanxi Prov, Cuihua Rd 17, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",yueming@nwu.edu.cn,,"Hou, Longyu/0000-0003-1221-4586",Western Young Scholars Program of Chinese Academy of Science [XAB2019AW16]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31500393]; Scientific Research Program of Shaanxi Province [2019JQ-436],"Western Young Scholars Program of Chinese Academy of Science, Grant/Award Number: XAB2019AW16; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31500393; Scientific Research Program of Shaanxi Province, Grant/Award Number: 2019JQ-436",,71,0,0,5,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In birds, interspecific competition often occurs by song-mediated interference and frequently implies asymmetrical outcomes between the species pairs involved. Habitat loss resulting from agricultural intensification is expected to have aggregated bird species in the remaining suitable habitats, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecific competition. However, this process has rarely been considered as a potential factor limiting population recovery in farmland birds. We investigated whether interspecific competition occurs between grey, Perdix perdix, and red-legged, Alectoris rufa, partridges, two phylogenetically related species. Originally parapatric, they have suffered an artificial increase in their contact zone due to huge human-mediated gamebird releases. We analysed territorial behaviour through a playback stimuli experiment and investigated shifts in habitat niche in the absence and presence of a hypothetical competitor. Results showed that the grey partridge appeared less territorial when co-occurring with the red-legged partridge and shifted its habitat niche away from the latter, while no such change was detected for the red-legged partridge. These asymmetrical patterns in behaviour and ecology are predicted under an interspecific competition scenario beneficial to the red legged partridge, and therefore suggest that they are competitively dominant to grey partridges where they co-occur. This result has potentially strong implications for the management of grey partridges as gamebirds, and for their conservation in areas where they are almost extirpated.

We screened over 5400 publications and identified 39 studies that quantified phenomenological intraspecific and interspecific interactions in terrestrial plant communities. Of the 67% of species pairs in which both intra- and interspecific effects were negative (competitive), intraspecific competition was, on average, four to five-fold stronger than interspecific competition. Of the remaining pairs, 93% featured intraspecific competition and interspecific facilitation, a situation that stabilises coexistence. The difference between intra- and interspecific effects tended to be larger in observational than experimental data sets, in field than greenhouse studies, and in studies that quantified population growth over the full life cycle rather than single fitness components. Our results imply that processes promoting stable coexistence at local scales are common and consequential across terrestrial plant communities.","[Adler, Peter B.; Smull, Danielle; Beard, Karen H.; Choi, Ryan T.; Furniss, Tucker; Kulmatiski, Andrew; Tredennick, Andrew T.; Veblen, Kari E.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adler, Peter B.; Smull, Danielle; Beard, Karen H.; Choi, Ryan T.; Furniss, Tucker; Kulmatiski, Andrew; Tredennick, Andrew T.; Veblen, Kari E.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Meiners, Joan M.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Adler, PB (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Adler, PB (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.adler@usu.edu,"Veblen, Kari E./D-1439-2012; Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011","Veblen, Kari E./0000-0001-7523-3368; Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495; Furniss, Tucker/0000-0002-4376-1737; Meiners, Joan/0000-0001-9369-9313","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1054040, DEB-1655522]; National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1400370]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University","We thank Simon Hart and Jonathan Levine for comments that improved an early version of the manuscript.

Propagule size and number often vary by several orders of magnitude among co-occurring plant species. Explaining the maintenance of this variation and understanding how propagule size contributes to coexistence remain a central challenge for community ecologists. The dominant paradigm is that a competition-colonization trade-off maintains interspecific variation in seed size, but empirical support is limited and other coexistence mechanisms, such as size-dependent seed predation, have not been examined. 2. We examined how seed size, fecundity, and other functional traits of 18 co-occurring perennial forbs trade-off with both vulnerability to rodent seed predation and competitive response to a community-dominant perennial bunchgrass. We added seeds of these species to 1 m(2) plots at 10 sites where we factorially manipulated rodent seed predation and competition from the community dominant, Festuca campestris. For a given plot, seeds of each species were added at densities that reflected the fecundity (i.e., per capita seed production) for each species. Moreover, we varied total seed density among plots by adding seeds at one of five relative densities (0, 0.25. 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 times each species' fecundity) to examine how fecundity affected overall recruitment for each species. 3. There was a trade-off between seed size and fecundity, as expected, but larger seed size was also associated with greater plant height, lower C/N ratios, and lower water use efficiency, suggesting that seed size represented a resource acquisitive trait syndrome (as quantified by trait principal component scores). 4. In the field experiment, the suppressive effects of seed predation on seed recruitment rate increased with increasing seed size. In contrast, smaller seeded species with less resource-acquisitive traits were more negatively affected by competition from F. campestris than were species with more resource acquisitive traits. 5. Synthesis. While the competition-colonization trade-off has been the predominant mechanism thought to maintain coexistence among species that vary in fecundity and seed size, our work suggests that susceptibility to rodent seed predation and competitive response to community dominants represent alternative mechanisms that can differentially influence plant recruitment of species based on their seed size and associated traits.","[Maron, John L.; Hajek, Karyn L.; Hahn, Philip G.; Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,,Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-1553518]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518; NSF, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518",,55,9,9,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

These plant traits are assumed to predict how plants compete and capture resources. Variation in stoichiometric ratios both within and across species reflects resource capture dynamics under competition. However, the impact of local plant diversity on species-specific stoichiometry remains poorly studied. Here, we analyze how spatial and temporal diversity in resource-acquisition traits affects leaf elemental stoichiometry of plants (i.e. the result of resource capture) and how flexible this stoichiometry is depending on the functional composition of the surrounding community. Therefore, we assessed inter- and intraspecific variations of leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) (and their ratios) of 20 grassland species in a large trait-based plant diversity experiment located in Jena (Germany) by measuring leaf elemental concentrations at the species-level along a gradient in plant trait dissimilarity. Our results show that plants showed large intra- and interspecific variation in leaf stoichiometry, which was only partly explained by the functional group identity (grass or herb) of the species. Elemental concentrations (N, P, but not C) decreased with plant species richness, and species tended to become more deviant from their monoculture stoichiometry with increasing trait dissimilarity in the community. These responses differed among species, some consistently increased or decreased in P and N concentrations; for other species, the negative or positive change in P and N concentrations increased with increasing trait difference between the target species and the remaining community. The strength of this relationship was significantly associated to the relative position of the species along trait gradients related to resource acquisition. Trait-difference and trait-diversity thus were important predictors of how species' resource capture changed in competitive neighbourhoods.","[Guiz, Jordan; Hillebrand, Helmut] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm ICBM, Schleusenstr 1, DE-26382 Wilhemshaven, Germany; [Ebeling, Anne] FSU Jena, Inst Ecol, Jena, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Physiol Divers, Leipzig, Germany; [Hacker, Nina; Oelmann, Yvonne] Univ Tubingen, Geoecol, Tubingen, Germany; [Hertzog, Lionel] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol, Ghent, Belgium; [Wagg, Cameron] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland","Hillebrand, H (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm ICBM, Schleusenstr 1, DE-26382 Wilhemshaven, Germany.",helmut.hillebrand@uni-oldenburg.de,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Oelmann, Yvonne/J-8730-2016; Wagg, Cameron/O-4318-2019","Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Oelmann, Yvonne/0000-0003-3513-6568; Wagg, Cameron/0000-0002-9738-6901; Hertzog, Lionel/0000-0003-0869-9672","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 456/1451, HI848/11-2]; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena","The Jena Experiment is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG FOR 456/1451; HI848/11-2) and supported by the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena.",,55,10,11,15,94,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2018,127,7,,,,,903,914,,10.1111/oik.04907,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GL1JE,WOS:000436856200001,,,,,2021-09-21,

This is particularly the case for communities with large species richness S since it is practically impossible to perform the S monoculture experiments (to obtain the species carrying capacities) plus the S x (S - 1)/2 pairwise experiments (required to estimate the entire set of interspecific interaction coefficients of the interaction or community matrix). However quantitative predictive tools are vital for understanding the fate of ecological communities. Here we derive an analytical approximation for predicting the relative yield total (or equivalently the mean relative yield) as a function of the mean intensity of the interspecific competition and the species richness. The rationale is that with incomplete information on model parameters it seems more reasonable to attempt to predict macroscopic or mean quantities, defined for the whole community of competing species, rather than making detailed microscopic predictions, like species abundances. This method, with only a fraction of the model parameters (carrying capacities and competition coefficients), is able to predict accurately empirical measurements covering a wide variety of taxa algae, plants, protozoa, etc. Our aim with this approach is to contribute in making community ecology a more quantitative and predictive science. We argue that such parsimonious modeling is preferable than more realistic/complex theories involving additional parameters which can be very difficult to measure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These negative competitive interactions could also affect the coexistence of predatory species. The co-occurrence of aphidophagous ladybird species in crops creates opportunities for CANN and IGP, especially when aphids become scarce. The Lotka-Volterra model predicts the coexistence of two species if intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific interference interactions. Cycloneda sanguinea L. and Eriopis connexa (Germar) (both Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) coexist in sweet pepper crops in La Plata (Argentina) consuming mainly Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The present study used laboratory experiments to estimate levels of CANN and IGP by adults and larvae on eggs, and by adults on larvae, in both the presence and absence of prey (i.e., M.persicae), to explain the effect of prey on coexistence of these two predators. Levels of CANN by C.sanguinea and E.connexa were high in the absence of aphids, and decreased when prey was present. Intraguild predation was bidirectional and asymmetric. Adults and larvae of E.connexa were more voracious IG predators of C.sanguinea than vice versa, the former being the stronger IG predator and interference competitor. Eriopis connexa always won when larvae of the same instar were compared, whereas the larger larva always won when larvae were of different instars, regardless of species. In the presence of prey, CANN by both species decreased, but IGP by E.connexa on C.sanguinea remained high, suggesting that E.connexa could displace C.sanguinea via interspecific interference competition. Other factors potentially affecting the coexistence of C.sanguinea and E.connexa in sweet pepper crops are discussed.","[Rocca, Margarita; Rizzo, Estefania; Greco, Nancy; Sanchez, Norma] Univ Nacl La Plata, Ctr Estudios Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, CONICET, Blvd 120 S No 60 & 64, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Greco, N (corresponding author), Univ Nacl La Plata, Ctr Estudios Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, CONICET, Blvd 120 S No 60 & 64, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",ngreco@cepave.edu.ar,,,Programa de Incentivos [UNLP N712];  [BID PICT 2012-1624];  [BID PICT 2013-0108],"We thank the three anonymous reviewers whose suggestions helped us improve the manuscript.

Competitive ability often increases with age or size; alternatively, senescence can lead to a loss of viability and reduced competitive success. Differences between species in their age-specific competitive abilities can promote coexistence in the face of substantial niche overlap. 2 We examined two sympatric species of nematodes (genus Steinernema) to determine whether their competitive relationship changes as a function of age. These obligately killing insect parasites are known for their broad host ranges and are transmitted from insect to insect via a juvenile stage propagule that is free-living in the soil. Here, we tested whether the two species differed in the effects of age by examining the mortality of insect hosts infected with young or old transmission stage nematodes of each species. We also performed mixed infections, where an equal ratio of both species was simultaneously exposed to a host, to determine the effect of age on competitiveness. 3 One species showed reduced performance with age, as older propagules were slower at inducing host mortality. In contrast, the other species increased in killing speed with age. In competition, insect mortality rate was predictive of competitive outcome, such that if one species induced considerably faster host death in a single-species infection, it was competitively dominant in the coinfection. Accordingly, we found a shift in the competitive relationship between the two species with age. 4 Our work demonstrates that species differences in the effects of aging can lead to dramatic shifts in reproductive success. As these effects are realized solely in a competitive environment, both spatial patchiness and temporal niche partitioning may be important for promoting coexistence.","[Bashey, Farrah; Sarin, Tara; Lively, Curtis M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Bashey, F (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",fbasheyv@indiana.edu,"Lively, Curtis M/A-8057-2011","Bashey-Visser, Farrah/0000-0002-7992-4577","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0515832, DEB-0919015]",Funding was provided from National Science Foundation DEB-0515832 and DEB-0919015.,,53,2,2,0,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In the Chitose River system, Hokkaido, northern Japan, nonnative brown trout Salmo trutta may have replaced nonnative rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss due to interspecific competition. The outcome of this competition is predicted to be influenced by the density of both species. Then, I conducted an enclosure experiment to test whether density-dependent interspecific competition between YOY (young-of-the-year) of these species may have explained the species replacement. Rainbow trout decreased their stomach contents in the high density treatment sympatry with brown trout, and growth rate of rainbow trout decreased in the high density treatments both allopatry and sympatry with brown trout.

Altogether a total of 5926 rove beetle individuals belonging to 25 species were collected. Whilst the average number of rove beetle individuals per replicate per sampling date varied and, moreover, decreased each year, there were no observed differences in rove beetle abundance when compared between isogenic and GM maize plots within the study period. Furthermore, no clear trends on positive correlations between weed coverage and rove beetle abundances were detected. Altogether a total number of 76,070 ground beetle individuals and 11,126 spiders (including all Araneae) were collected with pitfall traps. Analyses revealed a strong negative relationship between rove beetles and the other two groups in each treatment and year. According to the results the effect of interspecific competition on rove beetle abundance in GM maize is much higher than the effects of treatments including both Bt toxins and extra glyphosate applications.

While competition is recognized as a major factor responsible for plant community dynamics, the genetics of intra- and interspecific competitive ability of a target species (i.e. level of intra-population genetic variation, identity of phenotypic traits under selection and genetic bases) still deserves a deeper investigation at the local spatial scale by considering both numerous genotypes and several interacting species. 2. In this study, we tested whether the genetics of competitive response and effect in Arabidopsis thaliana was dependent on the competitive environment at both the intraspecific and interspecific levels. We used a mapping population of 48 accessions (i) that maximize the genetic diversity of a local population of A.thaliana and (ii) that have been genotyped for 168503 single nucleotide polymorphisms. 3. In a common garden experiment, those 48 accessions were grown in six competitive environments: the absence of competition, intraspecific competition and interspecific competition with four species frequently associated with A.thaliana in natural plant communities (i.e. Poa annua, Stellaria media, Trifolium repens and Veronica arvensis). A suite of nine phenotypic traits, including a proxy of fitness, were scored on each target A.thaliana plant and the above-ground dry biomass of its corresponding competitor was estimated. 4. We first showed that crossing reaction norms of competitive response (A.thaliana performance) and effect (competitor biomass) might promote maintenance of genetic variation in a local population of A.thaliana and species coexistence at a fine spatial scale. By estimating genotypic gradients of selection, we then demonstrated that the optimal phenotypic strategies in response to competition depend on the identity of the competitor species. Finally, a genomewide association mapping approach highlighted that genomic regions associated with direct genetic effects were (i) dependent on the competitor species and (ii) different from genomic regions associated with interspecific indirect genetic effects. 5. While a first step, this study highlighted the power of adding ecology to genomics in A.thaliana to identify genetic bases underlying micro-geographic adaptation to competition. Next-generation sequencing technologies will undoubtedly facilitate the discovery of molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying competitive ability in other plant species, and thereby the prediction of evolutionary trajectories of plant communities.","[Baron, Etienne; Richirt, Julien; Villoutreix, Romain; Amsellem, Laurent; Roux, Fabrice] Univ Lille 1, UMR CNRS 8198, Lab Genet & Evolut Populat Vegetales, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Baron, Etienne; Roux, Fabrice] INRA, Lab Interact Plantes Microorganismes, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Baron, Etienne; Roux, Fabrice] CNRS, Lab Interact Plantes Microorganismes, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France","Roux, F (corresponding author), Univ Lille 1, UMR CNRS 8198, Lab Genet & Evolut Populat Vegetales, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",fabrice.roux@toulouse.inra.fr,"Villoutreix, Romain/AAO-6617-2021; AMSELLEM, Laurent/A-2725-2009","Villoutreix, Romain/0000-0002-1815-3844; AMSELLEM, Laurent/0000-0002-4117-6147; Richirt, Julien/0000-0003-3618-836X; Fabrice, Roux/0000-0001-8059-5638","PhD fellowship from University of Lille 1 - Region Nord-Pas-de-CalaisRegion Hauts-de-France; PhD fellowship from University of Lille 1; Region Nord-Pas-de-Calais grantRegion Hauts-de-France; LABEX TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02]","Special thanks are given to Cedric Glorieux, Nathalie Faure and Angelique Bourceaux for their assistance during the common garden experiment.

In the field, however, contaminant effects are ubiquitously co-occurring with ecological interactions such as species competition and predation, which might influence the sensitivity of the individuals exposed to toxicants. The present experimental study investigated how intra- and interspecific competition influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms to a pesticide. For this, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the mortality and growth of the snail Bithynia tentaculata and the crustacean Gammarus pulex under different levels of intraspecific and interspecific competition for a food resource. Interspecific competition was created by adding individuals of Radix peregra and Asellus aquaticus, respectively. The interaction of competition and carbendazim exposure significantly influenced B. tentaculata growth, however, combined effects on survival and immobility were considered transient and were less easily demonstrated. Positive influence of competition on G. pulex survival was observed under low-medium carbendazim concentrations and under medium-high density pressures, being partly related to cannibalistic and predation compensatory mechanisms, enhanced under food limiting conditions. This study shows that intra- and interspecific competition pressure may influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms in a more complex way (positive, non-significant and negative effects were observed) than just increasing the sensitivity of the studied species, as has generally been hypothesized.

Theory predicts that species persistence and community stability are feasible when the beneficial effects of mutualisms are balanced by density-dependent negative feedbacks. Enemy-mediated negative feedbacks can foster plant species coexistence in diverse communities, but empirical evidence remains mixed. Disparity between theoretical expectations and empirical results may arise from the effects of mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we build a multiprey species/predator model combined with a bidirectional resource exchange system, which simulates mutualistic interactions between plants and fungi. To reach population persistence, (1) the per capita rate of increase of all plant population must exceed the sum of the negative per capita effects of predation, interspecific competition, and costs of mycorrhizal association, and (2) the per capita numerical response of enemies to mycorrhizal plants must exceed the magnitude of the per capita enemy rate of mortality. These conditions reflect the balance between regulation and facilitation in the system. Interactions between plant natural enemies and mycorrhizal fungi lead to shifts in the strength and direction of net mycorrhizal effects on plants over time, with common plant species deriving greater benefits from mycorrhizal associations than rare plant species.","[Bachelot, Benedicte; Uriarte, Maria] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, 1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [McGuire, Krista] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Bachelot, B (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, 1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",bmb2157@columbia.edu,,"McGuire, Krista/0000-0002-8970-8827",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-524989]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1239764] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"Benedicte Bachelot was partially supported with funds from National Science Foundation DEB-524989 to MU.

Intraspecific and interspecific competition are expected to result in additional stress and might increase the sensitivity of aquatic populations to pesticide contamination. To test this hypothesis, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the population dynamics of the micro-crustacean Daphnia magna under different levels of intraspecific and interspecific competition for an algal food resource, using the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus as competing species. The experiments were performed in glass jars with three different carbendazim concentrations (i.e., 50, 100 and 150 A mu g/L), and had a duration of 25 days, with a 4-day pre-treatment period in which competition was allowed to take place and a 21-day exposure period. The endpoints evaluated were D. magna total population abundance and population structure. Results of these experiments show that competition stress on its own had a significant influence on shaping D. magna population's structure, however, a different response was observed in the intraspecific and interspecific competition experiments. The use of a 4-day pre-treatment period in the intraspecific experiment already led to an absence of interactive effects due to the quick abundance confluence between the different intraspecific treatments, thus not allowing the observation of interactive effects between competition and carbendazim stress. Results of the interspecific competition experiment showed that rotifers were quickly outcompeted by D. magna and that D. magna even profited from the rotifer presence through exploitative competition, which alleviated the original stress caused by the algal resource limitation. These experiments suggest that competition interactions play an important role in defining population-level effects of pesticides in a more complex way than was hypothesized (increasing competition leading to a sensitivity increase), as the interspecific experiment showed. Therefore, these should be taken into account in the extrapolation of single-species toxicity data to protect higher levels of biological organization.","[Isabel Del Arco, Ana] Univ Jaen, Dept Plant Biol Anim Biol & Ecol, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Rico, Andreu; van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Del Arco, AI (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Dept Plant Biol Anim Biol & Ecol, B3 078 Campus Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain.",aarco@ujaen.es,"van den brink, Paul/AAT-7144-2020; Rico, Andreu/G-1102-2016","van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347; Rico, Andreu/0000-0002-1820-4218; del Arco Ochoa, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-5690-4979",Long Range Initiative of CEFIC [LRI-ECO19]; Jaen University,"The authors thank John Beijer, Marie-Claire Boerwinkel and Ivo Roessink for providing useful advices, and Carry van Mameren and Steven Crum for performing the chemical analysis.

Here I study analytically and numerically the predictions of LVNCT concerning total abundance and biodiversity, measured by the Shannon equitability index. Firstly, a set of simplifying assumptions that render the LVNCT amenable of analytical treatment are considered. In particular I derive an approximated formula for the total abundance, as the inverse of the mean value of the interspecific competition coefficients, which works pretty well both for the transient and steady regime and for a wide range of the typical niche width a. Secondly, I analyze, by means of simulations, the effect of relaxing the above simplifying assumptions when considering more realistic conditions. It turns out that the approximated formula for the total abundance is quite robust and its potential implications for management are discussed.

However, little is known about how intra-and interspecific plant-soil feedbacks influence interspecific plant competition. Here, we used plants and soil from early-stage ex-arable fields to examine how intra-and interspecific plant-soil feedbacks affect the performance of 10 conditioning species and the focal species, Jacobaea vulgaris. Plants were grown alone and in competition in both conditioned and control soils. Overall, plant-soil feedback of the 10 plant species influenced the competitiveness of J. vulgaris more strongly than their own competitiveness. However, effects depended on species combination: competitiveness of J. vulgaris was significantly enhanced by interspecific plant-soil feedback from Anthoxanthum odoratum, Agrostis capillaris, and Trifolium dubium, and significantly decreased by interspecific feedback from Achillea millefolium. Intraspecific feedback from Taraxacum officinale and A. odoratum decreased their competitiveness with J. vulgaris. There was a positive relationship between the strength of interspecific feedback and competitiveness of J. vulgaris in conditioned soil. Multiple linear regression showed that the competitiveness of J. vulgaris in conditioned soil was determined by interspecific feedback and competitiveness of neighbour plants. The positive relationship between interspecific feedback and competitiveness in control soil suggests that the soil feedback effect of the competing species on J. vulgaris can build up quickly during competition. We conclude that the effect of plant-soil feedback on interspecific competition may be due to either legacy effects of plant species previously colonizing the soil, or immediate interspecific feedback of the competing plant species via the soil. Therefore, our results suggest that plant-soil feedback can influence interspecific plant competition through a multitude of intra-and interspecific plant-soil interactions both from predecessors, and from the currently competing plant species.","[Jing, Jingying] China Agr Univ, Dept Plant Nutr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Jing, Jingying; Bezemer, T.

In syntopic populations of competing species common predators can play a mediator role thus influence the interaction out-come of prey-species in an indirect way. We studied differences in antipredator response in two competing lizards in syntopy in a multi-predator environment. Studied prey species, Iberolacerta horvathi and Podarcis muralis, are likely to compete in syntopic populations limited in size and have similar morphology and ecology but exhibit fine-scale ecophysiological differences. Taking into account interspecific differences in ecophysiology we expected that!. horvathi as a more precise thermoregulator would be less prone to use refuges that represent a thermal cost (are colder than outside). The pattern we found was the opposite of our expectations; I. horvathi escaped at greater distances and remained in the refuge for longer before re-emerging than P. muralis. Second part of the study revealed that both species were able to recognize chemical cues of predator snakes (represented as higher tongue flick rates in the presence of scents of predator snakes in comparison to control). Behavioral responses, which are linked with stressful situations connected to saurophagous snakes, were more frequent and variable in L horvathi. Overall, antipredator responses seem to be more pronounced in L horvathi than in P. muralis. While this more cautious attitude of!. horvathi should provide higher short-term benefits (higher survival rates), this would hold true only in populations where predation pressure is high. Otherwise it carries substantial time and thermoregulatory costs. For I. horvathi, costs of refuge use should be even higher due to narrower dimensions of their ecophysiological fundamental niche. Such divergences in antipredator behavior are expected to shape the relationships between both species in syntopic populations modulated by common predation pressure and habitat structure.

Understanding habitual, daily behavioural rhythms, and their climatic and environmental influences, could shed light on the constraints on long-term upslope range-shifts. In addition, behavioural rhythms can be affected by interspecific interactions, which can ameliorate or exacerbate climate-driven effects on ecology. Here, we investigate the relative influences of ambient temperature and an interaction with domestic sheep (Ovis aries) on the altitude use and activity budgets of a mountain ungulate, the Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). Chamois moved upslope when it was hotter but this effect was modest compared to that of the presence of sheep, to which they reacted by moving 89-103m upslope, into an entirely novel altitudinal range. Across the European Alps, a range-shift of this magnitude corresponds to a 46% decrease in the availability of suitable foraging habitat. This highlights the importance of understanding how factors such as competition and disturbance shape a given species' realised niche when predicting potential future responses to change. Furthermore, it exposes the potential for manipulations of species interactions to ameliorate the impacts of climate change, in this case by the careful management of livestock. Such manipulations could be particularly appropriate for species where competition or disturbance already strongly restricts their available niche. Our results also reveal the potential role of behavioural flexibility in responses to climate change. Chamois reduced their activity when it was warmer, which could explain their modest altitudinal migrations. Considering this behavioural flexibility, our model predicts a small 15-30m upslope shift by 2100 in response to climate change, less than 4% of the altitudinal shift that would be predicted using a traditional species distribution model-type approach (SDM), which assumes that species' behaviour remains unchanged as climate changes. Behavioural modifications could strongly affect how species respond to a changing climate.","[Mason, Tom H.

Adjoining interspecific colonies represent an ideal model for testing hypotheses about competitive interactions between clonal species and developing predictive theories on plant competition for space. In this study, we evaluated the outcome of competition between colonies of Phragmites and Typha. First, we compared the progression and density of colonies in roadside ditches 1) at the zone of contact of two well-established monospecific colonies, and 2) in zones where the progression fronts are free from competition. Second, we used an experimental mesocosm approach to simulate competition for space between two plant colonies. The experiment was done under three salinity levels in order to better understand how deicing salt may influence interspecific competition. In roadside ditches, Typha did not slow down Phragmites progression. In the mesocosm experiment, both species showed optimal growth in low salinity, but Phragmites was superior at all salinity levels. In opposition to previous classical pair-wise experiments, the results of our experiments on Phragmites - Typha interactions concur with field evidence of dynamics between neighboring colonies.

However, the role of top-down effects of predation as opposed to the bottom-up effects of competition for resources in shaping migrations is not well understood. We studied 30 GPS radio-collared wildebeest and zebra migrating seasonally in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem to ask how predation and food availability differentially affect the individual movement patterns of these co-migrating species. A hierarchical analysis of movement trajectories (directions and distances) in relation to grass biomass, high-quality food patches, and predation risk show that wildebeest tend to move in response to food quality, with little attention to predation risk. In contrast, individual zebra movements reflect a balance between the risk of predation and the access to high-quality food of sufficient biomass. Our analysis shows how two migratory species move in response to different attributes of the same landscape. Counterintuitively and in contrast to Most other animal movement studies, we find that both species move farther each day when resources are locally abundant than when they are scarce. During the wet season when the quality of grazing is at its peak, both wildebeest and zebra move the greatest distances and do not settle in localized areas to graze for extended periods. We propose that this punctuated movement in high-quality patches is explained by density dependency, whereby large groups of competing individuals (up to 1.65 million grazers) rapidly deplete the localized grazing opportunities. These findings capture the roles of predation and competition in shaping animal migrations, which are often claimed but rarely measured.","[Hopcraft, J.

An analysis of competition between pairs of Hydra oligactis, Hydra vulgaris and Hydra circumcincta, that simultaneously encountered a single prey item, showed that competitive success in these sessile predators depended on species and clone in inter- and intraspecific competition, respectively. H. oligactis appeared to be competitively superior, even to the larger H. vulgaris individuals. Phenotypic traits important for prey capture, such as the fraction of the nematocyst that penetrates the prey (penetrants), were positively related to success in intraspecific competition. Body size appeared to be a positive key factor in determining foraging success in the competition between pairs of conspecifics from single or different clones. In contrast to the results of the intraspecific competition, body size was not significantly related to the foraging success of competing heterospecifics.","[Kaliszewicz, Anita] Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, PL-01815 Warsaw, Poland; [Kaliszewicz, Anita] Polish Acad Sci, Ctr Ecol Res Dziekanow Lesny, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland","Kaliszewicz, A (corresponding author), Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, PL-01815 Warsaw, Poland.",a.kaliszewicz@uksw.edu.pl,,"Kaliszewicz, Anita/0000-0002-5146-5882",,,,67,2,3,0,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP,2013,714,1,,,,,105,114,,10.1007/s10750-013-1527-4,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,170IH,WOS:000320843100010,,,,,2021-09-21,

Intraguild interactions between predators have significant implications for how multiple predators impact on their prey. Carabid assemblages are not generally thought to be structured by interspecific competitive interactions, species relative abundances instead being determined mainly by abiotic factors. However, several field studies report negative associations between the abundance of certain carabid species and the presence of wood ants. 2. Replicated laboratory experiments were used to monitor the behaviour of individual female Abax parallelepipedus (Piller & Mitterpacher) in the presence of a range of wood ant (Formica rufa L.) densities (including ant-free controls) over 23 h. Carabids did not feed when wood ants were present. Running and defence activities were high at low ant densities but decreased with increasing ant density. At the highest ant density, all carabids were killed within the first 2 h of the experiment, but the ants did not consume the carabids after they had killed them. Carabid diurnal activity increased at the higher wood ant densities. 3. Female A. parallelepipedus and Pterostichus madidus (F.) maintained individually in the presence of five wood ants had significantly lower mean body weights and carried fewer eggs after 21 days compared to control beetles that had been kept without ants. 4. The results help to explain the reduced abundance of these two carabid species under field conditions when wood ants are present. We interpret these findings to mean that the interaction between wood ants and carabids is one of asymmetric aggressive interference competition rather than predation.","[Hawes, Cathy; Evans, Hugh F.] Alice Holt Lodge, Forest Res, Surrey, England; [Hawes, Cathy] James Hutton Inst, Dundee, Scotland; [Evans, Hugh F.] Rhodfa Padarn, Forest Res, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Stewart, Alan J.

Simulation models suggest that hybridization increases the risk of extinction beyond the risk resulting from interspecific competition alone, but such combined effects are rarely studied empirically. Here, we use detailed records on pairing patterns, breeding success, local recruitment and immigration collected during 8 years (2002-2009) to investigate the underlying mechanism of the rapid displacement of pied flycatchers by collared flycatchers on the Swedish island of A-land. We found no differences in average reproductive success or reproductive lifespan between the two species. However, we show that young male pied flycatchers failed to establish new territories as the density of male collared flycatchers increased. In addition, as the relative frequency of collared flycatchers increased, the risk of hybridization dramatically increased for female pied flycatchers, which speeds up the exclusion process since there is a high fitness cost associated with hybridization between the two species. In a nearby control area, within the same island, where pied flycatchers breed in the absence of collared flycatchers, no decline in the number of breeding pairs was observed during the same period of time. Our results demonstrate the crucial importance of studying the combined effects of various types of heterospecific interactions to understand and predict the ecological and evolutionary implications of secondary contact between congeneric species. These findings are particularly interesting in the light of recent climate change since the expected range shifts of many taxa will increase competitive and sexual interactions between previously separated species.","[Vallin, Niclas; Rice, Amber M.; Arntsen, Hanna; Kulma, Katarzyna; Qvarnstrom, Anna] Uppsala Univ, Anim Ecol Dept Ecol & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Vallin, N (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Anim Ecol Dept Ecol & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Norbyvagen 18D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",niclas.vallin@ebc.uu.se,"Rice, Amber/F-3410-2011","Rice, Amber/0000-0002-5475-8226; Kulma, Katarzyna/0000-0002-2952-9720",Zoologiska stiftelsen; Varmlands nation; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; European Science FoundationEuropean Science Foundation (ESF)European Commission,"We thank all persons helping us in the field and Zoologiska stiftelsen (N.

Here, I investigate how the functional diversity of communities changes with environmental disturbances. Specifically, I assume that there is variation in traits among species that confer tolerance or sensitivity to environmental disturbances. When a disturbance occurs, variation in species tolerances causes changes in the relative abundances of species, which in turn changes the average tolerance of the community. For example, if tolerance to an environmental disturbance is conferred by large body size, then the environmental disturbance should be expected to increase the average body size of individuals in the community. Despite this expectation, ecological interactions among species can affect the average community response. For example, if larger species are also strong competitors with each other, then this might reduce the increase in average body size in the community, because interspecific competition limits the grow in population density of large bodied species. Similarly, when disturbances affect multiple traits, the covariance in the distribution of trait values among species may restrict the response of any one trait; if two traits provide tolerance to the same disturbance but negatively covary among species, then the response of one trait will limit the response of the other trait at the community level. Using a Lotka-Volterra model for competitive communities, I derive general formulae that generate explicit predictions about the changes in average trait values in a community subject to environmental disturbances. These formulae demonstrate that competition can impede the change in average community trait values. However, the impediment is not considerable in comparison to the predominant factors of trait variances and species selection effects when species with the most similar trait values also experience the greatest interspecific competition. Similarly, negative covariances among different traits that confer resistance to the same environmental disturbance will impede their responses. I illustrate these results using phytoplankton data from a whole-lake experiment in which manipulation to the zooplankton community created a disturbance to the phytoplankton that changed the selective consumption of large vs. small phytoplankton.","Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Environm Risk, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3068506, Japan","Tanaka, Y (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Environm Risk, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3068506, Japan.",ytanaka@nies.go.jp,,,"Japan Society of Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science;  [17510027]","This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 17510027 to Y.T.) and Global COE Program E03 Global Eco-Risk Management from Asian Viewpoints from the Japan Society of Promotion of Science.

As an aggregate measure for community properties we employed the mean community trait value as the species traits averaged over an entire community with weighting by relative species abundances. For three particular types of community, in which there was competition for abiotic resources, competition for biotic resources, or species packing on an environmental gradient, we analytically proved that the responses of the mean community trait to environmental change were determined by the total trait range in the community but were weakly associated with the strength of competition and the number of species. These results were provided with simplifying assumptions that the species trait determining the resource utility equally spaced along an univariate resource axis and the competition between species was symmetrical between pairs of competing species and within the entire community. Some numerical simulations based on stochastically-generated communities and randomly-sampled natural communities indicated that relaxation of the simplifying assumptions did not considerably violate the above conclusion. The suggested determinacy of trait dynamics with variable species richness and competition regime implies that aggregated description of communities in terms of trait distributions among composite species is relevant in predicting community responses, in terms of functional traits and ecosystem function, to environmental changes.

In Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, surveys were used to quantify microhabitat use and selectivity in two live-coral specialist damselfishes (Pomacentridae), Chrysiptera parasema, and Dascyllus melanurus. A patch reef experiment was then conducted to test how intra- and interspecific competition interacts with two types of microhabitat to influence survival of recently settled C. parasema. Surveys demonstrated that C. parasema and D. melanurus recruits utilized similar coral microhabitats; 72% of C. parasema and 85% of D. melanurus used corymbose and bottlebrush growth forms of Acropora. One microhabitat type, Pocillopora sp. coral, was commonly used by D. melanurus but rarely by C. parasema. The patch reef experiment revealed that both microhabitat and interspecific competition influence abundance of recently settled C. parasema. Microhabitat had the strongest influence on survival of C. parasema. In the absence of interspecific competitors, 85% of C. parasema survived for 5 days after transplantation to high-complexity bottlebrush Acropora reefs when compared to only 25% survival of Pocillopora reefs. In both microhabitats, interspecific competition with D. melanurus, but not intraspecific competition, significantly decreased the survival of C. parasema. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed distribution of C. parasema results from specialized microhabitat requirements and competition for space in those microhabitats. This study demonstrates that interspecific competition and microhabitat type can interact to influence early post-settlement survival in coral reef fishes, though, whether and how these factors influence survival will depend on the behavioural attributes and strength of habitat associations among potential competitors.","[Bonin, M.

The different models included, singly or in combination, the effects of a putative competitor and a specialist predator on the dynamics of pampas mice. The most simple model, a logistic single-species stochastic differential equation, failed to fit the observed time series satisfactorily (R (model) (2) = 0.36), while models including interspecific effects gave much better fits with increasing model complexity (competition R (model) (2) = 0.71, predation R (model) (2) = 0.62, competition and predation R (model) (2) = 0.83). Using Akaike's information criterion, the competition model was selected as the best alternative with regard to model fit and model complexity. Synthetic time-series probes obtained by simulations from the parameterized stochastic mechanistic models were significantly different and indicated the competition plus predation model as a slightly better alternative than the competition model. The differences between the two methods for selecting models indicate that the incorporation of predation only slightly improves the match between the predicted and observed time series and that this slight improvement is not sufficient to override the increase in model complexity. Competition thus seems to play a more important role than predation in shaping the population dynamics of pampas mice.","Univ Nacl Mar del Plaa, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biol, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina","Kittlein, M (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Mar del Plaa, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biol, Funes 3250 4To Piwo, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina.",kittlein@mdp.edu.ar,,,"International Foundation for Science, SwedenInternational Foundation for Science [C/1706-1]; FONCYT, ArgentinaFONCyT [01-01345]","This research was supported by grants from the International Foundation for Science (C/1706-1), Sweden, and FONCYT (01-01345), Argentina.

Life-history traits that make a species a successful invader are of particular interest in elucidating both invasion success and how interspecific competition may emerge. In southeastern France, the invasion of cedar forests by the seed chalcid Megastigmus schimitscheki generated competitive relationships with the resident M. pinsapinis for the exploitation of the seed resource. Among the numerous ecological traits allowing these seed predators to exploit their niche successfully, the timing of adult emergence, initial egg load and age-specific realized fecundities of females were investigated to help understanding the issue of such interspecific relationships. Spring adult emergence of M. schimitscheki under natural conditions was significantly earlier than that of M. pinsapinis, suggesting that an advantage for the access to the seed resource for the invasive species may be associated with this trait. Initial egg load was significantly higher in M. schimitscheki than in M. pinsapinis and the analysis of age-specific realized fecundity in semi-natural conditions indicated that both M. schimitscheki and M. pinsapinis females lay a large proportion of their eggs during the early days of their lives. In the light of these findings, both earlier phenology and higher reproduction abilities of M. schimitscheki may have the potential to confer an advantage within a competitive context with M. pinsapinis through enhanced seed resource preemption. This may potentially explain the invasiveness of M. schimitscheki in southern France despite the presence of its closely related competitor M. pinsapinis.","[Boivin, Thomas; Rouault, Gaelle; Chalon, Alain; Candau, Jean-Noel] INRA, UR Rech Forestieres Mediterraneennes 629, F-84914 Avignon, France","Boivin, T (corresponding author), INRA, UR Rech Forestieres Mediterraneennes 629, F-84914 Avignon, France.",boivin@avignon.inra.fr,,"Candau, Jean-Noel/0000-0001-9356-3950; Boivin, Thomas/0000-0003-1694-2425",European Marie Curie integration grant (IRG)European Commission,We thank Dr Joel Chadoeuf for insightful discussions on data.

Gradual increases in the abundance and average size of putative abalone predators inside the no-take Maria Island Marine Reserve (MIMR) have coincided with increases in the minimum size of the emergent abalone Haliotis rubra. This suggests that the threat of predation may influence the structuring of abalone populations. The abundance of emergent abalone was negatively associated with predator abundance, especially the rock lobster Jasus edwardsii, inside the MPA and in adjacent fished areas. Abalone leave cryptic habitat at smaller sizes in fished areas compared to abalone inside the MPA. Although the patterns in abalone size at emergence (SAE) were strongly correlated with rock lobster abundance and average size, the abundance of other predators (demersal predatory fish and crabs) or competitors (sea urchins) did not influence the patterns in abalone SAE. However, predation mortality in isolation could not account for the differences we observed in abalone size frequency distributions between MPA and adjacent fished locations. We suggest that a combination of factors including predation, intra and interspecific competitive interactions are responsible for patterns in abalone SAE.","[Pederson, H. G.; Barrett, N.

In this study, we show that there is variation in competitive ability between two clones of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, both of which out-compete a clone of the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae, in the laboratory. We tested whether this variation in competitive ability would alter the outcome of interspecific competition in the field. White one pea aphid clone followed the pattern set in the laboratory, out-competing the Megoura viciae clone, another showed the reverse effect with Megoura viciae dominating. These differences appear to be the result of variation in early population growth rate between the pea aphid clones, rather than predation, although predation did lead to the eventual extinction of colonies. We also questioned whether intra- and interspecific differences in predator escape behaviour could affect the outcome of competition in the field. All three clones responded similarly to the presence of foraging hoverfly larvae (Episyrphus balteatus), but the Megoura viciae clone dropped from the plant significantly less often in response to the presence of a foraging two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata). This work provides evidence that intraspecific variation in competitive ability can alter the outcome of interspecific competitive interactions in nature and suggests that species-specific behavioural. traits may have the potential to modify the outcome of these interactions.

A number of invasions in the family Tephritidae (fruit flies) have been observed worldwide despite quarantine procedures. In this review, the potential importance of interspecific competition and competitive displacement among different tephritid species is evaluated in the context of recent invasions. 2. Where polyphagous tephritid species have been introduced in areas already occupied by a polyphagous tephritid, interspecific competition has resulted in a decrease in number and niche shift of the pre-established species. No reciprocal invasions have been observed. 3. The data on tephritid invasions seem to support a hierarchical mode of competition; however, complete exclusion usually did not occur. Indeed, tephritid distribution and abundance are markedly structured by various abiotic (mostly climatic) and biotic (host plants) factors. 4. The primary determinant of competitive interactions in near-optimal conditions, such as lowlands with abundant fruit plantations, is probably the life-history strategy. The r-K gradient could be used as a predictor of potential invaders, because K traits (such as large adult size) may favour both exploitation and interference competition. 5. For future research, a better understanding of competition mechanisms seems essential. Different species competing in the same area should be compared with respect to: (i) demographic parameters, (ii) the outcome of experimental co-infestations on the same fruit, and (iii) behavioural and chemical interference mechanisms.","CIRAD Pole Protect Plantes, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu T, 7 Chemin IRAT, F-97410 St Pierre, Reunion, France; CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34033 Montpellier, France","Duyck, PF (corresponding author), CIRAD Pole Protect Plantes, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu T, 7 Chemin IRAT, F-97410 St Pierre, Reunion, France.",duyck@cirad.fr,"Duyck, Pierre-Francois/C-2416-2008; BPA, UPR SDC/B-8097-2009","Duyck, Pierre-Francois/0000-0001-5484-1970; ",,,,86,153,168,3,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

We tested for potential relationships among numbers of bark beetles, conspecifics and competitors, and predators within and among flight seasons to help identify factors affecting population densities. The two most common bark beetle species obtained were Ips pini (Say) and Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff). The predominant predators obtained were Thanasimus dubius (F.) (Cleridae), Platysoma cylindrica (Paykull) (Histeridae), and Platysoma parallelum Say. Declining stands contained significantly more Ips than did healthy stands during the early portion of the season. Healthy stands had more predators than declining stands. There were strong delayed inverse relationships between L pini and predators at the site level, both within and between flight seasons. The number of L pini caught during the late portion of the season was lower when each of the above predators was more abundant earlier in the season, during both 1998 and 1999. Likewise, numbers of L pini and I grandicollis caught during the early portion of the year were inversely related to numbers of predators caught during the previous year. Although Ips trap counts showed significant correlations with each predator species, simple predator-prey models did not necessarily improve fits based on habitat quality (i.e., Ips numbers regressed on prior Ips numbers). We did not observe evidence for interspecific competition among Ips spp. This pattern is consistent with the view that host plant quality and predation jointly affect L pini and L grandicollis population dynamics. These results emphasize the importance of interactions among host tree physiology, predation, and dispersal in the population dynamics of phloeophagous herbivores, and have implications to forest management.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Biometry Program, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Erbilgin, N (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Div Insect Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Erbilgin, Nadir/F-3675-2014","Erbilgin, Nadir/0000-0001-9912-8095",,,,58,39,41,0,16,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

I used a number of experiments to document competitor-induced behavior and morphology in wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica), to quantify how competitor-induced changes affected subsequent competitive ability, and to investigate the cues responsible for the competitor-induced response. Competitors induced wood frogs to increase their activity and generally develop larger bodies and smaller tails. Further, wood frogs were able to discriminate between intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Whereas behavioral responses to competitors are well documented, the widespread morphological responses are a new discovery; these responses are particularly intriguing because they are in the opposite direction of predator-induced responses in tadpoles. The competitor-induced phenotypes are not simply an allometric effect, but appear to be adaptive responses to competitors; competitor-induced wood frogs experienced higher relative growth rates than noninduced wood frogs in subsequent performance trials, but past studies suggest that the competitor-induced phenotype should experience higher predation risk. When responding to competition, wood frogs were not responding only to reduced food. They were able to sense changes in both the per capita food levels and changes in density (per unit volume) that were independent of per capita food level. Thus, these animals have an amazing ability to sense changes in their environments and respond in very precise ways. When one considers competitor-induced responses in light of past studies on predator-induced phenotypes in larval anurans, one sees that predator-induced traits provide individuals with increased predator resistance but decreased competitive ability, whereas competitor-induced traits provide individuals with increased competitive ability but decreased predator resistance. This suggests that predator- and competitor-induced plasticity have evolved an intricate link that presents a trade-off between competitive ability and predator resistance ability. This trade-off is common across species and makes sense in light of the environments in which wood frogs live, ranging from ponds with high densities of predators and few tadpoles competing to ponds with few predators and extremely high densities of tadpoles competing. Further, there is evidence that this type of plasticity trade-off might be quite common in other phenotypically plastic taxa.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea+@pitt.edu,,,,,,106,181,187,0,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

In support of this, many cases of divergent character displacement between close relatives (congeners) are known. Yet, experimental tests of underlying mechanisms are uncommon. In a pond experiment with threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.), we tested the prediction that competition between species should decline as character divergence proceeds, yielding descendants whose present-day interaction is a 'ghost' of its former strength. Competition's impact on the marine threespine stickleback (G. aculeatus) was contrasted between two treatments simulating early and late stages of a hypothesized character displacement series that began at the end of the last ice age when marine sticklebacks colonized lakes containing an earlier descendant. Growth rate and niche specialization of marine stickle-backs were higher in the 'post-displacement' treatment than in the 'pre-displacement' treatment, suggesting a decline in competition strength through time. The result supports the idea that interspecific competition favoured divergence between sympatric sticklebacks, with reduced competition the outcome. The influence of other interactions on divergence between sympatric species may be tested with analogous experimental designs.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Ctr Biodivers Res, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Schluter, D (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",,"Langerhans, R.

The classical model is described by a set of ordinary differential equations, one for each species. Mortality is density dependent, including both intraspecific and interspecific competition. Fecundity may depend on the type of species but is density independent. Depending on the relative strengths of interspecific and intraspecific competition and on the fecundities, the parameter space for the classical model is divided into regions where either coexistence, competitive exclusion or founder control occur. The spatial version is a continuous time Markov profess in which individuals are located on the d-dimensional integer lattice. Their dynamics are described by a set of local rules which have the same components as the classical model. Our main results for the spatial stochastic version can be summarized as follows. Local competitive interactions between species result in (1) a reduction of the parameter region where coexistence occurs in the classical model, (2) a reduction of the parameter region where founder control occurs in the classical model, and (3) spatial segregation of the two species in parts of the parameter region where the classical model predicts coexistence.","Univ Minnesota, Sch Math, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Neuhauser, C (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Math, 127 Vincent Hall,206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",nhauser@math.umn.edu; steve@eno-princeton.edu,,"Neuhauser, Claudia/0000-0001-8932-675X",,,,33,112,112,3,36,INST MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS-IMS,CLEVELAND,"3163 SOMERSET DR, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",1050-5164,,,ANN APPL PROBAB,Ann.

We manipulated woody and herbaceous vegetation in the neighborhoods of > 685 trees on four sites in the Oregon Coast Range for Eve years. We sought the best neighborhood expression of interspecific competition by systematically examining the influence of various measures of woody-neighbor abundance, height, distance, and spatial arrangement in regression models that predict the annual basal area and height growth of Douglas-fir. We identified the optimum neighborhood height and radius for each year. Visual estimates of shrub species cover provided the best assessment of neighbor abundance. Stratifying the neighborhood by the height of shrubs relative to the height of the Douglas-fir improved regression models and quantified patterns of competitive asymmetry. Differences in the response of Douglas-fir height and basal area to neighborhood height suggested that neighbor influences on height growth were asymmetric, while effects on basal area growth were symmetric. Shrub neighbors whose crowns intermingled with that of the Douglas-fir had the greatest influence on Douglas-fir growth and defined the optimum neighborhood radius. The competitive influence of neighboring shrubs decreased rapidly as their distance increased beyond the optimum neighborhood radius. Accounting for neighbor spatial arrangement using two measures of angular dispersion did not improve the models. The best neighborhood dimensions for Douglas-fir seedlings changed with time, apparently with the dynamics of vertical structure in the plant community. The neighborhood approach was effective for (1) evaluating various approaches forest managers might use to quantify competing vegetation, (2) examining the dynamics of competitive effects, (3) quantifying asymmeteric competition, (4) determining the relative competitive effects of woody and herbaceous vegetation, and (5) documenting the differing response of tree height and basal area growth to neighboring plants.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Wagner, RG (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Cooperat Forestry Res Unit, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",,,,,,,62,67,68,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Both species have persisted in the lake for decades, but their water-column densities are negatively correlated. The larger Daphnia pulicaria dominates in some years, the smaller D. galeata mendotae in others, and in some years one species replaces the other seasonally. Although this pattern results in part from annual variation in vertebrate predation pressure, predation alone cannot explain the irregular daphnid dynamics. In 1992-1995, I examined the water-column abundances, birth and death rates of both species. D. pulicaria dominated in two years, D. galeata mendotae was replaced by D. pulicaria in one year and in 1994, both species persisted in low numbers. To test the effect of temporal changes on the strength of intra- and interspecific competition on both juvenile and adult daphnids, I manipulated a series of field enclosures in 1994 and 1995. The outcome of competition varied within and between years, and its effects were most evident at the highest densities and lowest resource levels. For adults of both species, the effects of interspecific competition were detected more often than those of intraspecific competition. Lipid reserves (a metric of fitness) among juveniles were generally low, with those of D. galeata mendotae often being less than those of D. pulicaria. Contrary to the results of other studies examining competition in daphnids, spatial segregation and predictable within year reversals in competitive dominance most likely do not play a large role in fostering coexistence of the Oneida Lake daphnids. Instead, coexistence of these competitors is promoted by interannual variation and long-lived diapausing eggs.","Cornell Univ, Ecol & Systemat Sect, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Caceres, CE (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",caceres@mail.inhs.uiuc.edu,,,,,,69,44,45,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,233,244,,10.1007/s004420050512,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700029,28308457,,,,2021-09-21,

Previous studies showed that the competitive displacement occurs rapidly and is facilitated by clumped insect resources. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of displacement is primarily due to differences in the ability of each species to exploit insect resources. (1) These species show nearly complete diet overlap. (2) Insects are a limiting resource for both geckos as evidenced by positive demographic effects with increased insect abundance. (3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris. (4) This reduced resource acquisition translates into significant reductions in the body condition, fecundity, and survivorship of L. lugubris individuals. (5) Evidence for interference (and other) mechanisms does not account for these negative demographic effects on L. lugubris. Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for L. lugubris, with increasing L. lugubris density having negligible effect on H. frenatus, mirroring the asymmetry of the large-scale displacement. The superior harvesting ability of H. frenatus is most pronounced when insects are clumped spatially and temporally, and is attributable to a variety of species-specific traits such as their larger body size, faster running speed, and reduced intraspecific interference while foraging. We conclude that clumped resources can increase interspecific exploitation competition, and this mechanism may contribute to species turnover when human environmental alterations redistribute resources.","UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, DEPT BIOL 0116, LA JOLLA, CA 92117 USA",,,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Petren, Kenneth/0000-0002-7936-6042",,,,44,222,237,1,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1996,77,1,,,,,118,132,,10.2307/2265661,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TR079,WOS:A1996TR07900014,,,,,2021-09-21,

I examined the behavioral mechanisms that permit these species to coexist with their predatory congener, A. opacum. I asked whether the two prey species differ in their vulnerability to predation and in their use of structural and spatial refugia when under the risk of predation; such interspecific variation may allow predation to contribute indirectly to prey coexistence. Larval A. maculatum (the superior forager) was more vulnerable to predation by A. opacum than was A, talpoideum, and only the latter species significantly increased its use of structural refugia (leaf litter) in the presence of the predator. In pond enclosures, both species of prey exhibited diel patterns of microhabitat use; significantly more larvae occupied shallow regions of enclosures during the day and migrated to deeper water (a spatial refugium) at night. However, when considered separately, neither (1) the presence of a predatory larval A. opacum nor (2) an increased density of intra- and interspecific competitors significantly altered this habitat shift for either prey species. Rather, diel microhabitat usage in A. talpoideum was significantly affected by an interaction between predator presence and competitor density. My results demonstrate the importance of refugia to coexistence in this predator-prey assemblage. Furthermore, predation by A. opacum may mediate prey competition; that is, preferential consumption of A. maculatun may reduce the competitive impact of this superior forager on A. talpoideum, thus enhancing their coexistence.",,"WALLS, SC (corresponding author), CUNY CITY COLL, DEPT BIOL, 138TH ST & CONVENT AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10031 USA.",,,"Walls, Susan/0000-0001-7391-9155",,,,68,40,41,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1995,101,1,,,,,86,93,,10.1007/BF00328904,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QE054,WOS:A1995QE05400012,28306980,,,,2021-09-21,

Tephritid fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) include some of the most destructive pests of fruit and vegetable crops worldwide. Parasitoid guilds of fruit-infesting tephritids are dominated by opiines (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Opiinae) that have been the main agents used for biological control of pest tephritids. All opiine parasitoids are solitary koinobiont endoparasitoids that attack host eggs or larvae and emerge as adults from host puparia. Thus, a host initially attacked by an egg-larval parasitoid can be subsequently attacked by a larval parasitoid, providing an ideal system to test the Earlyacting Competitive Superiority Hypothesis (i.e., the first species occupying a host or exploiting early host stages has an advantage over competitive species). We reviewed the literature on interspecific competition among opiine fruit fly parasitoids, which reveals strong evidence supporting the early-acting competitive superiority hypothesis by egg-larval over larval parasitoids, through physiological suppression mechanisms. Competitive outcomes among larval parasitoids, however, depend on early action as well as the morphological characteristics used in direct physical competition of their first instars (e.g., size of mandibles). We discuss the range of ecological mechanisms facilitating coexistence of interacting species and highlight the ecological consequences of interspecific competition as evidenced by historical competitive displacements of introduced opiine parasitoids for biocontrol of tephritids. Finally, we provide a framework for exploring the role of interspecific competition, among other factors, in selecting opiine parasitoids for biocontrol of invasive tephritids.","[Wang, Xingeng; Hoelmer, Kim A.] USDA ARS, Beneficial Insects Intro Res Unit, Newark, DE 19713 USA; [Ramadan, Mohsen M.] State Hawaii Dept Agr, Div Plant Ind, Honolulu, HI USA; [Guerrieri, Emilio] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Sustainable Plant Protect, Portici, Italy; [Messing, Russell H.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Plant & Environm Protect Sci, Kapaa, HI USA; [Johnson, Marshall W.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Daane, Kent M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Wang, XG (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Beneficial Insects Intro Res Unit, Newark, DE 19713 USA.",xingeng.wang@usda.gov,,,,,,117,0,0,3,3,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1049-9644,1090-2112,,BIOL CONTROL,Biol.

Consequently, species that reduce competition by adapting to specialize on a specific resource should be morphologically disparate to sympatric contemporaries and show evidence of phenotypic specialization. However, few studies have compared the morphologies of specialist and generalist competitors. In this context, we compare the feeding morphology and diet of an obligate, specialist, bird-egg-eating snake to three sympatric generalists that only facultatively consume bird eggs. We measured and compared body and head morphology of preserved museum specimens of each of four, syntopic snake species from southern Africa: the obligate bird-egg-eating rhombic egg-eater (Dasypeltis scabra), and the facultative bird-egg-eating boomslang (Dispholidus typus), cape cobra (Naja nivea) and mole snake (Pseudaspis cana). Given the physical challenges of consuming bird eggs in snakes, we predicted that consumption of bird eggs would be facilitated by the evolution of relatively larger heads in the smaller-bodied Dasypeltis. We found that head size was not phylogenetically conserved in the clades of these taxa and that contrary to our expectations, the specialist egg-eaters evolved to possess significantly smaller heads relative to body size than their competitors. We found a positive relationship between dietary niche breadth and head size within these species and their close relatives. Thus, relatively large-headed species have evolved diverse diets that overlap with the restricted diets of the small-headed specialist thereby producing this atypical competitive interaction. Our findings suggest that specialized adaptations can decouple typical body-size-constrained competition dynamics between sympatric snake species and highlight the complexity of the origins of dietary specialization.","[Barends, J.

However, the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution in deep-time has been predominantly investigated using trait evolutionary models which assume that lineages evolve independently from each other. Consequently, the role of species interactions in driving macroevolutionary dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we quantify the prevalence for signatures of competition between related species in the evolution of ecomorphological traits across the bird radiation. We find that mechanistic trait models accounting for the effect of species interactions on phenotypic divergence provide the best fit for the data on at least one trait axis in 27 out of 59 clades ranging between 21 and 195 species. Where it occurs, the signature of competition generally coincides with positive species diversity-dependence, driven by the accumulation of lineages with similar ecologies, and we find scarce evidence for trait-dependent or negative diversity-dependent phenotypic evolution. Overall, our results suggest that the footprint of interspecific competition is often eroded in long-term patterns of phenotypic diversification, and that other selection pressures may predominantly shape ecomorphological diversity among extant species at macroevolutionary scales.","[Chira, A.

A multitrophic species foraging system was established in the laboratory to investigate how starvation and a rapa whelk (Rapana venosa) affect the behavior of swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) preying on Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum). We calculated the predation rate and quantified the foraging behavior and encounter behavior between predators. Under no starvation (0 d) and short-term starvation (3 d), the interactions between crab and whelk, including intraguild predation and kleptoparasitism, were relatively weak, which did not have the significant impacts on crab. However, the interspecific interactions were intensified by the long-term starvation (6-12 d). Specifically, the probability of intraguild predation was increased, but crab did not obtain revenue from preying on whelk. These made crab reduces the investments for foraging on clams, such as the decreasing of handling time and probability of capture upon encounter. Additionally, the active foraging of whelk stimulated the occurrence of kleptoparasitism under long-term starvation, promoting the foraging of crab partly, included the increasing of encounter rate with clam and probability of consumption upon capture. In long-term starvation treatments, the positive effects provided by whelk perhaps were swamped by the negative effects of intraguild predation, which impeded the foraging behaviors of crab, resulting in the decline of predation rate of crab eventually.","[Liu, Dapeng; Su, Xianpeng; Wang, Fang; Sun, Yunfei] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Mariculture, Minist Educ, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Funct Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, 1 Wenhai Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Dasen] Minist Agr, Dev Ctr Sci & Technol, 96 Dongsanhuan Nan Rd, Beijing 100020, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Dan] Tianjin Agr Univ, Dept Fisheries Sci, Tianjin Key Lab Aquaecol & Aquaculture, 22 Jinjing Rd, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China","Wang, F (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Mariculture, Minist Educ, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Wang, F (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Funct Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, 1 Wenhai Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wangfang249@ouc.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of Shandong ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2018MC028]; Scientific and Technological Innovation Project - Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology [2015ASKJ02],"This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (No: ZR2018MC028), and the Scientific and Technological Innovation Project Financially Supported by Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (No: 2015ASKJ02).",,58,3,3,1,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0044-8486,1873-5622,,AQUACULTURE,Aquaculture,APR 15,2019,504,,,,,,22,29,,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.01.050,,,8,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,HN1QS,WOS:000459962400004,,,,,2021-09-21,

Here, we examine the role of seasonality in moderating interactions between a globally important invasive mysid shrimp (Hemimysis anomala) and an ecologically similar native species (Mysis salemaai) by combining distribution and diet surveys with experimental quantification of comparative resource exploitation rates and mutual aggressive interactions. We found partial overlap in winter, but not summer horizontal distributions of the two species. Diets were highly similar in the seasonally overlapping range, potentially resulting in competition for the high-quality, but seasonally scarce, zooplankton prey in invaded lakes. Despite its smaller size, H. anomala had similar feeding rates to M. salemaai on three key zooplankton prey species. H. anomala was more aggressive toward M. salemaai than M. salemaai was toward H. anomala, although there was no evidence for intraguild predation. Our findings indicate that spatio-temporal niche partitioning permitted invasion by H. anomala and coexistence with M. salemaai, in spite of their high trophic similarity.","[Penk, Marcin R.; Donohue, Ian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Irvine, Kenneth] UNESCO IHE Inst Water & Educ, Delft, Netherlands","Penk, MR (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",penkm@tcd.ie,"Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013","Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064; Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991","Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [ECS/2009/01]; Ecological Consultancy Services Limited [ECS/2009/01]",We thank Magda Gluza and Tomek Pia. tek for help in the field.

Invasive alien species are a major threat to biodiversity. In addition to predation and parasitism, native species might suffer from competition when invasive alien species occupy a similar ecological niche. 2. This study focused on the potential interspecific interaction between two hornets: the Asian yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, a high-concern invasive alien species recently arrived in Europe; and the native European hornet, Vespa crabro. The two species share a similar ecological niche and V. velutina is rapidly expanding across Europe, which suggests that V. crabro might suffer from competition. 3. Under laboratory-controlled conditions, two life-history traits that might cause the two species to compete were investigated: (i) the ability of workers to find food sources and their flexibility in exploiting them (through individual food item choice tests and exploration assays); and (ii) the worker resistance to pathogens (through immune challenge tests). 4. The results show that trophic preference of both species highly overlaps, with a marked dietary preference for honeybees compared with other insect prey and non-prey protein items. No differences were observed in the exploratory behaviour of both species. Finally, constitutive antibacterial activity was greater in workers of the native species than in workers of the invasive hornet. 5. This laboratory study provides a first assessment under controlled conditions of the factors affecting competition between workers of two hornet species and proposes a framework to assess, in wild contexts, the magnitude of the competition and the impact of the introduced V. velutina on the native V. crabro.","[Cini, Alessandro; Cappa, Federico; Petrocelli, Iacopo; Pepiciello, Irene; Cervo, Rita] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Biol, Florence, Italy; [Bortolotti, Laura] CREA, Unita Ric Apicoltura & Bachicoltura, Bologna, Italy; [Cini, Alessandro; Cappa, Federico; Petrocelli, Iacopo] UCL, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England","Cini, A (corresponding author), UCL, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",cini.ales@gmail.com,"Cappa, Federico/AAF-8489-2020; Bortolotti, Laura/ABD-9669-2020; Cini, Alessandro/A-4156-2009; CERVO, Rita/B-5441-2018","Bortolotti, Laura/0000-0001-7372-1579; Cini, Alessandro/0000-0003-0355-2188; CERVO, Rita/0000-0002-0405-6402; PEPICIELLO, IRENE/0000-0003-4280-7171","Universita degli studi di Firenze; UNAPI; FC; 'Programma Interreg Italia-Francia Marittimo. -La cooperazione al cuore del Mediterraneo', axe II","We wish to thank F.

Morphology and swimming performance are two important fitness-related traits in fishes. Both traits are essential in acquiring and defending resources as well as avoiding predation. Here, we examined if interspecific competition could induce changes in morphology and affect the swimming performance of two strains of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We imposed competitive scenarios on the fish using artificial streams containing different combinations of four interspecific competitors. Exposure to interspecific competitors induced morphological changes over time, through the development of deeper bodies, whereas controls free of interspecific competitors developed more fusiform body shapes. Furthermore, swimming performance was correlated to fusiform morphologies and was weaker for Atlantic salmon in competitive scenarios vs. controls. This implies that interspecific competition has direct effects on these fitness-related traits in Atlantic salmon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that morphology, an important fitness-related trait linked to swimming performance, has been shown to be negatively impacted through interactions with an interspecific competitor.","[Smith, A.

Infra-guild predation (IGP) has been suggested as the main mechanism causing such species displacements. This study elucidates a mechanism for species displacement that is based on competition for shelter, viz, species excluding each other from a shelter place. Preferences of Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus roeselii for shelter space were studied in laboratory experiments. In contrast with night conditions both species showed a strong preference for shelter sites under daytime conditions so that all experiments were carried out under permanent light conditions. Single individuals of D. villosus sheltered more than those of G. roeselii. Intraspecific competition experiments with different size classes and sexes showed that in contrast with D. villosus, the size class had a significant effect on the mean sheltering proportion of individuals of G. roeselii. When both species were brought together in a basin with a shelter site to test interspecific competition, individuals of G. roeselii were actively pushed out of their shelters within 24 h, while D. villosus showed no change in shelter. This led to a significantly increased predation risk for G. roeselii, which was confirmed in an experiment in which a benthic fish was added. IGP only manifested itself after 48h, indicating that competition for shelter preceded IGP When shelter opportunities are in short supply, shelter exclusion may be one of the initial mechanisms for gammarid species displacements.","[de Gelder, S.; van der Velde, G.; Leung, N.; Hendriks, H.

The invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridisPallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is implicated in declines of native ladybirds with intraguild predation identified as an underlying mechanism, however, less studied are the effects on non-coccinellid predators. Intraguild predation between Anthocoris nemoralisFabricius (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) and H. axyridis and the relative effects of inter- and intraspecific competition on predators on potted Tilia cordata Mill. was investigated, at two aphid densities. 2. Intraguild predation was unidirectional in favour of H. axyridis in Petri dishes although a low level of ladybird egg predation by A. nemoralis occurred. However, on trees intraguild predation was rare. 3. A positive effect of aphid density on H. axyridis weight gain, and increased survival when reared with A. nemoralis on potted trees indicated stronger effects of intraspecific competition on H. axyridis. Consistent suppression of aphids by ladybirds revealed their superior competition for aphids. 4. Anthocoris nemoralis weight gain was reduced when reared with H. axyridis on potted trees, indicating a potential for a sublethal effect through interspecific competition. Survivorship of A. nemoralis did not differ between con- and heterospecific treatments, but high aphid density enhanced A. nemoralis survival. Overall, high mortality among nymphs across treatments suggested effects related to both inter- and intraspecific competition for resources. 5. Results provide evidence of a sublethal effect by invasive H. axyridis through resource competition, suggesting that where these predators co-occur, competitive interactions for shared prey are more likely to affect A. nemoralis populations than intraguild predation by H. axyridis.","[Howe, Andy G.; Ravn, Hans P.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Ransijn, Johannes] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Disturbance Ecol, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany","Howe, AG (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",andy@ign.ku.dk,"Howe, Andy G./A-8259-2015","Howe, Andy G./0000-0002-7460-5227",University of Copenhagen; Villum Fonden,"We thank four anonymous reviewers for their insightful suggestions to improve an earlier version.

Still, in models of two prey sharing a resource and a predator, predator-mediated coexistence occurs only over narrow ranges of resource productivity. These models have so far ignored the widespread feature of ontogenetic diet shifts in predators. Here, we theoretically explore the consequences of a diet shift from juvenile to adult predator stages for coexistence of two competing prey. We find that only very minor deviations from perfectly identical diets in juveniles and adults destroy the traditional mechanism of predator-mediated coexistence, which requires an intrinsic trade-off between prey defendedness and competitive ability. Instead, predator population structure can create an emergent competition-predation trade-off between prey, where a bottleneck in one predator stage enhances predation on the superior competitor and relaxes predation on the inferior competitor, irrespective of the latter's intrinsic defendedness. Pronounced diet shifts therefore greatly enlarge the range of prey coexistence along a resource gradient. With diet shifts, however, coexistence usually occurs as one of two alternative states and, once lost, may not be easily restored.","[Wollrab, Sabine; Diehl, Sebastian] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [de Roos, Andre M.] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Diehl, Sebastian] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Wollrab, S (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",wollrabs@msu.edu,"De Roos, Andre M./A-1590-2008; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Wollrab, Sabine/H-2905-2017","De Roos, Andre M./0000-0002-6944-2048; Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; Wollrab, Sabine/0000-0003-2430-4845",German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [DI745/7-1],The research has been supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG grant no.

Over 13 mo we used 24 remote video-camera traps to monitor habitat use of sympatric chimpanzee, gorilla and elephant in four different habitat types in Loango National Park, Gabon. Habitat use by each species was predicted to vary according to seasonal changes in food availability and precipitation. Increased interspecific competition between the three species was expected at times of reduced resource availability, leading to exclusion of the inferior competitor. Supporting the predictions, species abundance per habitat showed seasonal variation: all three species responded positively to increased fruit availability in all habitats, but the response was only significant for gorilla in mature forest and elephant in coastal forest. Responses to rainfall varied, with the chimpanzee responding negatively to rainfall in swamp forest, the gorilla responding positively to rainfall in coastal and secondary forest, and the elephant responding positively to rainfall in mature forest. Elephant presence resulted in competitive exclusion of the apes under certain conditions: the chimpanzee was excluded by the elephant where fruit availability was low, whereas the gorilla was excluded by the elephant in areas of low herb density despite high fruit availability. Our results emphasize the value of applying a multi-species, longer-term approach to studying variation in habitat use among sympatric species and highlight the impact competitors can exert on one another's distribution.","[Head, Josephine S.; Robbins, Martha M.; Mundry, Roger; Makaga, Loic; Boesch, Christophe] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Primatol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Mundry, Roger] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Dev & Comparat Psychol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Head, JS (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Primatol, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",head@eva.mpg.de,,,Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society; BHP Billiton,"We thank the Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux (ANPN), the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique (CENAREST) and the Institut de Recherche en Ecology Tropicale (IRET) of Gabon for their collaboration and for permission to conduct our research in Loango National Park.

Mathematical method: We present a game-theoretic model that investigates trade-offs between efficient nutrient harvest and neighbour pre-emption as evolutionarily stable strategies. The model builds upon previous game-theoretic models by incorporating potential differences in uptake capacity among competing plants, and by extending the model to interspecific competition. Key assumptions: We assume that plants exhibit plasticity in growth that is informed by cues in the environment. We also assume that soil resources are limiting while light is not limiting to plant growth, and root costs increase linearly with root biomass. Finally, we assume a spatially implicit soil environment with infinite mixing of nutrients. Conclusions: The model predicts plants should invest primarily in efficient nutrient harvest when soil fertility is low, per-root costs are high or uptake ability is low. Under these conditions, the plants produce fewer roots when neighbours are present compared with when grown alone. Alternatively, when soil fertility is high, per-root costs are low or uptake ability is high, the plants should invest heavily in more roots than are necessary to harvest available nutrients, thus pre-empting their neighbours. Under these conditions, the plants produce more roots compared with when grown alone.","[McNickle, Gordon G.; Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","McNickle, GG (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, 845 W Taylor St MC066, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",mcnickle@uic.edu,"McNickle, Gord/AAB-4871-2019; McNickle, Gordon G/F-3699-2017","McNickle, Gord/0000-0002-7188-7265; McNickle, Gordon G/0000-0002-7188-7265",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank J.F.

Understanding the interaction among predators and between predation and climate is critical to understanding the mechanisms for compensatory mortality. We used data from 1999 radio-marked neonatal elk (Cervus elaphus) calves from 12 populations in the north-western United States to test for effects of predation on neonatal survival, and whether predation interacted with climate to render mortality compensatory. 2. Weibull survival models with a random effect for each population were fit as a function of the number of predator species in a community (3-5), seven indices of climatic variability, sex, birth date, birth weight, and all interactions between climate and predators. Cumulative incidence functions (CIF) were used to test whether the effects of individual species of predators were additive or compensatory. 3. Neonatal elk survival to 3 months declined following hotter previous summers and increased with higher May precipitation, especially in areas with wolves and/or grizzly bears. Mortality hazards were significantly lower in systems with only coyotes (Canis latrans), cougars (Puma concolor) and black bears (Ursus americanus) compared to higher mortality hazards experienced with gray wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus horribilis). 4. In systems with wolves and grizzly bears, mortality by cougars decreased, and predation by bears was the dominant cause of neonatal mortality. Only bear predation appeared additive and occurred earlier than other predators, which may render later mortality by other predators compensatory as calves age. Wolf predation was low and most likely a compensatory source of mortality for neonatal elk calves. 5. Functional redundancy and interspecific competition among predators may combine with the effects of climate on vulnerability to predation to drive compensatory mortality of neonatal elk calves. The exception was the evidence for additive bear predation. These results suggest that effects of predation by recovering wolves on neonatal elk survival, a contentious issue for management of elk populations, may be less important than the composition of the predator community. Future studies would benefit by synthesizing overwinter calf and adult-survival data sets, ideally from experimental studies, to test the roles of predation in annual compensatory and additive mortality of elk.","[Griffin, Kathleen A.; Hebblewhite, Mark; Robinson, Hugh S.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Zager, Peter] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Lewiston, ID 83501 USA; [Barber-Meyer, Shannon M.] Teton Sci Sch, Kelly, WY 83011 USA; [Christianson, David; Creel, Scott] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Harris, Nyeema C.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hurley, Mark A.] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Salmon, ID 83467 USA; [Jackson, DeWaine H.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, Roseburg, OR 97470 USA; [Johnson, Bruce K.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Myers, Woodrow L.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Spokane, WA 99216 USA; [Raithel, Jarod D.] Kihei Charter Sch, Kihei, HI 96753 USA; [Schlegel, Mike] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Kamiah, ID 83536 USA; [Smith, Bruce L.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Jackson, WY 83001 USA; [White, Craig] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Boise, ID 83707 USA; [White, P.

Detritus type has been shown to affect interspecific competitive outcomes between Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes aegypti (L.) larvae under controlled conditions. We assessed the relationships among spatial distributions of detritus types, nutrients, and aquatic larvae of these species in nature. We collected mosquitoes, water, and detritus from artificial containers across 24 Florida cemeteries that varied in relative abundances of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We measured nutrient content of fine particulate organic matter in water samples as total N, P, and C and ratios of these nutrients. We quantified food availability via a bioassay, raising individual Aedes larvae in the laboratory in standard volumes of field-collected, particulate-containing water from each cemetery. Quantities of detritus types collected in standard containers were significant predictors of nutrients and nutrient ratios. Nutrient abundances were significant predictors of relative abundance of Ae. aegypti, and of larval survival and development by both species in the bioassay. Survival and development of larvae reared in particulate-containing water from sites decreased with decreasing relative abundance of Ae. aegypti. These data suggest that N, P, and C availabilities are determined by detritus inputs to containers and that these nutrients in turn determine the feeding environment encountered by larvae, the intensity of interspecific competition among larvae, and subsequent relative abundances of species at sites. Detritus inputs, nutrients, and food availability thus seem to contribute to distributions of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in cemetery containers throughout Florida.","[Murrell, Ebony G.; Damal, Kavitha; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Lounibos, L.

We analysed habitat preferences of two top avian predators, Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus, a medium-sized diurnal raptor, and Eagle Owl Bubo bubo, a large nocturnal raptor. These two species are known to compete for preferred nest-sites, and proximity to cliffs with Eagle Owls may reduce Peregrine breeding output through predation of young Falcons. We investigated the environmental factors affecting occurrence and coexistence of the two species and the potential role of habitat suitability in favouring co-occurrence in 3519 km2 of the central pre-Alps of Italy, where the two species breed on cliffs and sometimes co-occur on the same cliff. Peregrines settled on long, steep and favourably orientated cliffs in woodland landscapes close to urban areas. Eagle Owls settled on topographically similar cliffs, but in lower rainfall areas compared with cliffs occupied by Peregrines and cliffs unoccupied by either species. Sites where the two species co-occurred were characterized by more horizontally extended cliffs compared with sites of exclusive occurrence of each species. An analysis of relative habitat suitability revealed that sites where the two species co-occurred had the highest predicted probability of occupancy for both species, suggesting that those sites should be regarded as high-quality sites. Breeding productivity of Eagle Owls was negatively affected by the co-occurrence of Peregrines, whereas the effect of Eagle Owl proximity on Peregrine productivity varied according to cliff suitability for the Peregrines. Habitat selection had fitness consequences for Eagle Owls because breeding productivity increased with cliff length. Environmental conditions, particularly climatic factors, could allow the widespread coexistence of these competing raptors at the landscape scale, whereas at the local scale co-occurrence could take place only on larger cliffs. These were preferred sites for both species, presumably because breeding at such sites offsets the costs of settling close to the competitor species.","[Rubolini, Diego] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Biol, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Brambilla, Mattia] Fdn Lombardia Ambiente Settore Biodiversita & Are, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Bassi, Enrico] Parco Nazl Stelvio, I-23032 Bormio, SO, Italy; [Ceci, Chiara] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Sci Umane Formaz Riccardo Massa, I-20126 Milan, Italy","Rubolini, D (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dipartimento Biol, Via Celoria 26, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",diego.rubolini@unimi.it,"Rubolini, Diego/F-2851-2011","Rubolini, Diego/0000-0003-2703-5783; Brambilla, Mattia/0000-0002-7643-4652",,,,55,14,15,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,APR,2010,152,2,,,,,310,322,,,,,13,Ornithology,Zoology,571OR,WOS:000275764100008,,,,,2021-09-21,

This study tested whether these changes in gammaridean dominance could have been determined by interspecific competition and unequal mortality, for example by intraguild predation (IGP). Single and two species tests have been carried out in aquariums provided with all substrata present in the main channel of the Rhine. Changes in substratum choice, increased swimming activity and increased mortality of a species were used as indicators of interspecific competition during interaction between gammaridean species. Interspecific competition and mortality between the most abundant invasive gammaridean species in the Rhine, viz. Gammarus tigrinus, Echinogammarus ischnus and Dikerogammarus villosus were tested. In single-species experiments, G. tigrinus and D. villosus showed similar preferences for a stony substratum, whereas E. ischnus mostly occupied the water column. The two-species aquarium experiments indicated direct interference competition for substratum and unequal mortality between G. tigrinus and D. villosus, with D. villosus being the stronger competitor. Competitive stress was influenced by population density, was size-dependent and varied between the different types of substratum due to substratum choice. G. tigrinus did not show any behaviour indicative of interference competition in the presence of E. ischnus, and neither did E. ischnus or D. villosus in the presence of any of the other gammarideans. Swimming in the water layer may already enable E. ischnus to minimise its encounters with the stone-dwelling D. villosus and G. tigrinus. To maximise the encounters between E. ischnus and D. villosus, a fish (Lepomis gibbosus) was added to occupy the water layer during the aquarium experiments. E. ischnus showed a higher mortality in the presence of both D. villosus and fish, probably due to increased stress, as shelter opportunities to escape the predators had been minimised. The study shows that interference competition between gammaridean species can explain the replacement of the North American invader G. tigrinus by D. villosus in the river Rhine. E. ischnus and D. villosus both Ponto-Caspian invaders did not show interference competition in our experiments and co-exist in the Rhine.","[van Riel, M.

I investigated the effects of dispersal on communities of keystone predators and prey. I obtained two key results. 2. First, a strong trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility allows consumer coexistence over a large resource productivity range, but it also lowers the predator-susceptible superior competitor's abundance and increases its risk of extinction. Thus, unexpectedly, dispersal plays a more important role in coexistence when predator-mediated coexistence is strong rather than weak. The interplay between the trade-off, small population sizes resulting from transient oscillations, and dispersal leads to qualitatively different species distributions depending on the relative mobilities of the consumers and predator. These differences yield comparative predictions that can be tested with data on trade-off strength, dispersal rates, and species distributions across productivity gradients. 3. Second, there is an asymmetry between species in their dispersal effects: the predator-resistant inferior competitor's dispersal has a large effect, but the predator-susceptible superior competitor's dispersal has no effect, on coexistence and species' distributions. The inferior competitor's dispersal also mediates the predator's dispersal effects: the predator's dispersal has no effect when the inferior competitor is immobile, and a large effect when it is mobile. The net outcome of the direct and indirect effects of the inferior competitor's dispersal is a qualitative change in the species' distributions from interspecific segregation to interspecific aggregation. 4. The important point is that differences between species in how they balance resource acquisition and predator avoidance can lead to unexpected differences in their dispersal effects. While consumer coexistence in the absence of dispersal is driven largely by the top predator, consumer coexistence in the presence of dispersal is driven largely by the predator-resistant inferior competitor.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",amarasek@eeb.ucla.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717350],This research was funded by a grant from NSF (DEB-0717350).

Many approaches to predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity so far have been based purely on a climate envelope approach and have not considered direct and indirect species interactions. Using a long-term observational data set (>30 years) of competing intertidal barnacle species, we built a hierarchy of age-structured two-taxa population models (Semibalanus balanoides vs. Chthamalus montagui and C. stellatus combined as one taxon) to test if the presence of a dominant competitor can mediate climatic influence on the subordinate species. Models were parameterized using data from populations on the south coast of southwest England and verified by hindcasting using independent north coast population data. Recruitment of the dominant competitor, S. balanoides, is driven by temperature. The mechanisms of competition explored included simple space preemption and temperature-driven interference competition. The results indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile barnacles is important in regulating chthamalid density but not that of the dominant competitor S. balanoides. Simulations were carried out using alternative future climate scenarios to predict barnacle population abundance over the next century. Under all emission scenarios, the cold-water S. balanoides is predicted to virtually disappear from southwest England by the 2050s, leading to the competitive release of Chthamalus throughout the entire region and thereby substantially increasing its abundance and occupied habitat (by increasing vertical range on the shore). Our results demonstrate that climate change can profoundly affect the abundance and distribution of species through both the direct effects of temperature on survival, and also by altering important negative interactions through shifting competitive balances and essentially removing dominant competitors or predators. Climate change impacts on organisms are unlikely to lead only to straightforward, easily predictable changes in population size and distribution. The complex, indirect effects of climate change need to be taken into account if we are to accurately forecast the long-term effects of global warming.","[Poloczanska, Elvira S.] CSIRO Marine & Atomspher Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Hawkins, Stephen J.] Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Hawkins, Stephen J.; Southward, Alan J.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Ynys Mon LL59 K5AB, North Wales, Wales; [Burrows, Michael T.] Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA34 1QA, Argyll, Scotland","Poloczanska, ES (corresponding author), CSIRO Marine & Atomspher Res, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",elvira.poloczanska@CSIRO.au,"poloczanska, elvira/P-5356-2014; Burrows, Michael/ABF-4844-2020; Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008; Poloczanska, Elvira/F-4366-2014","Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899; poloczanska, elvira/0000-0001-8470-0925",,,,72,181,182,0,132,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2008,89,11,,,,,3138,3149,,10.1890/07-1169.1,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,374OL,WOS:000261053500018,31766801,,,,2021-09-21,

We conducted both single-generation competition experiments and multiple-generation experiments and then analyzed the system with a discrete version of the Lotka-Volterra competition model. The estimated competition coefficients showed the competitive dominance of the C. maculatus strain over the C. chinensis strain in both types of bean. Zero-growth isocline analysis based on the predicted model showed that an overall dominance of the contest species, C. maculatus, in azuki beans, whereas the outcome of competition was dependent on the initial population size of each species in the black-eye beans. In the multiple-generation experiments, C. maculatus was the successful competitor irrespective of the ratio of the two beans, whereas C. chinensis overcame C. maculatus in one of five replicates with the black-eye beans system. When we incorporated the cost of scramble competition, or density-dependent reduction in body mass into the predicted model, the model alteration decreased the survival region of C. chinensis in phase space on the black-eye bean. Thus, the competitive equations, which do not consider the density-dependent body size reduction, tend to overestimate the advantages of scramble strategists.","[Ishii, Yumiko; Shimada, Masakazu] Univ Tokyo, Dept Syst Sci Biol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan","Ishii, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Syst Sci Biol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",ishiij@dolphin.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Ishii, Yumiko/B-8135-2011","Ishii, Yumiko/0000-0003-2712-5244",,,,41,16,17,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

This may happen via differential individual properties of prey animals (e.g. vigilance, escape) or via habitat effects making hunting by a predator easier and more rewarding in some habitats, or both. Furthermore, community dynamics may be influenced by predator mediated apparent competition, in which an increase in one prey type has negative effects on another prey type indirectly via the shared predator. We summarize the current knowledge from the field in a model predator-prey system consisting of sympatric boreal vole species and their common specialist predator and review field studies using predator manipulation and studies on the responses of individuals in the laboratory and in outdoor enclosures. The vole species studied represent different prey types that are thought to have different vulnerabilities. Our observations on the main resident specialist predator, the least weasel (Mustela nivalis nivalis L.), show that it hunts according to prey availability and suitability of the hunting habitat. Prey voles respond to the presence of the predator behaviorally in various ways to avoid predation. We conclude that even if the least weasel is a specialized predator of small rodents it acts like a generalist predator within the small rodent guild and may facilitate the coexistence of prey species via predator switching. This may lead to interspecific synchrony between prey populations, which has often been observed. We suggest that the processes determining the community impact of predator-prey interactions are driven by the behavioral arms race between the predator and the prey, together with the habitat-dependent density of prey and net gain for the predator.","[Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland","Sundell, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",janne.sundell@helsinki.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [52045, 44887, 208478]","We are grateful to the Academy of Finland (projects 52045, 44887 and 208478) for funding our research.

Due to the costs of coexistence with competitors, a breeding habitat selection strategy that avoids competitors is expected to be favored. However, many migratory birds appear to gain benefits from an attraction to the presence of resident birds, even though residents are assumed to be competitively dominant. Thus far the mechanisms of this habitat selection process, heterospecific attraction, are unknown, and the consequences for resident birds of migrant attraction remain untested. Through heterospecific attraction, migrants may gain benefits if the density or territory location of residents positively reflects habitat quality, and/or they gain benefits through increased frequency of social interactions with residents in foraging or predator detection. In this experiment, we examined the reciprocal effects of spatial proximity on fitness-related traits in migrant pied flycatcher (Ficedula, hypoleuca) and resident great tit (Parus major) by experimentally forcing them to breed either alone or in close proximity to each other. Surprisingly, great tits bore all the costs of coexistence while flycatchers were unaffected, even gaining slight benefits. In concert with an earlier study, these results suggest that flycatchers use tits as information about good-quality nest-site locations while benefits from social interactions with tits are possible but less important. We suggest that utilizing interspecific social information may be a common phenomenon between species sharing similar resource needs. Our results imply that the effects of interspecific information rise can be asymmetric and may therefore have implications for the patterns and consequences of species coexistence.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; Uppsala Univ, Anim Ecol Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Forsman, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",jukka.forsman@oulu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X",,,,56,54,56,0,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The purpose of this work was to study the relationship between the two species, which co-occur in time and space, and may therefore potentially compete for plant resources. Characterization of the resources available to ovipositing females revealed that shoots in apical positions are more vigorous than shoots in basal positions, but that the two species of gall midges react to this variability of resources in different ways, as reflected by the patterns of gall distribution. Izeniola obesula galls were primarily induced in the younger, more rapidly growing shoots, whereas those of S. defoliata were predominantly induced in older, less vigorous shoots. Nevertheless, despite the general partitioning of resources, a certain amount of niche overlap was found, resulting in the occasional induction of an S. defoliata gall proximal to that of I. obesula in the same shoot. Co-occurrence of the two types of galls in time and space did not have apparent effect on S. defoliata galls, but did have a strong adverse impact on young I. obesula galls, 60% of which were killed without producing adult midges, and the remaining 40% produced a much smaller number of adults. These effects are attributed to asymmetric interspecific competition that is mediated by the plant, resulting from the difference in stem tissues utilized by the larvae of the two species. It is concluded that preponderance of vacant niches, low densities of galls, and small niche overlap between the species do not preclude the occurrence of interspecific exploitative competition in this system, although its role in shaping the populations of the species is limited.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Dorchin, N (corresponding author), Bucknell Univ, Dept Biol, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",ndorchin@bucknell.edu,,,,,,27,4,4,0,16,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Measurements of K crassipes yield per original plant included biomass, clonal expansion, and flower production. Without herbivory, intraspecific competition among E crassipes individuals was 41 times more intense than interspecific competition in terms of biomass yield. Herbivory shifted competitive outcomes, bringing intraspecific competition in line with interspecific competition. Both weevil species reduced E crassipes biomass and flowering, but X bruchi also lessened clonal expansion (rosette density) whereas N. eichhorniae did not. Nutrient limitation reduced plant performance but did not alter the pattern of competitive interactions. However, low nutrients moderated differences between weevil species such that both seemed equally damaging. We conclude that while herbivory directly and indirectly affected plant performance by altering competition between these two invasive plant species, the competitive response varied depending upon the herbivore species and availability of nutrients. The influence of herbivores on competitive interactions may thus be ail important consideration for evaluating the invasive potential of exotic plant species as well as for predicting the potential efficacy of biological control agents. but interactions between herbivory, competitors, and nutrient availability create complexities that must be considered.

The impact of both intra- and interspecific competition on sex allocation was measured in two egg parasitoids, Trichogramma minutum Riley and T. pintoi Voegele (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), by comparing the sex ratio deposited by females exploiting host patches alone and in groups. Results showed that the sex ratio deposited by both species was higher when in groups, as predicted by the LMC model. When the sex ratio produced was compared between females either alone or in interspecific groups, T. minutum females deposited the same sex ratio, while T. pintoi produced more sons when in interspecific groups than when alone.

Our fitness functions are derived from the Lotka-Volterra competition equations, and we assume that individuals settle in the habitat in which their fitness is maximized. We derive an ideal free distribution across the habitats for both species. Our model provides analytical and graphical descriptions of individual habitat selection behavior, isolegs (the boundary lines separating regions where qualitatively different habitat preferences are predicted), and spatial population distributions. Our analysis reveals complex isolegs, several novel patterns of habitat distribution, and even situations where spatial strategies, as well as the relative abundances of coexisting species, exhibit only local stability. Hence, distributions of competing species may be determined not solely by their respective densities but also by the order of colonization. This happens, however, only for extreme levels of interspecific competition. In the situation where one competitor species is dominant over the other, our model predicts isolegs that qualitatively agree with observed behavioral patterns. However, our model predicts a greater variety of possible situations than has been previously described. Finally, we analyze the influence of habitat selection behavior on species isoclines and verify that increasing interspecific competition leads to habitat segregation.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Biol, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Fac Biol Sci, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Univ Bretagne Sud, Lab Accueil, F-56017 Vannes, France","Krivan, V (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Biol, Branisovska 31, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",krivan@entu.cas.cz; etienne.sirot@univ-ubs.fr,"Krivan, Vlastimil/F-1709-2010; Krivan, Vlastimil/J-7015-2019","Krivan, Vlastimil/0000-0003-0971-1231; ",,,,66,34,35,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Brook sticklebacks sympatric with ninespine sticklebacks have diverged from local allopatric brook populations, and so the two types of brook sticklebacks potentially represent pre- and post-displacement forms. We used enclosures placed in a lake to compare short-term fitness (growth) of sympatric (post-displacement) and allopatric (pre-displacement) brook forms in the presence and absence of ninespine sticklebacks. Brook sticklebacks grew less in the presence vs. absence of ninespine sticklebacks, indicating that interspecific competition occurred. As expected, allopatric brook forms had lower growth than sympatric forms when ninespine sticklebacks were present.

There has been speculation that sheep ranching may have played a major role in guanaco population decline after monopolising the most productive land because of competition for forage plants. Our aim in this work was to estimate guanaco abundance and account for its variation across nine different sites, two seasons and two years. We conducted over 100 ground surveys of both guanacos and sheep and estimated the availability of the preferred plant species both animal species might select in their diet. We found that (1) sheep densities were up to 23 times higher than guanaco densities in sympatric conditions, (2) at a protected site without sheep, guanaco density was one order of magnitude higher than at the rest of the sites, (3) across nine different sites, sheep densities alone accounted for around 60% of the variation in guanaco abundance, (4) guanaco densities were negatively related to both total plant cover and availability of the preferred plant species in their diet, which were both positively associated with sheep density, and (5) within-site changes in guanaco densities between seasons and years were negatively related to changes in sheep densities. Our results are consistent with predictions on interspecific competition for food resources, although we cannot rule out possible effects of other human-related activities influencing guanaco abundance.

The former species is normally allotopic with the latter two but has recently suffered competition from them following successional changes on sand-dune habitats that have rendered all three species syntopic. In a replicated cage experiment using natural densities of larvae, survivorship of B. calamita was reduced more strongly by interspecific than by intraspecific competitors. Predation did not relieve interspecific competition and in some treatments further increased the mortality of B. calamita. Survival was highly correlated with growth rate, and the negative effects of interspecific competition on growth were much stronger than those of intraspecific competition. Feeding-niche overlaps among all three species were high, and growth rates of B. calamita were related to total algal cell numbers available in the treatment cages. However, larvae in treatments exhibiting interspecific competition also generated large numbers of Anurofeca (= Prototheca) richardsi. This unicellular organism is implicated in interference competition between anurans. B. calamita growth also correlated inversely with A. richardsi numbers. Taken together the data demonstrate strong adverse effects of interspecific competition on the endangered B. calamita and indicate that both resource and interference mechanisms were probably operative, though the former was more important than the latter. Methods for alleviating the destructive impact of competition on the endangered species are discussed.","Univ Sussex, Sch Biol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Beebee, TJC (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Biol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,55,16,19,0,23,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The presence of predatory fish was found to alter the foraging activities of the baetid, but not of the glossosomatid. We investigated the local distribution of Baetis thermicus and Glossosoma sp. to examine the potential for competition between the two grazers in a northern Japanese stream. Further, we carried our a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that the freshwater sculpin Cottus nozawae, when not allowed to attack prey, mediates the resource-limited competitive influences of Baetis on the growth of Glossosoma, but not the reverse. We found a negative correlation between the densities of Baetis and Glossosoma in the stream, suggesting the strong potential for resource-limiting competitive interactions to occur between the grazers. Using a laboratory channel experiment employing a target-neighbor design, neither the presence of sculpin nor the density of the two grazers altered any life-history traits measured for the grazers. However, the proportion of Baetis individuals positioned on the upper surface of a ceramic plate substrate (with greater periphyton biomass) largely decreased in the presence of sculpin, with only a minor behavioral shift being detected in Glossosoma. This difference in behavioral shift resulted in greater growth suppression in Baetis than in Glossosoma. In the absence of sculpin, growth of both target grazers was lowered by experimentally increasing the density of neighboring competitors. In par tial contradiction to the above hypothesis, the growth of not only Glossosoma but also Baetis was never influenced by the density of neighbor competitors when sculpin were present. The biomass of periphyton in the presence of sculpin was greater than when sculpin were absent, and was lower with higher densities of either grazer. Predator-avoidance behavioral modifications in both grazers may be the mechanism responsible for mediation of their exploitative competition.","Chitose Board Educ, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan; Hokkaido Univ Forests, Tomakomai Res Stn, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan; Inst Low Temp Sci, Biodivers Grp, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600019, Japan","Kuhara, N (corresponding author), Chitose Board Educ, 958-1 Kamiosatsu, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan.",naotoshi.kuhara@nifty.ne.jp,,,,,,42,27,27,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1999,87,1,,,,,27,35,,10.2307/3546993,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,248AG,WOS:000083252700003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Contrary to these premises, evidence of interspecific competition in web-weaving spiders is ambiguous, and new experiments on natural communities are interesting. This paper reports on an experiment designed to test competitive effects in a natural community of web-weaving spiders, accomplished by selective removal of each of the three locally dominant species: Araneus marmoreus, Argiope bruennichi, and Agelena labyrinthica. No statistically significant difference was found among control plots and the plots where one of the three species had been removed, for any of the variables measured, but the small number of replicates limited statistic power. Considering only effect direction, and not statistical significance, these removal experiments supported competitive effects on community structure, habitat overlap, and spider body size. On the other hand, effects were contrary to competitive expectations as regards abundance and habitat breadth. These results are in line with the findings of the other removal experiments conducted so far on spiders, that uncovered small intra- and interspecific competitive effects fbr some variables but not for others.

The aim of this work is to present spatial models of these two processes. The animals of two species are assumed to move on a two dimensional array of spatial patches with local interactions of competition or of selective predation between them. We focus on the case of mutual exclusion. Initially, the two competing species occupy complementary areas in an array of spatial patches with. a small common zone. Numerical simulations show that under particular conditions, one species gets extinct and the other invades the whole set of spatial patches. These simulations show that with time, the length of the overlapping zone stabilizes and moves at a constant velocity. The limit length of the overlapping band and the velocity of the extinction wave are found to be functions of the parameters of the models.

For each of these combinations, food consumption by predators was calculated assuming functional responses of either type 1, 2 or 3. Two levels of competition intensity were studied: low and high intensity, with food consumption decreased by 1% or 50% as compared to a situation without competition. The reproduction of prey was either slow or rapid, potentially increasing the number of prey at the end of a simulation by either 2* or 100* initial abundances. Prey reproduction was either exponential, influenced by intraspecific interaction or by both intra- and interspecific interactions between prey. All together, separate analyses of intra- and interspecific competition between different numbers of predator species combined with different numbers of available prey species, competition intensities, functional responses and rates and regulation of prey reproduction, gave 288 different types of models. For each of these, 100 simulations were run, with prey capture rates determined randomly for each predator-prey combination. The output data analysed were frequencies of increases and decreases in food niche overlap in response to interspecific competition and expansion and contraction in food niche width in response to either intra- or interspecific competition. All changes in niche parameters resulted from pure exploitative competition, without behavioural changes, short-term selection or evolutionary processes. The results were complex, with both increases and decreases in niche width and niche overlap as results of intra- and interspecific competition. Frequencies of increases and decreases were influenced by complex interactions between number of species of predators and preys, functional response of predators and reproduction rate and density dependence in prey population growth. The effect of one species on the niche width of another, as well as on their mutual niche overlap, sometimes changed with the intensity of competition. These results are in strong contrast to the niche dynamics theory frequently used as basis for interpreting field data, according to which species are assumed to generalise in response to intraspecific competition (niche expansion), and segregate and specialise in response to interspecific competition (decreased overlap and niche contraction [resource partitioning]). These variable results were derived from models which are very simple compared to the complexity of Nature, a complexity which is reasonable to assume increases the possibility for the development of complex niche dynamics. In my opinion, niche dynamics in Nature are thus very likely to be complex and great care must be taken before concluding from field data on food niche dynamics whether or not coexisting species compete.","UNIV STOCKHOLM,CTR MARINE RES,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","HANSSON, S (corresponding author), UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT SYST ECOL,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,85,10,13,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Observational studies indicate that the introduced, North American species P. leniusculus may gradually replace the native A, astacus, but the mechanism behind the replacement is not known. This study examined the direct effects of interspecific competition between the crayfish, and indirect effects of competitive interactions and fish (European perch, Perca fluviatilis L.) predation. Three different experiments with young-of-the-year (YOY) crayfish were performed. P. leniusculus was strongly dominant over similar-sized A. astacus in interference competition for shelter in a laboratory experiment. However, in a 35-day experiment in outdoor pools, A, astacus growth and survival were about equally affected by interactions with conspecifics and P. leniusculus. In contrast, P. leniusculus was significantly more affected by intraspecific competition than by competition with A. astacus, suggesting asymmetric competition between the two species. The presence of perch in outdoor ponds with mixed-species groups of the two crayfish species resulted in considerably higher predation rates on A. astacus than on P. leniusculus. Both species showed strong antipredator responses to perch by increasing refuge use. I suggest that higher perch predation rates on A. astacus originate from P. leniusculus being the superior species in interspecific competition for shelter. Because of displacement from refuges, A. astacus individuals become more exposed to the predator. This indirect effect of interactions among the two crayfish species and the predator may be important in the observed in situ replacement of A. astacus by P. leniusculus.","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT ENVIRONM ASSESSMENT,S-75007 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","SODERBACK, B (corresponding author), UPPSALA UNIV,INST LIMNOL,NORBYVAGEN 20,S-75236 UPPSALA,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,60,71,71,0,23,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1994,100,3,,,,,229,235,,10.1007/BF00316949,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PZ755,WOS:A1994PZ75500004,28307005,,,,2021-09-21,

The rationale behind this approach is twofold. First, interspecific competition among herbivorous arthropods is thought to be weak; populations are kept at low levels through the action of natural enemies. Second, the potential benefits of an herbivorous biological control agent must be weighed against the damage it causes to the host plant through its feeding. In the field we have been successful at using less economically important Willamette mites to control economically important Pacific mites. In greenhouse and field experiments reported here, we examined both direct and indirect mechanisms (via the host plant or a shared predator) to explain this negative interaction. In our first greenhouse experiment we injured leaves on single canes of young Zinfandel grapevines with Willamette mites at four density levels, removed these mites and then measured consequences of this past injury on Pacific mites placed on newly produced leaves. Pacific mite populations were reduced significantly by previous Willamette mite injury, suggesting a systemic induced response. In our second greenhouse experiment we measured the relative importance of interspecific interactions between concurrent populations of Willamette and Pacific mites, direct predation by a phytoseiid predator, and interactions between predation and competition (apparent competition). Predators and prey were confined to single canes and, at this small scale, direct predation was of overriding importance while interspecific competition and apparent competition were not significant in determining Pacific mite populations. We examined the relative importance of an early season release of Willamette mites, predaceous mites, or both in a large field experiment conducted in a commercial Zinfandel vineyard. Pacific mite populations were most strongly reduced by the early release of Willamette mites and by midseason abundance of predaceous mites. Our ANOVA results did not detect a significant interaction between the early season release of Willamette mites and predaceous mites. The presence of Willamette mites did not make releases of predators more effective at controlling Pacific mites. Grape yield and berry sugar concentration were unaffected by either Willamette mite or predaceous mite treatments in the year of the mite releases nor in the following season. Path analysis showed that Willamette mite density was never strongly negatively correlated with Pacific mite density in the subsequent time period (2-wk intervals between sampling dates), despite the strong negative effect that the early-season release of Willamette mites had on Pacific mite densities later in the season. This suggests that Willamette mites affected Pacific mites indirectly.",,"ENGLISHLOEB, GM (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,34,33,33,0,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We addressed this question in a temporary-pond community where the broken-striped newt Notophthalmus viridescens doralis is known to act as a keystone predator on larval anurans. We independently manipulated the initial density of adult Notophthalmus (two or four) and the presence or absence of one adult Siren intermedia in a set of 20 artificial ponds to determine if this additional predator affected the ability of Notophthalmus to function as a keystone predator. Each pond received a diverse assemblage of larval anuran prey: a spring-breeding assemblage of 275 Rana utricularia, 100 Pseudacris crucifer and 25 Bufo americanus tadpoles, and a summer assemblage of 200 Hyla chrysoscelis and 150 Gastrophryne carolinensis tadpoles. Two additional ponds received neither predator, to assay the outcome of competition among the tadpoles. The effect of the salamander Siren on Notophthalmus survival and fecundity depended on the density of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren had no effect on survival, but at high newt density competition reduced the survival and growth rates of Notophthalmus. The density of Notophthalmus and the presence of Siren interacted to determine the fecundity of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren reduced Notophthalmus reproductive success by preying on larvae. At high newt density Siren indirectly enhanced reproductive success by reducing survival of adults, thus releasing larvae from intraspecific competition and cannibalism. Notophthalmus density had no effect on adult Siren survival or growth rate in this experiment, but other evidence indicates that competition with Notophthalmus reduces the growth rates of Siren. Notophthalmus acted as a keystone predator on the assemblage of spring-breeding anurans; it increased the number of metamorphs of the weak competitor Pseudacris crucifer by releasing them from interspecific competition. Siren preyed on tadpoles in a nonselective manner. An additive model was sufficient to describe the effects of Siren and initial density of Notophthalmus on the structure of the tadpole assemblage. In our system of experimental ponds, the strong interaction between Siren and Notophthalmus density did not extend its effects to lower trophic levels, and the direct and indirect effects of Siren did not alter the role of Notophthalmus as a keystone predator.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,,,,,,49,73,76,0,27,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1991,72,3,,,,,827,838,,10.2307/1940585,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FM084,WOS:A1991FM08400007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids as well as immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as aphids, whiteflies and soft scales. Field experiments assessing the importance of interspecific competition between autoparasitoids and primary parasitoids, as well as its impact on herbivore suppression, are scarcely found in the ecological literature. 2. Using field data from 40 olive orchards, this study examined the mechanisms that regulate: (i) the interspecific competition between primary parasitoids of the genus Metaphycus and the autoparasitoid Coccophagus lycimnia; and (ii) the density of their shared herbivore host, the soft scale Saissetia oleae. 3. Metaphycus parasitoids used smaller hosts than C. lycimnia, yet did not outcompete C. lycimnia. On the other hand, C. lycimnia preferred to use Metaphycus females as secondary hosts for producing males rather than their own females. This preference might explain why the autoparasitoid negatively affected the density of the primary parasitoids. 4. Parasitism by the autoparasitoid C. lycimnia at the beginning of the season was the sole variable positively related to host mortality throughout the season, showing its greater effect on herbivore suppression. 5. In this study, an autoparasitoid, inferior at resource exploitation, was shown to outcompete a primary parasitoid without disrupting herbivore suppression.","[Marrao, Rosalina; Pereira, Jose A.] Inst Politecn Braganca, Escola Super Agr, CIMO, Braganca, Portugal; [Frago, Enric] CIRAD, Ctr Biol Gest Populat, UMR CBGP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Tena, Alejandro] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Ctra CV 315,Km 10-7, E-46113 Moncada, Spain","Tena, A (corresponding author), Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Ctra CV 315,Km 10-7, E-46113 Moncada, Spain.",atena@ivia.es,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Pereira, Jose A./L-6798-2014","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Pereira, Jose A./0000-0002-2260-0600",,,,44,0,0,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Several species of predatory mites are important biocontrol agents and the species Phytoseiulus macropilis and Neoseiulus californicus are used to control the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, an important pest in agriculture worldwide. We investigated their compatibility showing that the two predators do not avoid plants on which the other species is present together with their common prey, and demonstrated that their oviposition rates are not affected by the presence of the other species. However, the distribution of the eggs on leaf discs was affected by the presence of the heterospecific predator. This behaviour might weaken possible interference between these two biocontrol agents, which, in turn, may enable their persistence on plants and favour pest suppression. The increased joint use of several natural enemies for biological control highlights the importance of studies on predator-predator interactions.","[Fonseca, Morgana Maria; Pallini, Angelo; Marques, Pedro Hermano; Lima, Eraldo; Janssen, Arne] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, Evolutionary & Populat Biol, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.; Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Evolutionary & Populat Biol, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",morganamaria.fonseca@gmail.com; pallini@ufv.br; pdrohermano@gmail.com; eraldo.lima@ufv.br; arne.janssen@uva.nl,"Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/Z-3908-2019","Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/0000-0002-2135-8488","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Foundation for Research Support of the State of Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88887.145883/2017-00, 88887.314241/2019-00]; FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); National Institute of Science and Technology Semiochemicals in Agriculture (INCT/CNPq)","We thank Ecotrix Biodefensivos Pesquisa & Consultoria Ltda for support with the rearing of arthropods and the colleagues from the Laboratory of Acarology of the Federal University of Vicosa for suggestions on experimental design and discussions.

Here, we use win-draw-lose competitive overgrowths for a marine benthic community of encrusting bryozoans that have evolved together in New Zealand for at least 2.3 million years to investigate battles for substrate space, a resource that is limiting for these colonial organisms. Using more than 6,000 fossilized and contemporary battles, we explored what combination of traits-including relative zooid (module) size, weapons, armor, and relative abundance-best predict battle outcomes, and if these are time varying. In simpler models, where we disregard trait-trait interactions, we find that the effects of larger zooid sizes and three-dimensional growth on battle outcomes are both positive, while that of relative abundance is negative, such that more common species are more often overgrown by less common species. When we include trait-trait and trait-time interactions in our models, we confirm that a larger zooid size is advantageous for successful overgrowth but infer that it is time varying. In these complex models, we also detect interactions between combinations of traits, where more armored and weaponized bryozoans seem to be at a disadvantage in overgrowth battles. Our best models do perform statistically better than the null model, but we find that there is low predictability for overgrowth outcomes for our New Zealand data set of fossil and contemporary battles, suggesting unmeasured variables and/or high stochasticity in a system that is otherwise well characterized. A best model, developed using our New Zealand data, is applied to three ecologically similar systems described in previous studies to investigate its general predictive power, with the expectation that it would perform better than null models. Surprisingly, we find that the best model developed within the New Zealand system cannot be extrapolated to other encrusting cheilostome bryozoan communities and that these three communities often even have opposite signs for trait coefficients. We conclude that there is much to learn about multi-species marine communities where biotic interactions such as competition may have long-lasting consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics.","[Liow, L.

The prey consumption rate per individual of predator is considered as Beddington-DeAngelis type. Beddington-DeAngelis type functional response describes predator feeding rate depending on both the prey and predator density. Ecological significance of considering this type of functional response depends on how frequently a predator encounters another predator while feeding on the same type of prey, resulting in strong intraspecific competition and thereby reducing the predator feeding rate. Firstly we establish persistence and permanence of the system and examine the role of cooperation coefficient. Different conditions for the coexistence of equilibrium solutions are discussed. Then the local asymptotic stability of various equilibrium points and the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the positive equilibrium are carried out to understand the dynamics of the model system. The Kolmogorov analysis of subsystems suggests for the existence of transcritical bifurcation. Sufficient conditions for the nonexistence of periodic orbits of the considered model system have been presented. The analytical results found in this paper are illustrated with the help of numerical examples.","[Tripathi, Jai Prakash] Cent Univ Rajasthan, Dept Math, NH-8 Bandarsindri, Ajmer 305817, Rajasthan, India; [Jana, Debaldev] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Kattankulathur 603203, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jana, Debaldev] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, SRM Res Inst, Kattankulathur 603203, Tamil Nadu, India; [Tiwari, Vandana] Indian Inst Technol BHU, Dept Math Sci, Varanasi 221005, UP, India; [Tiwari, Vandana] MLV Text & Engn Coll, Sch Basic & Appl Sci, Pur Rd, Bhilwara 311001, Rajasthan, India","Tripathi, JP (corresponding author), Cent Univ Rajasthan, Dept Math, NH-8 Bandarsindri, Ajmer 305817, Rajasthan, India.",jtripathi85@gmail.com; debaldevjana.jana@gmail.com; vandanpp@gmail.com,"Tripathi, Jai Prakash/T-4865-2019","Tripathi, Jai Prakash/0000-0001-9046-4236","University Grant Commission (UGC), IndiaUniversity Grants Commission, India [19-06/2011(i)EU-IV]","The research work of third author (Vandana Tiwari) is supported by University Grant Commission (UGC) (No. 19-06/2011(i)EU-IV), India.

However, the influence of interspecific aggression and fatigue on the predation cost of fighting is seldom examined, although both are unignorable aspects of fighting. Here, I incorporated both factors in a series of field experiments on the cichlid Lamprologus ocellatus. If territorial males respond more strongly to conspecific territorial intruders than to heterospecific intruders, then they should delay escape more frequently during intraspecific fighting than during interspecific fighting. Consequently, although I predicted that vigilance would be decreased as fighting progresses in both cases, intraspecific aggression should decrease vigilance more than interspecific aggression. Males were also exposed to a predator approaching at different (slow or fast) speeds during these fighting bouts. Delays in predator detection and flight initiation were quantified and these predictions were tested. As predicted, males responded more strongly to intraspecific intruders, resulting in slower predator detection and fleeing times than when encountering interspecific intruders. Furthermore, flight latency decreased with increasing fight duration, suggesting that fatigue negatively influenced escape responses. However, contrary to the prediction, the vigilance decrement rate was faster in response to slow predators than in response to rapid predators, and was not influenced by intruder identity. This suggests that fighting males reserve their attention for information critical to their survival and are less vigilant toward a less-threatening (slowly approaching) predator. This cognitive allocation may be an adaptive compensation for fatigue-related low vigilance during fighting.","[Ota, Kazutaka] Osaka City Univ, Dept Biol & Geosci, Sumiyoshi Ku, Osaka 5588585, Japan","Ota, K (corresponding author), Osaka City Univ, Dept Biol & Geosci, Sumiyoshi Ku, Osaka 5588585, Japan.",otkztk@gmail.com,,"Ota, Kazutaka/0000-0002-7097-7330","Overseas Research grant from Osaka City University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16777290]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K18614] Funding Source: KAKEN",This study was supported by an Overseas Research grant from Osaka City University and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (no. 16777290).,,63,6,6,0,6,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

The behaviour of the system near the biologically feasible equilibria is thoroughly analysed. Boundedness and dissipativeness of the system are established. The stability analysis including local and global stability of the equilibria has been carried out in order to examine the behaviour of the system. The present system experiences Hopf-Andronov bifurcation for suitable choice of parameters. The results of this investigation reveal that the intra-specific competition among predator populations can be beneficial for the survival of predator.

We studied patterns of space use by the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), a prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) specialist, and the American badger (Taxidea taxus), a larger generalist carnivore that competes for prairie dogs and is known to kill ferrets. We expected that ferrets would spatially avoid badgers because of the risk of predation, that these patterns of avoidance might differ between sexes and age classes, and that the availability of food and space might influence these relationships. We used location data from 60 ferrets and 15 badgers to model the influence of extrinsic factors (prairie dog density and colony size) and intrinsic factors (sex, age) on patterns of space use by ferrets in relation to space use by different sex and age categories of badgers. We documented asymmetric patterns of avoidance of badgers by ferrets based on the sex of both species. Female ferrets avoided adult female badgers, but not male badgers, and male ferrets exhibited less avoidance than female ferrets. Additionally, avoidance decreased with increasing densities of prairie dogs. We suggest that intersexual differences in space use by badgers create varying distributions of predation risk that are perceived by the smaller carnivore (ferrets) and that females respond more sensitively than males to that risk. This work advances understanding about how competing species coexist and suggests that including information on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors might improve our understanding of behavioral interactions between sympatric species.","[Grassel, Shaun M.; Rachlow, Janet L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Grassel, Shaun M.] Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Dept Wildlife Fish & Recreat, Lower Brule, SD 57548 USA; [Williams, Christopher J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Stat Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA","Grassel, SM (corresponding author), Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Dept Wildlife Fish & Recreat, POB 246, Lower Brule, SD 57548 USA.",smgrassel@gmail.com,,"Williams, Christopher/0000-0001-6346-8100","U.

The expectation that close relatives experience greater competition than distant relatives has become known as the competition-relatedness hypothesis (CRH).'' The CRH is predicated on the assumption that closely related species are more likely to have similar resource requirements than distant relatives, and thus, compete more strongly for limited resources. While this assumption has been popular because it is intuitive, it has also been subject to relatively little experimentation. Over the past decade, a growing number of CRH studies have arrived at divergent conclusions showing that the strength of competitive interactions can increase, decrease, or be independent of evolutionary relatedness. Most of these studies have focused on measuring competition among species pairs as opposed to competition experienced by species when part of whole communities. We tested whether the CRH holds in communities where individual species experience interactions with a variety of other taxa, which we call the 'resident community'. We performed a laboratory mesocosm study using communities of eight species of freshwater green algae whose evolutionary relationships were quantified using a recently developed multi-gene molecular phylogeny of 59 North American green algae. We grew species alone and in various combinations in polyculture so that we could measure each species' sensitivity to competition (reduction in intrinsic growth rate when grown alone vs. with a resident community), relative yield, and competitive release (proportional change in biomass of a species when grown in a resident community missing one competitor vs. in a community with all possible competitors). While each of these metrics consistently revealed a prevalence of competitive interactions among the algal species, none were predicted by the relatedness of a species to a resident community. This suggests that the results of prior pairwise studies refuting the competition-relatedness hypothesis for green algae can be extended to larger resident communities in which more complex ecological interactions possibly occur.","[Naughton, H.

Superior competitors can dominate other species numerically with high reproductive rates, indirectly with high growth rates that facilitate space acquisition, or directly with competitive overgrowth. To assess how climate change could affect competitive interactions, we examined latitudinal patterns in growth rates and overgrowth competition via field surveys and experiments with marine epibenthic communities. Epibenthic fouling communities are dominated by invasive tunicates, bryozoans, and other species that grow on docks, boats, and other artificial structures. Fouling communities are space limited, so growth rate and overgrowth competition play an important role in shaping abundance patterns. We experimentally assessed temperaturedependent growth rates of several tunicates and bryozoans in eight regions spanning the U.S. east and west coasts. Several species displayed positive growth responses to warmer temperature in the northern portions of their latitudinal ranges, and vice versa. We used photo surveys of floating docks in at least 16 harbors in each region to compare communities and overgrowth competition. There was a strong correlation across species and regions between growth rate and competitive ability, indicating that growth plays an important role in competitive outcomes. Because growth rates are typically temperature dependent for organisms that compete for space, including terrestrial plants, fungi, algae, bacteria, and sessile benthic organisms, global warming could affect competitive outcomes. Our results suggest that these competitive shifts can be predicted by species' relative growth rates and latitudinal ranges.","[Lord, Joshua; Whitlatch, Robert] Univ Connecticut, Groton, CT 06340 USA","Lord, J (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, 1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA.",joshua.p.lord@gmail.com,,"Lord, Joshua/0000-0003-3020-5704",Connecticut Sea Grant [PD-12-17]; University of Connecticut Department of Marine Science Pre-doctoral Fellowship,"Thanks to all of the individuals who deployed settlement panels for us and allowed Joshua Lord to use laboratory space, as well as to the institutions that provided Joshua Lord with space in offices and flowing seawater systems.

We compared proportional habitat use at observation sites with randomly selected points and evaluated differences in distance to the water sources and to urban boundaries. Habitat use by both species was different from what we had expected from random points. Stone martens used high-density housing more frequently than red foxes and that expected from random points and avoided open and industrial areas, whereas red foxes used housing estates significantly more often than expected and avoided high-density housing. Both species used the other habitats according to their availability. Stone martens often selected habitats located closer to the city centre, whereas red foxes often selected habitats closer to urban borders than expected. The distribution of red foxes and stone martens is influenced by several factors including the availability of shelter and food, as well as the opportunity to move around undetected. Interspecific competition may also play an important role in habitat selection. Stone martens seem to be better adapted to urbanized areas than red foxes.

We investigated intraguild interactions among three opportunistic predators (dog (Canis lupus familiaris L., 1758), cat (Felis catus L., 1758)), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes (L., 1758)) co-occurring in the extensive farmlands of central Poland. Their space use was monitored using tracking stations distributed in field and forest plots along a distance gradient from buildings and analyzed using the occupancy-modeling framework. For all three species occupancy decreased with increased distance from buildings, although for the fox the pattern was relatively weak. The occurrence of cats at the stations was higher in the forest than in the field; for fox and dog, there was a strong variation between study plots. For all three predators, the probability of detection was higher during the night than during the day and varied between the seasons; however, the exact patterns were species-specific. The presence of one predator was also linked to the presence of the other two species generally, a given species was detected more frequently in the absence of the other two species. We recorded spatiotemporal niche segregation among the three species. We conclude that interspecific antagonistic interactions and differences in foraging ecology are the main drivers shaping co-occurrence of the three species in the agriculture landscape.","[Krauze-Gryz, D.; Goszczynski, J.] Warsaw Univ Life Sci WULS SGGW, Dept Forest Zool & Game Management, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Gryz, J.

Interactions with classical predators (e.g., those not competing for shared resources) can strongly influence nest-site selection, but whether intraguild predation also influences this behavior is unknown. We tested whether risk of predation from an intraguild predator [the diurnal scincid lizard Eutropis (Mabuya) longicaudata] influences nest-site selection by its prey (the nocturnal gecko Gekko hokouensis) on Orchid Island, Taiwan. These two species putatively compete for shared resources, including invertebrate prey and nesting microhabitat, but the larger E. longicaudata also predates G. hokouensis (but not its hard-shelled eggs). Both species nested within a concrete wall containing a series of drainage holes that have either one (closed-in) or two openings (open). In allopatry, E. longicaudata preferred to nest within holes that were plugged by debris (thereby protecting eggs from water intrusion), whereas G. hokouensis selected holes that were open at both ends (facilitating escape from predators). When we experimentally excluded E. longicaudata from its preferred nesting area, G. hokouensis not only nested in higher abundances, but also modified its nest-site selection, such that communal nesting was more prevalent and both open and closed-in holes were used equally. Egg viability was unaffected by the choice of hole type, but was reduced slightly (by 7%) in the predator exclusion area (presumably due to higher local incubation temperatures). Our field experiment demonstrates that intraguild predators can directly influence the nest density of prey by altering maternal nest-site selection behavior, even when the predator and prey are active at different times of day and the eggs are not at risk of predation.","[Huang, Wen-San] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Taichung, Taiwan; [Pike, David A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Huang, WS (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Taichung, Taiwan.",wshuang@mail.nmns.edu.tw,"Pike, David A/B-2032-2012","Huang, Wen-San/0000-0003-0073-3557","Kuo Wu Hsiu Luan Culture and Education Foundation; National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC96-2621-B-178-002-MY3]; National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan [NMNSHP97-002]","We are grateful to C.

However, few studies have experimentally tested if competitive ability of consumer species changes depending on elemental contents of the food, although it has been suggested by the theories of resource ratio for competition and ecological stoichiometry. To verify if competitive superiority actually changes according to elemental contents of the food, competition experiments were conducted using high and low P algal food and three Daphnia species (D. galeata, D. pulicaria, and D. tanakai) with different threshold levels of carbon (TFC) and phosphorus (TFP) necessary for individual growth. Since the TFCs of D. tanakai and D. pulicaria were similar to each other but lower than that of D. galeata, we specifically predicted that when fed high P food (i.e., limited by C), D. tanakai and D. pulicaria would be competitively equal to each other but superior to D. galeata. We also predicted from their TFPs that when fed low P food, D. pulicaria would outcompete D. tanakai and D. galeata, while neither of the latter two would be competitively superior to the other. The results showed that when one of the two competitors was predicted to be competitively superior, the food level under competition was similar to the TFC (or TFP) of the superior species but lower than that of the other inferior species, and that the biomass of the former was much less affected by the competition. Also, when the two competing species were predicted to be competitively equal, the food levels under competition were generally similar to the TFC (or TFP) of both species and their biomasses decreased by the same magnitude. The results thus accorded well with the predictions from the TFC and TFP, and indicate that competitive superiority between the same two Daphnia species changes depending on P: C ratio of algal food. This study provides firm evidence for the first time that resource ratio theory can be applied to competition between animal consumers for essential substances packaged within a single food resource.","[Iwabuchi, Tsubasa; Urabe, Jotaro] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan","Iwabuchi, T (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, 6-3 Aramaki Aza Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",iwa283@gmail.com,"Urabe, Jotaro/A-6256-2012; Urabe, Jotaro/ABI-7692-2020","Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X","MEXT JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [19207003]; Environmental Research & Technology Development Fund from Ministry of the Environment of Japan [D-1002]; Global COE program of MEXT JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [J03]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [22370007] Funding Source: KAKEN","We deeply appreciate James M.

A 2-year field study was conducted with soybean cultivars (Glycine max L. Merr.) grown in the presence of mixed weed competition to determine whether foliar parameters and micronutrient concentrations served as predictors of seed yield and quality. Relative water content, chlorophyll fluorescence, and foliar trigonelline, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn, were collected from leaves. Trigonelline differed between growth stages in the first year but showed a three-way interaction between cultivar, weed competition, and growth stage in the second year. Fluorescence and Fe differed significantly only between growth stages within years. Two- and three-way interactions between treatment variables were observed for Mn, Zn, and Cu in at least 1 of the 2 years. Stepwise multiple regressions produced 17 significant models that illustrated the degree to which the parameters explained previously observed variation in seed yield, oil, or protein. Foliar trigonelline, foliar RWC, chlorophyll fluorescence and foliar Fe emerged in several models for seed quality. Cultivar-specific trends produced high variability in the data and low R2 for several models, demonstrating the need to develop models on a cultivar-by-cultivar basis until more comprehensive data on the relationship between these foliar parameters and seed quality can be obtained.","[Millar, K.

The invasive amphipod has been particularly successful in some habitats (e.g. on pebbles) where it has become one of the most abundant gammarid species. We studied experimentally if the dominant fish Gasterosteus aculeatus preyed differentially on the exotic G. tigrinus and the native Gammarus salinus, if predation differed among habitats, and if one gammarid species facilitated predation on the other. The experiment demonstrated that (1) fish preyed more on the exotic G. tigrinus than the native G. salinus. (2) Predation did not differ among habitats. (3) Gammarus tigrinus facilitated the predation on G. salinus and this facilitation varied among habitats with significant effects on pebbles. Thus, the combined effect of habitat-specific fish predation and competition between gammarid amphipods is a possible explanation of the current range of G. tigrinus in the northern Baltic Sea. G. tigrinus seems to establish in habitats where it can significantly increase fish predation on the native gammarids. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The size of an individual is an important determinant of its trophic position and the type of interactions it engages in with other heterospecific and conspecific individuals. Consequently an individual's ecological role in a community changes with its body size over ontogeny, leading to that trophic interactions between individuals are a size-dependent and ontogenetically variable mixture of competition and predation. 2. Because differently sized individuals thus experience different biotic environments, invasion success may be determined by the body size of the invaders. Invasion outcome may also depend on the productivity of the system as productivity influences the biotic environment. 3. In a laboratory experiment with two poeciliid fishes the body size of the invading individuals and the daily amount of food supplied were manipulated. 4. Large invaders established persistent populations and drove the resident population to extinction in 10 out of 12 cases, while small invaders failed in 10 out of 12 trials. Stable coexistence was virtually absent. Invasion outcome was independent of productivity. 5. Further analyses suggest that small invaders experienced a competitive recruitment bottleneck imposed on them by the resident population. In contrast, large invaders preyed on the juveniles of the resident population. This predation allowed the large invaders to establish successfully by decreasing the resident population densities and thus breaking the bottleneck. 6. The results strongly suggest that the size distribution of invaders affects their ability to invade, an implication so far neglected in life-history omnivory systems. The findings are further in agreement with predictions of life-history omnivory theory, that size-structured interactions demote coexistence along a productivity gradient.","[Schroder, Arne] Present address Wageningen IMARES, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands; [Schroder, Arne; Nilsson, Karin A.; Persson, Lennart; van Kooten, Tobias; Reichstein, Birte] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Schroder, A (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",arne.schroder@emg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Reichstein, Birte/0000-0002-0551-6896",Memorial of J.C.

We studied the effect of predation risk imposed by the least weasel Mustela nivalis nivalis on space use, foraging and activity of two competing vole species, the grey-sided vole Myodes rufocanus, and the bank vole Myodes glareolus. The experiment was conducted in a large indoor arena, consisting of microhabitat structures providing food, shelter, trees for refuge and separated areas with high and low predation risk. Voles were followed for 5 days: 2 days before, 1 day during and 2 days after the presence of weasel. Our results suggest an effect of weasel presence on the vole community. Voles of both species shifted their activity from risky to less risky areas, climbed trees more often and were less active. Seed consumption was not affected by weasel presence. The time spent in the risky and less risky area did not differ between species, but bank voles spent more time in trees than grey-sided voles. Males of both species were more exposed to predation risk than females, i.e. generally spent more time in the risky area. Proportion of time spent in the risky area, the use of area, trees and food stations were sex dependent. Activity and use of trees were species dependent. We found no evidence for despotic distribution between our two species, although bank voles seemed to be more affected by coexistence, since they lost weight during the experiment. Based on our results we conclude that predator response was largely similar between species, while the sex-specific responses dominated. Besides a stronger escape response in the bank vole, the strongest individual differences were sex specific, i.e. males were more prone to take risks in space use and activity.","[Trebaticka, Lenka; Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Metapopulat Res Grp, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Tkadlec, Emil] Palacky Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic","Trebaticka, L (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",letrebat@cc.jyu.fi,"Tkadlec, Emil/A-6230-2014",,"CIMO; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [208478, 44878]","Jyrki Raatikainen is greatly acknowledged for building the tube system, Jani Korpilauri, Janne Koskinen, Helina Nisu, Irja Hanninen and Risto Latvanen for technical help.

Specific components of the system for predicting current size distributions of planted Douglas-fir include: dominant height and survival of planted Douglas-fir; a basal area projection equation for hardwoods; and diameter distribution percentile prediction Junctions for planted Douglas fir. Prediction equations for height, crown width, and height to crown base of individual trees describe stand structure of the planted Douglas-fir. The stand- and tree-level equations include both direct and indirect effects of hardwood competition and site preparation, competition release, and precommercial thinning treatments. With the exception of minimum dbh, stand-level equations for planted Douglas-fir explained at least 92% of the observed variation. Basal area dynamics were simulated through plantation age 20 Years for site preparation and competition release treatments of different effectiveness by varying hardwood basal area at plantation age 5 years. The simulations indicate that site preparation must reduce hardwood basal area at plantation age 5 years by 75% or more to realize an increase in Douglas-fir basal area and shift of the diameter distribution toward larger trees. This is due to increased growth of hardwoods that survive site preparation. In contrast, competition release treatments exhibited positive Douglas-fir response with 50% efficacy or more. Therefore, ineffective site preparation treatments need to be followed with competition release treatments having at least 50% efficacy to produce similar Douglas-fir basal area and diameter distributions at age 20 as in stands with no site preparation.","USDA ARS, Forest Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA","Knowe, SA (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Forest Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",steve.knowe@amforem.biz,,"Shula, Bob/0000-0002-9011-847X",,,,41,9,9,0,12,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0885-6095,,,WEST J APPL FOR,West.

However, persistence of a community as a whole depends both on the local interactions and the rates of dispersal between patches. We study a mathematical model of a metacommunity with two consumers exploiting a resource in a habitat of two different patches. They are the exploitative competitors or the competing predators indirectly competing through depletion of the shared resource. We show that they can potentially coexist, even if one species is sufficiently inferior to be driven extinct in both patches in isolation, when these patches are connected through diffusive dispersal. Thus, dispersal can mediate coexistence of competitors, even if both patches are local sinks for one species because of the interactions with the other species. The spatial asynchrony and the competition-colonization trade-off are usual mechanisms to facilitate regional coexistence. However, in our case, two consumers call coexist either in synchronous oscillation between patches or in equilibrium. The higher dispersal rate of the superior prompts rather than suppresses the inferior. Since differences in the carrying capacity between two patches generate flows from the more productive patch to the less productive, loss of the superior by emigration relaxes competition in the former, and depletion of the resource by subsidized consumers decouples the local community in the latter.

This is particularly relevant to classical biological control of cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar) (Tetranychidae) in Africa, as this pest mite is shared by several natural enemies in the Neotropics (its area of origin), two of which have been introduced and established widely in Africa. We conducted two screenhouse experiments using the two neotropical phytoseiid predatory mites, Typhlodromalus aripo DeLeon and Typhlodromalus manihoti Moraes, to determine the effects of single and two-predator species on population dynamics of the two predators and on suppression of M. tanajoa populations. The two predators are thought to be complementary in their impact on their shared prey M. tanajoa, due to similarities in their preference for this prey and to differences in their spatial distribution and foraging activities on cassava. The two predator species were released alone or together at low and at high initial densities of M. tanajoa. In all cases, predator releases resulted in significant suppression of M. tanajoa, but the degree of suppression did not differ among single and two-species releases with one exception: at high initial density of M. tanajoa, releases of T. aripo alone had less impact than that of either T. manihoti alone or of the two species together. Typhlodromalus aripo also appeared to be inferior as a competitor of T. manihoti: at low initial density of M. tanajoa, the proportion of T. aripo in the two-predator release treatments gradually declined and was strikingly lower than in the single species release, probably due to intraguild predation on its larvae by T. manihoti. However, T. aripo persisted longer than T. manihoti after elimination of M. tanajoa . On the basis of this study under semi-natural conditions, it appears that either species is sufficient for controlling M. tanajoa populations, with T. manihoti being more efficient at high initial prey densities and T. aripo at low initial prey densities. At high prey density, T. manihoti increased to large numbers and outcompeted T. aripo. Relevance of these findings to larger spatial scale and under natural conditions is discussed.","Int Inst Trop Agr, Biol Control Ctr Africa, Cotonou, Benin; Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hanna, R (corresponding author), LW Lambourn & Co, IITA Benin, 26 Dingwall Rd, Croydon CR9 3EE, England.",r.hanna@cgiar.org,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,36,18,20,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-3157,1360-0478,,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

The Jonah crab, Cancer borealis (Stimpson), was chosen as the interspecific competitor because it shares resources with C. irroratus. Four treatments were tested for their effect on foraging: the presence or absence of a competitor and two types of prey odor; body odor (living mussel) and tissue extract (dead mussel tissue). The presence of Jonah crabs did not influence location time, search time, prey size selected, or handling time of the rock crabs. However, rock crabs responded differently to the presence of body odor and tissue extract cues. The presence of extract odor decreased the time to locate prey while increasing the number of prey manipulated and prey size selected. When prey body odor was present, rock crabs displayed less investigative behaviors than in the presence of extract odor, illustrated by reduced location time. Extract odor provided a stronger and more attractive cue than body odor, but increased prey manipulation and search time. Extract odor induced increases in manipulation and searching for prey but canceled out the benefits of decreased location time, resulting in crabs from both treatments displaying similar search times. These elevated behaviors may be associated with foraging for injured and cracked prey or may indicate an area of conspecific feeding. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Gravid females of Menochilus sexmaculatus ( Fabricius) ( Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) reduced oviposition, but not feeding, when exposed to immobilised conspecific or Coccinella transversalis ( Fabricius) ( Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) individuals in the short-term ( 3 h) and long-term ( 24 h). Feeding and oviposition responses were not affected when M. sexmaculatus females were exposed to larvae or adults of Scymnus pyrocheilus Mulsant ( Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) beetles or larvae of the syrphid fly Ischiodon scutellaris ( Fabricius) ( Diptera: Syrphidae). The ratio of eggs laid to numbers of aphids consumed by M. sexmaculatus females was also affected by the presence of conspecific or C. transversalis larvae.

Research in this area is needed due to the often contradictory predictions provided by the many theoretical models, the increasing dependence on biological control, and the concern that biological control agents may adversely affect some nontarget organisms. We describe a study whereby the occurrence and dynamics of interspecific interactions among three natural enemies (two parasitoids: Encarsia formosa and Encarsia pergandiella; and one predator Delphastus pusillus) of the whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii (previously referred to as Bemisia tabaci strain ''B''), were evaluated in greenhouse cage experiments. Eight populations consisting of all possible combinations of the three natural enemies and one population of whitefly alone were established to test the following hypotheses: (1) Natural enemy introductions are capable of suppressing B. argentifolii populations; (2) all interspecific interactions are detrimental to achieving biological control; (3) the likelihood of achieving biological control decreases as the potential number of interspecific interactions increases; and (4) the species composition of biological control agents is of greater consequence than the number of natural enemy species released. In addition, we tested the hypothesis (5) that the frequency of interspecific interactions increases with a decrease in host or prey availability. Our results demonstrate that all combinations of natural enemies provided significant levels of whitefly suppression. While the intensities of interspecific interactions among natural enemy species were frequently positively and significantly correlated with the densities of parasitized whitefly, interspecific interactions among natural enemies were not detrimental to achieving higher levels of biological control. The composition of species released, rather than the number of species released, was of greater importance to accomplishing biological control. Releases of D. pusillus in combination with one or both of the parasitoids provided the greatest levels of whitefly suppression. These results suggest that the types of interspecific interactions rather than the numbers of interspecific interactions among natural enemies may be important to the outcome of inundative biological control programs.

We extend a predator-prey model previously parameterized for voles and weasels to two prey species, a 'Microrus' (field vole) type which is competitively superior to but more vulnerable to predation than a 'Clethrionomys' (bank vole) type. 2. The model explains four patterns in the dynamics of multispecies rodent assemblages in Fennoscandia: a predictable shift in the relative abundances of different prey species during one multiannual population cycle; long-term (supracyclic) variation in relative prey abundances; an association between the amplitude of population oscillations and the type of the numerically dominant prey species; and increasing rodent species number with increasing latitude, 3. The model results illustrate the complex and often unexpected behaviour of strongly connected multispecies assemblages, of which the Fennoscandian rodent-predator community is a prime example. 4. Since the mid 1980s, rodent oscillations in many, though not all, parts of northern Fennoscandia have become distinctly less regular (non-cyclic), a change which is reflected in the entire animal community linked to the keystone species. the arvicoline rodents, We demonstrate that such long-term changes in the amplitude and regularity of rodent oscillations are not unexpected in multispecies prey-predator assemblages.","FINNISH FOREST RES INST, DEPT FOREST ECOL, SF-01301 VANTAA, FINLAND","Hanski, I (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT SYSTEMAT & ECOL, DIV POPULAT BIOL, POB 17, ARKADIANKATU 7, SF-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND.",,,,,,,84,160,164,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Daphnia pulicaria is mostly found in the hypolimnion whereas D. galeata mendotae undergoes diel vertical migration between the hypolimnion and the epilimnion. I examined how habitat segregation between these two potentially competing species might be affected by trophic interactions with their resources and predators by performing a field experiment in deep enclosures in which I manipulated fish predation, nutrient levels, and the density of epilimnetic Daphnia. The results of the experiment indicate that habitat use by D. pulicaria can be jointly regulated by competition for food from epilimnetic Daphnia and predation by fishes. Patterns of habitat segregation between the two Daphnia species were determined by predation by fish but not by nutrient levels: The removal of epilimnetic fish predators resulted in higher zooplankton and lower epilimnetic phytoplankton densities and allowed D. pulicaria to expand its habitat distribution into the epilimnion. In contrast, increased resource productivity resulted in higher densities of both Daphnia species but did not affect phytoplankton levels or habitat use by Daphnia. The two species exhibit a trade-off in their ability to exploit resources and their susceptibility to predation by fish. D. g. mendotae (the less susceptible species) may thus restrict D. pulicaria (the better resource exploiter) from the epilimnion when fish are common due to lower minimum resource requirements than those needed by D. pulicaria to offset the higher mortality rate imposed by selective epilimnetic fish predators. D. g. mendotae does not appear to have this effect in the absence of fish.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,KELLOGG BIOL STN,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060",,,,,,,,51,83,83,0,24,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,86,4,,,,,510,520,,10.1007/BF00318317,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN885,WOS:A1991FN88500008,28313332,,,,2021-09-21,

The reasons why this variation is often very large within populations have been less investigated. We suggest that the interaction between fluctuating environmental conditions and polyandry is a key phenomenon explaining such variation. We focus here on imminent predation risk (IPR). IPR impacts significantly several aspects of prey behaviour and reproduction, and it is expected to influence the operation of sexual selection before and after mating. We estimated the effect of IPR on the male opportunity for pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), a livebearing fish where females prefer colourful males and mate multiply. We used a repeated-measures design, in which males were allowed to mate with different females either under IPR or in a predator-free condition. We found that IPR increased the total opportunity for sexual selection and reduced the relative contribution of postcopulatory sexual selection to male reproductive success. IPR is inherently variable and our results suggest that interspecific reproductive interference by predators may contribute towards maintaining the variation in sperm production within populations.

We use replacement series experiments with three species of blow flies: Phormia regina (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae), and Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) to characterize competitive relationships. From experimental results, P regina showed a significant competitive advantage over L. sericata. Infestation of carrion differs between L. sericata and P. regina; specifically, L sericata oviposits on carrion without any delay, while P. regina typically delays oviposition. Our findings are consistent with the notion that differences in oviposition times represent a mechanism for L. sericata to avoid potential competition. Competition by C. rufifacies differs since C. rufifacies, in the event of a limited food supply, will prey on other maggot species. In replacement series experiments, C. rufifacies killed all P. regina in mixed treatments, representing an ultimate competitive advantage. In the United States, these two species do not often overlap because of differences in seasonal distribution. However, with climate change, phenological separation may grow less distinct. Surprisingly, in replacement series experiments with C. rufifacies and L. sericata, no competitive interactions were observed. In other studies, L. sericata has been shown to form clusters away from predaceous maggots, allowing improved survival, which may account for the absence of predation by C. rufifacies. Finally, this study shows that replacement series models are useful in measuring competition, supporting the notion that interspecific competition between necrophagous insect species may have driven life history traits of those species.","[MacInnis, Amber E.; Higley, Leon G.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, 1400 R St, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","MacInnis, AE (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, 1400 R St, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",thesocialblowfly@gmail.com,"Higley, Leon G/E-3311-2010",,,,,56,0,0,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

The Arctic tundra is a low productivity ecosystem supporting simple food webs, but several predators often feed on the same prey species, lemmings, known for their large-amplitude population fluctuations. We examined mechanisms involved in reducing intra-guild competition and allowing coexistence of four avian predators (snowy owls, glaucous gulls, rough-legged hawks and long-tailed jaegers) feeding on a pulsed resource (brown and collared lemmings). We compared the size and species of prey consumed by predators to see if resource partitioning occurred. We also verified if spatial segregation in nesting areas could be another mechanism allowing coexistence. Finally, we tested if the absence of the snowy owl, a dominant and irruptive species, triggered a competitive release on the smallest predator, the jaeger, with respect to prey size and nesting area used. We monitored the breeding of predators and lemming abundance over a 14-year period on Bylot Island, Canada. We mapped their nesting sites and collected regurgitation pellets to recover lemming mandibles, which were used to infer prey species and size. The size of lemmings consumed varied among species with the largest predators consuming the largest lemmings and the smallest predators consuming the smallest lemmings. All predators consumed more collared than brown lemmings compared to their availability although owls and jaegers consumed relatively more brown lemmings compared to gulls and hawks. Jaegers consumed larger lemmings in the absence of owls than in their presence, suggestive of a short-term competitive release. We found moderate to low overlap in nesting areas among predators and no evidence of their expansion in the absence of owls, suggesting that spatial distribution is caused by species-specific habitat preferences. The main mechanism to partition food resources among these avian predators is spatial segregation, and secondarily prey size and species. However, we found evidence that food competition is still present and leads to a niche shift in the smallest predator of the guild. Interspecific competition may thus be a pervasive force in simple, low productivity food webs characterized by pulsed resources.","[Seyer, Yannick; Gauthier, Gilles; Fauteux, Dominique] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Seyer, Yannick; Gauthier, Gilles; Fauteux, Dominique] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Fauteux, Dominique] Canadian Museum Nat, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Therrien, Jean-Francois] Hawk Mt Sanctuary, Acopian Ctr Conservat Learning, Orwigsburg, PA USA","Seyer, Y (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.; Seyer, Y (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",yannick.seyer.1@ulaval.ca,"Fauteux, Dominique/H-5232-2019","Fauteux, Dominique/0000-0001-5373-8701; Seyer, Yannick/0000-0001-5752-7952",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Fonds de recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies; Network of Centre of Excellence ArcticNet; Polar Continental Shelf Program of Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources Canada; Northern Scientific Training Program of Polar Knowledge Canada; International Polar Year Program of the Government of Canada; Garfield Weston Foundation,"Support for this project was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Fonds de recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies, the Network of Centre of Excellence ArcticNet, the Polar Continental Shelf Program of Natural Resources Canada, the Northern Scientific Training Program of Polar Knowledge Canada, the International Polar Year Program of the Government of Canada and the Garfield Weston Foundation.",,63,0,0,3,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

It has been suggested that the conversion of old-growth coniferous forests into early-seral stages has increased cervid abundances, which have, in turn, stimulated a numerical response of predator populations, ultimately threatening caribou populations via a habitat-mediated apparent competition mechanism. Using a long-term dataset (1984-2012) of the Atlantic-Gaspesie caribou population, we quantified changes in interspecific interactions triggered by apparent competition between moose (Alces americanus) and caribou via the responses of two incidental predators, coyote (Canis latrans) and black bear (Ursus americanus). We also documented calf recruitment rates and analysed temporal trends (last three decades) in this vital rate. Inter-annual variations in autumn calf recruitment were mostly affected by the proxy of regional abundance of coyotes, which was highly correlated with moose and black bear proxies of abundance. The increase in coyote abundance proxy in the Gaspesie Peninsula following anthropogenic habitat modifications seems to be the main mechanism responsible for the current decline in the Atlantic-Gaspesie caribou population. Our analyses revealed some impacts of habitat alteration and the complexity of the resulting trophic cascades. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Recent studies have illuminated multi-speciesmigrations by land and sea including the simultaneous movements of numerous insects, birds, bats and of fish invertebrates marine predators. Beyond their significance as natural wonders, species with overlapping migrations may interact ecologically, with potential effects on population and community dynamics. Direct and indirect ecological interactions (including predation and competition) between migrant species remain poorly understood, in part because migration is the least-studied phase of animals' annual cycles. To address this gap, we conducted a literature review to examine whether animal migration studies incorporate multiple species and to what extent they investigate interspecific interactions between co-migrants. Following a key word search, we read all migration research papers in 23 relevant peer-reviewed journals during 2008-2017. Thirty percent of animal migration papers reported two or more species with coinciding migrations, suggesting that co-migrations are common, although few studies investigated or discussed these mixed-species migrations further. Synthesizing these, we present examples and describe five types of ecological interactions between migrating species, including predator-prey, host-parasite and commensal relationships. Considering migratory animals as interacting with migrant communities will enhance understanding of the drivers of migration and could improve predictions about wildlife responses to global change. Further research focused on multi-species migrations could also inform conservation efforts for migratory animal populations, many of which are declining or shifting, with unexplored consequences for other co-migratory species.","[Cohen, Emily B.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Appalachian Lab, 301 Braddock Rd, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA; [Satterfield, Dara A.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Migratory Bird Ctr, Natl Zool Pk, Washington, DC USA","Cohen, EB (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Appalachian Lab, 301 Braddock Rd, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA.",emily.cohen@umces.edu,"Cohen, Emily/AAB-4246-2020","Cohen, Emily/0000-0002-4978-4278",,,,121,6,6,5,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,NOV,2020,43,11,,,,,1657,1671,,10.1111/ecog.04958,,MAR 2020,15,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OM4UH,WOS:000522505000001,,gold,,,2021-09-21,

One general hypothesis, often attributed to Darwin and MacArthur, is that interspecific competition prevents species from inhabiting the warmest portions along geographic gradients (i.e., low latitudes or low elevations). A prediction arising from this Darwin-MacArthur hypothesis is that lower elevation species are better competitors than related higher elevation species. An alternative prediction is that higher elevation animal taxa will tend to be better competitors because they will tend to be larger (Bergmann's rule). Here, I test these opposing predictions. Location Global. Time period 1971-2019. Major taxa studied Birds, mammals, amphibians, fishes. Methods I conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured pairwise behavioural aggression between species-pairs of closely related animals where the two species inhabit divergent elevational distributions. Results I found that (a) interspecific aggression appears to be a reliable indicator of interspecific competition; (b) elevational position was not consistently linked to interspecific aggression-while lower elevation songbird species in the tropics showed stronger interspecific aggression in response to playback experiments, higher elevation species showed stronger interspecific aggression in direct observations of interspecific aggression across a range of taxa and latitudes; (c) body size was a good predictor of pairwise interspecific aggression and (d) there was limited evidence for Bergmann's rule. Main conclusions My results do not support the longstanding prediction that lower elevation animals are generally better competitors than their higher elevation relatives. Instead, patterns of interspecific aggression are linked to body size, with larger animals showing more aggression towards smaller relatives than vice versa. Hence, a trait-body size-that is idiosyncratically related to elevational position appear to determine the outcome of pairwise behavioural interactions. Last, I consider these results in the context of the hypothesis that behavioural interactions may impact rates of upslope range shifts associated with recent warming.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, 2212 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Freeman, Benjamin G.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, 2212 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",freeman@zoology.ubc.ca,,"Freeman, Benjamin/0000-0001-6131-6832",Banting Research Foundation [379958],"Banting Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 379958",,56,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Rather, the differences that promote stable coexistence can be those which cause each species to experience stronger intraspecific than interspecific competition. Recent approaches have established how to detect the demographic signature of these competitive effects, but alone they cannot elucidate the ecological differences among species that yield these patterns. Here, we present a unifying experimental and observational framework that identifies potential ecological differences among species shaping their responses to intra- and interspecific competition. We first describe a conceptual model establishing why the strength of intra- and interspecific competitive interactions should vary along environmental gradients related to species ecological differences. We then show how to apply the framework using Enallagma damselflies, a diverse group of predatory aquatic insects. To determine how species responded to intra- and interspecific competition along environmental gradients, we experimentally manipulated the relative abundances of three species and replicated this across five lakes which varied in environmental conditions affecting larval damselfly per capita growth and mortality rates-key vital rates regulating their populations. Results suggest Enallagma are ecologically differentiated in ways that in some communities can result in intraspecific competition exceeding interspecific competition. However, in many cases the opposite was true, or the effects of intra- and interspecific competition were equivalent via growth and mortality responses. Moreover, these effects tended to be weak and asymmetrical among competitors, which suggests that differential responses of larval growth and mortality to intra- and interspecific competition may not contribute strongly to the maintenance of Enallagma diversity. Different environmental factors appear to shape these demographic responses to competition, providing insight into the ecological mechanisms regulating damselfly assemblages. This framework can be broadly applied to identify the ecological differences among species that may promote coexistence, advancing knowledge of the mechanisms underlying coexistence and overcoming some limitations of purely phenomenological approaches.","[Ousterhout, Brittany H.; Serrano, Mabel; Bried, Jason T.; Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Ousterhout, Brittany H.] Natl Great Rivers Res & Educ Ctr, East Alton, IL USA; [Bried, Jason T.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Siepielski, AM (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",amsiepie@uark.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021; Bried, Jason/AAF-9492-2021","Bried, Jason/0000-0002-8659-9848",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1748945],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB1748945",,83,5,5,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

In nature, sexual selection occurs in communities of interacting species; however, heterospecifics are rarely included in characterizations of social structure. Heterospecifics can influence the reproductive outcomes of intrasexual competition by interfering with intraspecific sexual interactions (interspecific reproductive interference [IRI]). We outline the need for studies of sexual selection to incorporate heterospecifics as part of the social environment. We use simulations to show that classic predictions for the effect of social structure on sexual selection are altered by an interaction between social structure and IRI. This interaction has wide-ranging implications for patterns of sexual conflict and kin-selected reproductive strategies in socially structured populations. Our work bridges the gap between sexual selection research on social structure and IRI, and highlights future directions to study sexual selection in interacting communities.","[McDonald, Grant C.; Pizzari, Tommaso] Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [McDonald, Grant C.] Univ Vet Med Budapest, Dept Ecol, H-1077 Budapest, Hungary; [Gardner, Andy] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland","McDonald, GC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.; McDonald, GC (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Budapest, Dept Ecol, H-1077 Budapest, Hungary.",grant.mcdonald@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Gardner, Andy/K-5353-2013","Gardner, Andy/0000-0002-1304-3734; Mcdonald, Grant/0000-0002-2864-9608",Biotechnology AMP; Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/L009587/1]; Aviagen Ltd.

Synthesiomyia nudiseta is a species that has recently been recorded on human corpses in Europe, and it has been cited in forensic cases in Spain and Italy. The mature larvae are known to be facultative predators on necrophagous fly larvae, but their role as predators is unknown. The aim of this paper is to investigate the predatory behavior of S. nudiseta on the most abundant blowfly larvae in sarcosaprophagous communities in southwestern Europe (i.e., Chrysomya albiceps, Lucilia sericata, and Calliphora vicina). Intraspecific and interspecific competition experiments were carried out to study the effect of this species in the necrophagous diptera community. First-instar larvae were placed in plastic cups with the same amount of pig liver (15g) at different densities (50, 100, 150, and 300 individuals/cup). Mortality in blowflies increased when S. nudiseta larvae were present: up to 98.40% in Ch. albiceps, 89.60% in L. sericata, and 84.93% in C. vicina. Pre-imaginal developmental time and adult wing size were analyzed and compared under each of the intraspecific and interspecific conditions; both variables were affected by competition in all cases. The implications of the presence of S. nudiseta for sarcosaprophagous community dynamics and its effect on the estimation of postmortem interval (PMI) are discussed.","[Ivorra, Tania; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel; Rojo, Santos] Univ Alicante, Dept Environm Sci & Nat Resources, E-03080 Alicante, Spain","Ivorra, T (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Environm Sci & Nat Resources, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",tania.ivorra@gmail.com,"Rojo, Santos/L-9717-2014; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel/H-1376-2014","Rojo, Santos/0000-0003-2160-9643; Ivorra, Tania/0000-0002-4656-6347; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel/0000-0003-1497-8571",Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat ValencianaEuropean Commission [GV/2011/039]; University of Alicante [GRE09-27],"This work belongs to Tania Ivorra PhD and was partially supported by the projects GV/2011/039 (Generalitat Valenciana) and GRE09-27 (University of Alicante).

Three solitary larval endoparasitoids, Asobara japonica Belokobylskij (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), Ganaspis brasiliensis Ihering and Leptopilina japonica Novkovic & Kimura (both Hymenoptera: Figitidae) from Asia are potential agents for classical biological control of the invasive Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in North America. We compared the developmental rates of early immature stages of the three parasitoids and then evaluated their potential interactions, including elimination of competitors in intrinsic competition, interspecific discrimination of previously parasitized hosts, and the outcomes of interspecific competition at three host densities (5, 15 or 30 host larvae). On average, L. japonica eggs hatched first, followed by A. japonica and then G. brasiliensis. All three species exhibited interspecific competition after egg hatch through physical combat or in some cases through physiological suppression, with L. japonica out-competing the other two parasitoid species in multi-parasitized hosts. Ganaspis brasiliensis adults discriminated strongly against hosts previously parasitized by L. japonica, and A. japonica adults discriminated against hosts previously parasitized by L. japonica, whereas L. japonica only discriminated against hosts parasitized by G. brasiliensis. Regardless of host density, the observed parasitism when both A. japonica and L. japonica were present was lower than expected, a likely consequence of interspecific competition, but the combined impacts on host suppression by L. japonica and G. brasiliensis were additive, likely due to strong interspecific discrimination by G. brasiliensis.","[Wang, Xingeng; Hougardy, Evelyne; Nance, Alexandra H.; Daane, Kent M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Xingeng] USDA ARS, Beneficial Insects Intro Res Unit, Newark, DE 19713 USA; [Hogg, Brian N.] USDA ARS, Invas Species & Pollinator Hlth Res Unit, Albany, CA USA","Wang, XG (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Beneficial Insects Intro Res Unit, Newark, DE 19713 USA.",xingeng.wang@ars.usda.gov,,"Hougardy, Evelyne/0000-0001-7537-470X","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture Specialty Crops Research Initiative [2015-51181-24252]; California Cherry Board, USDA APHIS (Farm bill) [14-8130-0463]; University of California Agricultural and Natural Research Grant","Funding for the study was provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture Specialty Crops Research Initiative under Agreement No. 2015-51181-24252, the California Cherry Board, USDA APHIS (Farm bill, fund 14-8130-0463), and the University of California Agricultural and Natural Research Grant.

However, the nature and strength of interactions among species remain unknown for most resource pulse-driven ecosystems. We considered five hypotheses concerning the influence of resource pulses on the interactions between rodents, predators, and bird reproduction with data from northern Switzerland collected between 2010 and 2015. In high-rodent-abundance-years (HRAYs), wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) nest survival was lower than in low-rodent-abundance-years, but rodents were not important nest predators, in contrast to rodent-hunting predators. The higher proportion of nests predated by rodent-hunting predators and their increased occurrence in HRAYs suggests a rodent-mediated aggregative numerical response of rodent-hunting predators, which incidentally prey on the wood warbler's ground nests. There was no evidence that rodent-hunting predators responded behaviorally by switching prey. Lastly, nest losses caused by nonrodent-hunting predators were not related to rodent abundance. We show that wood warblers and rodents are linked via shared predators in a manner consistent with apparent competition, where an increase of one species coincides with the decrease of another species mediated by shared predators. Mast seeding frequency and annual seed production appear to have increased over the past century, which may result in more frequent HRAYs and generally higher peaking rodent populations.

However, the spatial and temporal variations in coexistence and its consequences for competition remain poorly understood. We used an extensive database on reproduction in nest boxes by great and blue tits based on 87 study plots across Europe and Northern Africa during 1957-2012 for a total of 19,075 great tit and 16,729 blue tit clutches to assess correlative evidence for a relationship between laying date and clutch size, respectively, and density consistent with effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition. In an initial set of analyses, we statistically controlled for a suite of site-specific variables. We found evidence for an effect of intraspecific competition on blue tit laying date (later laying at higher density) and clutch size (smaller clutch size at higher density), but no evidence of significant effects of intraspecific competition in great tits, nor effects of interspecific competition for either species. To further control for site-specific variation caused by a range of potentially confounding variables, we compared means and variances in laying date and clutch size of great and blue tits among three categories of difference in density between the two species. We exploited the fact that means and variances are generally positively correlated. If interspecific competition occurs, we predicted a reduction in mean and an increase in variance in clutch size in great tit and blue tit when density of heterospecifics is higher than the density of conspecifics, and for intraspecific competition, this reduction would occur when density of conspecifics is higher than the density of heterospecifics. Such comparisons of temporal patterns of means and variances revealed evidence, for both species, consistent with intraspecific competition and to a smaller extent with interspecific competition. These findings suggest that competition associated with reproductive behaviour between blue and great tits is widespread, but also varies across large spatial and temporal scales.","[Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, CNRS, Ecol Systemat Evolut, Orsay, France; [Balbontin, Javier] Univ Seville, Fac Biol, Dept Zool, Seville, Spain; [Dhondt, Andre A.] Cornell Univ, Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Remes, Vladimir] Palacky Univ, Dept Zool, Lab Ornithol, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Adriaensen, Frank] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Biard, Clotilde] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Inst Ecol & Sci Environm, Sorbonne Univ, UPEC,IEES Paris, Paris, France; [Camprodon, Jordi] Ctr Tecnol Forestal Catalunya, Area Biodiversitat, Grp Biol Conservacio, Solsona, Spain; [Cichon, Mariusz] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Doligez, Blandine] Univ Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, CNRS, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut,UMR 5558, Villeurbanne, France; [Dubiec, Anna; Mazgajski, Tomasz D.] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Warsaw, Poland; [Eens, Marcel; Pinxten, Rianne] Behav Ecol & Ecophysiol Grp, Dept Biol, Campus Drie Eiken, Antwerp, Belgium; [Eeva, Tapio] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland; [Goodenough, Anne E.] Univ Gloucestershire, Dept Nat & Social Sci, Cheltenham, Glos, England; [Gosler, Andrew G.] Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Gosler, Andrew G.] Inst Human Sci, Oxford, England; [Gustafsson, Lars] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biolpgy Ctr, Dept Anim Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Heeb, Philipp] UPS Toulouse III, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, Toulouse, France; [Hinsley, Shelley A.] CEH Wallingford, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Jacob, Staffan] CNRS Moulis, Stn Ecol Expt, CNRS, USR 2936, Moulis, France; [Juskaitis, Rimvydas] Nat Res Ctr, Inst Ecol, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Laaksonen, Toni] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku, Finland; [Massa, Bruno] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Nager, Ruedi G.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Nilsson, Jan-Ake] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol, Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson, Sven G.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers, Lund, Sweden; [Norte, Ana C.] Univ Coimbra, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Coimbra, Portugal; [Pinxten, Rianne] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Didact Res Grp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Robles, Hugo] Univ A Coruna, Fac Sci, Evolutionary Ecol Grp GIBE, La Coruna, Spain; [Robles, Hugo] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Grp EVECO, Antwerp, Belgium; [Solonen, Tapio] Luontotutkimus Solonen Oy, Helsinki, Finland; [Sorace, Alberto] ISPRA, Rome, Italy; [van Noordwijk, Arie J.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lambrechts, Marcel M.] CEFE, UMR 5175, Montpellier 5, France","Moller, AP (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, CNRS, Ecol Systemat Evolut, Orsay, France.",anders.moller@u-psud.fr,"Gustafsson, Lars/A-7634-2012; Moller, Anders/O-6665-2016; Eens, Marcel/AAC-8466-2020; Remes, Vladimir/B-6842-2016; Gustafsson, Lars/O-8056-2019; Doligez, Blandine/ABB-5977-2020; Laaksonen, Toni/B-4241-2014; Juskaitis, Rimvydas/A-2806-2008; Balbontin, Javier/H-5932-2015; Dubiec, Anna/H-2941-2012; Norte, Ana Claudia do Souto Goncalves/AAC-5871-2021; Robles, Hugo/AAH-6795-2021; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Eeva, Tapio/V-8922-2018","Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863; Moller, Anders/0000-0003-3739-4675; Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863; Doligez, Blandine/0000-0003-3015-5022; Laaksonen, Toni/0000-0001-9035-7131; Juskaitis, Rimvydas/0000-0003-0254-9198; Balbontin, Javier/0000-0003-1539-2636; Dubiec, Anna/0000-0003-4007-5915; Norte, Ana Claudia do Souto Goncalves/0000-0001-7833-4463; Robles, Hugo/0000-0003-0289-0687; Mazgajski, Tomasz/0000-0003-3714-1467; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Camprodon, Jordi/0000-0001-8457-9424; Biard, Clotilde/0000-0001-7474-5345; Cichon, Mariusz/0000-0002-6164-6951; Eeva, Tapio/0000-0002-0395-1536",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [265859],"We would like to warmly thank the hundreds of collaborators and contributors who helped with study plot management, data collection, data management, administration, financial support and scientific discussion.

Variation in predation risk and resource availability may influence the occurrence and fitness effects of aggregating in nature. Yet tests of such possibilities are lacking. Cavity-nesting birds provide an interesting test case. They compete aggressively for resources and experience low nest predation rates, which might predict dispersion, but across 19 years of study we found that they commonly aggregate by sharing nest trees. Tree sharing was more common when aspen were more abundant and was somewhat more common in years with higher nest predation risk. Nest success was higher in shared trees when nest predation risk was higher than average. Ultimately, the costs and benefits of aggregating (nest tree sharing) varied across years, and we outline hypotheses for future studies.","[Mouton, James C.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Martin, Thomas E.] Univ Montana, US Geol Survey, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Mouton, JC (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",james@moutons.org,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1701672, DEB-0841764, DEB-1241041, IOS-1349178]","We appreciate helpful comments from two anonymous reviewers and our laboratory on the manuscript.

Cases where the invasion has been tracked since its beginning are rare, however, such that the first interactions between invasive and native species remain poorly understood. Communication behavior is an integral part of species identity and is subject to selection. Consequently, resource use and direct interference competition between native and invasive species may drive its evolution. Here, we tested the role of interactions between the recently introduced invasive lizard Anolis cristatellus and the native Anolis oculatus on variation in behavior and communication in Calibishie (Dominica). From May to June 2016, we filmed 122 adult males of both species displaying in banana farms under two contexts (allopatry and sympatry). We then recorded (i) the proportion of time spent displaying and (ii) the relative frequency of dewlap vs. push-up displays. To control for habitat variation, we measured and compared the habitat characteristics (canopy openness and habitat openness) of 228 males in allopatry and sympatry. While the habitat characteristics and total display-time did not differ between the contexts for the two species, the proportion of display-time spent dewlapping by A. cristatellus decreased in sympatry. The display of A. oculatus did not differ between the contexts, however. Shifts in microhabitat use, predation pressure, or interspecific interference are potential factors which might explain the behavioral changes in display observed in A. cristatellus. This study highlights the role of behavioral traits as a first response of an invasive species to recent competition with a closely related native species.","[Dufour, Claire M.

Several phylogenetic comparative methods have been developed to assess the importance of such processes in nature; however, the statistical properties of these methods have gone largely untested. Focusing mainly on scenarios of competition between closely-related species, we assess the performance of available comparative approaches for analyzing the interplay between interspecific interactions and species phenotypes. We find that many currently used statistical methods often fail to detect the impact of interspecific interactions on trait evolution, that sister-taxa analyses are particularly unreliable in general, and that recently developed process-based models have more satisfactory statistical properties. Methods for detecting predictors of species interactions are generally more reliable than methods for detecting character displacement. In weighing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, we hope to provide a clear guide for empiricists testing hypotheses about the reciprocal effect of interspecific interactions and species phenotypes and to inspire further development of process-based models.","[Drury, J.

The role of interspecific competition for generating patterns in species' distribution is hotly debated and studies taking into account processes occurring at both large and small spatial scales are almost missing. Theoretically, competition between species with overlapping niches should result in divergence of their niches in sympatry to reduce the costs of competition. Many species show a mosaic distribution within sympatric zones, with the syntopic sites occupied by both species, and allotopic sites where only one species occurs. It is unclear whether such mosaics arise as a consequence of competition-driven niche segregation or due to the decline of their abundances towards range edges driven by environmental gradients. 2. If the interspecific competition matters, we should observe (1) a shift in habitat preferences of one or both species between syntopy and allotopy, and (2) between allopatry and allotopy. Moreover, (3) species should show greater divergence in their habitat preferences in allotopy than in allopatry where (4) no differences in habitat preferences may occur. Finally, (5) shifts should be generally greater in the competitively subordinate species than in the dominant species. 3. We used a unique dataset on abundance of two closely related passerine species, the Common Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and the Thrush Nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), collected across their syntopy, allotopy and allopatry. The predictions were tested within a generalized mixed-effects modelling framework. 4. After accounting for environmental gradients perpendicular to the species' contact zone, we found a strong support for all but one prediction. Habitat preferences of both species shifted markedly between syntopy and allotopy, as well as between allopatry and allotopy. Whereas the species preferred the same habitats in allopatry, their preferences became strikingly different in allotopy where the abundance of the Common Nightingale increased towards dry and warm sites with low coverage of pastures, while the abundance of the Thrush Nightingale showed exactly opposite trends. Fifth prediction was not supported. 5. Our results indicate that the competition between closely related species can result in considerable changes in habitat use across their geographic ranges accompanied with divergence in their habitat preferences in sympatry. Here, the species escape from competition to allotopic sites covered by habitats avoided by the competitor. Therefore, we argue that the interspecific competition is an important driver of species' distribution at both large and small spatial scales.","[Reif, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Environm Studies, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Reif, Jiri] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool & Lab Ornithol, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Reifova, Radka] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague, Czech Republic; [Skoracka, Anna; Kuczynski, Lechoslaw] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Populat Ecol Lab, Poznan, Poland","Reif, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Inst Environm Studies, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.; Reif, J (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool & Lab Ornithol, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",jirireif@natur.cuni.cz,"Reif, Jiri/I-9168-2017; Reifova, Radka/D-2137-2011; Kuczynski, Lechoslaw/E-5525-2011; Skoracka, Anna/E-6002-2011","Reif, Jiri/0000-0003-2553-7333; Reifova, Radka/0000-0001-5852-5174; Kuczynski, Lechoslaw/0000-0003-3498-5445; Skoracka, Anna/0000-0002-9485-532X",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-10884Y],"Czech Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 15-10884Y",,84,15,15,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Competition for ecological resources can lead to different outcomes from character displacement to, ultimately, competitive exclusion. Accordingly, divergent natural selection should disfavor those species that are the most similar to their competitor in resource use, thereby increasing morphological disparity. Here, we examined ecomorphological variability within an Australo-Papuan bird radiation, the Acanthizidae, which include both allopatric and sympatric complexes. In addition, we investigated whether morphological similarities between species are related to environmental factors at fine scale (foraging niche) and/or large scale (climate). Contrary to that predicted by the competition hypothesis, we did not find a significant correlation between the morphological similarities found between species and their degree of range overlap. Comparative modeling based on both a priori and data-driven identification of selective regimes suggested that foraging niche is a poor predictor of morphological variability in acanthizids. By contrast, our results indicate that climatic conditions were an important factor in the formation of morphological variation. We found a significant negative correlation between species scores for PC1 (positively associated to tarsus length and tail length) and both temperature and precipitation, whereas PC2 (positively associated to bill length and wing length) correlated positively with precipitation. In addition, we found that species inhabiting the same region are closer to each other in morphospace than to species outside that region regardless of genus to which they belong or its foraging strategy.

Competition and predation can affect adaptive radiations, but contrasting theoretical and empirical results show that they can both promote and interrupt diversification. A mechanistic understanding of the link between microevolutionary processes and macroevolutionary patterns is thus needed, especially in trophic communities. Here, we use a trait-based eco-evolutionary model to investigate the mechanisms linking competition, predation and adaptive radiations. By combining available micro-evolutionary theory and simulations of adaptive radiations we show that intraspecific competition is crucial for diversification as it induces disruptive selection, in particular in early phases of radiation. The diversification rate is however decreased in later phases owing to interspecific competition as niche availability, and population sizes are decreased. We provide new insight into how predation tends to have a negative effect on prey diversification through decreased population sizes, decreased disruptive selection and through the exclusion of prey from parts of niche space. The seemingly disparate effects of competition and predation on adaptive radiations, listed in the literature, may thus be acting and interacting in the same adaptive radiation at different relative strength as the radiation progresses.","[Pontarp, Mikael; Petchey, Owen L.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pontarp, Mikael] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Pontarp, M (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.; Pontarp, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",mikael.pontarp@biol.lu.se,"Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission,Financial support for M.P.'s participation in this study was provided by the Swedish Research Council.

We conducted a field experiment to evaluate Culex oviposition behavior in response to the interspecific competitor Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae, and resources in the form of quantity of plant detritus, and dissolved nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) derived from that detritus. We tested a set of specific predictions: 1) As a poorer competitor, Culex will avoid ovipositing in containers with superior interspecific competitors; 2) Culex choose oviposition habitats that contain greater amount of resources for the microbial food of their offspring; 3) Sufficiently high resource abundance can override avoidance of oviposition in containers with interspecific competitors. Culex restuans Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was the only species ovipositing, and the oviposition responses changed over time. The effect of resources was more important in driving oviposition decisions at the beginning and end of the experiment. The amount of resources, as manifest by TN and TP concentrations, had differential effects on oviposition. At the beginning females laid more eggs in containers with low detritus, which had the highest TN. After that, females preferred those containers with high detritus, which had low TN and high TP. The effect of competitors was important only during the middle of the experiment. Paradoxically, even as a poorer competitor Cx. restuans preferentially oviposited in containers with late-instar Ae. triseriatus, suggesting that the presence of successful heterospecifics indicates a good quality larval habitat.","[Grech, Marta G.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Grech, Marta G.] UNPSJB, Fac Ciencias Nat, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Grech, MG (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina.",mgrech@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322-01A1]; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We wish to thank G.

We studied in experimental enclosures how closely related species, the sibling vole (Microtus levis Miller, 1908) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis (Linnaeus, 1761)), adjust their habitat use when facing either the competing species or simultaneously competition and predation risk. The species responded differently in their proportional use of two habitat types, a low cover (productive but riskier) and a high cover (safer but poorer). When alone, field voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability at low densities, but decreased its use with increasing density. Sibling voles, however, avoided the low-cover habitat in single-species populations. Under interspecific competition, the habitat-use patterns switched between species: sibling voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability, with decreasing use as densities increased. Sibling voles responded to predation risk by showing a stronger density-dependent decrease in the use of low-cover habitat. Field voles, initially using mostly high cover, did not change behaviour under risk of predation. Our results highlight the importance of considering both predation risk and interspecific competition when interpreting patterns of habitat selection among coexisting species.","[Koivisto, E.; Hoset, K.

Generally, within a host species, large hosts (i. e. older instars) are considered of higher quality for parasitoid development. Studies of interspecific competition between parasitoids have considered the effect of host instar on indirect competition but its effect on interference competition remains unknown. Here, we report the first results on whether the quality of host instars might dictate the outcome of interference competition between sympatric parasitoids of the genus Aphytis (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) when they attack low-quality (second) and high-quality (third) instars of their common host Aonidiella aurantii (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). Oviposition behaviour (host acceptance and clutch size) in low-and high-quality host instars was similar for both Aphytis species in the absence of competition. When they found heterospecific parasitized hosts of high quality, Aphytis melinus laid more eggs and accepted significantly more hosts than Aphytis chrysomphali, whereas there were no significant differences in the low-quality instar. This result suggests that interference competition is mediated by host quality. However, the progeny proportion of both parasitoids in multiparasitized hosts (outcome of competition) was independent of host quality and A. melinus always emerged at higher rates. Therefore, the result of interference competition between these sympatric parasitoids was not affected by host quality and this competition will contribute to the displacement of the native A. chrysomphali by the introduced A. melinus, which has been observed in some areas of the Mediterranean basin.

We investigated interspecific competition between the Endangered tiger and two sympatric carnivore species (Near-Threatened leopard and Endangered dhole) in Malaysia. We used a spatially-explicit camera trapping method to sample the three carnivore species in order to assess their: relative abundance; spatial co-occurrence; and, temporal overlap. Our focal landscape consists of two adjacent study areas that have different forest management regimes: 1) Royal Belum State Park (RBSP) which has relatively higher levels of enforcement resulting in high tiger and prey densities, and 2) Temengor Forest Reserve (TFR) which has no enforcement resulting in low tiger and prey densities. Our analyses found inter specific competition in the form of fine-scale spatial avoidance of tiger by leopard in RBSP, but not in TFR. Thus, leopard was less likely to occur in forest patches with greater tiger presence in RBSP. Dhole was not detected in RBSP, and showed no fine-scale spatial avoidance of tiger on TRF. It was unclear if absence of dhole in RBSP was due to the high tiger density, or another factor such as disease. Regardless, our results indicate dhole can persist in human-degraded forest landscapes. Neither leopards nor dholes showed any major temporal avoidance of tigers on either site. Our findings of fine-scale spatial avoidance by leopard towards tiger and possible exclusion of dhole by tiger in areas of high tiger density were similar to that found in other areas of Asia. Our study demonstrates that degraded forest can be important for threatened carnivores. It also provides a reminder that efforts to recover tiger populations, a conservation priority, may require flanking measures to secure meso-predator populations, especially those forced into edge environments where they come into greater contact with people.

It has recently spread into western regions and projected climate change scenarios suggest continued expansion to the west and north. Aedes albopictus has had major impacts on, and been impacted by, a diverse array of resident mosquito species. Laying eggs at the edges of small, water-holding containers, hatched larvae develop within these containers feeding on detritus-based resources. Under limited resource conditions, Ae. albopictus has been shown to be a superior competitor to essentially all native and resident species in the United States. Adult males also mate interspecifically with at least one resident species with significant negative impacts on reproductive output for susceptible females. Despite these strong interference effects on sympatric species, competitor outcomes have been highly variable, ranging from outright local exclusion by Ae. albopictus, to apparent exclusion of Ae. albopictus in the presence of the same species. Context-dependent mechanisms that alter the relative strengths of inter-and intraspecific competition, as well as rapid evolution of satyrization-resistant females, may help explain these patterns of variable coexistence. Although there is a large body of research on interspecific interactions of Ae. albopictus in the United States, there remain substantial gaps in our understanding of the most important species interactions. Addressing these gaps is important in predicting the future distribution of this species and understanding consequences for resident species, including humans, that interact with this highly invasive mosquito.","[Fader, Joseph E.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, 450 Res Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Fader, JE (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, 450 Res Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",joseph.fader@duke.edu,,,,,,90,8,8,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2585,1938-2928,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

We evaluated monthly relationships between temperature and altitude used by a large mountain-dwelling herbivore, the Himalayan tahr Hemitragus jemlahicus, and its main predator, the snow leopard Panthera uncia, in an area of central Himalaya for five consecutive years (2006-2010). In contrast to expectations, there was no significant direct relationship between altitude of tahr sightings and temperature. The mean altitude of tahr sightings decreased by c. 200 m throughout our study. As expected, snow leopard movements tracked those of tahr, although the core area of the snow leopard did not move downwards. Tahr remained the staple of the snow leopard diet: we suggest that the former did not move upwards in reaction to higher temperature to avoid encounters with the latter. Avoidance of competition with the larger common leopard Panthera pardus at lower altitudes could explain why snow leopards did not shift their core area downwards. Apparently, interspecific interactions (predation; competition) influenced movements of Himalayan tahr and snow leopards more than climatic variations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a long-term laboratory mesocosm experiment, we quantified competition strength and the plasticity of foraging traits in a guild of generalist predators of arthropods with a range of foraging modalities. Each mesocosm contained eight passively foraging pink sundews, and we employed an experimental design where treatments were the presence or absence of a sit-and-wait foraging spider and actively foraging toad crossed with five levels of prey abundance. We hypothesized that actively foraging toads would outcompete the other species at low prey abundance, but that spiders and sundews would exhibit plasticity in foraging traits to compensate for strong competition when prey were limited. Results generally supported our hypotheses. Toads had a greater effect on sundews at low prey abundances, and toad presence caused spiders to locate webs higher above the ground. Additionally, the closer large spider webs were to the ground, the greater the trichome densities produced by sundews. Also, spider webs were larger with than without toads and as sundew numbers increased, and these effects were more prominent as resources became limited. Finally, spiders negatively affected toad growth only at low prey abundance. These findings highlight the long-term importance of foraging modality and plasticity of foraging traits in determining the strength of competition within and across taxonomic kingdoms. Future research should assess whether plasticity in foraging traits helps to maintain coexistence within this guild and whether foraging modality can be used as a trait to reliably predict the strength of competitive interactions.","[Jennings, David E.; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, 4202 East Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Krupa, James J.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Jennings, DE (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, 4112 Plant Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",david.e.jennings@gmail.com,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Jennings, David/0000-0001-7179-3069",American Arachnological Society Grant; Fern Garden Club Scholarship; Rutlish Foundation Grant; Sigma Xi GIAR; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM109499] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Our research was supported by an American Arachnological Society Grant, Fern Garden Club Scholarship, Rutlish Foundation Grant and Sigma Xi GIAR to DEJ.

Such characteristics promote distinct ecological conditions that support the existence of unique communities. In this work, we studied seven caves in the Presidente Olegario municipality, Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil, to determine their richness of predatory species, to understand how they are spatially distributed in the cave and whether their distribution is influenced by competition and/or predation. We carried out five surveys of the caves, with each cave divided into sampling plots. We collected fauna within the plots using a manual search method. The collected animals were fixed in 70% ethanol for later identification. We performed a canonical correspondence analysis to verify the spatial distribution and substrate preference of each species, and selected five species for agonistic interaction testing in the laboratory. We found a great richness of predators in the caves, with 79 species distributed among 22 families of spiders, five families of pseudoscorpions, three families of chilopods, two families of opilionids and one family each of scorpions and heteroptera. Spiders were the most species diverse and abundant of all arthropods we found in the caves. We recorded evidence of competition among some pairs of species but, in general, the spatial distribution of the predatory community in the interior of the caves seems to be unrelated to interspecies competition. The laboratory pairings support our field observations that most species merely share space, rather than exhibiting aggressive or predatory behaviour.","[Resende, L. P. A.; Bichuette, M.

Conspecific animals routinely compete for resources and regularly engage in aggressive signalling exchanges. Heterospecific animals may also compete for resources, and therefore animals may direct their aggression towards heterospecific as well as conspecific rivals. In both cases, animals should benefit by discriminating between nonthreatening individuals versus threatening conspecific and heterospecific competitors. Experience may play an important role in competitor discrimination; animals living in sympatry with heterospecific competitors may gain experience with heterospecific rivals, but animals living in allopatry will not. We investigated whether experience influences species discrimination between two congeneric Neotropical wrens (rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, and banded wrens, Thryophilus pleurostictus) that live in sympatry in some parts of their range and in allopatry in other parts of their range. We simulated the presence of male conspecific, congeneric and control intruders in the territories of rufous-and-white wrens at sites where they are sympatric or allopatric with banded wrens. If species discrimination is influenced by experience, we predicted that wrens would always respond strongly to conspecific songs, but that in sympatry, they would respond more strongly to the congeneric competitor than to the control songs. Conversely, we predicted that, in allopatry, wrens would show similarly low responses to congener and control songs. In contrast to our predictions, we found that rufous-and-white wrens discriminated between conspecific and heterospecific animals, but that this response did not differ in sympatry or allopatry, suggesting that experience with heterospecific competitors does not influence interspecific discrimination in this species. By contrasting the responses of sympatric and allopatric populations, we can better understand the effect of experience on interspecific discrimination and gain insight into the evolution of species discrimination signals.

Belowground predators feeding on microbial grazers like Collembola could decelerate nutrient mineralization by reducing microbial turnover in the soil, which in turn could negatively influence plant growth. However, empirical evidences for the ecological significance of belowground predators on nutrient cycling and plant communities are scarce. Here, we manipulated predator density (Hypoaspis aculeifer: predatory mite) with equal densities of three Collembola species as a prey in four functionally dissimilar plant communities in experimental microcosms: grass monoculture (Poa pratensis), herb monoculture (Rumex acetosa), legume monoculture (Trifolium pratense), and all three species as a mixed plant community. Density manipulation of predators allowed us to test for density-mediated effects of belowground predators on Collembola and lower trophic groups. We hypothesized that predator density will reduce Collembola population causing a decrease in nutrient mineralization and hence detrimentally affect plant growth. First, we found a density-dependent population change in predators, that is, an increase in low-density treatments, but a decrease in high-density treatments. Second, prey suppression was lower at high predator density, which caused a shift in the soil microbial community by increasing the fungal: bacterial biomass ratio, and an increase of nitrification rates, particularly in legume monocultures. Despite the increase in nutrient mineralization, legume monocultures performed worse at high predator density. Further, individual grass shoot biomass decreased in monocultures, while it increased in mixed plant communities with increasing predator density, which coincided with elevated soil N uptake by grasses. As a consequence, high predator density significantly increased plant complementarity effects indicating a decrease in interspecific plant competition. These results highlight that belowground predators can relax interspecific plant competition by increasing nutrient mineralization through their density-dependent cascading effects on detritivore and soil microbial communities.","[Thakur, Madhav Prakash; Herrmann, Martina; Steinauer, Katja; Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Thakur, Madhav Prakash; Steinauer, Katja; Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Herrmann, Martina; Rennoch, Saskia] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Thakur, MP (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",madhav.thakur@idiv.de,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Cesarz, Simone/A-8468-2012; Cesarz, Simone/AAA-8702-2020; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019","Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Thakur, Madhav/0000-0001-9426-1313",German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ei 862/2],German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG; Ei 862/2).,,85,14,15,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Nevertheless, the contribution of intraspecific and interspecific interactions to chemical effects on populations is often overlooked. In the present study, Daphnia magna populations were initiated with different levels of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, and predation and exposed to pyrene pulses. Generalized linear models were used to test which of these factors significantly explained population size and structure at different time points. Pyrene had a negative effect on total population densities, with effects being more pronounced on smaller D. magna individuals. Among all species interactions tested, predation had the largest negative effect on population densities. Predation and high initial intraspecific competition were shown to interact antagonistically with pyrene exposure. This was attributed to differences in population structure before pyrene exposure and pyrene-induced reductions in predation pressure by Chaoborus sp. larvae. The present study provides empirical evidence that species interactions within and between populations can alter the response of aquatic populations to chemical exposure. Therefore, such interactions are important factors to be considered in ecological risk assessments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:1751-1759. (c) 2015 SETAC","[Viaene, Karel P.

To determine whether intraguild predation and competition for prey may be partially responsible for the decline, we paired first-instar larvae of two populations of C. novemnotata (eastern and western) with first-instar C. septempunctata at low or high aphid densities. Survival of both C. novemnotata populations was significantly lower when larvae were paired with C. septempunctata, and western C. novemnotata exhibited significantly lower survival compared with the eastern population. This relationship depended on aphid density with the greatest survival of both C. novemnotata populations occurring at the high aphid density. Both male and female C. novemnotata weighed less on the day of eclosion when paired with C. septempunctata as compared with pairings with conspecifics. In a second test, C. septempunctata and C. novemnotata instars were varied at the start of the trial and C. novemnotata survival to adulthood in the presence of C. septempunctata was dependent of the instar of C. novemnotata used to initiate the experiment. C. novemnotata exhibited higher rates of survival and weighed significantly more on the day of eclosion when C. novemnotata was older than its C. septempunctata partner. These results suggest that interspecific competition including intraguild predation by C. septempunctata may contribute to C. novemnotata population declines, but that the intensity of this impact may vary across C. novemnotata populations.","[Turnipseed, Rakim K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Turnipseed, Rakim K.; Ugine, Todd A.; Losey, John E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Turnipseed, RK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rturnipseed@berkeley.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank the Lost Lady Project participants for helping us to collect rare species to start our colonies, and the National Science Foundation for project and salary support.

Interspecific competition and facilitation between predators may either enhance or dampen trophic cascades, ultimately influencing total predator effects on communities and biogeochemical cycling of ecosystems. However, previous studies have only investigated the effects of a single predator species on CO2 flux of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we measured and compared the individual and joint effects of predatory damselfly larvae and diving beetles on total prey biomass, leaf litter processing, and dissolved CO2 concentrations of experimental bromeliad ecosystems. Damselfly larvae created strong trophic cascades that reduced CO2 concentrations by 46 % relative to no-predator treatments. Conversely, the effects of diving beetles on prey biomass, leaf litter processing, and dissolved CO2 were not statistically different to no-predator treatments. Relative to multiplicative null models, the presence of damselfly larvae and diving beetles together resulted in antagonistic relations that eliminated trophic cascades and top-down influences on CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, we showed that the antagonistic interactions between predators occurred due to a tactile response that culminated in competitive displacement of damselfly larvae. Our results demonstrate that predator identity and predator-predator interactions can influence CO2 concentrations of an aquatic ecosystem. We suggest that predator effects on CO2 fluxes may depend on the particular predator species removed or added to the ecosystem and their interactions with other predators.","[Atwood, Trisha B.; Richardson, John S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & C onservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4069, Australia; [Hammill, Edd; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hammill, Edd; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hammill, Edd] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia","Atwood, TB (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & C onservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",tatwood16@gmail.com,"Richardson, John/G-1513-2012","Richardson, John/0000-0001-8135-7447",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada) grants,"We would like to thank J.

The relationships between growth rate, survival, and temperature may thus be important for predicting biological responses to climate change. Although it is well known that growth rates and survival are affected by competition and predation in addition to temperature, the combined effect of these factors on growth rates, survival, and size structure has rarely been investigated simultaneously in the same ecological system. To address this question, we conducted experiments on the larvae of two species of damselflies and determined the temperature dependence of growth rate, survival, and cohort size structure under three scenarios of increasing ecological complexity: no competition, intraspecific competition, and interspecific competition. In one species, the relationship between growth rate and temperature became steeper in the presence of competitors, whereas that of survival remained unchanged. In the other species, the relationship between growth rate and temperature was unaffected by competitive interactions, but survival was greatly reduced at high temperatures in the presence of interspecific competitors. The combined effect of competitive interactions and temperature on cohort size structure differed from the effects of these factors in isolation. Together, these findings suggest that it will be challenging to scale up information from single-species laboratory studies to the population and community level.","[Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor; Johansson, Frank] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Johansson, Frank] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Nilsson-Ortman, V (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",viktor.j.nilsson@gmail.com,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",FWOFWO; KULeuven research fundKU Leuven; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas,"Financial support to R.

We examined whether intraspecific density-dependence altered IG predator traits, as well as the subsequent interspecific effects among its intraguild prey within a larval salamander guild. Four densities of ringed salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum), the IG predator, were combined with the presence/absence of spotted salamanders (A. maculatum), the IG prey, within experimental mesocosms. We modeled the effects of A. annulatum density on both conspecific and heterospecific responses that would be indicative of density-dependent competition and predation, respectively. We also modeled the reciprocal interspecific effects of A. maculatum on A. annulatum. We found that increasing intraspecific density negatively affected morphological traits but not survival of A. annulatum. No interspecific effects of A. maculatum on A. annulatum were observed. Alternatively, traits of A. maculatum showed nonlinear relationships with increasing A. annulatum density. Thinning effects of A. annulatum on A. maculatum were observed, as survival was positively and size negatively related for A. maculatum with IG predator density. The temporal overlap of the IG predator and prey also increased nonlinearly with IG predator density, intensifying the potential encounter rate of the two species. Overall, this study shows that density-dependent processes in IG predators can significantly affect traits of both themselves, as well as IG prey, which could ultimately change whether competition or predation occurs between the two groups.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 110 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",tlarkf@mail.missouri.edu,,"Semlitsch, Raymond/0000-0002-7999-5762",Department of Defense Strategic Environment Research and Development Program [RC-2155],"We would like to thank the Semlitsch lab for their input on study design, D.

As the number and impact of biological invasions increase, it has become increasingly important to determine whether competitive differences exist between native and exotic insects. We conducted a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that native/exotic status affects the outcome of herbivore competition. Specifically, we used data from 160 published studies to assess plant-mediated competition in phytophagous insects. For each pair of competing herbivores, we determined the native range and coevolutionary history of each herbivore and host plant. Plant-mediated competition occurred frequently, but neither native nor exotic insects were consistently better competitors. Spatial separation reduced competition in native insects but showed little effect on exotics. Temporal separation negatively impacted native insects but did not affect competition in exotics. Insects that coevolved with their host plant were more affected by interspecific competition than herbivores that lacked a coevolutionary history. Insects that have not coevolved with their host plant may be at a competitive advantage if they overcome plant defenses. As native/exotic status does not consistently predict outcomes of competitive interactions, plant-insect coevolutionary history should be considered in studies of competition.","[Radville, Laura] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Intercoll Grad Degree Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Gonda-King, Liahna; Gomez, Sara; Preisser, Evan L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Gomez, Sara] Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Kaplan, Ian] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Radville, L (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Intercoll Grad Degree Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",lur150@psu.edu,,,Department of Ecosystem Science and Management at Pennsylvania State University,"L.

Such movement is often influenced by biotic interactions, but the abiotic environment can also be important, affecting the strength of species' interactions and even changing their outcome. Here, we focused on two biotic interactions and examined their effect on movement of the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator: intraspecific interactions (specifically, the effect of conspecific density) and interspecific interactions with a competitor-predator, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta (=Nassarius obsoletus). We assessed the magnitude of the temporal variation and examined the influence of pertinent abiotic variables (lunar cycle, presence of tide pools). Despite substantial temporal variation in movement levels, density of conspecifics did not influence emigration or immigration rates of C. volutator. Mud snails negatively affected immigration of C. volutator, and this was consistent across all lunar phases. However, mud snails influenced mortality and emigration of C. volutator in a contrasting way relative to lunar phases; sometimes amphipods evaded snails and survived, but at other times did not emigrate and were killed. The presence of tide pools did not change the nature or strength of the snail-amphipod interaction. Our results further clarify the complex interactions between C. volutator and I. obsoleta and suggest that resources on the mudflat are sufficient to sustain high densities of amphipods in a density-independent manner. Further, they highlight the importance of considering multiple environmental variables when examining interspecific interactions.","[Drolet, David; Hamilton, Diana J.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada; [Drolet, David; Coffin, Michael R.

The males of two species of Japanese stag beetles, Lucanus maculifemoratus and Prosopocoilus inclinatus, have intrasexually selected large mandibles. Because these two species are sympatric and feed on the same food, winning interspecific competitions might have considerable effects on male fitness with regard to access to limited resources. If the outcome of interspecific competitions between these two species of beetles is determined by body size, the advantage would lie with the larger species, L. maculifemoratus. To test this prediction, we examined the behaviour and outcome of contests between these two species in detail. Contrary to our expectations, the larger size of the male L. maculifemoratus did not provide a competitive advantage against P inclinatus. The higher winning rate of P. inclinatus was attributable to differences in mandible use: male L. maculifemoratus nipped the opponent's dorsal side and threw it, whereas male P. inclinatus nipped both ventral and dorsal sides. The proximate cause of this difference was the interspecies difference in tactile stimulation to the mandible: a tactile stimulus on the underside of the mandible resulting in mandible-nipping behaviour was observed in both species, whereas a tactile stimulus to the upper side of the mandible resulting in mandible-nipping behaviour was observed only in P. inclinatus. The present study provides an important counter-example to the general belief that larger species have an advantage in interspecific contests involving physical combat.","[Hongo, Yoshihito; Okamoto, Kohei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Hongo, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",yoshihon@ethol.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,Grant for the Global COE Program A06,"We thank Dr. A.

We applied the CRE to three carnivore species, linking interspecific competition with predator control efforts. We predicted the population response of European badger, the red fox and the pine marten to this wildlife management tool by means of numerical simulations. The theoretical responses differed depending on the intrinsic rate of growth (r), although modulated by the competition coefficients. The red fox, showing the highest r value, can increase its populations despite predator control efforts if control intensity is moderate. Populations of the other two species, however, decreased with control efforts, even reaching extinction. Three additional theoretical predictions were obtained. The conclusions from the simulations were: 1) predator control can play a role in altering the carnivore communities; 2) red fox numbers can increase due to control; and 3) predator control programs should evaluate the potential of unintended effects on ecosystems.","[Lozano, J.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Lozano, J.; Casanovas, J.

However, long-term analyses of size-dependent interactions within simpler network modules, for instance, competitive guilds, are scant. Here, we model the assembly dynamics of the largest breeding seabird community in the Mediterranean basin during the last 30 years. This unique data set allowed us to test, through a natural experiment, whether body size drove the assembly and dynamics of an ecological guild growing from very low numbers after habitat protection. Although environmental stochasticity accounted for most of community variability, the population variance explained by interspecific interactions, albeit small, decreased sharply with increasing body size. Since we found a demographic gradient along a body size continuum, in which population density and stability increase with increasing body size, the numerical effects of interspecific interactions were proportionally higher on smaller species than on larger ones. Moreover, we found that the per capita interaction coefficients were larger the higher the size ratio among competing species, but only for the set of interactions in which the species exerting the effect was greater. This provides empirical evidence for long-term asymmetric interspecific competition, which ultimately prompted the local extinction of two small species during the study period. During the assembly process stochastic predation by generalist carnivores further triggered community reorganizations and global decays in population synchrony, which disrupted the pattern of interspecific interactions. These results suggest that the major patterns detected in complex food webs can hold as well for simpler sub-modules of these networks involving non-trophic interactions, and highlight the shifting ecological processes impacting on assembling vs. asymptotic communities.","[Almaraz, Pablo] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante 33012, Spain; [Almaraz, Pablo] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Stable Isotope Biogeochem Lab, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [Almaraz, Pablo] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Oro, Daniel] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Populat Ecol Grp, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain","Almaraz, P (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Carretera Beniel,Km 3-2, Alicante 33012, Spain.",palmaraz@gmail.com,"Almaraz, Pablo/A-3683-2014; Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012","Almaraz, Pablo/0000-0003-1416-2695; Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007",Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya; ICONA (Spanish Ministry of the Environment); Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2009-08298],"We are grateful to all the people participating in the seabird monitoring at the Ebro Delta over the years, particularly to Albert Martinez-Vilalta, Meritxell Genovart, Albert Bertolero, Julia Piccardo, Jose Manuel Igual, and Antoni Curco, who contributed to organizing and executing the censuses.

Predators typically reduce the effect of competition on growth and competitors provide alternative prey subjects, which may also alter predation. Here, we examine the independent and combined effects of competition and predation on the survival and growth of hatchling tadpoles of two widespread co-occurring Neotropical hylid frogs (Agalychnis callidryas and Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Using 400 L mesocosms, we used a 2 x 3 factorial substitutive design, which crossed tadpole species composition with the presence or absence of a free-roaming predator (Anax amazili dragonfly larva). Dragonflies were effective predators of both species, but had larger effects on A. callidryas survival. Both species had similar growth rates when alone, whereas A. callidryas grew 30 percent faster than D. ebraccatus when they co-occurred, suggesting interspecific rather than intraspecific competition had relatively stronger effects on D. ebraccatus growth, while the opposite was true for A. callidryas. Predator presence dramatically reduced growth rates of both species and erased this asymmetry. Results suggest that the effects of predator induction (i.e., nonconsumptive effects) on growth were larger than both consumptive and competitive effects. Our study demonstrates that predators have strong effects on both survival and growth of prey, highlighting the potential importance of predators in shaping prey populations and tropical aquatic food web interactions.","[Vonesh, James R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Gonzalez, Sergio C.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Touchon, Justin C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Vonesh, JR (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 W Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",jrvonesh@vcu.edu,"Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988",National Science Foundation (U.S.A.)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717220]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716923]; University of FloridaUniversity of Florida,"We thank the Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente de Panama for permission to conduct this research in Panama (Permiso No. SE/A-41-08) and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for use of their facilities and logistical support.

Only the first two hypotheses have been fairly well studied. To test the predator-removal hypothesis as a force determining IGP in avian predators, we performed a field experiment to simulate the presence of an IG predator (eagle owl Bubo bubo dummy) in the surrounding of the nests of four potential IG prey (black kite Milvus migrans, red kite Milvus milvus, booted eagle Aquila pennata and common buzzard Buteo buteo). To discard the possibility that an aggressive reaction towards the eagle owl was not related to the presence of the IG predator, we also presented a stuffed tawny owl Strix aluco, which is a potential competitor but cannot be considered an IG predator of the studied diurnal raptors considered in the experiment. While almost always ignoring the tawny owl, raptors chiefly showed an interspecific aggressive behaviour towards their IG predator. Our results seem to support the predator-removal hypothesis, as the IG prey may take advantage of the diurnal inactivity of the IG predator to remove it from their territory. However, the recorded behaviour may be also considered as a special variety of mobbing (i.e. a prey's counter-strategy against its predator), where the mobber is sufficiently powerful to escalate predator harassment into deliberate killing attempts. In their turn, eagle owls can respond with an IG predatory behaviour aimed at removing IG prey species which are highly aggressive mobbers.","[Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo] Univ Evora, LabOr Lab Ornithol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo] Univ Evora, Inst Mediterranean Agr & Environm Sci, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Lourenco, Rui; Penteriani, Vincenzo; del Mar Delgado, Maria] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Penteriani, Vincenzo] Univ Helsinki, Zool Museum, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [del Mar Delgado, Maria] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Marchi-Bartolozzi, Michela] Bourne Bridge Cottages, Little Abington, Cambridge CB21 6AN, England","Lourenco, R (corresponding author), Univ Evora, LabOr Lab Ornithol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",ruifazendalourenco@gmail.com,"Lourenco, Rui F/B-7148-2012; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo/A-7851-2011","Lourenco, Rui F/0000-0001-7694-0478; Delgado, Maria del Mar/0000-0002-3009-738X; Rabaca, Joao E./0000-0002-2196-3709","Consejeria de Medio Ambiente, Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [700/2005/M/00./]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [BD/27434/2006]; Ministry of Education and Science, C.S.I.C.

At small scales, intra-and interspecific competition for refugia from high flows and predation can affect the microdistribution of lotic organisms. The abiotic environment, such as water temperature, can have important impacts on lotic organism behavior, potentially influencing competitive and predator-prey dynamics. In the laboratory, we examined activity and refuge use of stonefly nymphs, Pteronarcys californica, in the presence and absence of conspecifics and signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) across three temperatures. We predicted that at high temperatures competitive dynamics would decrease in importance. Crayfish captured and consumed stoneflies in similar to 25% of trials indicating that crayfish are effective predators as well as competitors for refuge. Crayfish influenced stonefly activity and refuge use, and their effect varied with time of day. During the day, crayfish hid in refuge; in response, stoneflies reduced refuge use and increased activity. At night, crayfish decreased refuge use and increased crawling resulting in a sharp decline in stonefly activity. These behavioral responses to crayfish may impact P. californica fitness as increased day-time activity increases risk of detection by visual predators and decreased night-time activity might decrease encounters with food resources. In contrast to the strong impacts of crayfish, stonefly density and water temperature did not significantly affect stonefly or crayfish refuge use or behavior. Our results indicate that a large competitor and potential predator has strong impacts on the microdistribution and behavior of P. californica.","[Wooster, David E.; DeBano, Sandra J.; Madsen, Anne] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Hermiston Agr Res & Extens Ctr, Hermiston, OR 97838 USA","Wooster, DE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Hermiston Agr Res & Extens Ctr, Hermiston, OR 97838 USA.",david.wooster@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,42,2,2,2,33,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGS,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",1863-9135,,,FUND APPL LIMNOL,Fundam.

Each species relies primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Adelie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources.

One group of models predicts that if hosts are infected with more than one strain or species of parasite, then competition between the parasites will select for higher virulence. While this idea makes intuitive sense, empirical data to support it are rare and equivocal. We investigated the relationship between fitness and virulence during both inter- and intraspecific competition for a fungal parasite of insects, Metarhizium anisopliae. Contrary to theoretical expectations, competition favored parasite strains with either a lower or a higher virulence depending on the competitor: when in interspecific competition with an entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema feltiae, less virulent strains of the fungus were more successful, but when competing against conspecific fungi, more virulent strains were better competitors. We suggest that the nature of competition (direct via toxin production when competing against the nematode, indirect via exploitation of the host when competing against conspecific fungal strains) determines the relationship between virulence and competitive ability.","[Staves, Peter A.; Knell, Robert J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England","Staves, PA (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",P.A.Staves@qmul.ac.uk,,,Queen Mary and Westfield College,"This study was funded by a Queen Mary and Westfield College Studentship.

Fish were sampled monthly during the ice-free season, and diet composition and feeding strategy of the two species were compared by analyses of stomach contents. The dietary niches and feeding strategy of salmon parr and bullheads were highly similar both at the individual and population levels, with high within-phenotype contributions to niche width and pronounced generalisation observed during time periods with severe resource limitations. Our findings suggest that competitive coexistence with similar niches may be facilitated by a generalisation of niche width as predicted by optimal foraging theory, rather than the specialised niche width predicted by classic niche theory as a response to interspecific competition. Competitive coexistence may be particularly widespread in spatially and temporally dynamic habitats such as northern lotic systems, which thus may select for generalisation and convergence of ecological niches.","[Gabler, Heidi-Marie; Amundsen, Per-Arne] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Dept Aquat Biosci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Gabler, HM (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Dept Aquat Biosci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",Heidi.Marie.Gabler@fmtr.no; Per-Arne.Amundsen@uit.no,,"Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216",,,,53,32,33,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

We demonstrate a role for predation that is opposite to the conventional wisdom that predation promotes coexistence by reducing the intensity of competition. In the common situation where competitive coexistence involves intraspecific competition exceeding interspecific competition, predation can undermine coexistence by reducing the overall magnitude of competition, replacing competition with apparent competition'' in a way that does not lead to differential intraspecific and interspecific effects. We demonstrate this outcome in the case where coexistence occurs by the storage effect'' in a variable environment. The storage effect arises when the environment interacts with competition to create opportunities for species to increase from low density. Critical to the storage effect is positive covariance between the response of population growth to the environment and its response to competition, when a species is at high density. This outcome prevents species at high density from taking advantage of favorable environmental conditions. A species at low density has lower covariance and can take advantage of favorable environmental conditions, giving it an advantage over a high-density species, fostering its recovery from low density. Hence, species coexistence is promoted. Here we find that density-dependent predation lowers population densities, and so weakens competition, replacing competition with apparent competition, which does not covary with the environment. As a consequence, covariance between environment and competition is weakened, reducing the advantage to a species at low density. The species still strongly interact through the combination of competition and apparent competition, but the reduced low-density advantage reduces their ability to coexist. Although this result is demonstrated specifically for the storage effect with a focus on annual plant communities, the principles involved are general ones.","[Kuang, Jessica J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Math, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kuang, Jessica J.; Chesson, Peter] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Kuang, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Math, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jjkuang@u.arizona.edu,,,"GGAM block grant (UC Davis); UC Davis dissertation-year fellowship; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0542991, DEB-0717222]","We are grateful for comments on the manuscript by Michael Turelli, Larry Venable, the Chesson lab discussion group, and four anonymous reviewers.

Interactions between species in different trophic levels can mediate interspecific competition; e.g. predators are known to reduce competition between prey species by suppressing their population sizes. A parallel phenomenon may take place in host-parasite systems, with host defence mediating competition between parasite species. We experimentally investigated the impact of host defence (preening) on competitive interactions between two species of feather-feeding lice: 'wing' lice Columbicola columbae and 'body' lice Campanulotes compar. Both species are host-specific parasites that co-occur on rock pigeons Columba livia. We show that wing lice and body lice compete and that host defence mediates the magnitude of this competitive interaction. Competition is asymmetrical; wing louse populations are negatively impacted by body lice, but not vice versa. This competitive asymmetry is consistent with the fact that body lice predominate in microhabitats on the host's body that offer the most food and the most space. Our results indicate that host-defence-mediated competition can influence the structure of parasite communities and may play a part in the evolution of parasite diversity.","[Bush, Sarah E.; Malenke, Jael R.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Bush, SE (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",sbush@ku.edu,,"Bush, Sarah/0000-0002-2913-4876",,,,47,52,53,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Multiple regressions with data collected on 11 occasions on fixed back-reef and fore-reef sites suggested that the densities of the congener, other crevice-dwellers, and predators did not significantly affect the density of P. argus in either reef zone, or of P. guttatus on the back-reef, where coexistence of both lobster species was greatest. In contrast, there was a significant negative relationship between predators and the density of P. guttatus on the fore-reef, where this species was dominant. Congeneric cohabitation in dens was less than expected by chance, but this pattern may reflect a differential use of shelter resources rather than interspecific competition. P. guttatus was more prevalent in dens over the middle and upper third of the reef profile, and P. argus over the lower and middle third of the reef profile. Whether individuals cohabited with conspecifics, congeners, or resided solitarily, P. guttatus was more prevalent at the walls and/or ceiling and P. argus on the floor of dens. This differential use of shelter resources may be related to the differential vulnerability to predators, which may have promoted local coexistence of these congeners in reef habitats.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Cancun 77500, Mexico","Lozano-Alvarez, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, PO Box 1152, Cancun 77500, Mexico.",elozano@mar.icmyl.unam.mx,"Fourzan, Patricia Briones/AAD-4736-2020","Briones-Fourzan, Patricia/0000-0003-4096-1415",,,,69,19,19,2,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,JUN,2007,26,2,,,,,361,373,,10.1007/s00338-007-0207-0,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,179RF,WOS:000247307100019,,,,,2021-09-21,

The field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the sibling vole (M. rossiaemeridionalis) are sympatric close relatives which compete for similar resources. Previous non-experimental studies suggest that the smaller sibling vole is a superior competitor, yet more vulnerable to predation than the larger field vole. We studied the effects of coexistence on population densities, reproductive parameters, and survival in these two species by means of experimentation in large, predator-free outdoor enclosures. While populations of both species reached higher densities in the absence of the other, field voles appeared to suffer more from interspecific competition than sibling voles. The proportion of young individuals in the population was higher in the sibling vole than in the field vole at the end of the experiment. The presence of a coexisting species reduced the survival of field voles. Sibling voles, on the other hand, appeared to suffer more from intraspecific competition than interspecific competition. On a population level, the sibling vole seems to be a superior competitor in the absence of predators due to better survival and possibly a higher reproductive capacity. However, predation probably has a profound influence on the interspecific dynamics of these two species indicating that in natural surroundings apparent competition (i.e. competition via shared predators) is stronger than direct competition.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Koivisto, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",elanko@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509",,,,46,10,11,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2007,116,1,,,,,156,162,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15254.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,125AJ,WOS:000243413600015,,,,,2021-09-21,

In particular, in those cases where a competitive hierarchy exists among prey species, the presence of certain keystone predators can result in enhanced diversity in the prey community. However, little is known regarding the influence of keystone predator presence on invaded prey communities. Given the widespread occurrence of invasive species and substantial concern regarding their ecological impacts, studies on this topic are needed. In this study I used naturalistic replications of an experimental tadpole assemblage to assess the influence of predatory eastern newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, on the outcome of interspecific competition among native and nonindigenous tadpoles.

However, the theoretical background of this inference is insufficient. Hence. we constructed a simple theoretical model of interspecific territoriality assuming that interspecific territorial defence is the optimal behaviour. We discuss the factors promoting interspecific territoriality and the relationship between interspecific territoriality and ecological interactions. The model predicts that: (1) a territory holder preferentially excludes intruders of species with high 'exclusion efficiency's (2) the decision by the territory holder to exclude a certain species or not does not depend on the probability of finding intruders of the species or on the number of intrusions by the species, and (3) interspecific territoriality does not always reflect the intensity of ecological interactions between species. These results indicate that the observation of interspecific territoriality does not necessarily indicate the intensity of ecological interactions. In addition, if territory holders defend their territories as predicted by the present optimal model, the co-existence of competing species is promoted.","Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Biol Inst, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol,Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan","Mikami, OK (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Higashi Ku, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",omikascb@mbox.nc.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Kawata, Masakado/E-3962-2012","Kawata, Masakado/0000-0001-8716-5438",,,,29,18,21,1,15,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

What is known of the diet breadth, habitat preferences, and thermal thresholds for development of these two species indicates considerable niche overlap. The larger H. axyridis has many intrinsic advantages over C. sanguinea, including higher fecundity and fertility, and a lower rate of larval cannibalism. In laboratory tests, adults and larvae of H. axyridis consumed eggs of C. sanguinea more readily than vice versa. All H. axyridis adults provided with either a conspecific or a heterospecific second-instar larva killed and ate it, whereas only 15% of C. sanguinea adults consumed a second-instar larva of H. axyridis over a 24-h period. Larvae of H. axyridis were more aggressive against larvae of C. sanguinea in laboratory tests than vice versa; even when H. axyridis larvae were paired with a C. sanguinea larva 2d older and two to three times as large,they won 67% of contests. In choice tests, larvae of both species preferred to feed on dead C. sanguinea larvae than on dead H. axyridis larvae. Larvae of H. axyridis were capable of completing development exclusively as intraguild predators on C. sanguinea larvae, whereas the reverse was not true. The data suggest that H. axyridis is a highly evolved interspecific competitor, whereas C. sanguinea is adapted more to intraspecific competition and has few defenses against H. axyridis. Competitive displacement of C. sanguinea by H. axyridis appears to be in progress in the citrus ecosystem in Florida.","Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA","Michaud, JP (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Inst Food & Agr Sci, 700 Expt Stn Rd, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",jpmi@lal.ufl.edu,,,,,,45,181,192,2,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

The arctic fox in mainland Europe is endangered, while the red fox is increasing its range in the north. It has been suggested that the southern distribution limit of the arctic fox is determined by interspecific competition with the red fox. This has been criticised, on the basis that the species co-exist on a regional scale. However, if the larger red fox is superior and interspecific competition important, the arctic fox should avoid close contact, especially during the breeding season. Consequently, the distribution of breeding dens for the two species would be segregated on a much smaller spatial and temporal scale, in areas where they are sympatric. We tested this hypothesis by analysing den use of reproducing arctic and red foxes over 9 years in Sweden. High quality dens were inhabited by reproducing arctic foxes more often when no red foxes bred in the vicinity. Furthermore, in two out of three cases when arctic foxes did reproduce near red foxes, juveniles were killed by red foxes. We also found that breeding arctic foxes occupied dens at higher altitudes than red foxes did. in a large-scale field experiment, red foxes were removed, but the results were not conclusive. However, we conclude that on the scale of individual territories, arctic foxes avoid areas with red foxes. Through interspecific interference competition, the red fox might thus be excluding the arctic fox from breeding in low altitude habitat, which is most important in years when food abundance is limited and competition is most fierce. With high altitude refuges being less suitable, even small-scale behavioural effects could scale up to significant effects at the population level.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Tannerfeldt, M (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",tanner@zoologi.su.se,"Angerbjorn, Anders/AAX-3670-2021; Angerbjorn, Anders/A-5982-2013; Elmhagen, Bodil/M-4444-2014","Angerbjorn, Anders/0000-0001-5535-9086; Elmhagen, Bodil/0000-0001-5496-4727",,,,52,141,144,0,185,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2002,132,2,,,,,213,220,,10.1007/s00442-002-0967-8,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,580PL,WOS:000177242900008,28547354,,,,2021-09-21,

We studied the consequences of combined versus single release of two predaceous mite species (Phytoseiidae), with differing degrees of diet specialization, on their population dynamics and the suppression of the carmine spider mite, Tetranychus cinnabarinus Boisduval (Tetranychidae), on greenhouse-grown gerbera, Population growth of the specialist predator Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot was greater and population decline steeper when released in combination with the generalist Neoseiulus californicus McGregor than when released alone. In contrast, the N. californicus population grew and declined more gradually when released in combination with P. persimilis, compared to the single species release. The differential impact on each other's population dynamics can be primarily attributed to contrasting properties in competition, IGP, and cannibalism. At the same overall predator density and as long as prey was abundant, the specialist P. persimilis was more strongly affected by intraspecific competition than by interspecific competition with the generalist N. californicus. In contrast, interspecific competition with P. persimilis had a greater impact on N. californicus than intraspecific competition, After prey depletion, the generalist predator N. californicus was more likely to engage in IGP than was the specialist predator P. persimilis. Overall, the study demonstrates that prey specificity has significance for the quality and intensity of predator-predator interactions and indicates potential implications for biological control of spider mites. All predator releases (i.e., either species alone and both species in combination) resulted in reduction of the spider mite population to zero density. Individual release of the specialist P. persimilis led to the most rapid spider mite suppression. Nonetheless, in perennial greenhouse-grown crops P. persimilis and N. californicus could have complementary effects and a combination of the two predators could enhance long-term biological control of spider mites. The potential risks and benefits associated with the release of both species are discussed.

These species were chosen based on their high abundance and overlapping diets. Juvenile mosquitofish and sailfin mollies, at a range of densities matching field estimates, were maintained in the presence of adult mosquitofish, sailfin mollies, and bluefin killifish to test for effects of competition and predation on juvenile survival and growth. The mesocosms held 1,200 1 of water and all conditions were set to simulate those in Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (ENP), USA. We placed floating mars of periphyton and bladderwort in each tank in standard volumes that matched field values to provide cover and to introduce invertebrate prey. Of 15 possible intra- and interspecific age-structured interactions, we found 7 to be present at the densities of these fish found in Shark River Slough marshes. Predation by adult mosquitofish on juvenile fish, including conspecifics, was the strongest effect observed. We also observed growth limitation in mosquitofish and sailfin molly juveniles from intra- and interspecific competition. When maintained at high densities, juvenile mosquitofish changed their diets to include more cladocerans and fewer chironomid larvae relative to low densities. We estimated size-specific gape limitation by adult mosquitofish when consuming juvenile mosquitofish and sailfin mollies. At high field densities, intraspecific competition might prolong the time period when juveniles are vulnerable to predation by adult mosquitofish. These results suggest that path analysis, or other techniques used to document food-web interactions, must include age-specific roles of these fishes.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; USGS Biol Resources Div, Everglades Nalt Pk Field Stn, Homestead, FL 33034 USA","Taylor, RC (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, POB 42451, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",,"Trexler, Joel C/I-5265-2012",,,,,47,38,40,1,30,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2001,127,1,,,,,143,152,,10.1007/s004420000575,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,413UA,WOS:000167629200016,28547165,,,,2021-09-21,

We compared reproduction and body size of the two aphid species when they were caged on pecan leaves as single or mixed species, and when green lacewing larvae (Chrysoperla comanche or Chrysopa nigricornis) were present or absent. The experiment was repeated two times on mature compound leaves in the held in the autumn of 1997 and summer of 1998 and once in a greenhouse, on young seedlings with simple leaves. Our results suggest that interspecific competition was variable and asymmetric; in both the Summer 98 experiment and the greenhouse experiment, reproduction of M. crynaefoliae was significantly reduced in the mixed species treatments relative to the single species treatment, while M. caryella reproduction was significantly reduced only in the Summer 98 experiment. No evidence of an effect of competition on reproduction was found in the Autumn 97 experiment. M. caryella body size was reduced in one of the mixed species treatments in the Autumn 97 experiment. Body size of both aphid species was reduced in the mixed species treatments of the greenhouse experiment. The introduction of green lacewing larvae reduced the reproduction of aphids in two of the three experiments in comparison to controls. However, a significant interaction between aphid and predator treatment (M. caryella in the greenhouse experiment) was found in only one experiment. Variation in the outcome of competition was more likely to be due to aspects of plant quality, including leaf age and previous aphid feeding.","Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Petersen, MK (corresponding author), Dept Ecol, Zool Sect, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",,"Hunter, Martha/AAF-5288-2020; Hunter, Martha/B-7307-2012","Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X; Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X",,,,50,14,14,0,11,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2001,92,1,,,,,107,118,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920113.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,403NV,WOS:000167050100013,,,,,2021-09-21,

We hypothesized that the largest and behaviorally dominant species, the coyote, would exploit a wider range of resources (i.e., a higher number of habitat and/or food types) and, consequently, would occur in higher density than the other two carnivores. We evaluated our hypotheses by quantifying their diets, food overlap, habitat-specific abundances, as well as their overall relative abundance at the three study sites. We identified behavioral dominance of coyotes over foxes and bobcats in Santa Monica because 7 of 12 recorded gray fox deaths and 2 of 5 recorded bobcat deaths were due to coyote predation, and no coyotes died as a result of their interactions with bobcats or foxes. Coyotes and bobcats were present in a variety of habitats types (8 out of 9), including both open and brushy habitats, whereas gray foxes were chiefly restricted to brushy habitats. There was a negative relationship between the abundances of coyotes and gray foxes (P=0.020) across habitats, suggesting that foxes avoided habitats of high coyote predation risk. Coyote abundance was low in NP, high in CP, and intermediate in SP. Bobcat abundance changed little across study sites, and gray foxes were very abundant in NP, absent in CP, and scarce in SP; this suggests a negative relationship between coyote and fox abundances across study sites, as well. Bobcats were solely carnivorous, relying on small mammals (lagomorphs and rodents) throughout the year and at all three sites. Coyotes and gray foxes also relied on small mammals year-round at all sites, though they also ate significant amounts of fruit. Though there were strong overall interspecific differences in food habits of carnivores (P<0.0001), average seasonal food overlaps were high due to the importance of small mammals in all carnivore diets [bobcat-gray fox: 0.79+/-0.09 (SD), n=4; bobcat-coyote: 0.69+/-0.16, n=6; coyote-gray fox: 0.52+/-0.05, n=4]. As hypothesized, coyotes used more food types and more habitat types than did bobcats and gray foxes and, overall, coyotes were the most abundant of the three species and ranged more widely than did gray foxes. We propose that coyotes limit the number and distribution of gray foxes in Santa Monica Mountains, and that those two carnivores exemplified a case in which the relationship between their body size and local abundance is governed by competitive dominance of the largest species rather than by energetic equivalences. However, in the case of the intermediate-sized bobcat no such a pattern emerged, likely due to rarity or inconsistency of agonistic interactions and/or behavioral avoidance of encounters by subordinate species.","US Natl Pk Serv, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Nat Resource Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Fedriani, JM (corresponding author), CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Avda Maria Luisa S-N, Seville 41013, Spain.",,"Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018","Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621",,,,74,247,258,1,186,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2000,125,2,,,,,258,270,,10.1007/s004420000448,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,370EJ,WOS:000165110200012,24595837,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

To create predictive models of the interactions of forest ecosystems with herbivore communities, an appreciation of the interactions between the species of herbivore themselves is necessary. This paper reviews interspecific interactions of ungulates, methods used in studying them, and seeks to identify areas to which future research should be directed in the context of European forest systems. Methods that have been used to provide information on interactions include: comparative resource studies, niche theory, physiological and anatomical analyses, modeling and foraging theory, and population studies. The most commonly reported types of interactions appear to be competition and facilitation. Behavioural and social interactions between species are potentially important, but evidence for these is scarce and often anecdotal. It is suggested that there may be considerable potential for ungulates to interact in European forests which are often significantly altered from their natural state. Future research should aim at refining the theoretical understanding of interspecific interactions, particularly between ungulates with different feeding ecologies. The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) has a major impact on forest ecosystems and is increasing its range throughout Europe. However, there is evidence that it may be displaced or out-competed by a number of ungulate species, and it is suggested as being research priority to quantify these effects.

Although many species of voles usually coexist and are in severe competition for food and breeding space, the role of interspecific competition in vole cycles has never been evaluated statistically After studying community effects on the population dynamics of the gray-sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in the subarctic birch forest at Kilpisjarvi, Finland, we report statistical results showing that both interspecific and intraspecific effects are important in the direct year-to-year density dependence, However, interspecific effects are-not detectable in the 2-year delayed density dependence that is crucial for generating the characteristic cycles. Furthermore, we show that most of the competition takes place during the winter. The results are evaluated against two models of community dynamics. One assumes that the delayed effects are caused by an interaction with a specialist predator, and the other assumes that they are caused by overgrazing food plants. These statistical results show that vole cycles may be generated by a species-specific trophic interaction. The results also suggest that the gray-sided vole may be the focal species in the birch-forest community, as field voles may be in the taiga and as lemmings may be on the tundra.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Finnish Forest Res Inst, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Stenseth, NC (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, POB 1050, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",n.c.stenseth@bio.uio.no,"Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; Hansen, Thomas F/B-9021-2009","Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; ",,,,46,79,82,0,40,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

In central Oklahoma, the predaceous ant lions Myrmeleon crudelis and M. immaculatus live in dense aggregations at the sheltered bases of cliff ledges. Three larval instars of each species act as predators and competitors of one another. In controlled field experiments, mortality of second and third instars increased with density, although intra-and interspecific effects were indistinguishable. The presence of third-instar larvae did not affect recruitment or survivorship of first-instar larvae. In all experiments, mortality was predictable on the basis of body mass and larval density, but not species identity. Increased food supply shortened development time and increased adult body mass but did not affect mortality. Larvae near the front of the ant lion aggregation grew faster due to greater food availability but suffered greater mortality in the pupal stage.

These larvae live in water-filled holes in fallen and living trees, where they and three other common odonate species are the top predators. By mid wet season, M. coerulatus larvae were found in nearly half of all tree holes that harbored odonates. Although M. coerulatus were typically, but not always, eliminated from holes inhabited by larger heterospecifics, M. coerulatus were more likely to encounter conspecifics than other odonate species. Hole with less than 1 1 of water rarely contained more than a single larva. In large holes where M. coerulatus was the only odonate species present, multiple larvae coexisted at a density of one larva per 1-21 of water. There the absence of 2-4 of the 5 larval size classes, despite a continuous input of eggs, suggested that cannibalism was a common cause of mortality. The size of the final instar, which determined adult body size, was correlated positively with tree hole volume for male, but not female, larvae. Experiments showed that when two larvae were placed together in 0.4-1 holes with abundant tadpole prey, the larger larva killed the smaller one. Often the larva that was killed was not eaten. Small larvae were more tolerant of each other than were pairs of medium of large larvae. Before killing occurred, the presence of larger larvae reduced the growth of smaller individuals, relative to controls. 'Obligate' killing was density-dependent. In 3.0-1 holes with ad libitum prey, conspecific killing occurred until the larval density stabilized at one larva per 1-1.5 1, similar to the density found in large holes under field conditions, For M. coerulatus, cannibalism functions to reduce the number of potential competitors for food in addition to providing nutrition. When interactions between paired larvae in small holes were experimentally prevented, competition for food reduced the growth of one or both larvae relative to controls. Holes that were watered during the dry season supported larval densities similar to those in the wet season. Thus, dry season mortality could not be attributed to a decrease in available prey. Rather, M. coerulatus larvae could not survive more than 1 month of complete drying. Because the dry season typically lasts more than 6 weeks, habitat drying is a secondary source of mortality, affecting second- or third-generation larvae that fail to emerge before tree holes dry out completely.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST,BALBOA,PANAMA",,,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,42,87,94,3,29,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,1994,100,1-2,,,,,118,127,,10.1007/BF00317138,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PR645,WOS:A1994PR64500015,28307035,,,,2021-09-21,

Earlier work on resource competition has led to the ''R* rule,'' which states that a dominant competitor suppresses resources to a lower level than any other competing species. This rule describes the outcome of even ornate models of competition. Here we show that analogous simple rules can characterize systems with predation. We first demonstrate, for a simple two-prey, one-predator model without resource competition but with a predator numerical response leading to apparent competition, that the winning prey supports (and withstands) the higher predator density; that is, the outcome is described by a ''P* rule.'' We then develop a general model in which predation is inflicted evenhandedly on two prey species competing for a single resource and show that the R* and P* rules hold: the winning prey both depresses resources to the lowest level and sustains the higher predator density. We next examine a more complex model with differential predation. Assuming a closed system (i.e., a fixed nutrient pool), we portray the four-dimensional system dynamics in a two-dimensional graphical model, and we assess the domain of applicability of simple dominance rules in more complex systems. We address the generality of our conclusions and end by examining the implications of different, reasonable biological constraints for community structure.","IMPERIAL COLL, CTR ENVIRONM RES COUNCIL, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND; UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA","HOLT, RD (corresponding author), UNIV KANSAS, DEPT SYSTEMAT & ECOL, MUSEUM NAT HIST, LAWRENCE, KS 66045 USA.",,,"Grover, James/0000-0003-2425-6927",,,,37,451,464,6,173,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The relative size projection equation for the Coast Ranges study included the effect of total vegetation control, which indicated that diameters of Douglas-fir receiving total vegetation control tended to become more uniform over time in the Coast Ranges. An additional equation was developed to project quadratic mean diameter so that individual-tree diameters could be estimated from projected relative size. The effect of vegetation management treatments on projected quadratic mean diameters in the Siskiyou study was expressed as an interaction between proportion of cover removed by treatments (intensity) and dominant height of Douglas-fir at time of treatment relative to current dominant height.

In all three treatments, the survival of S. nigrolineata larvae was high at the beginning of experiment, 0.39-0.83 between the 1st and 5th stages, but later high mortality was observed. C. producta adults tended to invade experimental rock pools and towards the end of the experiment larvae of this species were dominant. Oviposition rates and developmental rates of the three species are comparable. In laboratory tests, young larvae of S. nigrolineata were more vulnerable to interspecific predation than those of the rock-pool species, and older larvae proved to be less efficient predators. In rock pools, there are no environmental factors preventing successful reproduction by S. nigrolineata. However, competition and predation by the two other rock-pool species seem to prevent successful reproduction. Dispersal in S. nigrolineata is too slow for efficient colonization of rapidly changing rock-pool environments.","UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT APPL CHEM & MICROBIOL,SF-00014 HELSINKI,FINLAND","PAJUNEN, VI (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,POB 17,SF-00014 HELSINKI,FINLAND.",,,,,,,18,10,10,1,17,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1993,95,2,,,,,220,225,,10.1007/BF00323493,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LV564,WOS:A1993LV56400009,28312945,,,,2021-09-21,

Muller). Two different predator profiles were used, one simulating a gape-limited (vertebrate) predator, and the other simulating a size-dependent (invertebrate) predator sensu Zaret (1980). Predation was executed by manually removing fixed percentages of populations in susceptible size-classes in accordance with the profiles, irrespective of species. Thirty-six two-species and seven one-species experiments were performed with predation rates from 0 to 90% per 8 days. (2) Under gape-limited (vertebrate) predation, the time to extinction of the larger D. magna decreased with increasing predation rates. In the size-dependent (invertebrate) predation experiments, coexistence of both species was common up to c. 75% predation per 8 days, and then D. longispina became extinct at higher predation rates. Extinctions of the sub-dominant species did not occur when it was reared alone under high predation rates. Both interspecific competition and predation appeared to be important for the exclusion of the species most susceptible to predation. (3) The results support the idea that vertebrate predation can be important in regulating prey size distribution and species composition in rockpool and pond zooplankton communities. They also suggest that low rates of invertebrate predation may have little effect on zooplankton composition in rockpools and ponds. (4) Predation and competition interacted to produce differences in species composition between different predation rates and profiles. Interspecific competition was still of importance under high predation rates. It is therefore suggested that the view that either one or the other of these processes operates in a particular community may be too simplistic.",,"MILBRINK, G (corresponding author), UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ZOOL, BOX 561, S-75122 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,"Bengtsson, Jan/AAF-2325-2021",,,,,78,19,19,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Similarly sized third instar larvae of Hippodamia convergens and H. tredecimpunctata, H. convergens and H. sinuata, and H. convergens and Coccinella septempunctata, were tested in experiments designed to ensure that paired larvae experienced moderate competition. Interspecific competition in these experiments did not differ significantly from intraspecific competition, in that an individual's weight gain did not depend on whether its competitor was heterospecific or conspecific. Furthermore, aphid populations were reduced equally by heterospecific and conspecific pairs.

Few studies, however, have examined how variation in intra- and interspecific resource use affect trophic interactions over time within a seasonally-dynamic food web. We compared diets with respect to predator body size and predator species identity over 3 seasons by collecting stomach contents from 2028 Reticulate Sculpin (Cottus perplexus), 479 Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii), and 107 Pacific Giant Salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) in western Oregon streams. In each season, predator body size was strongly associated with dietary composition and positively related to taxonomic breadth and the size of individual prey. Intra- and interspecific diet variation changed substantially across seasons, with much greater interspecific variation in spring than in summer and autumn. Interspecific differences in foraging mode (e.g., benthic vs drift feeding) were associated with predator-specific responses to a seasonal pulse in the availability of terrestrial thrip larvae (Thysanoptera) and contributed to temporal variation in trophic niche differentiation. These findings show that the relative magnitudes of intra- and interspecific diet differentiation can change over time in systems that receive seasonal resource pulses. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of food webs and the need to incorporate sampling over relevant temporal scales to understand species interactions.","[Falke, Landon P.; Preston, Daniel L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Henderson, Jeremy S.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, 305 South Canyon City Rd East, Canyon, OR 97820 USA; [Novak, Mark] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 3029 Cordley Hall,2701 Southwest Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA","Falke, LP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",landonfalke@gmail.com; hendejer@gmail.com; mark.novak@oregonstate.edu; daniel.preston@wisc.edu,,"Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353827]; Oregon State University; University of Wisconsin-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education,"For assistance with data collection, we thank Anuwar Azraf, Madeleine Barrett, Alicen Billings, Andrew Branka, Clarissa Chan, Rebecca Crawford, Kila Gebeyessa, Daniel Gradison, Kurt Ingeman, Emily Hiser, Tamara Layden, Dana Moore, Elora Ormand, Arren Padgett, Zachary Randell, Kieryian Rock, Wendy Saepharn, Alex Scharfstein, Leah Sequi, Johnny Schwartz, Isaac Shepard, Jasper Shults, Samantha Sturman, Ernesto Vaca Jr, and Beatriz Werber.

Our previous finding of reduced vigilance among jackdaws and lesser kestrels residing in mixed-species colonies suggested a reliance on interspecific communication of information regarding predatory threats. To test for interspecific communication of threat, we first determined whether jackdaw and lesser kestrel call structure varied with perceived threat. In this call production phase of our study, free-living birds in mixed-species colonies were presented with models representing a potential nest predator (European magpie) or with non-threatening stimuli (wood pigeon or wooden dowel) in proximity to nests. We recorded and subsequently analysed those calls to determine if any temporal or frequency-related call parameters differed by model type. In a second, perceptual phase of our study, we tested whether receivers perceive threat-related variation in both conspecific and heterospecific call structure by playing back call exemplars recorded in response to the predator model or to innocuous control stimuli, to determine whether free-living jackdaws or lesser kestrels respond differentially to playbacks of the different call types. We detected differences in vocalizations of both jackdaws and lesser kestrels relative to the model type presented, with more broadband (lesser kestrel) or noisy calls (jackdaws) in response to magpie versus innocuous model types. We also detected differential behavioural responses to call playbacks, with both jackdaws and lesser kestrels increasing vigilance and alarm calling in response to magpie-elicited jackdaw calls, but not to other call types. Taken together, our results suggest that jackdaw, but not lesser kestrel vocalizations, communicate enhanced threat associated with European magpies as possible nest predators. This interspecific alarm communication benefits both jackdaws and lesser kestrels, and, at least in part, explains asymmetric responses of jackdaws and lesser kestrels to magpies attending mixed-species colonies in nature.","[Hare, James F.; Hare, Alexander J.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Sara, Maurizio; Campobello, Daniela] Univ Palermo, Dept STEBICEF, Sect Anim Biol, Palermo, Italy; [Hare, Alexander J.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada","Hare, JF (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Biol Sci, 50 Sifton Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",james.hare@umanitoba.ca,"Sara, Maurizio/H-2662-2012","Sara, Maurizio/0000-0003-4274-422X; Hare, James/0000-0001-6408-8484",Universita degli Studi di Palermo; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [545611]; CoRI Human Mobility and International Scientific Cooperation,"Universita degli Studi di Palermo; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: 545611; CoRI Human Mobility and International Scientific Cooperation",,87,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,OCT,2019,125,10,,,,,733,744,,10.1111/eth.12926,,JUL 2019,12,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,IV9ZH,WOS:000478555100001,,,,,2021-09-21,

A potential for competition exists between red deer Cervus elaphus and chamois Rupicapra spp., as revealed by the high dietary overlap observed throughout the range where the species co-occur. Furthermore, some studies have recently reported negative demographic consequences on chamois populations living in sympatry with red deer. Using time series of counts spanning 35 years between 1984 and 2018 in the Stelvio National Park (Central Italian Alps), we tested for density dependence using state-space models and explored the evidence of competitive interaction through Ricker-like models on the growth rate of both species. We contrasted alternative hypotheses for the processes explaining the trends of (decreasing) chamois and (increasing) red deer populations. We expected chamois dynamics to be negatively affected by increasing deer abundance, while deer dynamics should be primarily affected by climate forcing and density dependence. We found evidence that resources were limiting for both species. In particular, growth rates were negatively affected by the synergistic effect of winter weather conditions and density dependence. The most important variable limiting the chamois population, however, was the increase in red deer numbers. The dynamics of this species was unaffected by chamois numbers. While causality cannot be inferred from the data, these results are consistent with the hypothesis of a negative effect of red deer on chamois dynamics, thus supporting the occurrence of interference or exploitation competition between sympatric mountain-dwelling ungulates. Understanding the processes underlying temporal dynamics is pivotal for informed management of wildlife.

But how does the structure of competitive hierarchies affect population dynamics and extinction processes? We tackled this important question by using spatially explicit simulations of ecological drift (10 species in a homogeneous landscape of 64 patches) in which birth rates were influenced by interspecific competition. Specifically, we examined how transitive (linear pecking orders) and intransitive (pecking orders with loops) competitive hierarchies affected extinction rates and population dynamics in simulated communities through time. In comparison to a pure neutral model, an ecological drift model including transitive competition increased extinction rates, caused synchronous density-dependent population fluctuations, and generated a white-noise distribution of population sizes. In contrast, the drift model with intransitive competitive interactions decreased extinctions rates, caused asynchronous (compensatory) density-dependent population fluctuations, and generated a brown noise distribution of population sizes. We also explored the effect on community stability of more complex patterns of competitive interactions in which pairwise competitive relationships were assigned probabilistically. These probabilistic competition models also generated density-dependent trajectories and a brown noise distribution of population sizes. However, extinction rates and the degree of population synchrony were comparable to those observed in purely neutral communities. Collectively, our results confirm that intransitive competition has a strong and stabilizing effect on local populations in species-poor communities. This effect wanes with increasing species richness. Empirical assemblages characterized by brown spectral noise, density-dependent regulation, and asynchronous (compensatory) population fluctuations may indicate a signature of intransitive competitive interactions.","[Ulrich, Werner; Puchalka, Radoslaw; Koprowski, Marcin] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Ecol & Biogeog, Torun, Poland; [Strona, Giovanni] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Sustainable Resources, Ispra, Italy; [Gotelli, Nicholas J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT USA","Ulrich, W (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Ecol & Biogeog, Torun, Poland.",ulrichw@umk.pl,"Koprowski, Marcin/A-2863-2014; Puchalka, Radoslaw/G-6188-2014","Koprowski, Marcin/0000-0002-0583-4165; Puchalka, Radoslaw/0000-0002-4764-0705; Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619",Polish National Science Center [2017/27/B/NZ8/00316]; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-DEB 1257625],W.

These antagonistic interactions have been scarcely studied in coccinellids. Through a laboratory study we assessed aphid consumption, weight gain and reproduction when the invasive Harmonia axyridis, the alien Hippodamia variegata and the native Eriopis chilensis were alone, in conspecific and heterospecific groups, at low and high aphid densities. Under intraspecific competition, coccinellids were more voracious than when they were alone, particularly H. axyridis and H. variegata at high aphid density; H. axyridis and H. variegata gained more weight than E. chilensis, and H. axyridis barely reproduced at low aphid densities, even when alone, while in the other two species reproduction was not affected by the presence of conspecifics. Under interspecific competition, weight gain and reproduction results suggest that H. axyridis was responsible for most aphid consumption; H. variegata gained less weight and barely reproduced in heterospecific groups, but its reproduction was not affected. Eriopis chilensis weight gain and reproduction was low but not affected by the presence of the other species. The lack of negative effects of intraspecific competition on H. axyridis and its better performance in heterospecific groups suggests that this species is the stronger competitor, negatively affecting H. variegata, but not E. chilensis. Thus, exploitative interspecific competition is an important mechanism explaining the dominance of H. axyridis and the decline of some species following its invasion. Therefore, this interaction deserves more attention than what has been paid up to now.","[Zaviezo, Tania] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Casilla 306-22, Santiago, Chile; [Soares, Antonio Onofre] Univ Azores, Dept Biol, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal; [Grez, Audrey A.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Casilla 2-15, Santiago, Chile","Grez, AA (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Casilla 2-15, Santiago, Chile.",agrez@uchile.cl,"Zaviezo, Tania/F-3099-2014; Zaviezo, Tania/AAM-5707-2020; Soares, Antonio Onofre/M-4207-2013","Zaviezo, Tania/0000-0002-4993-0386; Zaviezo, Tania/0000-0002-4993-0386; Soares, Antonio Onofre/0000-0001-7922-6296","FONDECYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140662, 1180533]","Special thanks to Elizabeth Gazzano for her invaluable help with field collections, insect colonies and assistance during the laboratory experiments.

Yet the influence of resource availability-critical for survival and reproduction-on small carnivore habitat use within these modified environments is poorly understood. We conducted camera-trap surveys within a seasonally dry tropical forest fragment (148 km(2)) in northeastern Thailand to better understand the influence resource availability has on small carnivore habitat use within fragmented areas. Species occupancy models including both habitat and resource variables were assessed across periods of high and low resource availability (fruit abundance and rodent biomass). Species with similar resource or habitat preferences may also compete when resources are low. Therefore, we tested species with shared preferences for patterns of spatial co-occurrence and temporal overlap. Fruit availability influenced the distribution of common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), while rodent biomass influenced Asiatic jackal (Canis aureus), leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), and small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), but only during annual periods of scarcity. In contrast, small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was highly selective for a specific habitat (dry dipterocarp forest) regardless of seasonal fluctuations in food availability. Occupancy increased for all species during periods of resource scarcity, with leopard cat and Asiatic jackal experiencing the greatest increases (139% and 58%, respectively). Species with shared resource and habitat preferences appeared to avoid each other, either spatially or temporally. For example, leopard cat and Asiatic jackal co-occurred spatially less than would be expected, though only when rodents were scarce. Similarly, small Indian civet and small Asian mongoose, which used the same habitat and co-occurred spatially at a rate greater than expected, were active at different times. Our results indicate that seasonal resource fluctuations and interspecific interactions strongly influence the distribution of sympatric small carnivores in a fragmented forest.

Predation risk has been shown to regulate mutualism dynamics in species-specific case studies; however, we lack studies which investigate whether predation can also explain broader patterns of mutualism evolution. We report that fish-anemone mutualisms have evolved on at least 55 occasions across 16 fish families over the past 60 million years and that adult body size is associated with the ontogenetic stage of anemone mutualisms: larger-bodied species partner with anemones as juveniles, while smaller-bodied species partner with anemones throughout their lives. Field and laboratory studies show that predators target smaller prey, that smaller fishes associate more with anemones, and that these relationships confer protection to small fishes. Our results indicate that predation is likely driving the recurrent convergent evolution of fish-anemone mutualisms and suggest that similar ecological processes may have selected convergence in interspecies interactions in other animal clades.","[Feeney, William E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Feeney, William E.; Brooker, Rohan M.; Johnston, Lane N.; Lecchini, David; Dixson, Danielle L.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Brooker, Rohan M.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Gilbert, James D.

However, there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of various factors on interspecific competition. In this study, both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches were employed to investigate how various combinations of the initial cell densities of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella vulgaris and copper exposure levels affect interspecific competition between these species. In the simulation results, C. vulgaris appeared to be superior to P. subcapitata in the absence of copper exposure. However, in the copper-exposed groups, the competitive positions of both algal species varied with the initial cell density and the copper exposure level. In particular, at the highest copper concentration (10 mu g/L), C. vulgaris became less competitive than P. subcapitata in most initial cell density combinations, resulting in a shift in competitive dominance. This study clearly showed that the dominant species in the interspecific competition could be altered by the two factors studied herein. The developed model provided a more detailed and intuitive understanding of the effects of the two factors on the interspecific competition by simulating the competition at various combinations of initial algal density and copper exposure levels. In this study, the initial algal density and copper exposure levels were selected as the factors influencing the interspecific competition between P. subcapitata and C. vulgaris, but the proposed model could be used to study the effects of other toxicants on the interspecific competition between other algal species.","[Kim, Yongeun] Korea Univ, OJERI, Inst Environm & Ecol, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Son, Jino; Lee, Yun-Sik] Korea Univ, Ojeong Ecoresilience Inst, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Mo, Hyoung-Ho] Anim & Plant Quarantine Agcy, Jungbu Reg Off, Incheon 22133, South Korea; [Cho, Kijong] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea","Cho, K (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",kjcho@korea.ac.kr,,,Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as The Chemical Accident Prevention Technology Development Project [2016001970003]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2017R1A6A3A11035451],This subject is supported by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as The Chemical Accident Prevention Technology Development Project.

Animals may anticipate and try to avoid, at some costs, physical encounters with other competitors. This may ultimately impact their foraging distribution and intake rates. Such cryptic interference competition is difficult to measure in the field, and extremely little is known at the interspecific level. 2. We tested the hypothesis that smaller species avoid larger ones because of potential costs of interference competition and hence expected them to segregate from larger competitors at the scale of a resource patch. We assessed fine-scale spatial segregation patterns between three African herbivore species (zebra Equus quagga, kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis) and a megaherbivore, the African elephant Loxodonta africana, at the scale of water resource patches in the semi-arid ecosystem of Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. 3. Nine waterholes were monitored every two weeks during the dry season of a drought year, and observational scans of the spatial distribution of all herbivores were performed every 15 min. We developed a methodological approach to analyse such fine-scale spatial data. 4. Elephants increasingly used waterholes as the dry season progressed, as did the probability of co-occurrence and agonistic interaction with elephants for the three study species. All three species segregated from elephants at the beginning of the dry season, suggesting a spatial avoidance of elephants and the existence of costs of being close to them. However, contrarily to our expectations, herbivores did not segregate from elephants the rest of the dry season but tended to increasingly aggregate with elephants as the dry season progressed. 5. We discuss these surprising results and the existence of a trade-off between avoidance of interspecific interference competition and other potential factors such as access to quality water, which may have relative associated costs that change with the time of the year.","[Ferry, Nicolas; Dray, Stephane; Fritz, Herve; Valeix, Marion] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon, CNRS UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, Bat Gregor Mendel,43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Ferry, N (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon, CNRS UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, Bat Gregor Mendel,43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",ferrynicolas@me.com,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014; Dray, Stephane/B-4107-2010; Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661; Dray, Stephane/0000-0003-0153-1105; Ferry, Nicolas/0000-0001-5191-9648",CNRS Zone Atelier Hwange (CNRS-Hwange LTER); French 'Ministere de la Recherche' through the 'Ecole Doctorale Diversite du Vivant' of 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie',"This research was conducted under the Hwange Environmental Research Development (HERD) programme from the French 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique' (CNRS) and 'Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement' (CIRAD), within the study area of, and with funding support from, the CNRS Zone Atelier Hwange (CNRS-Hwange LTER).

In a context of global warming, this spatial shift could impact local trophic interactions: direct impacts may affect forage fish through modified predator-prey interactions, and indirect impactsmay materialize through competition with other resident predators. For instance, North Sea saithe (Pollachius virens) spatial overlap with hake has increased while saithe spawning-stock biomass has decreased recently notwithstanding a sustainable exploitation. In this context, we investigated the range of potential impacts resulting from most recent hake emergence in the North Sea, with a particular focus on saithe. We carried out a multispecies assessment of North Sea saithe, using the Stochastic MultiSpecies (SMS) model. In addition to top-down processes already implemented in SMS, we built in the model bottom-up processes, relating Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii) abundance and saithe weight-at-age. We simulated the effects, on all North Sea species being considered but focusing on Norway pout and saithe, of combining different hake abundance trends scenarios with the inclusion of bottom-up processes in SMS. North Sea saithe F-MSY was then evaluated in a multispecies context and contrasted with single-species value. The different scenarios tested revealed a negative impact of hake emergence on saithe biomass, resulting from an increase of predation pressure on Norway pout. These results confirm the competition assumption between saithe and hake in the North Sea and might partially explain the most recent decrease of saithe biomass. This study also highlighted that taking into account bottom-up processes in the stock assessment had a limited effect on the estimation of saithe FMSY which was consistent with single-species value.","[Cormon, Xochitl; Marchal, Paul] IFREMER, Channel & North Sea Fisheries Res Unit, 150 Quai Gambetta,BP 699, F-62321 Boulogne, France; [Kempf, Alexander] Thunen Inst Sea Fisheries, Palmaille 9, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Vermard, Youen] IFREMER, Unit Fisheries Ecol & Modelling, BP 21105, F-44311 Nantes 03, France; [Vinther, Morten] DTU Aqua Tech Univ Denmark, Joegersborg Alle 1, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark","Cormon, X (corresponding author), IFREMER, Channel & North Sea Fisheries Res Unit, 150 Quai Gambetta,BP 699, F-62321 Boulogne, France.",xochitl.cormon@ifremer.fr,,"Vermard, Youen/0000-0003-2828-2815; Marchal, Paul/0000-0003-2047-4599; Vinther, Morten/0000-0002-2535-5575",,,,65,6,6,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

The extent to which microhabitat partitioning occurs depends on a variety of environmental parameters and biotic interactions. In the present study, we manipulated factors (animal density, presence of heterospecifics, and presence of predator cues) that potentially influence the differential use of microhabitats by 2 hemi-sessile congeners that coexist on small spatial scales at very high densities: the amphipod crustaceans Jassa marmorata and J. herdmani. In both species, the presence of heterospecifics had a clear effect on which part of an offered macroalga was preferably colonized, suggesting that the extent of microhabitat partitioning depends on the presence/absence of heterospecifics. Furthermore, 'predatory fish cues' in the seawater induced an avoidance behaviour, which should reduce the extent of habitat partitioning and inevitably increase competition between the species. The results clearly show some flexibility of habitat selection in, and thus habitat segregation between, the studied species, allowing for a trade-off between interspecific competition and predation pressure.","[Beermann, Jan] Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany; [Boos, Karin] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Beermann, J (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, POB 180, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany.",jan.beermann@awi.de,,"Beermann, Jan/0000-0001-5894-6817",Free University of Berlin (Elsa- Neumann-Stipendium of the Federal State of Berlin),"We thank the crew of the RV 'Aade' for their help in the field and colleagues Heinz- Dieter Franke (Helgoland, Germany), Martin Thiel (Coquimbo, Chile) and Roger Mundry (Leipzig, Germany) for valuable comments and suggestions.

The presence of filamentous cyanobacteria can reduce the competitive superiority of large-bodied cladocerans, because they are less resistant than small-bodied ones to interference with food collection by filaments. The viscosity of water decreases with increasing temperature which may alter the filtering mechanisms of cladocerans, making the large-bodied species even more susceptible to interference by cyanobacterial filaments. The aims of this study were (1) to test if the presence of the filamentous non-toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii shifts competitive dominance from a large-bodied cladoceran species towards a small-bodied one and (2) to determine whether the competitive superiority of a small-bodied species in the presence of cyanobacterial filaments is temperature-dependent. A laboratory competition experiment was conducted with large-bodied Daphnia pulicaria and small-bodied D. longispina, in the presence or absence of cyanobacteria in two different thermal regimes -18 and 25 degrees C. Unexpectedly, D. pulicaria was dominant over D. longispina, irrespective of the food and thermal treatments applied. The large-bodied Daphnia species was competitively superior even in the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria and at an elevated temperature.","[Sikora, Anna; Dawidowicz, Piotr] Univ Warsaw, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, Fac Biol, Dept Hydrobiol, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland","Sikora, A (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, Fac Biol, Dept Hydrobiol, Zwirki & Wigury 101, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland.",a.b.sikora@uw.edu.pl; p.dawidowicz@uw.edu.pl,"Dawidowicz, Piotr/N-7405-2018","Dawidowicz, Piotr/0000-0001-8385-6215; , Anna/0000-0001-6277-3621","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [N N305 134440]","We are grateful to Pawel Koperski for his great help and valuable comments on the manuscript, and Tomasz Karasek for his assistance in the laboratory.

To date, many studied systems have not met assumptions of the traditional competition theory, and a new paradigm has been emerging. We examined the behavioral and life-history consequences of common host plant use of Heliconius erato and Dryas iulia (Nymphalidae) in relation to Passiflora suberosa (Passifloraceae). Larvae of the former use the apical portion of this host; the latter is presumably able to explore all plant parts. We assessed host use pattern in relation to leaf age, when reared either alone (D. iulia) or together (D. iulia and H. erato). Larval feeding choice tests with respect to leaf age were performed, and performance was recorded. Observations were made to assess antagonistic behavior of H. erato and D. iulia towards each other, if any. Similarly to H. erato, D. iulia fed on the young leaves significantly more than the mature ones; larvae were not induced to prefer mature leaves. First instars of H. erato used only the apical parts of P. suberosa and displayed aggressive behavior towards D. iulia, which moved to the lower shoot portions. Larval mortality and development time of both species significantly increased when reared together; such performance costs were more pronounced in D. iulia than H. erato. Our study gathers evidences that use of P. suberosa by these heliconian butterflies represent a case of competitive exclusion resulting in niche differentiation, where costs are higher for D. iulia than H. erato.","[Millan, Carolina; Pires Moreira, Gilson Rudinei] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, PPG Ecol, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Borges, Simone Silva; Pires Moreira, Gilson Rudinei] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Daniela] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Inst Biol, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Rodrigues, D (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Inst Biol, CP 68020, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",lepidoptera.azul@gmail.com; drodrigues@biologia.ufrj.br; gilson.moreira@ufrgs.br,"Moreira, Gilson R P/D-2209-2013; Rodrigues, Daniela/E-2214-2013","Rodrigues, Daniela/0000-0003-3104-9053","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS); Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [480264/2010-4, 309676/2011-8]","We are grateful to Jose R.

Individuals compete for a resource on a common patch and can go to a refuge. It is assumed that if species would remain on the competition patch, species 1 survives and species 2 would go extinct. Therefore, species 1 is Locally Superior Competitor (LSC) and species 2 Locally Inferior Competitor (LIC). We study the effects of density dependent dispersal from the competition patch to the refuge on the global outcome of competition. We study two cases. The first case considers LSC density dependent dispersal of the LIC trying to escape competition and going to its refuge when the LSC density is large. The second case considers aggressiveness of LIC leading to LIC density dependent dispersal of the LSC. We show that under some conditions, tactic 2 can allow the LIC to survive and even provoke global extinction of the LSC.","[Nguyen-Ngoc Doanh] IFI, MSI, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen-Ngoc Doanh] Hanoi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Appl Math & Informat, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen-Huu Tri] ENS Lyon, IXXI, F-69364 Lyon 07, France; [Nguyen-Huu Tri; Pierre, Auger] Univ Paris 06, UMI 209, UMMISCO, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pierre, Auger] Univ Cadi Ayyad, LMDP, Fac Sci Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco; IRD, UMI UMMISCO 209, F-93143 Bondy, France","Doanh, NN (corresponding author), IFI, MSI, 42 Ta Quang Buu St, Hanoi, Vietnam.",doanhbondy@gmail.com,,,Vietnamese National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [101.01.61.09]; French ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR),Nguyen-Ngoc Doanh was partially supported by Vietnamese National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant 101.01.61.09.

First, we review characteristics of non-native mosquito species that have established viable populations, and those invasive species that have spread widely and had major impacts, testing whether biotic characteristics are associated with the transition from established non-native to invasive. Second, we review the roles of interspecific competition, apparent competition, predation, intraguild predation and climatic limitation as causes of impacts on residents or as barriers to invasion. We concentrate on the best-studied invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, evaluating the application of basic ecological theory to invasions by Aedes albopictus. We develop a model based on observations of Aedes albopictus for effects of resource competition and predation as barriers to invasion, evaluating which community and ecosystem characteristics favour invasion.

Arvicoline rodents have a typical, season-dependent, bimodal, age distribution of breeding individuals within a population. This distribution may influence population fluctuations. In this study, we measured effects of interspecific competition from field voles (Microtus agrestis) on various fitness components of female bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in an age-structured breeding population in large (0.25 ha) outdoor enclosures. We monitored survival, reproduction, and space use of experimental bank vole populations with females from two different age groups. Within the enclosures we manipulated the presence and absence of field voles. When coexisting with field voles, the year-born bank vole females had lower survival rates than the over-wintered ones did. Home ranges of bank voles were smaller in the presence of field voles than in their absence. Characteristics of litters of breeding females were not affected by the competition treatment. Reproduction of the youngest of the year-born females stopped earlier in the season than for over-wintered females although both age groups had reproduced prior to the trial. We did not observe indications of senescence, such as lower reproduction or survival of the over-wintered females in late summer. An earlier cessation of breeding in the younger females suggests an age-specific trade-off of summer reproduction and winter. survival for parous females. Inter- and intraspecific competition seemed to work additively on the year-born, females through direct interference. By selectively reducing survival of younger breeders, interspecific competition could influence age distribution and population growth of breeders toward the end of the breeding season. Because old, over-wintered females are not surviving to the next noribreeding season, the lower survival of young breeders through interspecific competition might impact greatly the structure of the breeding population at the start of the next breeding season, thus altering population growth patterns.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,,,,,,57,14,17,1,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2003,84,12,,,,,3284,3293,,10.1890/02-0220,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762LN,WOS:000187973500018,,,,,2021-09-21,

We report findings from such experiments assessing competitive interactions among three species of parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Aplielinidae) of the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia argentifolii Bellows & Perring (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), a pestiferous species of worldwide importance. The parasitoids used in the study (Encarsia pergandiella Howard, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet, and Encarsia formosa Gahan) encompass the range of life histories found within Aphelinidae, and they exhibit a high degree of niche overlap. The objectives of our studies were ( I) to investigate the occurrence of interspecific competition among the whitefly parasitoids, (2) to quantify shifts in resource utilization patterns as influenced by experimental manipulations of the parasitoid assemblage and (3) to assess the impact of interspecific competition on the ability of the parasitoids to suppress their host populations. Field cages enclosing cotton plants were inoculated with whitefly by releasing adults at either a high or a low rate followed by releases of all possible combinations of the parasitoid species (including a no-parasitoid release control). The treatments were replicated three and four times each in 1996 and 1997. The presence of interspecific competitors reduced population growth rates of E. formosa and E. pergandiella but not the population growth rate of E. mundus. The spatial distribution of parasitism by E. pergandiella along the vertical axis of cotton plants differed in the multiple species treatments compared to the single species treatments. Changes in parasitoid activity in the presence of competitors may reduce potentially adverse effects of competition and promote species coexistence. Only releases of E. formosa together with E. pergandiella resulted in lower levels of host mortality than would be expected based on observed mortality by individual species. Our results demonstrate competitive interactions among three parasitoids of B. argentifolii under field manipulations but indicate that, in most cases, competitive interactions among parasitoids do not affect host population suppression.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Biol Control Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; USDA, APHIS PPQ, Mission Plant Protect Ctr, Mission, TX 78573 USA","Bogran, CE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Biol Control Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,96,76,82,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2002,83,3,,,,,653,668,,10.2307/3071871,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,523QY,WOS:000173967500008,,,,,2021-09-21,

This study evaluated the effectiveness of spatially and temporally separating the feed for red hybrid tilapia and redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatirs) as a means of decreasing interspecific competition and increasing the performance of each species in communal culture. The effects of the spatial and temporal separation of feed (i.e., feeding with sinking and floating pellets vs. sinking pellets only, and by day and night vs. day only, respectively) were tested in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Two 6-week experiments were conducted involving inverse fish-crayfish size relationships. Monocultures of each species were included as controls. No effects of the spatial and temporal separation of feed on the survival and growth of tilapia were found. However, tilapia grew better in duoculture than in monoculture. The performance of redclaw was generally better in monoculture than in duoculture with tilapia. The magnitude of the deleterious effect of tilapia on redclaw was size-dependent, as reflected in reduced survival, growth and foraging of small redclaw in the presence of relatively larger tilapia. There was a significant effect of the temporal separation of feed on the growth of small crayfish; feeding them at night increased their growth by 32%. The temporal separation of feed, in which redclaw were fed at night and tilapia during the day, proved to be an appropriate feeding strategy in their communal culture. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Predation by the spider on the three ladybird species differed. All the larvae of C. septempunctata, none of H. axyridis, and an intermediate number of P. japonica were attacked and eaten by the spider. All the larvae of H. axyridis suffered mortality due to cannibalism or starvation in the treatments with and without a spider. In case of C. septempunctata, however, mortality in the early instars was significantly greater in the treatment with a spider than without a spider and no larvae developed into pupae due to predation. In the treatment without a spider, the majority of the larvae in the former treatment suffered mortality due to cannibalism or starvation, and only 13.3% of larvae developed into the adult stage. In the case of P. japonica, mortality was mainly attributed to predation in the treatment with a spider and only 26.7% became adult. In comparison, 86.7% of larvae survived to the adult stage in the treatment without a spider. In addition, in both H. axyridis and C. septempunctata, the development of young larvae was significantly slower in the presence of a spider, but this was not the case with the older larvae of H. axyridis, which indicates that the effect of the spider on larval development changed with the developmental stage of the larvae in this species. However, the spider had no significant effect on the developmental time of P. japonica larvae. Although both the spider and the ladybirds significantly affected the number of aphids. they did not have an additive effect on aphid abundance. The interactions between the spider and the ladybirds, such as intraguild predation or competition, caused them to reduce aphid population density less than the ladybirds did on their own. The effect of the spider on the larval performance of three predatory ladybirds was found to be unequal in terms of their vulnerability to predation and rats of larval development and it depended on the species and developmental stage of the ladybird.","Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan","Yasuda, H (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.",,,,,,,38,23,28,0,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Field experiment 1 tested which species has a competitive advantage as larvae developing in water-filled tires. Densities and al availability of resources (leaf litter, which is a substrate for microorganisms fed upon by larvae) were manipulated in a factorial design. Contrary to previous laboratory experiments, A. albopictus was clearly the superior competitor in this tire environment, maintaining positive population growth at higher combined density and lower per capita resource availability than did A. aegypti. The primary determinant of success in this experiment was survivorship to adulthood, and A. aegypti only survived well in this environment when raised alone at low density, with high resource availability. Field experiment 2 tested whether this advantage for A. albopictus resulted from apparent competition mediated by shared protozoan parasites in the genus Ascogregarina. In field experiment 2, A. albopictus larvae had moderate to high levels of parasitism, but A. aegypti larvae were virtually free from Ascogregarina in all experimental tires, implying that Ascogregarina played little or no role in producing the advantage for A. albopictus in field experiment 1. Thus, apparent competition does not appear to be necessary to account for the replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus. As a first step toward understanding variation in the outcome of this invasion, numbers of Aedes immatures and masses of adults from field collected pupae (indicators of the intensity of competition) were compared for three sites with known histories of invasion by A. albopictus ana decline or A. aegypti. Differences among sites in both number of Aedes per container and masses of adults of both species were consistent with the hypothesis that intensity of competition varies among sites, and suggest that A. aegypti persists only at sites where interspecific competition is less intense. Resource competition among larvae appears to be sufficient to account for replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus in suburban and rural areas of South Florida, which may have been marginal habitats for A. aegypti.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",,,,57,276,279,1,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1998,79,1,,,,,255,268,,10.2307/176880,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YR740,WOS:000071525500023,,,,,2021-09-21,

This quantitative examination of larval interactions between C. septempunctata and Coleomegilla maculata (DeCeer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a Nearctic coccinellid, was conducted under controlled prey densities. Larvae of both coccinellid species are affected by a limited diet [one pea aphid per day Acrythosiphon pisum (Harris) (Homoptera: Aphididae)] compared with an excess diet (> 20 aphids per day). Larval survival decreased from 86 to 63% in C. maculata and from 84 to 33% in C. septempunctata; mean preimaginal developmental time increased from 20.6 to 26.7 days in C. maculata, and from 18.1 to 32.0 days in C. septempunctata. Additionally, on one aphid per day, mean adult weight was reduced from 12.39 to 9.79 mg in C. maculata, and from 39.57 to 14.44 mg in C. septempunctata. Interspecific interactions, favoring C. septeumpunctata over C. maculata at a low prey density (one aphid per day), take the form of reduced survival of C. maculata compared with C. septempunctata (14 versus 66%). Reduced survival of C. maculata may be the result of competition for aphids or intraguild predation by C. septempunctata on C. maculata. No interspecific interactions (measured as effects on larval survival, preimaginal developmental time, and adult weight) were observed between larvae of these two species at a high prey density (> 20 aphids per predator per day).","Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK USA","Obrycki, JJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,48,104,112,0,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1998,117,1-2,,,,,279,285,,10.1007/s004420050659,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,144YZ,WOS:000077344700036,28308499,,,,2021-09-21,

Euseius finlandicus females consumed more larvae and protonymphs than the females of T. pyri and K. aberrans. In cages without free water E. finlandicus ate a range of 6.51 larvae or 5.31 protonymphs of T. pyri and 5.27 larvae or 5.95 protonymphs of K. aberrans per female per day. Kampimodromus aberrans and T. pyri females exhibited a greater tendency to prey on heterospecifics than on conspecifics. When feeding on phytoseiid immatures and without free water, T. pyri females survived longer and laid more eggs than the females of E. finlandicus and K. aberrans. Adult females of E. finlandicus and T. pyri having free water and preying on heterospecific protonymphs were able to maintain egg laying during the whole experimental period of 12 days. The females of all three species had difficulties in piercing phytoseiid eggs, and the number of sucked eggs per female per day was low. Kampimodromus aberrans females ate 0.48 eggs of T. pyri daily, which was the highest recorded number.

In Bolinas Lagoon, in central California, the site of this study, at least 15 species of trematodes infect snail populations. This study investigated patterns of interspecific association and interaction among members of this parasite guild. Seven to 19 host subpopulations were sampled annually at each of two sites in the lagoon from 1981 to 1988. Mixed-species infections constituted only 2.5% of the 5025 infections examined in the study. A Monte Carlo simulation procedure demonstrated that the numbers of such infections were often less than would be expected by chance, especially when the overall prevalence of infection was high. Patterns of association between particular pairs of species depended on whether the species' life histories include redial or only sporocyst larvae. Species that develop as rediae were predominantly negatively associated with other redial species and with most species that develop only as sporocysts. There was weak evidence of positive interspecific association between a few redial and sporocyst-only species, while members of other such pairs were distributed independently. Associations between sporocyst-only species were either weakly positive or neutral. Snails carrying known infections were marked, released, and recaptured at both study sites. During their exposure in the field, some initial infections were invaded by another parasite species that often excluded the first parasite. The vulnerability of a parasite species to invasion and replacement by another differed among the tested species. Infections of the largest redial species, Parorchis acanthus, were especially resistant to replacement, while those of the smallest redial species, Euhaplorchis californiensis, were the most frequently excluded. Four other species were invaded or replaced at intermediate rates. The two largest redial species, P. acanthus and Himasthla rhigedana, were responsible for >90% of the invasions or exclusions. Direct observations showed that the rediae of these species prey on the larval stages of other species, as do the rediae of Echinoparyphium sp. This direct form of interspecific antagonism is probably the primary mechanism by which such species exclude others from host snails, as has been widely demonstrated in similar freshwater snail-trematode systems. While hierarchical, negative interactions prevent the coexistence of species at the level of the individual host, the mark-recapture study showed that rates of exclusion are low for most subordinate species, with the exception of Euhaplorchis californiensis. At the level of the host subpopulation, the assemblage of larval trematodes is diverse, and its composition is temporally and spatially variable. There is no trend toward dominance of the assemblage by large redial species as the level of infection rises within aging cohorts or subpopulations of hosts. These patterns of guild structure within host cohorts and subpopulations are consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment processes rather than interspecific interactions primarily determine the composition and relative abundance of species at this regional level. Several characteristics of snail-trematode systems that may promote regional coexistence of such a large number of potentially interacting parasite species are the isolated and subdivided nature of the host resource, the aggregated distributions of larval stages, and the differential exploitation of different-sized hosts. Many features of this system are consistent with Price's (1980) non-equilibrial view of parasite communities.",,"SOUSA, WP (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,122,115,116,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

However, investigating carnivore behaviour in the field can be challenging especially for species that are difficult to access. Methods that enable remote collection of data provide a means of recording natural behaviour and are therefore useful for studying elusive species such as leopards (Panthera pardus). Camera traps and Global Positioning System (GPS) collars are powerful tools often used independently to study animal behaviour but where their data are combined, the interpretation of a species' behaviours is improved. In this study we used data from baited camera trap stations to investigate the feeding habits of leopards at Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, Zimbabwe. We investigated the influence of spotted hyenas, lions and other competing leopards on the feeding duration of leopards using Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Modelling. To test the influence of competing predators on resting distances from bait sites, eight leopards were fitted with GPS collars. Results showed that leopards spent the shortest time feeding on the baits in the presence of competing male leopards compared to other predators while lion presence caused animals to rest farthest from bait sites. Interaction analysis indicated that small-bodied leopards spent significantly shorter durations feeding when spotted hyenas were present. Our findings demonstrate that competition from guild carnivores has negative impacts on the food intake of leopards, which may have implications for fitness and survival. This study provides a snapshot of the competition dynamics at bait sites which may give insight to ecosystem level interactions among large carnivores in savanna ecosystems.","[Tarugara, Allan; Clegg, Bruce W.] Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, Private Bag 7085, Chiredzi, Zimbabwe; [Tarugara, Allan; Gandiwa, Edson; Muposhi, Victor K.] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Sch Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe","Tarugara, A (corresponding author), Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, Private Bag 7085, Chiredzi, Zimbabwe.",allantarugara@gmail.com,,"Tarugara, Allan/0000-0003-4623-6097","The Malilangwe Trust, Chiredzi, Zimbabwe","The Malilangwe Trust, Chiredzi, Zimbabwe",,81,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

These types of interaction are particularly exemplified in freshwater pond communities, where substantial size variation exists both within and among species of top consumers. We investigated whether density dependence can modify the outcome of size-structured interactions between larval stages of two pond-breeding salamanders, Ambystoma annulatum and Ambystoma opacum. Size structure exists in populations of these species due to variation in the timing of breeding, which we hypothesised would amplify predation rates and competitive asymmetries from the early-arriving species (A. annulatum) on the later-arriving species (A. opacum). We manipulated the relative densities of both A. annulatum and A. opacum in outdoor mesocosms. We maintained the experiment through metamorphosis, and analysed size at metamorphosis, larval period length and survival of each species. Ambystoma annulatum imparted a strong density-dependent effect on A. opacum through a combination of predation and competition. Survival of A. opacum was negatively related to the density of A. annulatum. For the A. opacum that survived, body size was reduced and larval period lengthened at higher A. annulatum densities, indicative of interspecific competition that was partly explained by resource pre-emption. In contrast, A. annulatum was only affected by intraspecific density-dependent competition. Our results suggest that density-dependent effects reinforce asymmetric interactions among larval salamanders. However, the intensity of the asymmetric interactions is mediated by the arrival time and size of conspecifics. Specifically, earlier-arriving species can negatively affect the later-arriving species via size-mediated predation and competition. The interactive effects of density dependence and arrival time of community members are probably a common mechanism generating size variability in ecological communities. Yet, most studies only evaluate one mechanism or the other. By interweaving these two processes, our work displays the importance of understanding context-dependence in species interactions.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Burkhart, Jacob J.; Davenport, Jon M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Biol, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Biol, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",thander@siue.edu,,,,,,54,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Location The Iberian Peninsula. Taxon Vipera aspis, V. latastei and V. seoanei.. Methods We applied the concept of favourability of occurrence to produce commensurate distribution units unaffected by the prevalence of different species in the Iberian Peninsula. We compared the favourability of each species individually with the favourability of occurrence of more than one species co-occurring in their overlapping ranges, and identified the areas in which sympatric coexistence, environmental segregation and competitive exclusion are predicted to occur. Results The main driver of the parapatric pattern was competitive exclusion, which was mediated by gradual changes in the environmental conditions favouring each species. The para-Mediterranean V. aspis presented fragmented favourable areas outside its range that seemed to be unoccupied due to competitive exclusion by the other vipers. The Mediterranean V. latastei appeared to be limited by competition with the other viper species and by the environment in north-western Iberia. V. seoanei prevented the other two species becoming established in the north-western quarter of the Iberian Peninsula due to its better adaption to the humid conditions in this region. Some areas of sustainable coexistence were detected, mainly in the upper reaches of the River Ebro. Main conclusions Each species is better adapted to particular conditions. However, the existence of ecotones forces them to occur sympatrically and compete for resources. The parapatric pattern is a result of the evolutionary history of the species and of strong competitive interactions between them, which form 'competitive-exclusion barriers'. However, these barriers are environmentally dependent, so changes in the environment could rapidly affect the limits of the species distribution.","[Chamorro, Dario; Real, Raimundo; Munoz, Antonio-Roman] Univ Malaga, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Biol, Biogeog Div & Conservat Res Team, E-29017 Malaga, Spain; [Martinez-Freiria, Fernando] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio, Vairao, Portugal","Chamorro, D (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Biol, Biogeog Div & Conservat Res Team, E-29017 Malaga, Spain.",dariochamorro@uma.es,"; Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010; Martinez-Freiria, Fernando/L-7075-2013","Munoz, Antonio Roman/0000-0002-0253-7632; Chamorro, Dario/0000-0003-4399-6998; Real, Raimundo/0000-0002-6642-1284; Martinez-Freiria, Fernando/0000-0003-2311-8960","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport [FPU15/00123]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [DL57/2016/CP1440/CT0010]; Programa Operativo FEDER, Consejeria de Economia, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad, Junta de Andalucia","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, Grant/Award Number: FPU15/00123; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: DL57/2016/CP1440/CT0010; Programa Operativo FEDER, Consejeria de Economia, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad, Junta de Andalucia",,68,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

One hundred and fifteen lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Calabrian cheeses were screened for their technological characteristics and inhibiting action against Listeria monocytogenes in laboratory media. The anti-Listeria activity of representative strains was evaluated also in soft cheese during chilled storage. Bacterial interaction was studied using a competitive modelling approach based on Lotka-Volterra equations. Strains 29 (Lactobacillus sakei), 31 (Lactobacillus plantarum group), and 76 (Lactobacillus plantarum group) showed the best performances both in vitro and in soft cheese reducing the loads of Listeria monocytogenes from 0.5 to almost 1 Log CFU/g. Also considering their technological features, these strains could be used as adjunct cultures to improve the safety of finished products. The proposed competition model returned good predictions, especially after the application of the interspecific competition parameter beta.

We present evidence that, when at high densities, South Island robins (Petroica australis) may be responsible for declines in a suite of smaller native and introduced songbird species. Bird surveys undertaken on 47 islands in Breaksea Sound and Dusky Sound, Fiordland, during 1974 to 1986, were repeated on the same islands in 2016 or 2019. During the first block of surveys, Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) were present on two islands, and stoats (Mustela erminea) were known or presumed to regularly reach 43 of the remaining islands. The rats were eradicated in 1986 and 1988, and stoats have been controlled to zero density since 2001 on all 28 of the islands surveyed in Dusky Sound, and since 2008 on 12 of 19 islands surveyed in Breaksea Sound. Bird species that apparently benefited from pest mammal eradications included South Island robin (Petroica australis) and kaka (Nestor meridionalis), both of which are endemic. Species recorded less often after the eradications included tomtit (Petroica macrocephala), grey warbler (Gerygone igata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), dunnock (Prunella modularis), and chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) - a mixture of endemic, native, and introduced species. We hypothesise that these five species have been outcompeted or displaced by the now widespread and abundant South Island robin, probably through aggressive interactions.","[Miskelly, Colin M.; Tennyson, Alan J.

Spatial variability includes short-range neighbour-dependent interactions and small-scale spatial structure, such asclusteringwhere individuals aggregate together, andsegregationwhere individuals are spaced apart from one another. Yet, a large class of mathematical models aimed at representing these processes ignores these factors by making a classical mean-field approximation, where interactions between individuals are assumed to occur in proportion to their average density. Such mean-field approximations amount to ignoring spatial structure. In this work, we consider an individual-based model of a two-species community that is composed ofconsumersandresources. The model describes migration, predation, competition and dispersal of offspring, and explicitly gives rise to varying degrees of spatial structure. We compare simulation results from the individual-based model with the solution of a classical mean-field approximation, and this comparison provides insight into how spatial structure can drive the system away from mean-field dynamics. Our analysis reveals that mechanisms leading to intraspecific clustering and interspecific segregation, such as short-range predation and short-range dispersal, tend to increase the size of the resource species relative to the mean-field prediction. We show that under certain parameter regimes these mechanisms lead to the extinction of consumers whereas the classical mean-field model predicts the coexistence of both species.","[Surendran, Anudeep; Simpson, Matthew J.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Plank, Michael J.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Math & Stat, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Plank, Michael J.] Te Punaha Matatini, Auckland, New Zealand","Simpson, MJ (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",anudeep.surendran@hdr.qut.edu.au; michael.plank@canterbury.ac.nz; matthew.simpson@qut.edu.au,"Surendran, Anudeep/ABF-5218-2020","Surendran, Anudeep/0000-0003-0777-4642",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170100474]; New Zealand Centre of Research Excellence,"This work is supported by the Australian Research Council (DP170100474).

Metabolic rates should therefore be under strong selection and, if heritable, become less variable over time. Yet intraspecific variation in metabolic rates is ubiquitous, even after accounting for body mass and temperature. Theory predicts variable selection maintains trait variation, but field estimates of how selection on metabolism varies are rare. We use a model marine invertebrate to estimate selection on metabolic rates in the wild under different competitive environments. Fitness landscapes varied among environments separated by a few centimeters: interspecific competition selected for higher metabolism, and a faster pace-of-life, relative to competition-free environments. Populations experience a mosaic of competitive regimes; we find metabolism mediates a competition-colonization trade-off across these regimes. Although high metabolic phenotypes possess greater competitive ability, in the absence of competitors, low metabolic phenotypes are better colonizers. Spatial heterogeneity and the variable selection on metabolic rates that it generates is likely to maintain variation in metabolic rate, despite strong selection in any single environment.","[Pettersen, Amanda K.; Hall, Matthew D.; White, Craig R.; Marshall, Dustin J.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Geometr Biol, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Pettersen, Amanda K.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22100 Lund, Sweden","Pettersen, AK (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Geometr Biol, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.; Pettersen, AK (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",amanda.pettersen@biol.lu.se,"Pettersen, Amanda Kate/O-7554-2017; Hall, Matthew/A-2006-2009","Pettersen, Amanda Kate/0000-0001-6191-6563; Hall, Matthew/0000-0002-4738-203X; White, Craig/0000-0002-0200-2187",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; Monash University Postgraduate Publication AwardMonash University,"The authors wish to thank Royal Brighton Yacht Club for generous access to the field site, K.

In addition, direct interspecific competition may lead to inferior species avoiding dominant species. I examined the summer spatial distribution of the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) at Mount Fuji in the absence of predation risk in relation to forage abundance, security (steep slope or poor visibility), and abundance of a dominant competitor, the sika deer (Cervus nippon). Only main forage abundance, terrain, and visibility affected serow summer spatial distribution, and serows were more abundant in areas with lower forage abundance, steeper slopes, and poorer visibility environments. Serows seem to use habitats with lower forage abundance in exchange for high security. My findings suggest that serows favor security rather than better forage abundance, even without predation risk, and have less behavioral plasticity related to predation risk (consistent with the idea of ghosts of the predators past). This may relate to serow phylogeny or characteristics, such as small body size, and solitary and sedentary habits. My findings also suggest that serows did not avoid habitats with high densities of sika deer.","[Takada, Hayato] Mt Fuji Res Inst Yamanashi Prefecture Govt, 5597-1 Kenmarubi, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi 4030005, Japan","Takada, H (corresponding author), Mt Fuji Res Inst Yamanashi Prefecture Govt, 5597-1 Kenmarubi, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi 4030005, Japan.",capricornis.murina.8810@gmail.com,"Takada, Hayato/ABE-1358-2020","Takada, Hayato/0000-0003-2118-8762",,,,84,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1616-5047,1618-1476,,MAMM BIOL,Mamm.

However, because species do not live in isolation, this requires knowledge of how species interactions influence population dynamics. In addition, spatial processes play an important role in shaping population dynamics. It is therefore important to improve our understanding of how these different factors act together to shape patterns of abundance across space within and among species. Here, we present a new analytical model for understanding patterns of covariation in space between interacting species in a stochastic environment. We show that the correlation between two species in how they experience the same environmental conditions determines how correlated fluctuations in their densities would be in the absence of competition. In other words, without competition, synchrony between the species is driven by the environment, similar to the Moran effect within a species. Competition between the two species causes their abundances to become less positively or more negatively correlated. The same strength of competition has a greater negative effect on the correlation between species when one of them has a more variable growth rate than the other. In addition, dispersal or other movement weakens the effect of competition on the interspecific correlation. Finally, we show that movement increases the distance over which the species are (positively or negatively) correlated, an effect that is stronger when the species are competitors, and that there is a close connection between the spatial scaling of population synchrony within a species and between species. Our results show that the relationships between the different factors influencing interspecific correlations in abundance are not simple linear ones, but this model allows us to disentangle them and predict how they will affect population fluctuations in different situations.","[Lee, Aline Magdalena; Saether, Bernt-Erik] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Engen, Steinar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Lee, AM (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",lee@alumni.ntnu.no,"Lee, Aline Magdalena/AAL-9984-2021","Lee, Aline Magdalena/0000-0001-9272-4249",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [SFF-III 223257/F50]; Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU); Research Council of Norway (KLIMAFORSK project)Research Council of Norway [244647],This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway (SFF-III 223257/F50 and KLIMAFORSK project 244647) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).,,47,9,9,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2020,101,1,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.2901,,NOV 2019,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KA1HE,WOS:000497142600001,31578713,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2021-09-21,

We assessed the seed dispersal success by tracking the fates of 21 600 tagged seeds from six paired sympatric tree species in both monospecific and mixed plots across 4 successive years in a subtropical forest. We found that apparent mutualism was associated with the interspecific synchrony of seed rain both seasonally and yearly, whereas apparent competition or apparent predation was associated with interspecific asynchrony of seed rain either seasonally or yearly. We did not find consistent associations of indirect interactions with seed traits.

Generalist predator interactions, such as intraguild predation (IGP) and competition, can alleviate predation pressure and weaken top-down control that predators have on lower trophic levels. Centipedes (Chilopoda) and carabid beetles (Coleoptera) are common deciduous forest floor generalist predators that may interact by competing for resources beneath rocks and logs on the forest floor, especially during dry periods when prey become confined to such microhabitats. We used laboratory and field studies to determine whether the carabid beetle, Pterostichus stygicus (Say), and the centipede, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus (Say) co-occur under artificial cover. Additionally, a laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions in intra- and interspecific trials. There was significant negative co-occurrence of beetles and centipedes beneath cover objects in the field and laboratory. Pairings of S. sexspinosus and P. stygicus within mesocosms resulted in high mortality of P. stygicus, and reciprocal but asymmetric IGP. Centipedes maintained weight within solitary, intra- and interspecific mesocosm treatments, however, beetles lost mass in all treatments. Scolopocryptops sexspinosus responded more favorably to intra- and interspecific competition than did P. stygicus. Analysis of the leaf litter mesofauna indicated that these predators consumed similar prey in laboratory mesocosms. Our results suggest that species with very different trophic morphology have the potential to compete for shared microhabitat and prey.","[Julian, Michele E.; Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA; [Julian, Michele E.] Front Range Community Coll, Dept Sci, 2190 Miller Dr, Longmont, CO 80501 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,"John Carroll University, University Heights, Ohio; Faculty Summer Research Fellowship","We would like to thank Harry Lee for helping with beetle identification and for being a valuable resource for information about ground beetles.

Carabid communities are regulating weeds in arable fields and include a mix of species ranging from granivores to predators that are obligate omnivores. It is not clear from field studies whether granivore and obligate omnivore species either contribute equally or are complementary in the process of weed suppression, and little is known about the impact of potential predator interference within carabid communities on weed suppression. We compared the weed seed foraging strategy of the granivore Harpalus affinis and the obligate omnivore Poecilus cupreus. Using no-choice test experiments, we compared their activity and seed acceptance for four weed species through a scoring of the proportion of tested individuals consuming weeds, their latency before the consumption of the first seed and the total number of seeds consumed. We then evaluated their seed acceptance for dandelion seed Taraxacum officinale under predator interference by using chemical cues of carabids and tested the impact of three treatments, namely cues of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition and intraguild predation. We found that the obligate omnivore P. cupreus was highly active, had a low latency before consuming its first seed but had an interest in only two of the four weed species. P. cupreus seed acceptance remained unchanged in the presence of predator cues. By contrast, H. affinis was slow to start its seed consumption, accepted equally seeds of the four weed species and significantly increased its seed consumption in the presence of cues mimicking intraguild predation. These findings indicate that the two species differ in their foraging strategies, and as such, could have different contributions to weed seed suppression. This novel result calls for further studies documenting the foraging strategy of carabid species that thrive in arable fields as this could significantly improve our understanding of the delivery of weed seed regulation.

Tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus) and dhole (Cuon alpinus) represent a typical multi-predator system of species of conservation concern. Several studies have addressed this system, with heterogeneous results, and there's a lack of information on population dynamics of multi-species assemblages. We studied a time series (1998-2009) of abundance indices for three predators and five prey species in Bor Wildlife Sanctuary (BWS), Maharashtra, India, before it was declared as Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR) in 2009. Aims. To analyse the complex relationships within a predator-prey system in a dynamic fashion, to analyse data collected in a stable and undisturbed area and to form a comparison basis for future studies within the sanctuary after its declaration as a Tiger Reserve. Methods. A 24-h effort was made annually to census the BWS. Predators were counted at waterholes from arboreal hideouts. The prey populations were censused along 353-km line-transects. For each species, we analysed the yearly growth rate, testing the effect of inter-species abundance. Key results. Tiger growth rate did not depend on any particular prey, whereas mesopredators seemed to depend on medium-sized prey. A die-out of dholes in 2001 was followed by an increase in tiger populations (from 4 to 11), which, in turn, negatively affected leopard numbers (from 6 to 2). We found no direct evidence of top-down effect, but the density dependence for three of five prey species could be linked to predation pressure. We found some evidence of interspecific competition among prey species, especially among ungulates, potentially being mediated by predation pressure. Conclusions. The relationships among species in a predator-prey system are very complex and often could be explained only by more-than-two-species interactions. The disappearance of one predator, not necessarily the top predator, could bring multiple effects, for which it could be difficult to detect causal relationships.","[Reddy, Chidanand S.] Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, Chandrapur, Maharashtra, India; [Yosef, Reuven] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Eilat Campus,POB 272, IL-88000 Elat, Israel; [Yosef, Reuven] Sevadal Mahila Mahavidyalaya Coll, Sakardara Sq, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Calvi, Gianpiero] Studio Pteryx, Via Risorgimento 9, I-20060 Basiano, Italy; [Calvi, Gianpiero; Fornasari, Lorenzo] FaunaViva, Via Angelo Fumagalli 6, I-20143 Milan, Italy","Yosef, R (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Eilat Campus,POB 272, IL-88000 Elat, Israel.; Yosef, R (corresponding author), Sevadal Mahila Mahavidyalaya Coll, Sakardara Sq, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.",ryosef60@gmail.com,"Yosef, Reuven/I-3450-2019","Yosef, Reuven/0000-0003-4331-9866",,,,88,0,0,0,9,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,1448-5494,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

When several species of parasitoids oviposit within the same individual host, a complex phenomenon of larval competitive interaction occurs. Within the same guild there is a specialization in competitive strategies, sometimes multiparasitism is avoided, but some species are facultative hyperparasitoids/predators of their competitors. As these interactions occur within a very small host and during a brief period of time, and that direct observation is very difficult to achieve, we used an alternative methodological approach. We analyzed intraguild host competition mechanisms via the combination of a series of competitive behavioral and functional response models, thurstonian competition model and set theory. These models were fitted via a reversible-jump bayesian model selection procedure to a series of competition experiments data using larvae of three species of Gonatocerus spp. (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), egg parasitoids of the sharpshooter Tapajosa rubromarginata (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) as a case-of-study. This study tests the influence of intrinsic interspecific competition between inmature stages within on an individual host, and parasitoid arrival order among the three parasitoid species. The results showed that the species differed in competitive behavior, some species were better competitors than others. Individuals arriving earlier had a competitive advantage, the weaker species were able to out compete the stronger ones if the time advantage was longer than 18 h. All the species avoided already parasitized hosts, but in different degrees. The functional response was also different, with the best competitors having shorter estimated handling times. Using this analytical approach on a conventional experimental setup, we gained insights in the mechanism of competition, both on interference and exploitation, and in terms of host selection, all in a single analysis.","[Bruzzone, Octavio A.] INTA, Estn Expt Agr Bariloche, CC 277 Ave Modesta Victoria 4450, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Bruzzone, Octavio A.; Aguirre, Maria B.; Virla, Eduardo G.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Logarzo, Guillermo A.; Aguirre, Maria B.] FuEDEI, Simon Bolivar 1559,Hurlingham T4001MVB, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Virla, Eduardo G.] Fdn M Lillo, PROIMI Biotecnol, M Lillo 251, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Virla, Eduardo G.] Fdn M Lillo, Inst Entomol, M Lillo 251, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina","Bruzzone, OA (corresponding author), INTA, Estn Expt Agr Bariloche, CC 277 Ave Modesta Victoria 4450, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",bruzzone.octavio@inta.gob.ar; glogarzo@fuedei.org; mbaguirre@conicet.gov.ar; egvirla@lillo.org.ar,"Virla, Eduardo Gabriel/L-5546-2016","Virla, Eduardo Gabriel/0000-0002-9512-4254",Argentina Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology [0607],This research was funded in part by by the Argentina Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology (Project PICT 2014 no 0607).

Intraguild predation and competition often occur simultaneously, and ontogenetic shifts in competitive strength can dictate the magnitude and direction of species interactions. The recent introduction of the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus to the Atlantic coast of North America has resulted in the potential for considerable intraguild interactions with juvenile American lobsters Homarus americanus, with which it now co-occupies rocky intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. We present data from 5 yr of monthly (May-October) field sampling revealing a significant decline in lobster density as H. sanguineus density increased in the low intertidal. To investigate potential mechanisms behind this pattern, we conducted three mesocosm experiments designed to examine whether competitive interactions between H. americanus and H. sanguineus are size- or density-dependent. Larger early benthic phase lobsters (16-34 mm CL) outcompeted H. sanguineus for both food and shelter resources. These lobsters fed faster and more in the presence of H. sanguineus, effectively defended shelter, were responsible for the majority of agonistic interactions, and, in multiple instances, killed and consumed H. sanguineus. Effects on sheltering and agonstic interactions by these lobsters were independent of H. sanguineus density; however, prior shelter residency increased lobster agonistic behavior towards crabs. In contrast, H. sanguineus outcompeted smaller, early benthic phase lobsters (7.2-11.2 mm CL) for shelter, and these interactions were density dependent. Displacement of lobsters from shelter by crabs and cumulative agonistic interactions instigated by crabs towards lobsters scaled positively with H. sanguineus density. Given the similarity of the invasion documented here and others occurring globally, these experiments demonstrate the importance of considering how factors such as ontogeny, density-dependence, and primacy influence the outcomes of interactions between intraguild predators. Disentangling how these factors structure intraguild interactions between invasive and endemic species will both advance our fundamental understanding of community ecology and enhance efforts to conserve and manage natural resources.","[Baillie, Christopher J.; Grabowski, Jonathan H.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA","Baillie, CJ (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.",baillie.c@husky.neu.edu,,"Grabowski, Jonathan/0000-0003-4711-5481",,,,95,2,2,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2018,99,9,,,,,2067,2079,,10.1002/ecy.2432,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GS3WV,WOS:000443558200015,29920682,,,,2021-09-21,

Despite the progress made in developing and optimizing computational modeling parameters to recapitulate these interactions in silico, experimental verification of model predictions in vitro is often elusive, due to the limits of common laboratory culturing methods, especially at the micro-and nanoscale. In this work, micro-scale bioprinting was used to evaluate the spatiotemporal effects of metabolite sharing between partners in an artificial syntrophic consortium consisting of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Micro-colonies of these bacteria were patterned at increasing spatial separation distances, in the presence of competitor or cooperator strains. Growth of the consortium members was evaluated and compared to predictions generated by a bacterial growth modeling platform known as Computation of Microbial Ecosystems in Time and Space (COMETS). In close agreement with simulation, experimental metabolite sharing between micro-colonies exhibited strong distance-dependency. When bioprinted micro-colonies were confronted with one-way or two-way diffusion barriers, such as the intervention of cooperative or competitive bacteria, experimental results showed that spatial positioning of the barriers critically influences metabolite sharing between consortium members. These results were generally predicted by simulation in COMETS. Our results demonstrate the utility of micro-scale bioprinting to experimentally test which aspects of predictive microbial growth models hold at this spatial scale, and for a range of synthetic biology applications.","[Hynes, William F.; Cady, Nathaniel C.] SUNY Albany, Polytech Inst, Coll Nanoscale Sci Engn, 237 Fuller Rd, Albany, NY 12203 USA; [Hynes, William F.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Mat Engn Div, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Chacon, Jeremy; Harcombe, William R.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Segre, Daniel] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Bioinformat Program, 24 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Segre, Daniel] Biol Design Ctr, 24 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Marx, Christopher J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, 875 Perimeter MS 3051, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Cady, NC (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Polytech Inst, Coll Nanoscale Sci Engn, 237 Fuller Rd, Albany, NY 12203 USA.; Harcombe, WR (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",hynes2@llnl.gov; ncady@sunypoly.edu; harcombe@umn.edu,,,US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-DC0006731],This study was supported by a US Department of Energy award to CJM (DE-DC0006731).,,39,9,10,0,11,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2057-1976,,,BIOMED PHYS ENG EXPR,Biomed.

Furthermore, dung beetles deposit chemical substances on the food ball that may repel fly larvae and certain predators. In the present study, using Deltochilum furcatum, a dung beetle that does not exhibit parental care and the blow-fly, Lucilia cuprina, we tested the hypothesis that pygidial secretions deposited on the food ball could also make it less attractive as an oviposition site for flies. Food balls rolled by either D. furcatum males or females received significantly fewer eggs that balls that had not been rolled by beetles. Also, flies laid significantly fewer eggs on food balls treated with secretions collected from male pygidial glands. Reduced fly oviposition may be a direct effect of compounds the beetles deposited, acting as an allomone, and/or an indirect negative effect on the microbial community that stimulates fly oviposition. A model of the reproductive biology of this species is proposed.","[Ix-Balam, Manuel A.; Oliveira, Maria G.

However, while pairwise interactions between ecologically similar species have been well studied, multi-species competitive networks have received less attention. When interference competition between two species results in partitioning of resources, this may have indirect consequences for other species distributed along the same resource gradient. Here, we tested whether interference competition between two territorial damselfish influenced the fine-scale species distributions of five other territorial damselfish in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. These species partition habitat across three reef zones-the flat, crest, and slope, with distinct patterns of distribution within these zones. We predicted the two species with similar distributions and microhabitat use, Pomacentrus adelus and Pomacentrus bankanensis, would display the greatest level of aggression toward one another. This was tested through an intruder experiment where stimulus fish were introduced into a resident's territory, which confirmed disproportionately high levels of interspecific aggression between these two species. We also predicted that the fine-scale differences in the distribution of each species were maintained through multi-species interference competition among neighboring species, with further indirect effects on species that did not directly interact. To test this, we conducted a large-scale (22 x 10 m) experimental removal of the most abundant species, Po. adelus, and quantified the abundance and distribution of all territorial damselfish species for 6 months to a 25 cm resolution. The main direct competitor, Po. bankanensis, exhibited a marked increase in abundance and expanded its distribution (+1.33 m) to acquire the space previously occupied by Po. adelus. This competitive release triggered indirect effects on the distribution of other neighboring species further back on the reef flat, with Chrysiptera unimaculata moving into the zone formerly occupied by Po. bankanensis. This study indicates that the distinct distribution patterns among the reef crest species are linked to levels of interspecific agonistic behavior. We argue that the competitive release following the removal of a superior competitor resulted in both direct and indirect effects, with the immediate neighbor shifting into the newly available space, followed by successive shifts in species responding to the change in the distributions of their immediate neighbors.","[Eurich, Jacob G.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, ARC Ctr Excellence fir Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Eurich, JG (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, ARC Ctr Excellence fir Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",jacob.eurich@my.jcu.edu.au,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Eurich, Jacob G./K-8598-2019; McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Eurich, Jacob G./0000-0003-1764-7524; McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645","ARC through the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; College of Science and Engineering, JCU","We are grateful to the traditional owners of the Tamare-Kilu reefs for allowing access; S.M.

We tested the relative influence of (i) climatic variables, (ii) topographic variables, and (iii) hydrological variables derived from remote sensing data to improve the prediction of occurrence of aquatic plant species. Methods We considered the southern part of the Korean Peninsula as the modeling extent for the potential distribution of E. ferox. Occurrence records for E. ferox were collected from the literature and field surveys. We applied maximum entropy modeling using remotely sensed environmental variables and evaluated their relative importance as prediction variables with variation partitioning. Important Findings The species distribution model predicted potential habitats of E. ferox that matched the actual distribution well. Floodplain wetlands and shallow reservoirs were the favored habitats of E. ferox. Quantitative loss and fragmentation of wetland habitats appeared to be a major reason for the decrease of E. ferox populations. Our results also imply that hydrological variables (i.e. normalized difference water index) derived from remote sensing data greatly increased model prediction (relative contribution: 10.5-37.0%) in the aquatic ecosystem. However, interspecific competition within a similar niche environment should be considered to increase the accuracy of the distribution model.","[Kim, Ji Yoon; Kim, Gu-Yeon; Do, Yuno; Joo, Gea-Jae] Pusan Natl Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Integrated Biol Sci, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Park, Hee-Sun] Nakdong Estuary Ecoctr, Busan 49435, South Korea","Joo, GJ (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Integrated Biol Sci, Busan 46241, South Korea.",gjjoo@pusan.ac.kr,,"Kim, Ji Yoon/0000-0001-5228-4939",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Ministry of Education [2016R1A6A3A01009457],This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education [no. 2016R1A6A3A01009457].,,60,5,5,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Non-native salmonids were introduced into Lake Ontario, Canada, to provide recreational fishing opportunities; however, the establishment of those species has been proposed as a significant barrier to the reintroduction of native Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) due to intense interspecific competition. In this study, we compared population differences of Atlantic salmon in transcriptome response to interspecific competition. We reared Atlantic salmon from two populations (LaHave River and Sebago Lake) with fish of each of three non-native salmonids (Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, rainbow trout O.mykiss, and brown trout S.trutta) in artificial streams. We used RNA-seq to assess transcriptome differences between the Atlantic salmon populations and the responses of these populations to the interspecific competition treatments after 10months of competition in the stream tanks. We found that population differences in gene expression were generally greater than the effects of interspecific competition. Interestingly, we found that the two Atlantic salmon populations exhibited similar responses to interspecific competition based on functional gene ontologies, but the specific genes within those ontologies were different. Our transcriptome analyses suggest that the most stressful competitor (as measured by the highest number of differentially expressed genes) differs between the two study populations. Our transcriptome characterization highlights the importance of source population selection for conservation applications, as organisms with different evolutionary histories can possess different transcriptional responses to the same biotic stressors. The results also indicate that generalized predictions of the response of native species to interactions with introduced species may not be appropriate without incorporating potential population-specific response to introduced species.","[He, Xiaoping; Heath, Daniel D.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Houde, Aimee Lee S.; Neff, Bryan D.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [He, Xiaoping] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Pacific Biol Stn, Nanaimo, BC, Canada","He, XP (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON, Canada.",xiaoping.he@hotmail.com,,"He, Xiaoping/0000-0002-0697-6501",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Discovery Grant and Strategic Project Grant,,56,4,4,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

While the presence of aphid-tending ants can change the distribution of aphids among host plants, the role of mutualistic ants has not been fully explored to understand coexistence of multiple aphid species in a community. The tansy plant (Tanacetum vulgare) hosts three common and specialized aphid species, with only one being tended by ants. Often, these aphids species will not coexist on the same plant but will coexist across multiple plant hosts in a field. In this study, we aim to understand how interactions with mutualistic ants and predators affect the coexistence of multiple species of aphid herbivores on tansy. We show that the presence of ants drives community assembly at the level of individual plant, that is, the local community, by favoring one ant-tended species, Metopeurum fuscoviride, while preying on the untended Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria and, to a lesser extent, Uroleucon tanaceti. Competitive hierarchies without ants were very different from those with ants. At the regional level, multiple tansy plants provide a habitat across which all aphid species can coexist at the larger spatial scale, while being competitively excluded at the local scale. In this case, ant mutualist-dependent reversal of the competitive hierarchy can drive community dynamics in a plant-aphid system.","[Mehrparvar, Mohsen; Zytynska, Sharon E.; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Ctr Food & Life Sci Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Balog, Adalbert] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Dept Hort, Fac Tech & Human Sci, Targu Mures, Romania; [Mehrparvar, Mohsen] Grad Univ Adv Technol, Dept Biodivers, Inst Sci & High Technol & Environm Sci, Kerman, Iran","Zytynska, SE (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Ctr Food & Life Sci Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",sharon.zytynska@tum.de,"Zytynska, Sharon/C-9089-2011; Balog, Adalbert/O-9649-2019; Adalbert, Balog/AAR-4097-2021; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014","Zytynska, Sharon/0000-0002-0174-3303; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Mehrparvar, Mohsen/0000-0002-6051-5845","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [WE 3081/25-1]; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of Iran; Institute of Science and High Technology and Environmental Sciences, Kerman, Iran; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich (TUM)","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: WE 3081/25-1; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of Iran and Institute of Science and High Technology and Environmental Sciences, Kerman, Iran; German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich (TUM)",,48,2,2,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

But with species redistributions associated with climate change, the response by endemic predators within an AIGP context to changing biotic-abiotic conditions over time (i.e. seasonal and decadal) has yet to be quantified. Furthermore, little is known on AIGP dynamics in ecosystems undergoing rapid directional change such as the Arctic. Here, we investigate the flexibility of AIGP among two predators in the same trophic guild: beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), by season and over 30 years in Cumberland Sound-a system where forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) have recently become more available. Using stable isotopes, we illustrate different predator responses to temporal shifts in forage fish availability. On a seasonal cycle, beluga consumed less Greenland halibut and increased consumption of forage fish during summer, contrasting a constant consumption rate of forage fish by Greenland halibut year-round leading to decreased AIGP pressure between predators. Over a decadal scale (1982-2012), annual consumption of forage fish by beluga increased with a concomitant decline in the consumption of Greenland halibut, thereby indicating decreased AIGP pressure between predators in concordance with increased forage fish availability. The long-term changes of AIGP pressure between endemic predators illustrated here highlights climate-driven environmental alterations to interspecific intraguild interactions in the Arctic.","[Yurkowski, David J.; Imrie, Kendra L.; Ferguson, Steven H.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Hussey, Nigel E.] Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Fisk, Aaron T.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Tallman, Ross F.; Ferguson, Steven H.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada","Yurkowski, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",dyurkowski1@gmail.com,,"Yurkowski, David/0000-0003-2264-167X",NSERC-DiscoveryNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ArcticNet; Government of Nunavut; W.

Despite this, the population-level effects of intraguild competition on large carnivores remain largely unknown, due to a paucity of long-term studies that focus simultaneously on competing species. Here, we comprehensively examine competitive interactions, including their demographic consequences, between 2 top predators, lions Panthera leo and leopards P. pardus. We tested the hypothesis that lions, as the dominant competitor, limit the distribution and abundance of leopards, using dietary, spatial, and life-history data collected concurrently on the 2 species. Dietary overlap between lions and leopards was limited, with lions targeting large-to very large-sized prey and leopards small-to medium-sized prey. Leopards did not actively avoid lions, either predictively or reactively, except in riparian woodland where the likelihood of encountering lions was highest. Lions accounted for more than 20% of leopard mortality, but this appeared to be compensatory. Observed and modeled population growth was similar between the 2 species, with both exhibiting net emigration. Our findings suggest that lions do not suppress leopard populations or limit their distribution, at least in our study area. Adequate availability of suitably-sized prey apparently enabled resource partitioning between lions and leopards, facilitating their coexistence. The potential for competition increases in areas devoid of large prey and should be considered in recovery efforts for the 2 species. Our study provides novel empirical evidence that intraguild competition does not always have population-level consequences for subordinates, even if they suffer from strong inference competition with dominant competitors.","[Balme, Guy A.; Pitman, Ross T.; Robinson, Hugh S.; Miller, Jennie R.

In the first experiment, combined effects of chlorpyrifos and different levels of intraspecific and interspecific interaction were assessed on Gammarus pulex survival using Asellus aquaticus as an interacting species. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions increased the time to extinction of G. pulex up to a factor of 2, most likely because of the cannibalistic nature of G. pulex and its intraguild predation on A. aquaticus under stress conditions. In the second experiment, combined effects of chlorpyrifos and intraspecific and interspecific interaction were assessed on Daphnia pulex abundance using Brachionus calyciflorus as a competing species and Chaoborus sp. larvae as a predator. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions significantly affected the D. pulex population structure, but they did not influence the total population size. Predation decimated D. pulex abundance; however, interacting effects of predation and chlorpyrifos exposure were less noticeable at high exposure concentrations because of the reduced predatory efficiency of Chaoborus sp. larvae. The present study shows that species interactions do not always increase the vulnerability of aquatic populations to chemical stress and that some interactions (e.g., cannibalism and intraguild predation) or reduced predator grazing pressure can alleviate competition and predation stress on population-level insecticide effects under food-limiting conditions.

Interspecific interactions have a fundamental role in plant population dynamics, as they may set the conditions for species coexistence. Parasitic plants, like dwarf mistletoes, offer the opportunity to study competition for resources that are different from those consumed by most plants, allowing for a better understanding of the interaction. 2. We explored how interspecific interactions between two dwarf mistletoe species (Arceuthobium), co-infecting the same host species (even sharing the same individual tree of Pinus hartwegii) affect their infection dynamics at two different stages of population development (colonization of new hosts and subsequent growth), and if heterogeneity in resource availability (host density and size structure) affects these interactions. For that purpose, we integrated these processes into a spatially explicit model of density-dependent population growth. 3. We found that self-regulation (density-dependence) was strong for both species; however, the intensity and sign of interspecific interactions changed depending on host size and demographic process. Population growth in Arceuthobium globosum was reduced by competition, except for smaller hosts where A. globosum growth was facilitated by Arceuthobium vaginatum. Arceuthobium vaginatum was facilitated by A. globosum regardless of host size. Colonization of new hosts by A. globosum was enhanced by previous infection by the other species, showing intraguild facilitation. 4. Demographic importance of interactions depended on stand structure: in homogeneous, low-density forests, facilitation predominates, increasing the population sizes of both species, whereas the opposite occurs in heterogeneous and dense forests. Both species achieved stable coexistence, fulfilling the invasibility criterion because each mistletoe species can invade a forest that is already infected by the other species. 5. Synthesis. Despite the fundamentally different mechanisms underlying the interactions between mistletoes compared with non-parasitic plants, our results reveal that their behaviour at the population level is similar. Stabilizing mechanisms, like strong self-limiting population growth, allow dwarf mistletoe coexistence. Interactions shift as populations develop, and they depend largely on environmental factors such as forest structure. Intraguild mutualism is shown as a relevant process for colonization of new spaces, highlighting the complexity of competitive/facilitative interactions between parasitic plants, a formerly unexplored subject. Interactions can only be fully understood when integrating all their components at the population level. Analysing these interactions may contribute to the understanding of plant-plant interactions in general, and convey interesting implications for forest management.","[Queijeiro-Bolanos, Monica E.; Gonzalez, Edgar J.; Martorell, Carlos; Cano-Santana, Zenon] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Av Univ 3000, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Queijeiro-Bolanos, Monica E.] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol, Av Ciencias S-N, Queretaro 76230, Queretaro, Mexico","Cano-Santana, Z (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Av Univ 3000, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",zcs@ciencias.unam.mx,"Martorell, Carlos/A-2265-2008; Gonzalez, Edgar J./AAH-7144-2019","Martorell, Carlos/0000-0002-0758-3953; Gonzalez, Edgar J./0000-0001-9113-1070; Cano-Santana, Zenon/0000-0003-4860-6696",UNAM-DGAPA-PAPIITPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN220912]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CONACYT-23470],"We thank the following people for their assistance during field work: Isael Victoria, Paulina Sabugal, Alejandra Lara, Georgina Gonzalez, Ixchel Gonzalez, Daniel Torres, Evelyn Quiroz, Israel Carrillo and Tania Oseguera.

In this paper, we present a framework for revising the potential distribution of tree species native to the Western Ecoregion of Nova Scotia, Canada, by integrating the long-term effects of interspecific competition into an existing abiotic-factor-based definition of potential species distribution (PSD). The PSD model is developed by combining spatially explicit data of individualistic species' response to normalized incident photosynthetically active radiation, soil water content, and growing degree days. A revised PSD model adds biomass output simulated over a 100-year timeframe with a robust forest gap model and scaled up to the landscape using a forestland classification technique. To demonstrate the method, we applied the calculation to the natural range of 16 target tree species as found in 1,240 provincial forest-inventory plots. The revised PSD model, with the long-term effects of interspecific competition accounted for, predicted that eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), white birch (Betula papyrifera), red oak (Quercus rubra), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) would experience a significant decline in their original distribution compared with balsam fir (Abies balsamea), black spruce (Picea mariana), red spruce (Picea rubens), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). True model accuracy improved from 64.2% with original PSD evaluations to 81.7% with revised PSD.

Native irises support and interact with multiple trophic levels, whereas I. pseudacorus is classified an invasive pest because it grows aggressively, reduces biodiversity, and displaces native vegetation. Salinity levels are increasing in coastal wetlands worldwide. We examined how salt-stress affects competitive interactions between these conspecifics. METHODS: We established a three-way full-factorial common-garden experiment that included species (I. pseudacorus, I. hexagona), competition (no competition, intraspecific competition, and interspecific competition), and salinity (0, 4, 8 parts per thousand NaCl), with six replicates per treatment. KEY RESULTS: After 18 mo, Iris pseudacorus produced much more biomass than the native species did (F-1,F-92 = 71.5, P < 0.0001). Interspecific competition did not affect the introduced iris, but biomass of the native was strongly reduced (competition x species interaction: F-2,F-95 = 76.7, P = 0.002). Salinity significantly reduced biomass of both species (F-2,F-92 = 21.8, P < 0.0001), with no species x salinity interaction (F-2,F-84 = 1.85, P = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that salt stress strongly reduced clonal reproduction in native and introduced irises; however, the introduced iris had a competitive advantage over the native, regardless of environmental salinity levels. Based on patterns in clonal reproduction, the introduced iris could potentially threaten native iris populations. We are currently investigating seed production and mortality during competition and stress because both clonal and sexual reproduction must be considered when predicting long-term population dynamics.","[Mopper, Susan] Univ Louisiana, Ctr Ecol, 703 Thoroughbred Dr, Lafayette, LA 70507 USA; [Mopper, Susan] Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, 410 East St Mary Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70503 USA; [Wiens, Karen C.] Lower Columbia Fish Recovery Board, 2127 8th Ave, Longview, WA 98632 USA; [Goranova, Greta A.] 324 Arnaudville Rd, Carencro, LA 70520 USA","Mopper, S (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana, Ctr Ecol, 703 Thoroughbred Dr, Lafayette, LA 70507 USA.; Mopper, S (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, 410 East St Mary Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70503 USA.",mop@louisiana.edu; kcwiens@hotmail.com; Gretagor1@hotmail.com,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0618457, DEB-0124901]; ULL Graduate Student Organization; Louisiana Garden Club","We thank The National Science Foundation (DEB-0618457 and DEB-0124901 to S.M.), the ULL Graduate Student Organization, and the Louisiana Garden Club for helping fund this study.

The quantification of these evolutionary forces is essential for the understanding of the coexistence of predators in light of competitive exclusion dynamics. We address this topic by investigating the ecological niche of two medium-sized troglophile spiders (Meta menardi and Pimoa graphitica). Over one year, we surveyed several populations in four subterranean sites in the Western Italian Alps, monitoring monthly their spatial and temporal dynamics and the associated physical and ecological variables. We assessed competition between the two species by means of multi regression techniques and by evaluating the intersection between their multidimensional hypervolumes. We detected a remarkable overlap between the microclimatic and trophic niche of M. menardi and P. graphitica, however, the former being larger in size resulted the best competitor in proximity of the cave entrance, causing the latter to readjust its spatial niche towards the inner part, where prey availability is scarcer (step back effect). In parallel to the slight variations in the subterranean microclimatic condition, the niche of the two species was also found to be seasonal dependent, varying over the year. With this work, we aim at providing new insights about the relationships among predators, demonstrating that energy poor environments such as caves maintain the potential for diversification of predators via niche differentiation and serve as useful models for theoretical ecological studies.

Here, I examined wood density (WD) variation in populations of two tree species, where individuals have contrasting access to resources. In five Nothofagus betuloides and Nothofagus pumilio even-aged, mixed second-growth forests in Patagonia (Chile), I sampled pairs of dominant (full access to resources) and the nearest-to-it suppressed individuals (constrained access to resources), with the following main objective: to assess whether WD is a good predictor of the competitive ability of individuals in tree populations. To accomplish this objective, I quantified, at the individual level, sapwood (WDsap) and heartwood densities (WDheart), sapwood proportion (Sap(p)), growth rates (BAI(10)) and growth efficiency (GE). Given that sapwood and heartwood differ in functionality, I used WDst, a standardized way of computing WD that considers both wood type proportions in the stem. In order to determine the relationship between growth rate (BAI(10), a proxy of competitive ability) and WD at the intraspecific level, I analyzed the effect of contrasting access to resources (dominant versus suppressed individuals) and WD fitting mixed-effects correlation models (LMM). WDst showed very low variation (<6% of CV), and WDst did not differ between dominant and suppressed individuals for both species, nor did Sap(p). Dominant individuals of both species had significantly higher BAI(10) and GE values than suppressed individuals. I found a non-significant correlation between BAI(10) and WDst. Independently of tree species and access to resources, WDheart was significantly higher than WDsap. In conclusion, my results are unequivocal in that WD is a poor predictor of competitive ability among individuals of the same species and thus interspecific trends found in the growth-WD relationship are not paralleled at the intraspecific level.

The species was detected in the north-eastern Baltic Sea in 2003 and has rapidly expanded its distribution ever since. This invasive amphipod has been notably successful in shallow, soft and mixed bottom habitats becoming one of the most abundant gammarid colonizing such environments. This study carried out two experiments: (1) an outdoor aquarium experiment to assess interspecific competition among the invasive G. tigrinus and the native Gammarus duebeni and compare their reproductive potential, and (2) an in situ meshbag experiment to determine the effect of adult G. tigrinus and native gammarids on juvenile gammarid amphipods. These demonstrated that the adult G. tigrinus had no effects on the adult G. duebeni; however, the invasive amphipod had higher reproductive potential compared to the native species such as G. duebeni. Moreover, almost all adult gammarids exerted a significant predation pressure on juvenile amphipods. Thus, the combined effect of predation on juvenile amphipods and large brood production of G. tigrinus could be plausible explanations describing increased abundance of G. tigrinus and decrease of local gammarid populations in the north-eastern Baltic Sea but plausibly in similar shallow water habitats in other seas.

Three treatments of lavender patches were set out: bumble bees excluded, honey bees excluded, control. Bumble bees are known to handle lavender flowers more rapidly than honey bees, partly due to their longer tongues. As predicted, excluding these superior competitors consistently (n = 4 trials) and greatly increased honey bee numbers per patch (14-fold increase; P < 0.001). The exclusion of bumble bee also caused multiple changes to honey bee foraging behaviour: time spent on a patch (+857 %; P < 0.001), flower handling time (+16 %, P = 0.040), interval between probed flowers (-27 %, P = 0.012), proportion of interflower flights (-26 %, P < 0.001) and flowers rejected (-12 %, P < 0.001). Conversely, and also as predicted, excluding honey bees had no effect on bumble bee numbers or foraging behaviour. A key consequence of bumble bee exclusion was to increase the mean flower nectar content from 0.007 to 0.019 mu l (+171 %). By constructing an energy budget, we find that this leads to honey bees making a substantial, rather than a marginal, energetic profit per flower visited. Our results show the foraging behaviour of individual bees is extremely flexible and greatly influenced by the effects of interspecific competition on nectar rewards. Collectively, these individual decisions can have rapid and important consequences at the community level, including competitive exclusion.","[Balfour, Nicholas J.; Ratnieks, Francis L.

During secondary contact between two allopatrically formed, closely related species, harmful male genitalia may also reduce the fitness of heterospecific females given interspecific copulation. We performed a laboratory experiment to determine whether the extent of genital spine exaggeration in Callosobruchus chinensis males affects the fitness of C.maculatus females by injuring their reproductive organs. We found that males with more exaggerated genital spines were more likely to injure the females via interspecific copulation and that the genital injury translated into fecundity loss. Thus, as predicted, reproductive interference by C.chinensis males on C.maculatus females is mediated by exaggeration of the genital spine, which is the evolutionary consequence of intraspecific male-male competition.

However, studies that have investigated this hypothesis have been incomplete as they either did not test for all aspects of competitive ability or did not select appropriate competitors. Methods Here, the prediction of increased competitive ability was examined with the invasive plant Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) in a set of common-garden experiments that addressed these aspects by carefully distinguishing between competitive effect and response of invasive and native plants, and by using both intraspecific and interspecific competition settings with a highly vigorous neighbour, Urtica dioica (stinging nettle), which occurs in both ranges. Key Results While the intraspecific competition results showed no differences in competitive effect or response between native and invasive plants, the interspecific competition experiment revealed greater competitive response and effect of invasive plants in both biomass and seed production. Conclusions The use of both intra-and interspecific competition experiments in this study revealed opposing results. While the first experiment refutes the EICA hypothesis, the second shows strong support for it, suggesting evolutionarily increased competitive ability in invasive populations of L. salicaria. It is suggested that the use of naturally co-occurring heterospecifics, rather than conspecifics, may provide a better evaluation of the possible evolutionary shift towards greater competitive ability.","[Joshi, Srijana; Gruntman, Michal; Bilton, Mark; Tielboerger, Katja] Univ Tubingen, Plant Ecol Grp, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Seifan, Merav] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Gruntman, M (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Plant Ecol Grp, Morgenstelle 5, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",michal.gruntman@bot.uni-tuebingen.de,"Seifan, Merav/Q-1654-2015","Seifan, Merav/0000-0002-2830-5450","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [TI-338/8-1, GR-4325/1-1]; Minerva Foundation",We thank Ortrun Ebinger for her technical help.

Interspecific competition, however, is thought to limit sexual dimorphism, as larger competitors in the community will prevent the larger sex from evolving larger size, and smaller species may prevent the smaller sex from becoming even smaller. We tested this prediction using data on the sexual size dimorphism of lizards, and mammalian carnivores, on islands world-wide. Because insular communities are depauperate, and guilds are species-poor, it is often assumed that enhanced sexual size dimorphism is common on islands. The intensity of interspecific competition, hindering enhanced dimorphism, is thought to increase with competitor richness. We tested whether intraspecific sexual size dimorphism of mammalian carnivores and lizards decreases with increasing island species richness. We further computed the average sexual dimorphism of species on islands and tested whether species-rich islands are inhabited by relatively monomorphic species. Within families and guilds across carnivores and lizards, and with both intraspecific and interspecific approaches, we consistently failed to find support for the notion that species-poor islands harbour more sexually dimorphic individuals or species. We conclude that either interspecific competition does not affect the sexual size dimorphism of insular lizards and carnivores (i.e. character displacement and species sorting are rare in these taxa), or that the number of species in an assemblage or guild is a poor proxy for the intensity of interspecific competition in insular assemblages.","[Meiri, Shai; Kadison, Amy E.; Novosolov, Maria; Itescu, Yuval] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Pafilis, Panayiotis] Univ Athens, Dept Biol, Sect Zool & Marine Biol, Athens 15784, Greece; [Foufopoulos, Johannes] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Raia, Pasquale] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ambiente & Risorse, I-80138 Naples, Italy; [Pincheira-Donoso, Daniel] Lincoln Univ, Sch Life Sci, Lincoln LN2 2LG, England","Meiri, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",uncshai@post.tau.ac.il,"Raia, Pasquale/I-8600-2012; Novosolov, Maria/Q-3929-2017; Meiri, Shai/D-2403-2010","Raia, Pasquale/0000-0002-4593-8006; Novosolov, Maria/0000-0002-4034-3441; Foufopoulos, Johannes/0000-0002-8341-8271; Pafilis, Panayiotis/0000-0002-1832-4906; Meiri, Shai/0000-0003-3839-6330",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1005/12]; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust,"We thank Tamar Dayan and Daniel Simberloff for invaluable help with measuring carnivore specimens, and museum collection managers for priceless help during our stay at their collections.

Evaluating the effects of multiple heterogeneities on predictions may help in quantifying prediction uncertaintie. In this study we investigated the effects of three levels of environmental heterogeneity on landscape-scale predictions. In addition, we analyzed how seed dispersal and interspecies competition contributes to prediction uncertainty. We used a coupled ecosystem and landscape modeling approach to predict tree species' abundance at the landscape scale. We designed multiple-species and single-species scenarios, each with the three levels of environmental heterogeneity. Our results showed the importance of considering environmental heterogeneity when predictioning tree species' abundance. For early-successional species landscape-scale predictions differed significantly among heterogeneity levels. For late-successional species, prediction uncertainties based on different heterogeneity levels were comparatively low. Seed dispersal may be a source of variation in predictions, whereas interspecies competition may reduce such variation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The existence, boundedness, uniqueness of solutions of all the models are established. Mathematical analysis including stability and bifurcation are observed. Comparison among the results of these models allows the general conclusion that relevant behaviour of the eco-epidemic predator-prey system, including switching of stability, extinction, persistence and oscillations for any species depends on four important parameters viz, the rate of infection, predator interspecies competition and the attack rate on susceptible predator.

Whether such intraguild interactions can also occur between adult females of one species and adult males of another, is not known. Herein, we report on intraguild interactions between adults of the two sexes in cross-pairing experiments involving three related phytoseiid species (Neoseiulus paspalivorus, N. baraki and N. neobaraki) that are potential candidates for controlling the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis, a serious pest of coconut palms in tropical countries. For comparative reasons, the experiments were repeated with larvae instead of males, and with only males or only females of two different species together. In the presence of an ample supply of prey, females of N. neobaraki never fed on individuals of their own species, yet appeared to be very aggressive against males, as well as larvae of the other two phytoseiid species. They also fed on females of N. paspalivorus, but rarely on females of N. baraki. Males of N. neobaraki did not suffer mortality when together with females of either of the two other phytoseiid species. Males of N. baraki did not suffer predation from females of N. paspalivorus, but males of N. paspalivorus suffered some mortality (15 %) from N. baraki females. Larvae of each of the three species were vulnerable to intraguild predation by heterospecific adult females, except for N. neobaraki larvae when together with N. baraki females. The absence or presence of intraguild predation is largely explained by the size ratios of the individuals that were put together: large individuals feed on smaller ones, but never the reverse. For each sex, size declines in the following order: N. neobaraki > N. baraki > N. paspalivorus. Moreover, for each species, females are larger than males and males are larger than larvae. Strikingly, however, females did not kill males and larvae of their own species. We propose that niche competition between related phytoseiid species is not only determined by intraguild predation on heterospecific larvae, but also by imposing great mortality on males from the intraguild prey because phytoseiid females being pseudo-arrhenotokous require insemination to produce offspring of both sexes.","[Sourassou, Nazer Famah; Hanna, Rachid; Negloh, Koffi] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin; [Sourassou, Nazer Famah; Negloh, Koffi; Breeuwer, Johannes A.

The intrinsic size-structure of fish provides the necessary prerequisites to test whether the above mechanisms are general features of species interactions in fish communities where IGP is common. We first experimentally tested whether Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) were more efficient as a cannibal than as an interspecific predator on the prey fish ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) and whether ninespine stickleback were a more efficient competitor on the shared zooplankton prey than its predator, Arctic char. Secondly, we performed a literature survey to evaluate if piscivores in general are more efficient as cannibals than as interspecific predators and whether piscivores are inferior competitors on shared resources compared to their prey fish species. Both controlled pool experiments and outdoor pond experiments showed that char imposed a higher mortality on YOY char than on ninespine sticklebacks, suggesting that piscivorous char is a more efficient cannibal than interspecific predator. Estimates of size dependent attack rates on zooplankton further showed a consistently higher attack rate of ninespine sticklebacks compared to similar sized char on zooplankton, suggesting that ninespine stickleback is a more efficient competitor than char on zooplankton resources. The literature survey showed that piscivorous top consumers generally selected conspecifics over interspecific prey, and that prey species are competitively superior compared to juvenile piscivorous species in the zooplankton niche. We suggest that the observed selectivity for cannibal prey over interspecific prey and the competitive advantage of prey species over juvenile piscivores are common features in fish communities and that the observed selectivity for cannibalism over interspecific prey has the potential to mediate coexistence in size structured intraguild predation systems.","[Bystrom, Par; Ask, Per; Andersson, Jens; Persson, Lennart] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden.",par.bystrom@emg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,Swedish Reseach Council FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Research Council VrSwedish Research Council,"Financial support was provided by the Swedish Reseach Council FORMAS, to Par Bystrom and the Swedish Research Council Vr to Lennart Persson.

However, little is known about how changing environmental conditions and anthropogenic pollution can affect aquatic communities in combination. We investigated the influence of short warming periods on the response of a zooplankton community to the insecticide esfenvalerate at a range of environmentally realistic concentrations (0.03, 0.3 and 3gL1) in 55 outdoor pond microcosms. Warming periods increased the cumulative water temperature, but did not exceed the maximum temperature measured under ambient conditions. Under warming conditions alone the abundance of some zooplankton taxa increased selectively compared to ambient conditions. This resulted in a shift in the community composition that had not recovered by the end of the experiment, 8weeks after the last warming period. Regarding the pesticide exposure, short-term effects of esfenvalerate on the community structure and the sensitive taxa Daphnia spp. did not differ between the two temperature regimes. In contrast, long-term effects of esfenvalerate on Daphnia spp., a taxon that did not benefit from elevated temperatures, were observed twice as long under warming than under ambient conditions. This resulted in long-term effects on Daphnia spp. until 4months after contamination at 3gL1 esfenvalerate. Under both temperature regimes, we identified strength of interspecific competition as the mechanism determining the time until recovery. However, enhanced interspecific competition under warming conditions was prolonged and explained the delayed recovery of Daphnia spp. from esfenvalerate. These results show that, for realistic prediction of the combined effects of changing environmental factors and toxicants on sensitive taxa, the impacts of stressors on the biotic interactions within the community need to be considered.","[Knillmann, Saskia; Stampfli, Nathalie C.; Beketov, Mikhail A.; Liess, Matthias] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Knillmann, Saskia] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Anal, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Stampfli, Nathalie C.] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Noskov, Yury A.] ISEA, Inst Systemat & Ecol Anim, Novosibirsk 630091, Russia","Knillmann, S (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",saskia.knillmann@ufz.de,"Noskov, Yury A./E-3889-2014; Liess, Matthias/A-8582-2009","Noskov, Yury A./0000-0001-8752-3979; Liess, Matthias/0000-0002-3321-8909",Helmholtz Association of German Research CentresHelmholtz Association [HRJRG-025]; Russian Fund of Fundamental Research (RFBR) [07-04-92280-SIG_a]; Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through the Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),"The study was supported by the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres (project ECOLINK, HRJRG-025), by the Russian Fund of Fundamental Research (RFBR No. 07-04-92280-SIG_a), and by the Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through the Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE).

We found no evidence for a negative interspecific density dependence in individual performance in either Arctic char or brown trout. In contrast, a negative intraspecific density dependence was present, especially in Arctic char. Furthermore, large brown trout condition showed a positive response to encounter rate with Arctic char (related to the density of small Arctic char). The most parsimonious interaction module to explain the Arctic char - brown trout interaction patterns in the studied system does therefore not need to include interspecific competition.

In subdivided populations, the impact of these mutations depends on the strength of selection as well as the softness of selection, that is, the extent to which fitness is governed by local rather than global competition. It is widely appreciated that the intensity and type of competition will affect selection on deleterious mutations but most empirical work has focused solely on the effects of competition on selection strength. However, competition has rarely been studied in the context of selection softness even though competition is at the conceptual root of soft selection. All other things being equal, theory predicts that inter- and intraspecific competitions have opposing effects on the softness of selection. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we estimated the strength and softness of selection in a baseline competitive environment as well as two additional competitive environments characterized by either additional intra- or interspecific competitors. We found that competitive environment had little effect on the average strength of selection. While the softness of selection was affected by the type of competition, the direction of change varied across tests of different genes, contrary to expectation. Although the hard/soft selection paradigm implicitly assumes that all individuals are equally sensitive to the local competitive environment, we found this not to be the case. Wild-type individuals were more sensitive to changes in the genetic quality of their local competitors than mutant individuals.","[Ho, E. K. H.; Agrawal, A.

For both species, toxicant sensitivity increased with the population biomass of the respective species before exposure, which is explained by intraspecific competition. Several weeks after exposure to the highest treatment concentration of 1 mu g/L, the slight differences in sensitivity between the two species were amplified to contrasting long-term effects due to interspecific competition: high interspecific competition impaired the recovery of Daphnia. Subsequently, Culex larvae profited from the slow recovery of Daphnia and showed an increased success of emergence. We conclude that, in natural systems where competition is present, such competitive processes might prolong the recovery of the community structure. Hence, natural communities might be disturbed for a longer period by toxic exposure than predicted from single-species tests alone. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

I examined the effects of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), an omnivorous fish, on the reproductive success of the red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena), an avian gape-limited predator, along a fish size gradient created by stocking distinct age-cohorts in seminatural ponds. Young-of-the-year (0+) carp were an essential food source for young grebes. Only adult birds were able to consume 1-year-old (1+) fish, while 2-year-old (2+) fish attained a size refuge from grebes. Amphibian larvae were the principal alternative prey to fish, followed by macroinvertebrates, but the abundance of both dramatically decreased along the carp size gradient. Fledging success was 2.8 times greater in ponds with 0+ versus 1+ carp; in ponds with 1+ carp, chicks received on average 2.6-3 times less prey biomass from their parents, and over 1/3 of broods suffered total failure. Breeding birds avoided settling on 2+ ponds. These results show that changes in prey fish size structure can account for shifts from positive trophic effects on the avian predator to a negative impact on the predator's alternative resources. However, competition did not fully explain the decrease in grebe food resources in the presence of large fish, as carp and grebes overlapped little in diet. In experimental cages, 1+ carp totally eliminated young larvae of amphibians palatable to fish. In field conditions, breeding adults of palatable taxa avoided ponds with 1+ and older carp. Non-trophic interactions such as habitat selection by amphibians or macroinvertebrates to avoid large fish may provide an indirect mechanism strengthening the adverse bottom-up effects of fish on birds.","Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland","Kloskowski, J (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, Akad 19, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland.",januszkl@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,"Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421","State Committee for Scientific ResearchPolish State Committee for Scientific Research [KBN 6 PO4F06620, 3 PO4F03623]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [MNiSW 2 P04G05030]","Thanks to J.

Non-consumptive predator effects are an important driver in predator-prey interactions. While indirect effects of predation risk shape interspecific species interactions, e.g. in fuelling trophic cascades, knowledge about non-consumptive predator effects on intraspecific interactions among intimidated prey is scarce. 2. In laboratory experiments, we tested whether predation by male and female green crabs (Carcinus maenas) is stronger on small than on larger specimens of the periwinkle Littorina littorea, an important herbivore species in intertidal habitats of the temperate zone. Moreover, we asked whether size-specific differences in predation-induced mortality reflect as a stronger effect of predation risk (caused by nearby consuming crabs) on the foraging behaviour of more threatened periwinkles and ultimately on the recruitment success of the brown seaweed Fucus serratus. Furthermore, predator activity and prey abundance was measured in the field and the efficacy of predation risk on the survival of seaweed recruits was assessed in three field experiments with two different set-ups (open plots and crab exclosures). 3. Male crabs consumed smaller periwinkles more often than larger conspecifics, while females refused periwinkles as food. In summer, 80-90% of periwinkles in the field attained a size at which crab predation was minimal in laboratory assays. The observed up to 15-fold decrease in the consumption of seaweed recruits by periwinkles in the presence of nearby consuming crabs in laboratory assays was, however, independent of the size of periwinkles. Predation risk effects from the laboratory were only confirmed in field experiments using crab exclosures but not with open plots, suggesting an artefact due to trespassing by wild crabs in the open plot set-up. 4. Synthesis. Predation risk may not change intraspecific competition for food in L. littorea. Yet, risk effects on foraging behaviour of periwinkles that experience a low threat of real predation indicate that non-consumptive predator effects may affect prey population dynamics more strongly than consumptive predator effects. Thus predation risk effects may be indirectly beneficial for the survival of basal species like perennial seaweeds, as experimental evidence from field and laboratory experiments indicates.","[Molis, Markus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Funct Ecol, Marine Stn, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany; [Preuss, Inken] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainable Sci, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Firmenich, Annika] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Dept Marine Biol, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Ellrich, Julius] Univ Marburg, Dept Morphol & Evolut Anim, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Molis, M (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Funct Ecol, Marine Stn, Kurpromenade 201, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany.",markus.molis@awi.de,,"Ellrich, Julius/0000-0003-0884-3726",,,,49,15,15,2,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

We predicted the distributions of 8 civet and mongoose species within Southeast Asia using ecological niche modeling, determined their habitat/elevation niche preferences, examined the interspecific differences in these 2 niche parameters, and investigated possible factors that could have affected these distribution and niche patterns. We found a tendency for each civet and mongoose species to separate spatially from related species on geographical, habitat, and elevation gradients, and that 3 pairs of civet and mongoose species showed similar distribution patterns and habitat/elevation preferences. The large Indian civet (Viverra zibetha) and crab-eating mongoose (Herpestes urva) have similar distributions throughout mainland Southeast Asia, are found over a broad range of elevations, and occur primarily in evergreen forest. The large-spotted civet (Viverra megaspila) occurs in lowland areas across northern Southeast Asia and is found most frequently in deciduous forest (and less frequently in evergreen forest). The Malay civet (Viverra tangalunga) and short-tailed mongoose (Herpestes brachyurus) both occur south of the Thai-Malaysian border in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines and are found primarily in lowlands and evergreen forest. The small Indian civet (Viverricula indica) and Javan mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) are found on mainland Southeast Asia and parts of Indonesia, occur mainly at lower elevations, and appear to have no preference for forest type. The collared mongoose (Herpestes semitorquatus) is found on Borneo (and possibly Sumatra) and might occur more frequently at higher elevations and in disturbed evergreen forests. Interspecific competition, biogeography, and human interference are discussed as possible factors to explain these distribution and niche patterns.","[Jennings, Andrew P.; Veron, Geraldine] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat & Evolut, UMR MNHN CNRS 7205, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Jennings, AP (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat & Evolut, UMR MNHN CNRS 7205, CP 51,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",smallcarnivores@yahoo.com,"Veron, Geraldine/P-8163-2019","Veron, Geraldine/0000-0003-4247-3976","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle/French Ministry of ResearchMinistry of Research, FranceCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","We are very grateful to the following researchers who provided unpublished records, and we thank their institutions and sponsors for allowing us to use their data: M.

Invasive insect generalist predators (IIGP) have widespread impacts on invaded communities because they consume both herbivores and other predators. Also, they often reach higher densities than and displace similar native species. Reflecting the complexity of their ecological roles, a wide variety of mechanisms might contribute to invasive success by IIGP. These species often drive resources to lower levels than do natives, leading to intense resource competition and sometimes competitive exclusion of other predators. The broader range of resources used by many IIGP can heighten their competitive advantage, particularly when IIGP exploit modified habitats. In either case, IIGP improve herbivore suppression by depressing prey densities below pre-invasion levels. Coexistence among native and invasive generalists is fostered when species differ substantially in their niche requirements. In this case, a larger proportion of the total prey population is subject to attack post- than pre-invasion, which strengthens prey suppression. On the other hand, some IIGP feed heavily on other predators, at times leading to a weakening of prey suppression. Future research should continue to explore the roles of competition and niche partitioning on larger spatial scales, and in both the native and invasive ranges of IIGP. Additionally, combining data from empirical studies with theory might be an effective way to predict the spread and community impacts of IIGP invasions.","[Crowder, David W.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Crowder, DW (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, POB 646382, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",dcrowder@wsu.edu,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102","National Research Initiative of the United States Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2004-01215]","We thank S.

But conspicuous signals are also open to exploitation by eavesdropping predators and should also pose a threat to other sympatric prey species. In western Finland, sibling voles Microtus rossiameridionalis and field voles M. agrestis compete for food and space, and both species rely upon scent marks for intraspecific communication. Both vole species are prey to a range of terrestrial scent hunting predators such as least weasels, however, the competitively superior sibling voles are taken preferentially. We tested in large out-door enclosures whether field voles eavesdrop on the signals of its competitor, and whether they behave as though this eavesdropping carries a risk of predation. We presented field voles with scent marks from unknown conspecifics and sibling voles and measured their visitation, activity and scent marking behaviours at these scents under high (weasel present) and low (weasel absent) predation risk. Field voles readily visited both field and sibling vole scents under both high and low predation risk; however their activity at sibling vole scent marks declined significantly under increased predation risk. In contrast, predation risk did not affect field voles' activity at conspecific scents. Thus, field voles were compelled to maintain eavesdropping on heterospecific scents under an increased risk of predation, however they compensated for this additional risk by reducing their activity at these risky scents. Scent marking rates declined significantly under high predation risk. Our results therefore reveal a hidden complexity in the use of social signals within multi-species assemblages that is clearly sensitive to the potential for increased predation risk. The predation risks of interspecific eavesdropping demonstrated here represents a significant generalisation of the concept of associational susceptibility.","[Hughes, Nelika K.] N Head Sanctuary, Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Sydney, NSW 2095, Australia; [Hughes, Nelika K.; Banks, Peter B.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Hughes, NK (corresponding author), N Head Sanctuary, Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Sydney, NSW 2095, Australia.",nelika@unsw.edu.au,,"Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495","Finnish Government (Centre for International Mobility, Ministry of Education, Finland CIMO)","We wish to thank H.

The three species occur naturally along a water-level gradient in the Sanjiang Plain, the largest freshwater marsh in China. Both intraspecific and interspecific competition were measured using a target-neighbor design, which subjected the three species to different intensities of inter- and intra-specific competition. Biomass accumulation and NEI differences among water levels and competition treatments suggested that intra- and inter-specific competition was strongest at 0 cm inundation. In contrast, neighboring plants stimulated the growth of C. lasiocarpa and D. angustifolia at the 40 cm water level. These results indicate that the strength of intra- and inter-specific competition decreases and the strength of facilitation increases with increasing water levels.

Focusing on red and arctic fox in tundra with cyclic populations of rodents as key prey, we develop a model to predict how population dynamics of a dominant and versatile predator (red fox) impacted long-term growth rate of a subdominant and less versatile predator (arctic fox). We compare three realistic scenarios of red fox performance: (1) a numerical response scenario where red fox acted as a resident rodent specialist exhibiting population cycles lagging one year after the rodent cycle, (2) an aggregative response scenario where red fox shifted between tundra and a nearby ecosystem (i.e. boreal forest) so as to track rodent peaks in tundra without delay, and (3) a constant subsidy scenario in which the red fox population was stabilized at the same mean density as in the other two scenarios. For all three scenarios it is assumed that the arctic fox responded numerically as a rodent specialist and that the mechanisms of competition is of a interference type for space, in which the arctic fox is excluded from the most resource rich patches in tundra. Arctic fox is impacted most by the constant subsidy scenario and least by the numerical response scenario. The differential effects of the scenarios stemmed from cyclic phase-dependent sensitivity to competition mediated by changes in temporal mean and variance of available prey to the subdominant predator. A general implication from our result is that external resource subsidies (prey or habitats), monopolized by the dominant competitor, can significantly reduce the likelihood for co-existence within the predator guild.

The degree of competition symmetry ( competition hierarchies) between species determines coexistence, exclusion, or niche differentiation. Intraspeci. c competition, however, is an important component in dictating levels of symmetry/ asymmetry between species and should be accounted for when attempting to understand interspeci. c evolutionary or ecological outcomes. Some social parasites compete for access to a common host and, thus, adhere to both parasite - host and predator - prey coevolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here I examine tripartite evolutionary dynamics with respect to intraspeci. c competition of two sympatric slave- making social parasites in the family of ants that conduct `` brood raids'' on a shared host species and use the captured brood as a functional work force. Slave- makers were challenged with either a conspeci. c or heterospeci. c parasite and the impact on hosts and parasites was evaluated. Within- species raiding occurred frequently in the `` prudent'' slave- maker but was almost nonexistent in the `` virulent'' slave- maker. Although intraspeci. c raiding led to larger single prudent slave- maker colonies, the preservation of two independent virulent slavemaker colonies had an early and a more devastating effect on the host. However, in response to synchronized raiding phenologies, the prudent slave- maker emerged as the better direct competitor against the virulent slave- maker. Sex ratios were male biased in the virulent slavemaker colonies but numerically equal ( hence female biased) in prudent slave- maker colonies. Combined, these results suggest that interspeci. c parasite interactions have produced ecological shifts in both slave- makers and attenuated the coevolutionary arms race between the prudent slave- maker and the shared host in sympatric populations.","[Johnson, Christine A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Aronoff Lab, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Johnson, CA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk W & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",cjohnson1@amnh.org,,,,,,75,4,4,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

As a consequence, the spatial distributions of tree species will expand or contract at differential rates. In addition, human fragmentation of the landscape may limit effective seed dispersal, and inter-specific competition may limit the migration of climate-adapted species, restraining the rate of tree species migration. If the northward migration of tree species adapted to a warmer climate lags behind the rate of climatic change, overall growth rates and aboveground biomass of northern forests may be significantly reduced relative to their potential. We used a spatially interactive forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, that simulates tree species establishment, growth, mortality, succession, and disturbance. We simulated multiple scenarios of disturbance and climatic change across a similar to 15 000 km(2) forested landscape in northwestern Wisconsin, USA. These simulations were used to estimate changes in aboveground live biomass and the spatial distribution of 22 tree species. We observed a reduction in aboveground live biomass relative to the potential biomass for the combined soils and changing climate. We regressed the reduction of potential aboveground biomass against a measure of fragmentation, the initial biomass for 22 tree species, and soil water holding capacity calculated at 3 spatial resolutions. We also regressed the range expansion of 3 individual tree species that are expected to expand their distributions against the same variables. Species migration and range expansion were negatively correlated with fragmentation both in total and for 2 of the 3 species examined in detail. The initial abundances of some tree species were also significant predictors of species migration and range expansion and indicate significant competition between existing species assemblages and more southerly species that are expected to migrate north. In conclusion, the aboveground biomass of northern forests may be limited by interactions among climate change, interspecific competition, and fragmentation.","[Scheller, Robert M.; Mladenoff, David J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Scheller, RM (corresponding author), Conservat Biol Inst, 136 SW Washington,Suite 202, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",rmscheller@consbio.org,"Scheller, Robert M/B-3135-2009","Scheller, Robert M/0000-0002-7507-4499",,,,50,59,61,0,52,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,,,CLIM RES,Clim.

Previous studies have demonstrated the important role that predators play in this process but not the impact of competitors on selective predation. We use a combination of lab and field studies to evaluate the effect of the presence of adult competitor damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus moluccensis; family Pomacentridae) on the selective mortality of newly-arrived (settled) lemon damselfish (P. moluccensis) by resident predator fishes (Pseudochromis fuscus Pseudochromidae and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus Apogonidae). Lab trials consisted of mesocosm experiments in which the behaviour, mortality, and physiological condition (measured as lipid content) of surviving P. moluccensis settlers from each of three treatments: (1) predators absent, (2) predators present, and (3) predators and competitors present, were compared. The field study involved stocking newly settled P. moluccensis on natural bommies (patch reefs) which had either been subject to a partial removal of resident fish (predators and competitors) or left alone. Results indicated there was very strong condition-based selective mortality in both the lab and field trials. In both cases there was a strong positive relationship between mortality and the lipid content of surviving fish; implying low-condition fish were selectively removed. The mesocosm trials indicated that the strength of mortality as well as condition selectivity was higher when competitors were present than when they were absent. Behavioural observations in the mesocosm study suggest that attention by juvenile P. moluccensis to the movements and occasional chases of the competitors (especially D. aruanus) reduced their vigilance to the predators. These results suggest the important and interactive roles which condition of newly settled reef fish and interspecific competition can play in the outcomes of post-settlement predation.","[Figueira, Will F.; Booth, David J.; Gregson, Marcus A.] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environ Resource Management, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Figueira, WF (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environ Resource Management, Dept Environm Sci, POB 123,Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",william.figueira@uts.edu.au,"Figueira, Will/A-5163-2009","Figueira, Will/0000-0001-9472-8710; Booth, David/0000-0002-8256-1412",,,,57,15,15,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2008,156,1,,,,,215,226,,10.1007/s00442-008-0985-2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,289DD,WOS:000255034300021,18305966,,,,2021-09-21,

Their economic value leads to further accidental and deliberate releases and lack of control is contributing to range expansion in Australia, South America and Europe. Despite localised or regional concern, the scale and generality of detrimental impacts have not been widely recognised. We review the direct and indirect impacts on ecosystems and evidence for interspecific effects on native deer. In New Zealand, where large herbivores were previously absent, severe and novel impacts have been found in susceptible forests. Even where ecosystems contain native deer, invasion by taxonomically exotic deer species carries the risk of cascade effects on spatial plant dynamics and forest composition. In Patagonia, introduced deer have disrupted forest composition, whereas in Europe, ecosystem impacts of introduced species can differ from those of over-abundant native deer. Introduced Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) within a coniferous forestry landscape in eastern England differ from native European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in their distribution of herbivory among differing habitats, and provide much lower rates of endozoochorous seed dispersal. Frequent concern is expressed that introduced deer species may have detrimental effects on native deer and other ungulates, although potential epidemiological effects have not been investigated. Apparent competition, with introduced prey resulting in increased predation rates on native deer, may be occurring between South American huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and southern pudu (Pudu puda). Habitat and dietary overlap is often substantial among native and introduced ungulates, including deer, and exploitation competition is likely. Evidence includes spatial responses of native to non-native deer and negatively correlated changes in population abundance, but demographic mechanisms have not been demonstrated previously. In a coniferous forestry landscape in eastern England, substantial habitat and dietary overlap occurs between native roe deer and high-density introduced Chinese muntjac. This roe deer population has shown a reduction in body weight and fertility following establishment and increasing abundance of non-native Chinese muntjac, compatible with interspecific competition. European roe deer also appear susceptible to competition from larger grazing deer, including native red deer (Cervus elaphus) and introduced fallow (Dama dama). The widely introduced fallow deer may be a particularly effective competitor in sympatry with intermediate or concentrate feeders. There is need for further investigation of potential interactions of introduced and native deer species, and a wider recognition of the ecological impacts of introduced deer.","[Dolman, Paul M.; Waeber, Kristin] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Dolman, PM (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",p.dolman@uea.ac.uk,"Dolman, Paul M./AAK-3914-2020","Dolman, Paul/0000-0002-9340-2791",,,,145,67,68,3,227,CSIRO PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

Trade-offs between competitive ability and tolerance of abiotic stress are widespread in the literature. Thus, condition-specific competition may explain spatial variability in the success of some biological invaders and why, in environments where there is small-scale environmental variability, competitively inferior and superior species can coexist. 2. We tested the hypothesis that differences in abiotic stress alter the outcome of competitive interactions between the native Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata and exotic Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas by experimentally testing patterns of intra- and interspecific competition across a tidal elevation gradient of abiotic stress at three sites on the east coast of Australia. 3. At low and mid-intertidal heights, exotic C. gigas were able to rapidly overgrow and smother native S. glomerata, which grew at c. 60% of the exotic's rate. In high intertidal areas, where C. gigas displayed about 80% mortality but similar growth rates to S. glomerata, the native oyster was not affected by the presence of the exotic species. 4. Asymmetrical effects of the exotic species on the native could not be replicated by manipulating densities of conspecifics, confirming that effects at low and mid-intertidal heights were due to interspecific competition. 5. Our results suggest that the more rapid growth of C. gigas than S. glomerata comes at the cost of higher mortality under conditions of abiotic stress. Thus, although C. gigas may rapidly overgrow S. glomerata at low and mid tidal heights, the native oyster will not be competitively excluded by the exotic due to release from competition at high intertidal elevations. 6. The success of trade-offs in explaining spatial variation in the outcome of competitive interactions between C. gigas and S. glomerata strengthen the claim that these may be a useful tool in the quest to produce general predictive models of invasion success.","[Krassoi, Frederick R.; Brown, Kenneth R.; Bishop, Melanie J.; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Summerhayes, Stephen] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environm Resource Management, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Krassoi, Frederick R.; Brown, Kenneth R.; Bishop, Melanie J.; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Summerhayes, Stephen] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Krassoi, Frederick R.] Ecotox Serv Australasia Pty Ltd, Lane Cove, NSW 2066, Australia","Bishop, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environm Resource Management, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",Melanie.Bishop-1@uts.edu.au,"Kelaher, Brendan/P-3647-2017","Kelaher, Brendan/0000-0002-7505-4412; Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500",,,,53,78,80,2,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Three similar natural stands were selected for each of the three age classes considered (10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 years). Several competition indices based on density (number of trees, basal area and spacing factor), distance-dependent and independent size-ratio (Hegyi's and Lorimer's) and crown characteristics (crown volume, surface area and cross-sectional area) were examined for their effectiveness at predicting light transmittance and spruce growth. Transmittance was poorly predicted by competition indices, except for some indices based on density, with relationships generally explaining less than 40% of variation. Models of spruce growth (diameter and height increment) indicated variable performance among stands and indices tested. Competition accounted for up to 70% of growth variation, with some of the best results provided by Lorimer's, Hegyi's and crown volume indices. The addition of initial size as a second explanatory variable increased the predictive ability of growth models. Best models of spruce growth were selected and tested for differences between stands and age classes using indicator variable tests. Results indicated that data from stands within the 20-40 and 40-60 year age classes could be pooled across sites and across the two age classes into a single model. Data from the youngest age class (10-20 years) could not be pooled with those from the two older age classes. Results from this study indicate that relationships between growth and levels of competition may differ between young and older stands and suggest it may be necessary to parameterize growth models separately for different age classes when growth is predicted as a function of competition.

This overlooks the distinction between factors that limit distributions directly and factors that only influence organisms indirectly through covarying regulators or resources. Because elevation affects organisms indirectly, testing whether competition influences elevational ranges relies on the heretofore untested assumption that the relationship between elevation and factors influencing organisms directly is similar across geography. Focusing on Buarremon brush-finches (Aves: Emberizidae), a group in which distributions represent one of the best examples of the potential role of competition limiting elevational ranges, we show that when distributions are compared along axes of climatic variation, some patterns of elevational range variation do appear to be consistent with predictions of the hypothesis that release from competition underlies expanded elevational ranges in allopatry. However, other patterns of expanded elevational ranges in the absence of putative competitors are better explained by hypothesis related to species' autoecology and geographic variation in the environment. This latter finding cautions against using elevation uncritically as a dimension of ecological niches, and suggests that classical examples of interspecific competition may need re-evaluation.","Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; Univ Missouri, Int Ctr Trop Ecol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; Univ Los Andes, Dept Ciencias Biol, Bogota, Colombia","Cadena, CD (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",ccadena@uniandes.edu.co,"Cadena, Carlos Daniel/G-1313-2010; Loiselle, Bette/O-7106-2016","Loiselle, Bette/0000-0003-1434-4173",,,,50,38,38,2,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,AUG,2007,30,4,,,,,491,504,,10.1111/j.2007.0906-7590.05045.x,,,14,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,203HH,WOS:000248965200005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Eudiaptomus gracilis, which was not present in Italy before the 1980s, is becoming established in an increasing number of Northern Italian lakes, ultimately replacing the endemic E. padanus. Coexistence of the two species in Lake Candia lasted only 7 months, suggesting that species replacement was determined either by environmental changes or by strong competition. To assess whether the potential for interspecific competition existed and to identify species' traits which could explain the competitive superiority of E. gracilis, we examined field seasonal patterns, reproductive parameters and body size of the two species. E. padanus abundance was probably reduced by predation and parasitism, which favoured the displacement of the species shortly after invasion by E. gracilis. The temporarily underexploited niche provided an opportunity for the successful establishment of the invader. The reproductive patterns of the two species were found to be similar in most of their features, with the exception of a markedly larger clutch size and a smaller egg volume in the resident species. By contrast, the invader showed a higher adult:egg ratio and a lower death rate. Thus, despite the greater fecundity of E. padanus, the competitive success of the invader might be attributable to interspecific differences in developmental rates and/or juvenile mortality.","CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, I-28922 Verbania, Italy","Riccardi, N (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, Largo Tonolli 50, I-28922 Verbania, Italy.",n.riccardi@ise.cnr.it,"Riccardi, Nicoletta/G-1756-2013; Riccardi, Nicoletta Rita/ABD-3351-2020","Riccardi, Nicoletta/0000-0002-5297-3387; Riccardi, Nicoletta Rita/0000-0002-5297-3387",,,,58,13,14,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

We conducted two experiments to examine priority effects of the Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) on the Upland Chorus Frog (Pseudacris feyiarum). Wood frogs hatch before upland chorus frogs and could potentially function both as intraguild predators and competitors of the latter. In a laboratory experiment, R. sylvatica did not prey on P. feriarum hatchlings that were greater than 1-day old. In a mesocosm experiment in which food level and the density of X sylvatica hatchlings were manipulated, R. sylvatica engaged in stage-structured intraguild predation on egg masses of P. feriarum The number of P. feriarum embryos surviving to hatching was inversely related to the initial density of R. sylvatica, but was independent of food level. Growth rates of P.feriarum hatchlings were inversely related to P, sylvatica density, suggesting strong interspecific competition. Collectively, these results illustrate that the density of an intraguild predator may mediate the strength of both stage-specific intraguild predation and interspecific competition.

In a study of a dog agility competition among human/dog teams, men's pre-competition basal testosterone (T) levels were positively related to changes in dogs' cortisol levels from pre- to post-competition, but only among losing teams. Furthermore, pre-competition basal T in men on losing teams predicted more than half of the variance in dogs' cortisol change. This relationship was mediated through men's punitive and affiliative behaviors towards their dogs immediately after competition. Men's T change was also a significant predictor of dogs' change in cortisol such that men who experienced greater decreases in T after a loss were associated with dogs that experienced greater increases in cortisol. In winning teams, men's pre-competition T and T changes were unrelated to dogs' cortisol changes. These results are discussed in light of T as a proxy for dominance motivation as well as T's relation to stress across the species boundary. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Using a response surface design and a press manipulation of densities, we tested effects of competition within and between two species of coral reef fishes (Coryphopterus glaucofraneum and Gnatholepis thompsoni). By tracking individually tagged fishes, we showed that the per-capita effect of intraspecific competitors on individual growth was at least twice as great as the effect of interspecific competitors. Growth rate was better predicted by measures of density that incorporated body size, rather than numerical density, suggesting interference competition. Individuals of both species interacted aggressively with conspecifics at least twice as often as with heterospecifics. Individuals of both species also covered more area while foraging and spent less time in shelter when crowded than when at lower densities. In combination, these behaviours suggest that increased metabolic costs at high density contribute to competitive effects on growth. These competitive interactions occurred among adult fishes, so reduced growth may translate to reduced fecundity as well as reduced survival, and so contribute to population regulation.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93103 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Forrester, GE (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",gforrester@uri.edu,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",,,,40,48,48,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,632,640,,10.1007/s00442-006-0397-0,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,056OG,WOS:000238533400010,16518631,,,,2021-09-21,

We present a new method that takes advantage of special biogeographical conditions where habitat islands are embedded in a moderately dissimilar matrix. Small, isolated islands lack habitat specialists to varying degrees, allowing matrix species to occupy island habitat. We examined the relative influence of local vs. biogeographical factors on bird richness of habitat islands by evaluating three predictions each for three hypotheses (competitive exclusion, mass effect, species-area effects). Location Five naturally isolated dry forest islands and eight extensive dry forest sites in Bolivia. Methods Linear and multiple regressions were calculated between standardized species richness, the number of typical dry forest, humid forest and habitat generalist species vs. canopy height, elevation, precipitation, habitat area and distance from evergreen forest. The same analyses were performed at the guild level. Results Our data are consistent with one prediction under each hypothesis, thus partly supporting and partly rejecting all three hypotheses. Bird richness of dry forest islands was primarily determined by local ecosystem properties (vegetation complexity, productivity), with a minor effect of habitat area (inverse) and distance to evergreen forest. The number of dry forest specialists was influenced by habitat area and isolation from source habitats, with elevation and precipitation adding moderate explanatory power. The number of humid forest specialists was determined by precipitation, habitat area (inversely) and canopy height. These patterns were also evident at the guild level, demonstrating that the loss of dry forest species in a given guild was correlated with a gain of humid forest species in the same guild, rather than random species turnover. Main conclusions Total local species richness of semi-isolated habitat islands is determined primarily by local (niche availability) but also by regional (biogeographical) factors, exemplifying MacArthur's paradox. Small dry forest islands historically lost part of their habitat specialists. Vacant niches were filled by species from adjacent humid forest that are competitively excluded by habitat specialists from large dry forest areas, ideally until the community is saturated, although this pattern is to some degree modified by biogeographical factors. This 'semipermeable island' approach can be applied to other taxa and regions and is a promising, widely applicable tool for gaining new insights into the regulation of diversity.","Bird Life Int, Asociac Armonia, Santa Cruz, Bolivia; Inst Vogelforsch Vogelwarte Helgoland, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Herzog, SK (corresponding author), Bird Life Int, Asociac Armonia, Casilla 3566, Santa Cruz, Bolivia.",skherzog@compuserve.com,"Kessler, Michael/A-3605-2009",,,,,59,20,23,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

I conducted a series of observational and manipulative experiments to further elucidate the mechanisms of competition, as well as coexistence, in these two groups in an archipelago of small Bahamian islands. Diel baiting trials demonstrated a significant temporal difference in foraging activity between the land hermit crab, Coenobita clypeatus (Herbst), and ant Brachymyonex obscurior Forel, suggesting this is one mechanism underlying their coexistence on small oceanic islands. Reciprocal manipulative baiting experiments, in which one of a pair of species was removed from baits, documented that aggressive interspecific interactions underlie patterns of complementary distribution and temporal turnover at rich food resources. This was true for competition between hermit crabs and B. obscurior, and between B. obscurior and a second ant species, Dorymyrmex pyramicus Roger. Negative species associations at baits were found to be common throughout an archipelago of 69 small islands. A trade-off in exploitative and interference abilities may be a second mechanism allowing species coexistence on these small islands. Interspecific interactions such as competition and predation may occur commonly between ants and land crabs and have important consequences for the structure and function of tropical and subtropical insular ecosystems.

Interspecific competition is a potential mechanism of negative impact of invasive species, but few studies have conclusively demonstrated competition between native and nonindigenous taxa. In this study I used experimental manipulations to examine the competitive effects of the larvae of two widely introduced anurans, the cane toad, Bufo marinus, and the Cuban treefrog, Osteopilus septentrionalis, on the growth and development of the larvae of two native anurans (the southern toad, Bufo terrestris, and the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea). The presence of O. septentrionalis larvae consistently impacted growth and development of native larvae, resulting in reduced growth rates and delayed metamorphosis of both native species and smaller mass at metamorphosis of B. terrestris. Hyla cinerea larvae transformed at greater body masses when reared with the rapidly transforming nonindigenous species as a result of competitive release. The negative effects of O. septentrionalis on native larvae were generally significant whether native tadpoles were exposed to O. septentrionalis alone or in combination with B. marinus. In contrast, B. marinus tadpoles did not significantly impact the growth or development of either native species. Neither nonindigenous species significantly decreased the survivorship of native larvae, although a trend toward decreased survivorship was evident for H. cinerea. These results suggest that nonindigenous larval anurans may adversely impact native tadpole communities as a result of interspecific competition.

Interactions among predators may influence the total efficiency of a predator complex. The effect of intra- and interspecific interactions of the generalist predators Orthotylus marginalis (Heteroptera: Miridae) and Anthocoris nemorum (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) was investigated in a laboratory experiment. Outcomes of the interactions were determined by comparing predation rates on eggs and larvae of the blue willow beetle Phratora vulgatissima of single individuals with those of two individuals of the same or different species. 2. A non-additive, antagonistic effect on predation rates due to intraspecific interactions was found between individuals of A. nemorum. No such effect was found in O. marginalis. These results are as expected as a consequence of differences in behaviour of the two predator species: A. nemorum is a much more active and mobile predator than O. marginalis. 3. Contrary to expectation, interspecific interactions between A. nemorum and O. marginalis did not affect the total predation rate. 4. An observation from the field corroborated the results obtained in the laboratory study; there was no negative relationship between the densities of the two predator species, indicating that the two species do not interact negatively in the field at their natural densities. 5. It is concluded that the additive effect of multiple predator species is of potential value in biological control.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Bjorkman, C (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, POB 7044, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",christer.bjorkman@entom.slu.se,,,,,,22,13,13,1,21,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Most studies attempting to measure the extent of competition are based on predator-prey balance indices that are annual snapshots and do not account for seasonal changes. We sought to identify times during the year when intra- and interspecific exploitative competition for prey was most likely among dominant predators in a large reservoir of the south-eastern United States. The possibility of interspecific competition was measured by examining the seasonal extent of diet overlap based on samples of stomach contents. The likelihood or severity of this competition was indexed by how well predators met their energy needs. We found predators were realising less of their energy requirements during spring and autumn, and diet analyses showed predators overlapped substantially in their use of prey during those seasons. Thus, exploitative competition was most likely or severe during spring and autumn; furthermore, this competition had the potential to be interspecific as evidenced by resource overlap.","Mississippi Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Mississippi State, MS USA","Raborn, SW (corresponding author), Louisiana Coll, Dept Biol, Pineville, LA 71359 USA.",raborn@lacollege.edu,,,,,,59,24,25,0,14,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0906-6691,,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Observations were made during winter, when both species are nocturnal. The proportion of Atlantic salmon sheltering was significantly lower in the presence than in the absence of signal crayfish when the interspecific treatment (Atlantic salmon plus signal crayfish) effected a doubling in density compared to the intraspecific treatment (Atlantic salmon alone). The proportion of signal crayfish sheltering was independent of the presence of Atlantic salmon. When total density was constant, the proportion of Atlantic salmon sheltering was significantly higher in intraspecific (52.8%) than interspecific trials (27.3%). Atlantic salmon out of shelter during the day in winter are believed to be very vulnerable to predators and the capacity for fish to share shelters with one another is known to be very low. Therefore, competition from crayfish for winter shelters may lead to detrimental effects on Atlantic salmon populations.

I use a landscape simulation model to explore and analyze how interactions among various ecological processes affect patterns of mammalian species diversity according to body size. The model incorporates ecological realism by using mammalian allometric relationships with realistic values taken from field data. It uses energy as a common currency to model and compare how species of different sizes use their environment. Components of the model include landscape, habitat, patch, community, species, and population. Processes include continuous-time population growth, saturation effect, species-habitat matching, demographic stochasticity (local-scale), dispersal, and catastrophic stochasticity (landscape-scale). I simulated a 16-patch landscape, with each patch having a unique habitat, and a 10-species pool in which species differ only in body size. Summed over the landscape, a log-normal relationship between body size and species abundance emerges. Additionally, geographic range increases nonlinearly with the log of body size. These patterns are qualitatively consistent with patterns of mammalian species diversity observed in natural systems, suggesting that they can emerge from scaling of habitat use with body size. I also simulated a simple 4-patch landscape, with each patch having a unique habitat, and a 26-species pool to draw from in which species differ only in body size. The results show that interspecific competition by itself reduces species diversity in each habitat and in the entire landscape. Stochasticity depresses mean population sizes but opens opportunities for species to avoid competitive exclusion. It also allows different habitats to have different communities that are characterized by the consequences of which large species become locally extinct at random. Demographic and catastrophic stochasticities differ, however, in their characteristic effects on species diversity. These characteristic effects can be used as fingerprints to identify processes acting in nature. Dispersing individuals move between habitats and re-establish the local populations of their species. Overall, the model provides us with predictions of how process-interactions in heterogeneous landscape may affect species composition and community structure.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Ziv, Y (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",yziv@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,,"Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,63,1,1,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

We defined the terms fertilization fitness and relative fitness as the parameters of competitive ability of the gametes and attempted to use them in a study on the variation of the chromosome number in the progeny between Brassica napus and B. rapa. Fertilization fitness was defined as the ratio of the actual frequency of the gametes with a specific chromosome number to the theoretical frequency based on binomial distribution. Relative fitness was defined as the ratio of fertilization fitness of the gametes with a specific chromosome number to fertilization fitness of the gametes with n = 10. A resynthesized accession and a natural accession of B. napus were used in this experiment to produce sesquidiploids AAC-S and AAC-N, respectively. A comparative study on these two sesquidiploid populations was carried out to reveal differences in the pattern of variation in the chromosome number. Fitness analysis showed that gamete competition was conspicuous and closely related to the chromosome number. Gamete competition occurred predominantly during the embryo developmental stage. In both sesquidiploid populations, fertilization fitness decreased abruptly when the chromosome number varied in the range from n = 10 to n = 12 or in the range from n = 19 to n = 17. However, in the range from n = 13 to n = 16, the effect of the chromosome number on fertilization fitness was more pronounced in the AAC-N population than in the AAC-S one. The AAC-N population showed stronger tendency in keeping its gametes toward euploid number. Fertilization fitness and relative fitness was found to be efficient parameters for the study of variation of the chromosome number in interspecific hybridization. The use of the Relative fitness parameter may enable to predict the frequency of a specific chromosome number in interspecific progenies.","Ehime Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Plant Breeding, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908566, Japan","Kato, M (corresponding author), Ehime Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Plant Breeding, 3-5-7 Tarumi, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908566, Japan.",kato@agr.ehime-u.ac.jp,,,,,,19,26,32,0,11,JAPANESE SOC BREEDING,TOKYO,"UNIV TOKYO, GRADUATE SCHOOL AGRICULTURAL LIFE SCIENCES, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-8657, JAPAN",1344-7610,1347-3735,,BREEDING SCI,Breed.

Experiments in both the wild and laboratory may, further, investigate other factors than body size that may be relevant to competition, such as behaviour-related characteristics (e.g. web structure and biting speed) and ecological factors (e.g. different susceptibilities of the species to parasite or predator attack).

More significant correlations were found than expected by chance at most sites. Stable sites had more negative and positive associations than the unstable sites, although in most instances there were similar numbers of positive and negative correlations. The variance ratio test indicated an overall positive association when all taxa were considered. However, negative associations occurred between a significant number of taxa and were more common at stable sites. Although it remains to be seen whether the negative associations are a result of competition, it does seem biotic interactions are more common in the stable streams than in the flood prone ones as predicted by the harsh-benign hypothesis.","Massey Univ, Inst Nat Resources Ecol, Palmerston North, New Zealand","Death, RG (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Inst Nat Resources Ecol, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",,,,,,,24,2,2,0,7,SIR PUBLISHING,WELLINGTON,"PO BOX 399, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND",0028-8330,,,NEW ZEAL J MAR FRESH,N.

I examined the competitive ability of larval common frogs (Rana temporaria) and common toads (Bufo bufo) in a laboratory experiment by manipulating the number and size of Rana and the number of Bufo. 2. Bufo was the most active tadpole type, whereas small Rana was more active than large Rana. 3. Especially at high food availability, the growth rate of large Rana at metamorphosis was reduced in the presence of small Rana, whereas that of small Rana was not affected by larger conspecifics. 4. Both size classes of Rana were negatively affected by the presence of Bufo. Size at metamorphosis of Bufo was greater when large Rana was present. These results suggest that activity level is important in determining competitive ability. 5. To study competition in the field, tadpoles of Bufo were introduced to small rock-pools that did not support Bufo naturally, but were with or without Rana. 6. In the experimental pools, there were no interspecific effects on the growth rate of either species. However, the growth rate of Bufo was lower in the experimental pools than in pools inhabited naturally. Futher, survival of Bufo was low in small pools. Lower food availability or physical factors associated with small pools, rather than interspecific competition, may be the reason why Bufo avoids breeding in small rock-pools.","Univ Helsinki, Div Populat Biol, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Integrat Ecol Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Laurila, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Populat Biol, Norbyvagen 18 D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,60,31,35,0,21,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

In part, this is because competitive exclusion has not been convincingly demonstrated in open, natural systems. In addition, traditional theoretical models cannot predict the outcome of competitive Interactions in the presence of environmental variability. In this paper we document the limiting influence of strong interspecific competition on population dynamics and nestling mortality in a mixed population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and collared flycatchers (F. albicollis) in a narrow zone of sympatry. Whereas the former species was limited mainly by interspecific competition, the latter species was limited by the concerted influences of intraspecific competition and climate. The analysis suggests a march towards competitive exclusion of the pied flycatcher during warm periods. However, competitive exclusion is apparently prohibited on a local scale because intraspecific competition among individual collared flycatchers intensifies when they are forced to cope with severe environmental conditions, promoting the temporary and local presence of pied flycatchers.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Forestry Commiss, Dlouha Loucka 78386, Czech Republic","Saetre, GP (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Norbyvagen 18D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",glenn-peter.saetre@evolution.uu.se,,,,,,26,41,41,0,10,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Responses to a spring warming treatment were measured on five common herbaceous species grown in outdoor microcosms in Northern England. Although elevated temperature had a beneficial effect on canopy height and plant cover in monospecific cultures of all species, strongly divergent responses to warming occurred in mixtures. 2. We show that the effect of interspecific competition was to modify and amplify the vegetation response-to the warming treatment through effects on phenology and morphological development. 3. The observed responses between the species to warming are consistent with predicted differential responses linked to genome size. 4. We conclude that the mechanism of competitive interaction proposed by Boysen-Jensen (1929) coupled with the insights related to genome size provide a basis for explaining and predicting the role of interannual variation in temperature in determining year to year fluctuations in the relative abundance of species in productive perennial. herbaceous vegetation.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Sheffield, Unit Comparat Plant Ecol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Dunnett, NP (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Arts Tower,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,42,41,42,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

An experimental assessment of nest site preferences of cliff-nesting gulls,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Alaska; artificial nest site; cliff nesting; competitive exclusion; interspecific competition; kittiwake; Laridae; nest site preference; resource addition experiment; Rissa brevirostris; Rissa tridactyla,SEABIRDS; INFORMATION; KITTIWAKE; COLONY,"Red-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris) are colonially breeding seabirds that are endemic to the Bering Sea, where they are sympatric with the more widely distributed Black-legged Kittiwake (R. tridactyla). Moreover, these two species breed interspersed on cliffs and potentially compete for nest sites on St. George Island, Alaska, which is the largest of only four known breeding locations of the Red-legged Kittiwake. On St. George Island, nesting ledges used by Red-legged Kittiwakes are narrower than those of Black-legged Kittiwakes, are more often located beneath overhangs, and are concentrated on high-elevation cliffs. To determine whether the nesting distribution of Red-legged Kittiwakes on St. George Island is shaped by competitive displacement by larger bodied Black-legged Kittiwakes, 1 compared realized niches of the two species (determined by measuring physical characteristics of natural nest sites) with fundamental niches of the two species (determined by observing nest site preferences of kittiwakes on artificial nesting ledges that differed in width, overhang cover, and elevation). The displacement hypothesis predicted that interspecific overlap in physical characteristics of nest sites would be greater for artificial than for natural nesting ledges (fundamental niches would overlap to a greater degree than realized niches). In contrast, nest site preferences of kittiwakes on artificial ledges differed markedly between species and mirrored the characteristics of natural nest sites: Red-legged Kittiwakes preferred narrower ledges, Black-legged Kittiwakes preferred wider ledges, and both species preferred ledges located within high-density clusters of conspecifics. Thus, I rejected the competitive displacement hypothesis and concluded that interspecific competition does not currently shape the breeding distributions of kittiwakes on St. George Island. Although interspecific competition in the past may have shaped current nest site preferences of kittiwakes, the concordance of habitat preferences with interspecific differences in body size, clutch size, and nest size and structure indicate that Red-legged Kittiwakes are uniquely adapted to exploit small ledges.","Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA","Kildaw, SD (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",,,,,,,26,5,5,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1999,80,2,,,,,576,586,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0576:CDAEAO]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,174LK,WOS:000079036500021,,,,,2021-09-21,

Water-filled tree holes in a lowland forest in Panama harbour an assemblage of large predators consisting of the larvae of five common species of Odonata, the mosquito Toxorhynchites theobaldi, and tadpoles of Dendrobates auratus. Odonate females oviposit in both large and small tree holes. However, the three largest species emerge from larger tree holes, on average, than do the two smallest species. Can assembly rules explain this and other patterns of predator distribution? 2. Past experiments suggested that fast growth of the largest, but later-colonizing odonates enabled them to out-compete the smaller, slower-growing Mecistogaster in large holes. In small holes, however, the first predator, regardless of species, should presumably kill any later arrivals. Priority effects in small holes were tested for their consistency across predator species. Two alternative explanations for differential odonate survivorship were also tested: abiotic conditions and the effect of non-odonate predators. 3. Diurnal fluctuations in oxygen content, pH, and temperature within holes were as great as the variation found between large and small tree holes; abiotic conditions were poor predictors of species occupancy. 4. Exchanging the largest and smallest odonate species from their original holes did not affect survivorship, suggesting that the observed patterns of emergence are unlikely to result from differential tolerance to abiotic factors that were not measured. 5. When larger and smaller predators were paired in 400-ml pots and provided with alternative prey, typically only the larger predator survived, regardless of species. The exception was T. theobaldi, which was often killed by odonates and tadpoles smaller than itself. 6. Between May and July, the occurrence of Mecistogaster in large tree holes declined, before larvae could have emerged. Neither abiotic effects nor differential predation by non-odonates could explain this habitat-specific decrease in survivorship. This temporal pattern is most consistent with the previous conclusion that in large holes, Mecistogaster suffer intraguild predation from later-colonizing, but faster-growing Megaloprepus and aeshnids. Whereas Mecistogaster can pre-empt guild members from small tree holes, they cannot do so in large holes where predators with fast initial growth realize a competitive advantage.","Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Fincke, OM (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,37,63,69,0,19,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Here we explore an alternative method of control. We suggest that the abundance of an undesired plant species (here dandelions: Taraxacum officinale) may be controlled by modifying interspecific competition via changes in resource supply rates. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence. First, analyses of effects of different patterns of fertilization on plant-species abundances in the 140-yr-old Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted, England, show that Taraxacum abundances were highly dependent on potassium fertilization and on liming, but not on addition of other nutrients. Potassium fertilization led to a 17- to 20-fold increase in Taraxacum abundances in the classical Park Grass data, and to a 4- to 7-fold increase in the modern data. Liming led to a 2- to 3-fold increase for classical data and to a 3- to 4-fold increase for modern data. Second, in a greenhouse study in Minnesota, Taraxacum had a higher requirement for potassium and had its biomass more limited by potassium than any of five common grass species of Park Grass. This suggests that Taraxacum may be a poorer competitor for potassium than these grasses, but this mechanism has not yet been tested. Third, in a series of Minnesota lawns that had not received fertilizer or herbicides, both Taraxacum density and abundance were significantly positively correlated with its tissue potassium levels. This demonstration that desired and weedy plant species can differ in their resource requirements suggests that adjustments in resource supply rates may determine the outcome of interspecific competition, allowing desired species to competitively control weedy species. In particular, for soils with low potassium levels, the use of potassium-free lawn fertilizer is predicted to decrease Taraxacum because of competition from grasses like Festuca rubra.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Rothamsted Expt Stn, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England","Tilman, D (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol, 1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",,,"Johnston, Atholl/0000-0001-5787-2270",,,,33,76,77,0,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Rana temporaria breeds earlier in spring than B. bufo, but the latter species was numerically superior in all ponds at the study site. We measured survival and growth rates of larvae in three duplicate sets of natural ponds. In one set we removed B. bufo, spawn, leaving only R. temporaria; in a second set we removed R. temporaria spawn, leaving only B. bufo; and in a third set we left both together. The third set also contained substantial numbers of predatory fish (Perca fluviatilis and Gasterosteus aculeatus). Rana temporaria survival was lower than that of B. bufo in all ponds, on average by sixfold. Rana temporaria fared better on its own than in the mixed-species ponds, but lower survival in the latter ponds was probably due to fish predation rather than to interspecific competition. By contrast, B. bufo survival was sevenfold higher in mixed-species compared with single-species ponds, probably because they are distasteful to fish and thus benefited indirectly from fish-predation of invertebrates. Prototheca richarsi, a mediator of interference competition between anuran larvae under laboratory conditions, was present in some of the dune ponds but was not correlated with larval growth inhibition. Taken together the evidence implicated predation of larvae and intraspecific competition, rather than interspecific competition, as the dominant structuring forces in this community.","Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Bardsley, L (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,29,19,20,0,10,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,OCT,1998,21,5,,,,,449,456,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00435.x,,,8,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,134AV,WOS:000076721000001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Their effectiveness as control agents may be impacted by intraguild predation.

Adult female predators were given prey as mixed populations of phytoseiid larvae and larvae of a more preferred species, the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, at different densities and ratios. Typhlodromus pyri, more of a generalist predator, showed higher rates of predation and cannibalism on phytoseiid immatures at most prey densities and ratios. Manly preference indices indicated that T. pyri switched to feed on phytoseiid larvae at higher prey levels and ratios of T. urticae than M. occidentalis. This greater ability to use phytoseiid larvae as prey may help stabilize T. pyri populations when more preferred prey is unavailable.

Various combinations of growth regulators were compared. Embryos rapidly formed at high frequency in each media tested, even without growth regulators. Histological analysis showed repeated divisions of cells of the upper epidermis showing densely stained cytoplasm. After 6 days of culture organized structures were observed on the leaf surface. Further, these clusters of cells increased their volume by division; embryoids developed asynchronously in large numbers over small areas of the leaf. Somatic embryos appeared variously malformed and sometimes they proliferated to produce additional accessory embryos from one morphogenetic unit. Nevertheless, phenotypically normal plants were easily recovered from somatic embryos. The direct embryogenesis observed in each media tested indicates that the somatic cells of EMB-1 plants are already predetermined as embryogenic cells. These cells do not lose their wide competence in the differentiation process and retain the full morphogenetic potential typical of the zygotic cell. This assumption is strengthened by the ability of leaf explants to differentiate embryos without signals of hormonal nature.","DIPARTIMENTO BIOL PIANTE AGR, SEZ GENET, I-56124 PISA, ITALY; CNR, IST MUTAGENESI & DIFFERENZIAMENTO, I-56124 PISA, ITALY",,,,,,,,33,22,24,1,7,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0168-9452,1873-2259,,PLANT SCI,Plant Sci.,MAR 1,1996,114,2,,,,,205,214,,10.1016/0168-9452(95)04320-9,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,TY581,WOS:A1996TY58100009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Both snails responded only to the amount of food available on a patch, and, except at very low food levels, the likelihood that a snail would remain to feed was identical for the two species across microalgal densities.

Density-dependent effects on microalgal standing stock differed between the snails; at low grazer densities, T. aureotincta depressed food levels to a comparatively greater degree, whereas at high grazer densities, T. eiseni had a relatively greater effect. The relative growth performance of the snails differed as a function of available food: T. aureotincta had superior body growth at high resource densities, while T. eiseni grew comparatively better at low microalgal densities. Differences in effects on and growth responses to microalgae arose from dissimilar foraging characteristics of the snails. Compared with T. eiseni, T. aureotincta moved more rapidly while feeding, harvested twice as great an area per unit time, but was unable to crop microalgae as close to rock surfaces. While T. eiseni grazed a smaller area per unit time, it removed relatively more microalgae per area grazed. These differing suites of foraging attributes may represent a trade-off to harvest food at different densities: cropping closer to the substratum (area intensive grazing) yields more food when microalgae are scarce, but precludes grazing a larger area per unit time (area extensive grazing) through fast movement, which provides a greater food intake when microalgae are abundant. If an area extensive (moves faster)-intensive (digs deeper) trade-off is a common feature of benthic grazer systems, knowledge of this aspect could provide great predictive insight into the patterns and causes of density dependence arising from exploitation.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, INST MARINE SCI,COASTAL RES CTR, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA","Schmitt, RJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,104,49,50,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1996,77,2,,,,,408,425,,10.2307/2265618,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TY198,WOS:A1996TY19800006,,,,,2021-09-21,

The population growth of B. rotundiformis, B. plicatilis, and D. celebensis in mixed-species cultures were significantly suppressed when compared with those in single-species cultures. This indicates that the competition for the limited amount of food suppressed mutual population growth. The population growth of B. rotundiformis was not affected by the co-existence of T. japonicus, however. T. japonicus grew better when cultured with B. rotundiformis. Contrary, the existence of B. rotundiformis did not affect the growth of Euplotes sp, but Euplotes sp. population interferes the growth of B, rotundiformis.

The three-species, the three two-species combinations, and one-species controls were used. The predictions from island biogeography and metapopulation theory that extinctions rates increase with decreasing patch size and increasing number of species present were also examined. Analyses of reproductive indices and population dynamics indicated that the species used similar resources and that interspecific competition operated during substantial parts of each year. The number of eggs per adult female (adult female egg ratio; E(A)) in the three species were positively related to each other, and concordant changes in the E(A)-values of pairs of species between subsequent sampling dates were significantly more common than discordant changes. There were negative relationships between E(A)-values and total Daphnia density in each species, but these were strong in one species only. Relative extinction rates (extinctions-population-1.year-1) were higher in experiments with three species initially present than in two-species experiments. No extinctions occurred in the one-species controls. Relative extinction rates were also higher in smaller than in larger volumes. The large species D. magna went extinct fewer times than the two smaller species D. pulex and D. longispina. In two-species experiments in volumes larger than 4 l, coexistence of both species after four years was the rule, in spite of interspecific competition. This is not consistent with the classical view that interspecific competition should lead to either niche differentiation or competitive exclusion, but it supports the view that environmental variability may promote coexistence of competing species. Although interspecific competition by itself may not be the most important factor determining the distribution of rockpool Daphnia, the finding that extinctions were most common in three-species experiments still indicates that competition may limit species richness in the rockpool system.","UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ZOOL, S-75122 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",,,,,,,,98,34,36,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1993,67,3,,,,,451,464,,10.2307/3545357,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LN449,WOS:A1993LN44900007,,,,,2021-09-21,

I studied the role of competition in structuring the benthic community of hard substrates in a coldwater stream dominated by mobile insects that grazed upon periphyton and by relatively sessile filter-feeding insects. I expected competitive interactions among periphyton grazers to be significant and chronic because the community was not subject to frequent flow-related disturbances and grazer densities were high despite consistently low periphyton availability. Laboratory and field experiments were performed to determine: (1) the potential for, and relative strengths of, competition within and between two common, widely distributed grazers, the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior and the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus, (2) the role of Glossosoma in affecting the organization of the community, and (3) the mechanisms of competition. Strong intraspecific effects on Baetis survivorship were observed in laboratory enclosures within the range of natural densities, but interspecific effects were not detected. Glossosoma survivorship was not affected by competition with itself or with Baetis. Individuals of both species experienced significant intra- and interspecific effects on growth, but the relative strengths of these effects differed between species. The effects of Baetis on Glossosoma growth were stronger than the effects of Glossosoma on itself. In contrast, Baetis growth was much less affected by the presence of Glossosoma than by conspecifics. Both species strongly depressed periphyton abundance, indicating that observed competitive effects resulted, in part, from exploitation. Exclusion of Glossosoma from habitats in the field resulted in a marked increase in periphyton biomass throughout a 10-mo study in which the movements of other taxa were not restricted. Most periphyton grazers responded to this increase in resource availability with increased densities in the Glossosoma exclusion treatment relative to the control. The size distributions of several chironomid grazers suggested that larval growth rates were greater in the absence of Glossosoma than with Glossosoma present. The larvae of two relatively small-bodied filter-feeders (Simulium, Rheotanytarsus) responded positively to the removal of Glossosoma, but larger bodied species (Hydropsyche, Brachycentrus) were not affected. There was not strong evidence for seasonal variation in the intensity of competition. Effects of Glossosoma on filter-feeders appeared to result from a form of interference competition, but there was no evidence for the operation of interference among grazers. Glossosoma had no effect on the colonization of habitats by grazers, and the feeding rates of Baetis and Glossosoma were not affected by the presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics. Contrasting patterns in periphyton abundance between the laboratory and field experiments suggest that, when their movements are unrestricted, Baetis departs periphyton patches at higher food densities than does Glossosoma to search for food elsewhere. Thus, strong competitive effects of Baetis on Glossosoma in the laboratory experiments resulted, in part, from limited Baetis dispersal in the enclosures. Baetis and Glossosoma appear to exhibit trade-offs in feeding efficiency and the costs of exploiting food patches that should help to ensure their coexistence on a spatially variable food resource. Results of this study suggest that the structure of benthic communities in coldwater streams composed largely of mobile taxa may often be strongly influenced by Glossosoma. A similar role has been observed for sessile, territorial grazers in other systems. Glossosoma's dominance does not result from aggressive behavior, but from physiological, behavioral, and life cycle attributes that allow it to regulate periphyton biomass throughout the year.",,"KOHLER, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, 607 E PEABODY DR, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,,,,,,89,139,144,0,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

We examined interactions among a pair of early season grasshopper species (May-June; Arphia conspersa and Pardalophora apiculata) and a late season pair (July-August; Melanoplus femur-rubrum and Melanoplus bivittatus). Each grasshopper species was placed in cages by itself and with another grasshopper species. Grasshoppers generally survived at higher density in fertilized cages and they reduced plant abundance relative to empty cages, suggesting that grasshoppers may be food limited at these densities. In unfertilized plots, early season grasshoppers preferred grasses (Schizachyrium scoparium and Poa pratensis) and favored the growth of forbs (especially Solidago spp.). However, late in summer, Melanoplus spp. preferred Solidago spp. and favored the growth of grasses. The pattern of grasshopper survivorship and plant reduction within these experimental environments provide preliminary support for some of the predictions of resource competition theory. Grasshoppers exhibited interspecific competition only if they significantly reduced plant biomass. If two species competed, a grasshopper species was eliminated only if the superior competitor, when living by itself, could reduce plant biomass to a significantly lower level than the inferior competitor. Competitors persisted only if they did not differ in their ability to reduce plant biomass or reduced the abundance of different plant species.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA","RITCHIE, ME (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,40,48,48,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1992,89,4,,,,,524,532,,10.1007/BF00317159,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL791,WOS:A1992HL79100011,28311883,,,,2021-09-21,

In a replicated pond experiment, B. calamita tadpoles treated with the faeces of R. temporaria tadpoles displayed growth inhibition. A unicellular organism was identified in tadpole faeces which is known to cause inhibition in laboratory cultures. (2) Overlap in the development periods of R. temporaria and B. calamita tadpoles is reduced when R. temporaria metamorphose before B. calamita. This subjects natterjacks to a steadily declining level of interspecific competition. Under such conditions, B. calamita tadpoles may be released from an initial period of growth inhibition, and metamorphose the same size as controls raised without R. temporaria. However, even with growth retrieval, time to metamorphosis and mortality are both increased relative to controls. (3) The effects of large R. temporaria tadpoles on B. calamita were not significantly different from those of small R. temporaria tadpoles. Large R. temporaria tadpoles metamorphosed before small R. temporaria tadpoles, thereby providing a longer retrieval period for inhibited B. calamita tadpoles. (4) When the breeding periods of R. temporaria and B. calamita are well-separated, temporal niche overlap between the tadpole stages will be reduced and growth inhibition ameliorated. However, such conditions may still prolong B. calamita development. Tadpoles may therefore be exposed to aquatic predators for longer, and incur a greater risk of dying as a result of pond desiccation.","NE SURREY COLL TECHNOL,SCH APPL PHYSIOL,EWELL KT17 TDS,SURREY,ENGLAND; UNIV SUSSEX,SCH BIOL,BRIGHTON BN1 9QG,E SUSSEX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,35,48,49,0,17,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Kleptoparasitism (the stealing of procured food) by dominant scavengers can have negative effects on populations and behaviors of apex predators. We captured 7 pumas (Puma concolor) and fitted them with GPS collars to investigate potential kill sites (n = 352), some of which we monitored with camera traps (n = 58). We analyzed whether observed kleptoparasitism by American black bears (Ursus americanus) affected puma energetics and foraging behavior. We found that black bears were the most frequent scavenger of puma kills (72.4%), and we documented bears scavenging puma kills during every month. The top model for bear detection of puma kills included prey size, temperature, and canopy cover, with bears more likely to scavenge from adult black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) carcasses in warmer temperatures and under dense canopy cover. When black bear scavenging occurred, pumas spent 22% less time at their kill and incurred energetic losses. In response, pumas shortened their inter-kill intervals by 1.3 days thus increasing their kill rates. Our results demonstrate how a dominant scavenger directly mediates the foraging behavior of an apex predator. These results suggest that community interactions do not necessarily start at the top in top-down systems, and the effects of predators on prey populations can only be understood within their respective ecological communities.

Parasitoids and predators can provide sustainable long-term solutions to pest problems (biological control), reducing the need for expensive and sometimes polluting pesticide applications. When several species of beneficial insects are present, their pest control actions may be additive, synergistic, or disruptive. One form of disruptive interaction between parasitoids and predators is direct interspecific contest for access to individual pests (the resource to be exploited). This study evaluated behavioural interactions between brood-guarding wasps, Goniozus nephantidis (Muesebeck) (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), which are known to engage in intra-specific contests, and a predatory bug, Cardiastethus exiguus (Poppius) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), which attack the same pest species, Opisina arenosella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae), a major pest in coconut production systems. Dyadic parasitoid-predator and predator-predator contests were staged to determine the factors that influence the behaviours within, and outcomes of, such interactions. Parasitoids were aggressive towards predators, sometimes killing them, but predators were not aggressive towards parasitoids. Biting and stinging only occurred when there was a host larva present. In the absence of the parasitoid that had oviposited onto a host, predators often consumed the parasitoid's eggs. Egg consumption sometimes occurred when the parasitoid was present. Intra-specific competition between pairs of predators was also evaluated: adults were aggressive towards each other, but interactions were not fatal. Biting was more common when there was no prey larva present. When a larva was present, predators were observed feeding simultaneously. We conclude that direct parasitoid-predator interactions are likely to influence pest population dynamics, possibly reducing the overall suppression of O. arenosella by its natural enemies.","[Velasco-Hernandez, Maria C.; Hardy, Ian C.

As such, they serve an important ecosystem role linking upper and lower trophic levels and transferring energy between the benthic and pelagic realms. Our objective is to explore what limits the southern distribution of polar cod in Pacific and Atlantic sectors by examining time series of survey and oceanographic data. We quantify the variability in the southern extent of the polar cod distribution in the Bering and Labrador Seas, and determine mechanisms (bottom temperature and potential predators: Pacific codGadus macrocephalus, Atlantic codGadus morhua, and Greenland halibutReinhardtius hippoglossoidesand competitors: capelinMallotus villosusand walleye pollockGadus chalcogrammus) driving the variability. When temperatures were lower, polar cod occupied larger areas and had higher abundances in both regions, suggesting that as temperatures increase with climate warming the range of polar cod is likely to contract. Temperature had a much larger impact on polar cod abundance than competitor abundance and predator abundance, especially in the eastern Bering Sea. However, when we included data from northern and eastern Bering Sea in 2010 and 2017, polar cod were less likely to occur in warmer waters when either Pacific cod or walleye pollock were present. Northward range expansions of subarctic Pacific cod and walleye pollock may further restrict polar cod distributions.","[Marsh, Jennifer M.; Mueter, Franz J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 17101 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA","Marsh, JM (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 17101 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.",jennifer.m.marsh@gmail.com,,"Marsh, Jennifer/0000-0003-0996-9558",,,,77,7,7,5,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4060,1432-2056,,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,AUG,2020,43,8,,,SI,,995,1014,,10.1007/s00300-019-02575-4,,,20,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NB4CB,WOS:000560461200005,,,,,2021-09-21,

The human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans can be found organized in biofilms, a complex community composed of an extracellular matrix which confers protection against predation. The aim of this study was to evaluate and characterize antagonistic interactions between two cohabiting microorganisms: C. neoformans and the bacteria Serratia marcescens. The interaction of S. marcescens with C. neoformans expressed a negative effect on biofilm formation, polysaccharide capsule, production of urease, and melanization of the yeast. These findings evidence that competition in mixed communities can result in dominance by one species, with direct impact on the physiological modulation of virulence determinants. Such an approach is key for understating the response of communities to the presence of competitors and, ultimately, rationally designing communities to prevent and treat certain diseases.

Individual tree growth can be controlled by many factors, such as competition, climate, tree size and age. However, information about contributions of different factors to tree growth is still limited in this region. In order to address this uncertainty, tree rings of two dominant tree species, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss), were sampled from boreal mixed forest stands distributed across Alberta, Canada. Tree growth rates over different time intervals (10 years interval, 1998-2007; 20 years interval, 1988-2007; 30 years interval, 1978-2007) were calculated to study the effects of different factors (tree size, competition, climate, and age) on tree growth. Results indicated that tree growth of two species were both primarily affected by competition or tree size, while climatic indices showed less effects on tree growth. Growth of trembling aspen was significantly affected by inter- and intraspecific competition, while growth of white spruce was primarily influenced by tree size, followed by competition. Positive relationship was found between growth of white spruce and competition index of coniferous group, suggesting an intraspecific mutualism mechanism within coniferous group. Our results further suggested that competition driven succession was the primary process of forest composition shift in the western Canadian boreal mixed forest. Although drought stress increased tree mortality, decline of stem density under climate change released competition stress of surviving trees, which in turn sustained growth of surviving trees. Therefore, climatic indices showed fewer effects on growth of dominant tree species compared to other factors in our study. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical evidence concerning the contribution of different traits to niche differentiation and the ability to supress and tolerate competitors is very limited, particularly when considering belowground interactions. We grew 26 temperate grassland species along a density gradient of interspecific competitors to determine which belowground traits a) explain species' ability to suppress and tolerate neighbours and b) contribute to niche differentiation, such that species with dissimilar trait values experience reduced competition. We found that having larger root systems with extensive horizontal spread and lower root tissue density enabled efficient suppression of neighbours but did not significantly contribute to the ability to tolerate competition. Species with deeper root systems, lower specific root length and less branched roots were better at tolerating competition, but these traits did not significantly affect the ability to suppress neighbours. None of the measured traits contributed significantly to niche differentiation, either individually or in combination. This study provides little support for belowground traits contributing to species co-existence through niche differentiation. Instead, different sets of weakly correlated traits enable plants to either suppress or tolerate their competitors.","[Semchenko, Marina] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Lepik, Anu; Abakumova, Maria; Zobel, Kristjan] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia","Semchenko, M (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",marina.semchenko@manchester.ac.uk,,,"Estonian Science foundation [9332, 9269]; Institutional Research Funding of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT 20-31]; University of Manchester","We thank Aime Randveer, Sirgi Saar and Siim-Kaarel Sepp for help in planting, harvesting and measuring plants.

We investigated the recent successful invasion of the Pacific crabs Hemigrapsus takanoi and H. sanguineus to the southeastern North Sea coast with respect to their recruitment patterns, as well as interactions of juvenile with sub-adult individuals among the Pacific crabs and with native shore crabs Carcinus maenas. A field survey of juvenile native and introduced crab abundances (carapace width 1.4-10 mm) was conducted in the northern Wadden Sea, spanning 24 months from 2014 to 2016. The survey revealed different seasonal recruitment patterns of native C maenas and both introduced Hemigrapsus species. Native shore crabs showed a single recruitment peak from June to July, while Hemigrapsus spp. mainly recruited from August to early September, but recruits occurred in low densities throughout the winter until the end of the following spring season. Field experiments on the effects of larger crabs on the recruitment intensity showed that recruitment of H. takanoi was enhanced by the presence of larger congeners, but remained unaffected by larger C. maenas. Recruitment of juvenile C maenas, by contrast, was reduced by the presence of larger Hemigrapsus spp. Additional laboratory experiments revealed high rates of cannibalism on newly recruited C. maenas by subadult conspecifics as well as strong predation by larger Hemigrapsus spp. In contrast, newly recruited Hemigrapsus spp. had a much lower risk of being preyed on by subadult conspecifics and native shore crabs. Our results suggest that the timing of recruitment in combination with low intraspecific competition and reduced predation pressure by native shore crabs are crucial for the rapid and ongoing establishment of Hemigrapsus spp. in the Wadden Sea.

Here, we have built an integrated model which is able to link climate, physical features of territory and inter-specific competition at aiming to simulate potential distribution of eight plant species (Quercus cerris, Quercus pubescens, Fraxinus ornus, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer campestre, Acer obtusatum, Ostrya carpinifolia and Carpinus betulus) either at actual climate conditions or future ones (B1 and A2 climatic scenarios; IPCC, 2013). The integrated model is based on innovative methodological approach, which combined statistical tools (Principal Component Analyses and Discretization) and two-dimensional grid based model to consider the interactive effects of climate and inter-specific competition on plant species distribution. The study case was given by geographical spatialisation of the I.V. for each considered plant species, in the overall Italian territory. The simulations had always occurred by taking into consideration both expected climate change and inter-specific competition under highly complexity terrains. The results substantially differed from other studies that used only environmental predictors for estimating potential plant distributions. Variations in the I.V. distribution seemed to be due to variations of relative competitive abilities of plants, reducing both local extinctions of some species in Southern and Central Italy and migration toward North. Furthermore, our simulations suggested that under pressure of climate change the competitive ability of plant species will be likely affected by reducing the effects of competitive asymmetry.

Surprisingly little is known about the outcome of such competitive scenarios, and we therefore aimed at elucidating interactions between the trematodes Himasthla elongata and Renicola roscovita coinfecting the periwinkle first intermediate host. The results show that the success of Himasthla colonies (rediae) in terms of cercarial emission is unaffected by Renicola competition (sporocysts), whereas deteriating host condition decreases fitness. Furthermore, double infection has no bearing on Himasthla's colony size but elevated the proportion of non-reproductive rediae that play a decisive role in colony defence. Opposite, the development of the Renicola colony (size/maturity), and in turn fitness, is markedly reduced in presence of Himasthla, whereas the nutritional state of the host appears less important. Hence, the intramolluscan competition between Himasthla and Renicola is asymmetrical, Himasthla being the superior competitor. Himasthla not only adjusts its virulence according to the hosts immediate nutritional state, it also nullifies the negative impact of a heterospecific competitor on own fitness. The latter is argued to follow in part from direct predation on the competitor, for which purpose more defensive non-reproductive rediae are strategically produced.","[Mouritsen, Kim N.; Andersen, Cecillie] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Aquat Biol, Ole Worms Alle 1, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Mouritsen, KN (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Aquat Biol, Ole Worms Alle 1, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",kim.mouritsen@bios.au.dk,"Mouritsen, Kim N/K-6569-2013","Mouritsen, Kim N/0000-0003-3564-8328",,,,39,5,5,1,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,SEP,2017,144,11,,,,,1530,1542,,10.1017/S003118201700107X,,,13,Parasitology,Parasitology,FE5TA,WOS:000408272800013,28653596,,,,2021-09-21,

Interspecific competition, predation, increased disturbance, organochlorine poisoning and food shortages were suggested as main reasons for the overall decrease. Here we contribute to a better understanding of population declines by comparing foraging movements of satellite tracked adult gulls in three geographical areas of Finland (West, South, and East) that differ in their population trends. Our analysis examines potential differences and preferences in the feeding site behaviour of adult gulls. Our comparison of the three geographical areas showed that nLBBGs preferred feeding at fur farms in West Finland, waste dumps in South Finland, and lakes and fields in East Finland. We found individual gulls of this purportedly generalist species to be highly specialised in their foraging behaviour, particularly those that might be associated with their survival probabilities. We hypothesise that differences in foraging behaviour and food availability during the breeding season are partially responsible for differences in demographic trends between populations. Specifically, we identify potential local conservation problems such as shooting in birds visiting fur farms. Our data suggest that the effective conservation and management of endangered nLBBGs could be aided by simple actions in the breeding areas in addition to better protection throughout the annual movement cycle.

To further understand interactions between invasive and native species in situ, competitive interactions between native logperch (Percina caprodes) and invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were examined using submerged enclosures in the Duluth-Superior Harbour. Experiments were conducted on rocky or sandy substrate throughout the spring and summer months. Trials consisted of single fish, paired conspecifics or round goby/logperch pairs with weight change determined after 28 days. The round gobies were able to outcompete and/or negatively affect logperch on rocky substrates as a direct result of round goby/logperch interactions, as logperch fared well when round gobies were excluded from the enclosures. Although there is evidence that round gobies exclude logperch from rocky substrates, the logperch population remains close to pre-invasion levels in the predominantly soft-bottomed harbour. The continued coexistence of the logperch with the round goby is attributed to the vastly greater area of soft-bottom vs. rocky substrate in the harbour, with the round gobies in the soft bottom younger and smaller than those in the rocky substrate. Recent evidence suggests that the round goby population is declining on the soft substrates indicating that the two populations will continue to coexist in the harbour.","[Leino, Jared R.; Mensinger, Allen F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, 1035 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA","Mensinger, AF (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, 1035 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",amensing@d.umn.edu,,,Minnesota's Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund,"Support for the project was provided by the Minnesota Legislature 2010, Chapter 362, Section 2, Subdivision 06d titled 'Bioacoustic Traps for Management of Round Goby' with provided funds from Minnesota's Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund.",,23,6,6,6,87,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

However, root exudation has also been shown to stimulate nutrient immobilization, thereby reducing plant growth. Both mechanisms depend on carbon exudation, but generate two opposite soil nutrient dynamics. We suggest here that this difference might arise from temporal variation in soil carbon inputs. We examined how continuous and pulsed carbon inputs affect the performance of wheat (Triticum aestivum), a fast-growing annual, while competing with sage (Salvia officinalis), a slow-growing perennial. We manipulated the temporal mode of soil carbon inputs under different soil organic matter (SOM) and nitrogen availabilities. Carbon treatment included the following two carbon input modes: (i) Continuous: a daily release of minute amounts of glucose, and (ii) Pulsed: once every 3 days, a short release of high amounts of glucose. The two carbon input modes differed only in the temporal dynamic of glucose, but not in total amount of glucose added. We predicted that pulsed carbon inputs should result in nutrient enrichment, creating favorable conditions for the wheat plants. Carbon addition caused a reduction in the sage total biomass, while increasing the total wheat biomass. In SOM-poor soil without nitrogen and in SOM-rich soil with nitrogen, wheat root allocation was higher under continuous than under pulsed carbon input. Such an allocation shift is a common response of plants to reduced nutrient availability. We thus suggest that the continuous carbon supply stimulated the proliferation of soil microorganisms, which in turn competed with the plants over available soil nutrients. The fact that bacterial abundance was at its peak under this carbon input mode support this assertion. Multivariate analyses indicated that besides the above described changes in plant biomasses and bacterial abundances, carbon supply led to an accumulation of organic matter, reduction in NO3 levels and increased levels of NH4 in the soil. The overall difference between the two carbon input modes resulted primarily from the lower total wheat biomass, and lower levels of NO3 and soil PH characterizing pots submitted to carbon pulses, compared to those subjected to continuous carbon supply. Carbon supply, in general, and carbon input mode, in particular, can lead to belowground chain reactions cascading up to affect plant performance.","[Livne-Luzon, Stav; Ovadia, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shemesh, Hagai] Tel Hai Acad Coll, Dept Environm Sci, IL-12208 Upper Galilee, Israel; [Gilor, Osnat] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Environm Hydrol & Microbiol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel","Livne-Luzon, S (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel.",stavl@post.bgu.ac.il,"Shemesh, Hagay/L-7793-2017","Shemesh, Hagay/0000-0002-4840-048X; Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947; Livne- Luzon, Stav/0000-0002-4579-1067",Sol Leshin UCLA-BGU Program [8721991],This study was partially supported by the Sol Leshin UCLA-BGU Program (8721991).,,51,3,3,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

The large size is genetically determined, as ascertained by clutch exchange experiments between island and mainland nests. We conclude that the increased size of P. ater in places where it is geographically isolated from its larger congeners is the result of evolutionary adaptation, due ultimately to relaxed interspecific competition. On the islands, P. ater has evolved into a medium-sized generalist, with selection pressures likely governed by the following causal relationships. When competitors are lacking, P. ater takes over the foraging space of the absentees. The enlarged food base allows higher population densities, which intensifies intraspecific interference competition. This, in turn, selects for increased body size. When P. ater coexists with its larger congeners, it occupies peripheral foraging sites in trees, which requires excellent manoeuvrability and energy-expensive locomotion modes. Reduction of body size increases locomotor capacity for mechanical and aerodynamic reasons and lowers energy consumption, so small size is favoured in sympatry. But in geographic isolation, P. ater exploits the tree periphery less and the inner tree regions more, and it also adopts the easier locomotion modes of the absent species. Therefore, selection for manoeuvrability and a small body size is relaxed. The new selection regime shifts the balance between opposing selection forces towards a larger body size. We were able to test 11 alternative hypotheses and available evidence conclusively eliminates them all. As a result, here, evolution could be predicted regarding both direction and amount of change.","[Norberg, R. Ake; Norberg, Ulla M.

In Ambrosia artemisiifolia, both of these tactics could theoretically increase its long-term fitness. However, their relative importance has never been tested. We studied the germination pattern of A.artemisiifolia seeds in various competitive environments by experimentally modifying the life stage (seed, seedling, adult), density (low, high) and also the identity (intraspecific and 3 interspecific competitors) of neighbours in controlled conditions. When facing competition of seeds and seedlings at high densities or of particular identity, A.artemisiifolia accelerated its germination. In contrast, A.artemisiifolia followed a competition avoidance strategy in the presence of established adult heterospecific neighbours by delaying germination and reducing the germination fraction through induction of secondary dormancy. By testing the seedlings' performance in the same competition situations as those of seeds, we showed that the germination responses were beneficial in the case of heterospecific, but not of conspecific neighbours.","[Fenesi, A.; Albert, A-J; Ruprecht, E.] Univ Babes Bolyai, Hungarian Dept Biol & Ecol, Cluj Napoca 400015, Romania; [Albert, A-J] Univ Debrecen, Dept Ecol, H-4012 Debrecen, Hungary","Fenesi, A (corresponding author), Univ Babes Bolyai, Republ St 42, Cluj Napoca 400015, Romania.",fenesi.annamaria@gmail.com,"Ruprecht, Eszter/ABC-9454-2020; Annamaria, Fenesi/AAY-9385-2020","Ruprecht, Eszter/0000-0003-0122-6282; ",,,,39,16,17,0,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0043-1737,1365-3180,,WEED RES,Weed Res.,FEB,2014,54,1,,,,,58,69,,10.1111/wre.12048,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,284JM,WOS:000329312400006,,,,,2021-09-21,

In the case of scavenging birds, which use soaring flight to locate and exploit ephemeral resources, the cost and speed of movement vary with meteorological factors. These factors are likely to modify the nature of interspecific interactions, as well as individual movement capacity, although the former are less well understood. We used aeronautical models to examine how soaring performance varies with weather within a guild of scavenging birds and the consequences this has for access to a common resource. Birds could be divided broadly into those with low wing loading that are more competitive in conditions with weak updraughts and low winds (black vultures and caracaras), and those with high wing loading that are well adapted for soaring in strong updraughts and moderate to high winds (Andean condors). Spatial trends in meteorological factors seem to confine scavengers with high wing loading to the mountains where they out-compete other birds; a trend that is borne out in worldwide distributions of the largest species. However, model predictions and carcass observations suggest that the competitive ability of these and other birds varies with meteorological conditions in areas where distributions overlap. This challenges the view that scavenging guilds are structured by fixed patterns of dominance and suggests that competitive ability varies across spatial and temporal scales, which may ultimately be a mechanism promoting diversity among aerial scavengers.","[Shepard, Emily L.

We assessed community structure changes in a natural mixed dinoflagellate bloom incubated at three pCO(2) levels (230, 433, and 765 ppm) in a short-term experiment (2 weeks). The four dominant species were then isolated from each treatment into clonal cultures, and maintained at all three pCO(2) levels for approximately 1 year. Periodically (4, 8, and 12 months), these pCO(2)-conditioned clones were recombined into artificial communities, and allowed to compete at their conditioning pCO(2) level or at higher and lower levels. The dominant species in these artificial communities of CO2-conditioned clones differed from those in the original short-term experiment, but individual species relative abundance trends across pCO(2) treatments were often similar. Specific growth rates showed no strong evidence for fitness increases attributable to conditioning pCO(2) level. Although pCO(2) significantly structured our experimental communities, conditioning time and biotic interactions like mixotrophy also had major roles in determining competitive outcomes. New methods of carrying out extended mixed species experiments are needed to accurately predict future long-term phytoplankton community responses to changing pCO(2).","[Tatters, Avery O.; Schnetzer, Astrid; Fu, Feixue; Lie, Alle Y.

However, little is known about how these alterations affect the recovery of sensitive taxa. We exposed zooplankton communities to esfenvalerate (0.03, 0.3, and 3 mu g/L) in outdoor microcosms and investigated the long-term effects on populations of Daphnia spp. To cover a broad and realistic range of environmental conditions, we established 96 microcosms with different treatments of shading and periodic harvesting. Populations of Daphnia spp. decreased in abundance for more than 8 weeks after contamination at 0.3 and 3 mu g/L esfenvalerate. The period required for recovery at 0.3 and 3 mu g/L was more than eight and three times longer, respectively, than the recovery period that was predicted on the basis of the life cycle of Daphnia spp. without considering the environmental context. We found that the recovery of sensitive Daphnia spp. populations depended on the initial pesticide survival and the related increase of less sensitive, competing taxa. We assert that this increase in the abundance of competing species, as well as sub-lethal effects of esfenvalerate, caused the unexpectedly prolonged effects of esfenvalerate on populations of Daphnia spp. We conclude that assessing biotic interactions is essential to understand and hence predict the effects and recovery from toxicant stress in communities.","[Knillmann, Saskia; Stampfli, Nathalie C.; Beketov, Mikhail A.; Liess, Matthias] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Knillmann, Saskia] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Anal, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Stampfli, Nathalie C.] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Noskov, Yury A.] ISEA, Inst Systemat & Ecol Anim, Novosibirsk 630091, Russia","Knillmann, S (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",saskia.knillmann@ufz.de,"Chaika, Anna/G-2827-2012; Liess, Matthias/A-8582-2009; Beketov, Mikhail A/E-1727-2011; Noskov, Yury A./E-3889-2014","Liess, Matthias/0000-0002-3321-8909; Noskov, Yury A./0000-0001-8752-3979",Helmholtz Association of German Research CentresHelmholtz Association [HRJRG-025]; Russian Fund of Fundamental Research (RFBR) [07-04-92280-SIG_a]; Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),"The study was supported by the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres (project ECOLINK, HRJRG-025), by Russian Fund of Fundamental Research (RFBR No. 07-04-92280-SIG_a) and by the Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through the Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE).

Both of these species are now recovering their populations nationally. We compared the relative abundance and the behavior of mink in the 1990s and in the 2000s in an area of southern England where both otters and polecats were absent in the 1990s but reappeared in the intervening years. We found that mink were still abundant in the 2000s in the presence of otters and polecats, but that they appeared to have altered some aspects of their behavior. In accordance with previous studies, we found that mink consumed fewer fish in the presence of otters. We also found that mink were predominantly nocturnal in the 1990s (in the absence of competitors) but were predominantly diurnal in the 2000s (in the presence of competitors). We hypothesize that this temporal shift may be an avoidance mechanism allowing the coexistence of mink with the otter and the polecat, although we are unable to attribute the shift to one or the other species. We also found that mink in the presence of competitors weighed less but remained the same size, suggesting the possibility of a competitor-mediated decline in overall body condition. This is one of very few field studies demonstrating a complete temporal shift in apparent response to competitors. The implications of this study are that recovering otter populations may not lead to significant and long-term reductions in the number of invasive mink in the United Kingdom as has been suggested in the media, although we cannot exclude the possibility of a decline in mink in the longer-term.","[Harrington, Lauren A.; Harrington, Andrew L.; Yamaguchi, Nobuyuki; Thom, Michael D.; Ferreras, Pablo; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Oxford OX13 5QL, England; [Windham, Thomas R.] Univ Oxford Brasenose Coll, Oxford OX14 4AJ, England","Harrington, LA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Abingdon Rd, Oxford OX13 5QL, England.",lauren.harrington@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Thom, Michael/C-8518-2014; Ferreras, Pablo/A-6017-2009; Yamaguchi, Nobuyuki/AAN-4884-2020","Thom, Michael/0000-0002-9985-0157; Ferreras, Pablo/0000-0002-1116-6706; Yamaguchi, Nobuyuki/0000-0002-6492-6588",Environment Agency and the People's Trust for Endangered Species (1995-1998); Esmee Fairbairn Foundation (2003-2007),"We thank the numerous volunteers who helped with this project and the landowners who allowed access to their land.

In this study we investigated and compared breeding and foraging parameters of White Terns between the northwest and southeast (May-September) monsoons to assess whether interspecific competition affected foraging activity and explained the timing of breeding of White Terns. Goatfish (Mullidae) dominated the diet of White Terns and no significant differences were found in diet composition between the northwest and southeast monsoons. Similar diets and patterns of food provisioning of White Terns between the two monsoons do not support the hypothesis of strong exploitation competition during the southeast monsoon. On the other hand, foraging behaviour and frequency of capture attempts of White Terns differed between the two monsoons. The percentages of multi-species flocks with White Terns and of large flocks with more than 25 noddies Anous and terns Onychoprion were significantly higher during the southeast monsoon. Moreover, capture attempt frequencies of White Terns foraging in multi-species flocks were lower than those of solitary individuals, and both solitary and flocking White Terns had significantly lower capture attempt frequencies during the southeast monsoon in comparison with the northwest monsoon. These results suggest that interference competition depresses foraging activity of flock-foraging White Terns, particularly during the southeast monsoon, which could potentially explain why White Terns breed preferentially during the northwest monsoon. However, and despite avoiding interference competition, White Terns nesting during the northwest monsoon did not show higher breeding success than those nesting during the southeast monsoon. Other hypotheses that might explain the preference of White Terns for breeding during the northwest monsoon, such as avoidance of agonistic interactions with Lesser Noddies Anous tenuirostris at nest sites, should also be investigated.","[Catry, Teresa; Ramos, Jaime A.] Univ Coimbra, Inst Marine Res IMAR, Dept Zool, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal; [Sampson, Emma] ICS, Aride Isl Nat Reserve, Victoria, Seychelles; [Le Corre, Matthieu] Univ Reunion, Lab ECOMAR, F-97715 St Denis 9, France","Catry, T (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Inst Marine Res IMAR, Dept Zool, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal.",teresa_catry@yahoo.com,"Ramos, Jaime A./B-6616-2018; Catry, Teresa/A-8082-2012; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/E-8060-2011","Ramos, Jaime A./0000-0002-9533-987X; Catry, Teresa/0000-0003-4047-9995; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/0000-0002-7207-3474",Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BD/16706/2004]; Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association [MASMA/AG/2004/04]; Agence National pour la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [2005-011],"We would like to acknowledge Island Conservation Society (ICS) for permission to work on Aride Island.

Within snail hosts, antagonistic interactions among trematode species, such as competition and predation, can influence parasite abundance and diversity. In the present study we examined the strength of antagonistic interactions between 2 marine trematodes (Maritrema novaezealandensis and Philophthalmus sp.) in naturally infected Zeacumantus subcarinatus snails. We found approximately the same number of snails harbouring both species as would be expected by chance given the prevalence of each. However, snails infected with only M. novaezealandensis and snails with M. novaezealandensis and Philophthalmus sp. co-occurring were smaller than snails harbouring only Philophthalmus sp. In addition, the number of Philophthalmus sp. rediae was not affected by the presence of M. novaezealandensis sporocysts and the within-host clonal diversity of M. novaezealandensis was not influenced by the presence of Philophthalmus sp. Our results suggest that antagonistic interactions may not be a major force influencing the evolution of these trematodes and that characteristics such as host size and parasite infection longevity are shaping their abundance and population dynamics.","[Keeney, D.

The question of what mechanisms drive the displacement of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni by the often introduced G pulex is presented as a case study Patterns of displacement are well documented throughout Europe, but the speed and direction of displacement between these species can be varied. From early studies proposing interspecific competition as causal in these patterns, I review research progress to date. I show there has been no evidence for interspecific competition operating, other than the field patterns themselves, a somewhat tautological argument. Rather, the increased recognition of behavioural attributes with respect to the cannibalistic and predatory nature of these species gave rise to a series of studies unravelling the processes driving field patterns. Both species engage in 'intraguild predation' (IGP), with moulting females particularly vulnerable to predation by congeneric males. G pulex is more able both to engage in and avoid this interaction with G duebeni. However, several factors mediate the strength and asymmetry of this IGP, some biotic (e.g. parasitism) and others abiotic (e.g. water chemistry). Further, a number of alternative hypotheses that may account for the displacement (hybridization; parasite transmission) have been tested and rejected. While interspecific competition has been modelled mathematically and found to be a weak interaction relative to IGP, mechanisms of competition between these Gammarus species remain largely untested empirically. Since IGP may be finely balanced in some circumstances, I conclude that the challenge to detect interspecific competition remains and we require assessment of its role, if any, in the interaction between these species. Appreciation of behavioural attributes and their mediation should allow us to more fully understand, and perhaps predict, species introductions and resultant distributions.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland","Dick, JTA (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Med Biol, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",j.dick@qub.ac.uk,,,,,,67,45,46,1,33,UNIV AMSTERDAM,AMSTERDAM,"LIBRARY FACULTY BIOLOGY, PLANTAGE MIDDENLAAN 45, AMSTERDAM, 1018 DC, NETHERLANDS",1383-4517,,,CONTRIB ZOOL,Contrib.

Fish distributions in Barnabus Trough, off the east coast of Kodiak Island, were assessed using acoustic data collected with a calibrated echosounder during August September 2002 and 2004. Trawl hauls were conducted to determine the species composition of the fish making up the acoustic backscatter. Oceanographic data were collected from moorings, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probes, trawl-mounted microbathythermographs (MBT) and expendable bathythermographs (XBT). National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data were used to assess area winds, and information on regional transport was derived from current meters deployed on moorings north and south of Kodiak Island. The distribution of water-mass properties and fish during 2002 showed variability at the temporal scale of weeks. Juvenile pollock (age-1 and age-2) were initially most abundant in warm, low-salinity water on the inner shelf, whereas capelin were distributed primarily on the outer shelf in cool, high-salinity waters. During a 2-week period juvenile pollock distribution expanded with the offshore expansion of warm, low-salinity water, and capelin abundance in outer-shelf waters decreased. We hypothesize that wind-driven pulsing of the ACC resulted in increased transport of warm, low-salinity water through the study area. In 2004, warm, low-salinity water characterized the inner shelf and cool, high-salinity water was found on the outer shelf. However, the distribution of water-mass properties did not show the weekly scale variability observed in 2002. Area winds were consistently toward the southwest during 2004, such that we would not expect to see the wind-driven pulsing of ACC water that occurred in 2002. Age-1 and age-2 pollock were not observed in Barnabus Trough in 2004. Instead, the midwater acoustic backscatter was composed of capelin mixed with age-0 pollock, and these capelin were not restricted to the outer-shelf waters, but were found primarily in warm, low-salinity inner-shelf waters that had been previously occupied exclusively by age-1 and age-2 pollock. We suggest that this is consistent with inner-shelf waters being preferred foraging habitat for juvenile pollock and capelin. Further study of the mechanisms linking climate change with variability in the ACC is needed, as are studies of the potential for competition between juvenile pollock and capelin.

In laboratory experiments, we determined if intraguild predation occurs between Typhlodromalus manihoti and Eusehis fustis, two phytoseiid mite predators of the cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa on cassava in Africa, and if the level of intraguild predation is affected by the availability of the primary prey, M. tanajoa, and maize pollen as alternative non-prey food. In the laboratory, the two predators attacked and killed heterospecific larvae but they did so only when prey mites and alternative food (maize pollen) were absent or scarce. On a diet of intraguild prey alone, the two predator species survived for several days but failed to reproduce. Addition of abundant levels of M. tanajoa and maize pollen increased survival and reproduction of the two predator species and reduced intraguild predation to very low levels. We then determined, on whole plants in pot experiments in a screenhouse, the effect of maize pollen (an alternative food) on the interactions between the two predator species and the impact of predator predator interactions on suppression of M tanajoa population densities. In single predator species treatments, both E fustis and T manihoti significantly reduced ill. tanajoa densities; but surprisingly, E fustis appeared to be superior to T manihoti. The co-presence of the two predators on the same cassava plant resulted in similar suppression of M tanajoa population densities, but greater suppression of M. tanajoa compared with T manihoti alone, regardless of presence or absence of maize pollen. The presence of the two predator species together reduced their respective abundance compared with single predator species treatments. Addition of maize pollen, however, significantly increased densities of the generalist predator E fustis, in both single and two predator species treatments; and tilted the balance of the interactions between the two predator species in favour of E fustis. The findings of our research underscore the role of generalist predators like E fustis in the suppression of M. tanajoa populations on cassava, and the potential role of alternative nonprey food in altering the interactions between co-occurring predators sharing the same primary prey (by favouring the generalist predators), and the effect of these interactions on suppression of population densities of the shared primary prey.

The areas of the highest densities of the two species are usually separated, with L argentinus most abundant to the north-west of the Islands in February-May and L. gahi to the south-east in February-May and August-October. However, in some years, L argentinus intrude in great numbers into nursery or feeding areas of L gahi in April and May. It could, therefore, affect, either directly (via predation) or indirectly (by competition for food), the abundance and recruitment of the second cohort of L. gahi, exploited around the Islands between April and October. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of L argentinus in February-March did not correlate with that of L gahi in February-May. In contrast, the CPUE of L argentinus in April-May was negatively correlated with that of L gahi in April-May and August-October of the same year. Possible reasons for these inverse abundance patterns of the two squid species, and their implications for fisheries management are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It has been suggested that competitive interactions among desert plants would be most intense during these pulse periods of high resource availability. We tested this hypothesis with three cold desert shrub species of the Colorado Plateau (Gutierrezia sarothrae, Atriplex confertifolia. and Chrysothamnus nauseosus), which differ in their distribution of functional roots. In a three-year field study we conducted a neighbor removal experiment in conjunction with simulated 25-mm precipitation events and the addition of a nitrogen pulse. in either spring or summer. We measured predawn water potential (Psi), gas exchange, leaf delta(15)N, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), and growth of target plants for the duration of the study. We found that G. sarothrae used resource pulses to a larger extent than A. confertifolia, which has more functional roots at depth. In all species, the addition of a water or nitrogen pulse did not significantly affect maximal rates of photosynthesis or branch growth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we did not find that pulse use was reduced by the presence of neighboring plants. Nevertheless, there was strong evidence for competitive interactions, which were more likely mediated by water at depth than by nitrogen. in the more deep-rooted species A. confertifolia, neighbor removal affected T, gas exchange, Delta, percentage of carbon, and growth. G. sarothrae, which has a much smaller proportion of roots at depth, was less affected by the removal of neighboring shrubs, and not at all when only predominantly shallow-rooted herbaceous species were removed. These results suggest that shrubs in this cold desert community may primarily compete for water in deeper soil layers, where water depletion is slow and dominated by plant water uptake. There appeared to be little competition for water in shallow soil layers, where depletion is fast and dominated by evaporation.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Stable Isotope Ratio Facil Environm Res, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Gebauer, RLE (corresponding author), Keene State Coll, Dept Biol, Keene, NH 03435 USA.",,"Schwinning, Susanne/G-6412-2015; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010","Schwinning, Susanne/0000-0002-9740-0291; ",,,,53,74,87,1,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2002,83,9,,,,,2602,2616,,10.2307/3071818,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,596FQ,WOS:000178153900023,,,,,2021-09-21,

We have shown that DSRICE1 predicts monoculture rice growth well and accounts for water-depth effects on growth. Here, the model is used to simulate competition for light between rice and two weeds, Echinochloa oryzoides (early watergrass) and Ammannia spp. (redstem). Except for minor differences in phenology, weed growth was simulated as described for rice. Direct competition for Light depended on the species' vertical distributions of leaf and stem areas (live and dead) and their extinction coefficients. Water also attenuates light, so species' early height growth rates were important because they determined when plants emerged into full light. Structural sensitivity analyses of rice in competition with the two weeds revealed that water-depth effects and leaf area distributions strongly affected competition, and shading by dead leaf and stem dry mass reduced total production. Validation was based on independent data sets for redstem and watergrass competition using several statistical tests and indices. For rice-redstem competition, DSRICE1 simulated rice growth well because redstem competitive effects were small, but predictions of redstem growth were good only when observed heights were matched in simulations. Redstem competitiveness depended on height growth rate, perhaps due to its small seed size. For rice-watergrass competition, the growth of both species was predicted well, except that watergrass growth in plots with early-season drainage was underpredicted. Watergrass parameters were similar to those for rice except for faster height growth and higher photosynthesis rates. In a model application, simulations in which rice seeding was delayed for a time after flooding led to greater yield losses from redstem than from watergrass because delays reduced the advantage of rice over redstem. The usefulness of DSRICE1 for drained fields will be improved by better simulation of plant growth responses to drainage, but rice competition with redstem and watergrass in continuously-flooded fields was simulated well.

The practice of discarding by-catch, under-sized fishes and offal from trawlers has led to an increase in the populations of certain scavenging bird species. The greatest population increases have occurred in the most aggressively competitive species, while some subordinate species have decreased in abundance. Several recent studies indicate that a similar situation may exist for epibenthic scavengers. We explore the possibility that enhanced food supply in the form of fisheries-generated carrion may affect the competitive balance between sympatric populations of hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus and P. prideaux. Under normal conditions, both species have overlapping diets and occur in equal abundance at the site studied. In laboratory investigations both species consumed the same types of carrion. However held observations revealed that while P. bernhardus aggregate in areas disturbed by trawls where they consume animals damaged in the trawl path, P. prideaux do not. Morphometric analyses revealed that P. prideaux have smaller chelae relative to P. bernhardus. Thus, P. prideaux may avoid dense aggregations of P. bernhardus which are more aggressive. These behavioural differences, coupled with higher fisheries mortality for P. prideaux, may provide a mechanism whereby P. bernhardus could outcompete P. prideaux in areas were fishing disturbance and discarding occur frequently.","Conwy Lab, Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Conwy LL32 8UB, Wales; Univ Coll N Wales, Sch Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales","Kaiser, MJ (corresponding author), Conwy Lab, Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Conwy LL32 8UB, Wales.",,"Kaiser, Michel J/M-8543-2013","Kaiser, Michel Josef/0000-0001-8782-3621",,,,36,12,12,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,LONDON,"ONE GUNPOWDER SQUARE, LONDON EC4A 3DE, ENGLAND",0022-2933,,,J NAT HIST,J.

The Menge and Sutherland (MS) model of community regulation and its refinements were developed for hard-bottom habitats, but can be modified for soft-sediment systems. This 'consumer stress model' posits that mobile consumers feed ineffectively in harsh environments, and that the relative importance of physical disturbance, interspecific competition and predation varies predictably with the magnitude of recruitment, environmental conditions, productivity and trophic position. The MS model predicts that interspecific competition for a resource depends directly upon the level of recruitment, though it does not explicitly address the joint effects of recruitment and resource availability, which are important in soft-sediment communities. The model is here revised to incorporate hard-bottom and soft-sediment systems by changing the recruitment axis to a 'recruitment:resource ratio', whereby the effect of a given level of recruitment depends on resource availability. The potential utility of the revised model is illustrated in a hypothetical contrast of the effect of recruitment:resource ratios on community regulation for a mussel-dominated assemblage in hard-bottom habitats and an infaunal clam-dominated system in soft sediments.","Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","Seitz, RD (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",seitz@vims.edu,,,,,,110,10,10,1,4,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

The differences in morphology between these two species generate: specific predictions under limiting similarity regarding the likelihood of competition and its relative strength: the congener should be a more important potential competitor. Increased fish density had a strong effect on the multivariate response of survival and growth, and on the relative condition of C. bairdi, indicating competition. The effect of additional C. bairdi or Kanawha sculpins were roughly equal, but the effect of E. flabellare was significantly greater.

The root and total mass of C. jacea increased with AM inoculation while F. vesca did not respond. The mass difference between C. jacea and E vesca in a particular pot increased when plants were mycorrhizal, mostly due to the mass increase of C. jaceae.

Harvests of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) cones by insects, birds, and mammals were negatively correlated both within and across sites. Birds and mammals significantly increased their cone harvest when the other group was experimentally prevented access to trees, and mammals harvested more cones when insects were removed from trees with an insecticide. These results suggest that stem- and cone-boring insects (primarily Dioryctria albovittella), birds (Clark's Nutcrackers, Pinyon Jays, and Scrub Jays), and mammals (cliff chipmunks and rock squirrels) compete for pinyon pine seeds. Additionally, insects affected the interaction between birds and mammals because the ratio of mammal to bird harvest increased up to 350-fold as insect cone consumption increased.

However, theory on the trophic impacts of invasive fauna on native competitors is ambiguous, as while increased interspecific competition can result in the species having constricted and diverged trophic niches, the species might instead increase their niche sizes, especially in omnivorous species. The competitive interactions between an omnivorous invasive fish, common carp Cyprinus carpio, and a tropically analogous native and threatened fish, crucian carp Carassius carassius, were tested using comparative functional responses (CFRs). A natural pond experiment then presented the species in allopatry and sympatry, determining the changes in their trophic (isotopic) niche sizes and positions over 4 years. These predictive approaches were complemented by assessing their trophic relationships in wild populations. Comparative functional responses revealed that compared to crucian carp, carp had a significantly higher maximum consumption rate. Coupled with a previous cohabitation growth study, these results predicted that competition between the species is asymmetric, with carp the superior competitor. The pond experiment used stable isotope metrics to quantify shifts in the trophic (isotopic) niche sizes of the fishes. In allopatry, the isotopic niches of the two species were similar sized and diverged. Conversely, in sympatry, carp isotopic niches were always considerably larger than those of crucian carp and were strongly partitioned. Sympatric crucian carp had larger isotopic niches than allopatric conspecifics, a likely response to asymmetric competition from carp. However, carp isotopic niches were also larger in sympatry than allopatry. In the wild populations, the carp isotopic niches were always larger than crucian carp niches, and were highly divergent. The superior competitive abilities of carp predicted in aquaria experiments were considered to be a process involved in sympatric crucian carp having larger isotopic niches than in allopatry. However, as sympatric carp also had larger niches than in allopatry, this suggests other ecological processes were also likely to be involved, such as those relating to fish prey resources. These results highlight the inherent complexity in determining how omnivorous invasive species integrate into food webs and alter their structure.","[Almela, Victoria Dominguez; Britton, J.

We include ecologically realistic assumptions, such as density dependence and stochastic fluctuations in the environment, and analyze how evolution caused by r- and K-selection will affect the packing of species in the phenotypic space as well as the species abundance distribution. Species-specific traits have the same matrix G of additive genetic variances and covariances, and evolution of mean traits is affected by fluctuations in population size of all species. In general, the model produces a shape of the distributions of log abundances that is skewed to the left, which is typical of most natural communities. Mean phenotypes of the species in the community are distributed approximately uniformly on the surface of a multidimensional sphere. However, environmental stochasticity generates selection that deviates species slightly from this surface; nonetheless, phenotypic distribution will be different from a random packing of species. This model of community evolution provides a theoretical framework that predicts a relationship between the structure of the phenotypic space and the form of species abundance distributions that can be compared against time series of variation in community structure.","[Engen, Steinar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Dept Math Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Grotan, Vidar; Saether, Bernt-Erik; Coste, Christophe F.

Here we study competitive interactions among juvenile salmon, grayling (Thymallus thymalius), and brown trout (Salmo trutta) that occur in the upper reaches of the river. We examine foraging rates, aggression, and activity of juvenile fish in allopauy at three different densities and in sympatry with one or both potential competitors in laboratory flumes. Salmon captured prey less frequently in the presence of brown trout and grayling, whereas grayling and brown trout were unaffected by salmon, but affected each other. Grayling was the most aggressive and active species, whereas salmon the least. Consequently, reintroduction of salmon probably will have little impact on grayling and brown trout, whereas grayling and brown trout could affect the success of reintroducing salmon.","[Hagelin, Anna] Cty Adm Board Vastra Gotaland, Dept Fish & Water Conservat, S-40340 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Hagelin, Anna; Bergman, Eva] Karlstad Univ, Dept Environm & Life Sci Biol, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden","Hagelin, A (corresponding author), Cty Adm Board Vastra Gotaland, Dept Fish & Water Conservat, S-40340 Gothenburg, Sweden.; Hagelin, A (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Environm & Life Sci Biol, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",anna.hagelin@lansstyrelsen.se,"Bergman, Eva/R-8464-2016","Bergman, Eva/0000-0003-2220-1615",,,,43,1,1,6,6,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Recent computational work suggests that physical structures in the environment can stabilize local competition between species that would otherwise be subject to competitive exclusion under isotropic conditions. Here we employ Lotka-Volterra models to show that interfacial competition localizes to physical structures, stabilizing competitive ecological networks of many species, even with significant differences in the strength of competitive interactions between species. Within a limited range of parameter space, we show that for stable communities the length-scale of physical structure inversely correlates with the width of the distribution of competitive fitness, such that physical environments with finer structure can sustain a broader spectrum of interspecific competition. These results highlight the potentially stabilizing effects of physical structure on microbial communities and lay groundwork for engineering structures that stabilize and/or select for diverse communities of ecological, medical, or industrial utility. Author summary Natural environments often have many species competing for the same resources and frequently one species will out-compete others. This poses the fundamental question of how a diverse array of species can coexist in a resource-limited environment. Among other mechanisms, previous studies examined how interactions between species-like cooperation or predation-could lead to stable biodiversity. In this work we looked at this question from a different angle: we used computational models to examine the role that the environment itself might play in stabilizing species that compete with each other when in proximity. We modeled how species arrange themselves in space when the environment contains objects that alter the interfaces along which competing species meet. We found that these 'structured' environments can stabilize species coexistence, across a range of density of those objects and in a way that was robust to differing strengths of interspecies competition. Thus, in addition to biological factors and other forms of environmental variation, our work presents a potentially generic mechanism by which the physical structure of the environment can influence ecological outcomes and stabilize biodiversity.","[Ursell, Tristan] Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Ursell, Tristan] Univ Oregon, Inst Mat Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Ursell, Tristan] Univ Oregon, Dept Phys, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Ursell, T (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.; Ursell, T (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Inst Mat Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.; Ursell, T (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Phys, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",tsu@uoregon.edu,,,University of Oregon,"This work was funded by the University of Oregon (https://www.uoregon.edu/).The author received salary from this funding source, which had no influence on the study.

The objective of this study was to determine how abiotic and biotic environmental factors contribute to interspecific competition of Polish crayfish based on the available literature. Abiotic factors affecting the interspecific competition include tolerance to extreme pH values, calcium ion content, temperature, oxygenation, water salinity, preferred substrate and the type of water bodies. Biotic factors are, inter alia, pathogens, food base, plant cover and interactions in the prey-predator system, as well as interactions between crayfish species. The most important abiotic factors are water temperature and oxygenation, while the most important biotic factor is the crayfish plague - a deadly disease for native species.

However, only a small fraction of pesticides really hit their target organisms, with the remaining fraction reaching the environment by several phenomena such as leaching, and ending up in aquatic ecosystems: the final receptor of micropollutants. Chemical stressors induce changes in taxonomic composition of fauna and flora which are now the focus of many biomonitoring studies. Interspecific competition and predation are structuring factors of community composition. But the combined effects of biotic relationships (competition, predation) and pesticides are rarely accounted for. We tested four factors (Predation, Competition, Diuron (Herbicide) and Imidacloprid (insecticide)) separately on three distinct morphotypes of two diatoms species: Planothidium lanceolatum and Gomphonema gracile (normal and teratogen forms), to quantify the daily growth kinetics of each under varied pressures. The predator used was a nematode, cosmopolitan in soils and aquatic ecosystems (Aphelenchoides bicaudatus). We reproduced experiments combining the factors in binary and ternary combinations. Diuron had lower toxicity than expected, while imidacloprid affected the growth of non-target diatoms. Interalgal competition had marked negative effects on diatom growth kinetics, which increased as supplementary pressures (nematodes and/or pesticides) were added. These results demonstrate that ecological relationships in freshwater biofilms (competition, predation) have a non negligible effect on community composition, population behavior and impacts usually observed. Multistress conditions including the presence of pesticides in freshwaters are expected to affect biodiversity in ways that are hard to predict from simple toxicity assays.","[Neury-Ormanni, Julie; Vedrenne, Jacky; Morin, Soizic] UR EABX, INRAE, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France","Neury-Ormanni, J (corresponding author), UR EABX, INRAE, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France.",julie.neury@laposte.net; jacky.vedrenne@inrae.fr; soizic.morin@inrae.fr,"Morin, Soizic/J-1204-2019","Morin, Soizic/0000-0003-0360-9383; Vedrenne, Jacky/0000-0001-9313-4283; Neury-Ormanni, Julie/0000-0003-4711-4593",Adour Garonne Water Agency,We are grateful to Emilie Saulnier-Talbot for checking English grammar and spelling.

They are based on monospecific bioassays conducted in the laboratory and thus do not directly take into account ecological interactions. This point, among others, is accounted for in environmental risk assessment through an assessment factor (AF) that is applied to compensate for the lack of environmental representativity. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of interspecific competition on the responses towards isoproturon of plant species representative of a vegetated filter strip community, and to assess its impact on the derived SSD and HC5 values. To do so, we realized bioassays confronting six herbaceous species to a gradient of isoproturon exposure in presence and absence of a competitor. Several modelling approaches were applied to see how they affected the results, using different critical effect concentrations and investigating different ways to handle multiple endpoints in SSD. At the species level, there was a strong trend toward organisms being more sensitive to isoproturon in presence of a competitor than in its absence. At the community level, this trend was also observed in the SSDs and HC5 values were always lower in presence of a competitor (1.12-11.13 times lower, depending on the modelling approach). Our discussion questions the relevance of SSD and AF as currently applied in environmental risk assessment.","[Baillard, Vincent; Devin, Simon; Billoir, Elise] Univ Lorraine, LIEC, CNRS, F-57000 Metz, France; [Sulmon, Cecile; Mony, Cendrine; Couee, Ivan; Gouesbet, Gwenola] Univ Rennes, Ecobio Ecosyst Biodiversite Evolut Umr 6553, CNRS, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Bittebiere, Anne-Kristel] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5023 LEHNA, 43 Blvd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Delignette-Muller, Marie Laure] Univ Lyon, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, VetAgro Sup, Univ Lyon 1,CNRS,UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Baillard, V (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, LIEC, CNRS, F-57000 Metz, France.",vincent.baillard@univ-lorraine.fr,"Gouesbet, Gwenola/C-4790-2009; Couee, Ivan/D-9201-2012","Gouesbet, Gwenola/0000-0002-5223-7240; Couee, Ivan/0000-0002-1117-0043","Ecosphere continentale et cotiere (EC2CO) interdisciplinary program from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France); French Research ministryMinistry of Research, France","This work has been funded by the Ecosphere continentale et cotiere (EC2CO) interdisciplinary program from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France).

Yet, most previous work on thermal niches has ignored detailed mechanistic information about the relationship between temperature and organismal performance, which can be described by a thermal performance curve. Here, we develop a model that predicts the width of thermal performance curves will be narrower in the presence of interspecific competitors, causing a species' optimal breeding temperature to diverge from that of its competitor. We test this prediction in the Asian burying beetle Nicrophorus nepalensis, confirming that the divergence in actual and optimal breeding temperatures is the result of competition with their primary competitor, blowflies. However, we further show that intraspecific cooperation enables beetles to outcompete blowflies by recovering their optimal breeding temperature. Ultimately, linking abiotic factors and biotic interactions on niche width will be critical for understanding species-specific responses to climate change.","[Tsai, Hsiang-Yu; Chen, Bo-Fei; Liu, Mark; Chan, Shih-Fan; Chen, De-Pei; Sun, Syuan-Jyun; Yuan, Tzu-Neng; Shen, Sheng-Feng] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tsai, Hsiang-Yu; Chen, De-Pei; Shen, Sheng-Feng] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Coll Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Rubenstein, Dustin R.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY USA; [Rubenstein, Dustin R.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Integrat Anim Behav, New York, NY USA","Shen, SF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan.; Shen, SF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Coll Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",shensf@sinica.edu.tw,"Chen, Bo-Fei/N-6076-2014; Shih-Fan, Chan/AAU-3609-2020; Rubenstein, Dustin/A-3451-2015","Chen, Bo-Fei/0000-0003-3005-8724; Shih-Fan, Chan/0000-0003-2955-9433; Tsai, Hsiang-Yu/0000-0002-6578-5051; Rubenstein, Dustin/0000-0002-4999-3723; Shen, Sheng-Feng/0000-0002-0631-6343","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [103-2621-B-001 -003 -MY3, 101-2313-B-001 -008 -MY3]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1656098]; Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan [AS-SS-106-05, AS-IA-106-L01]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 103-2621-B-001 -003 -MY3 Sheng-Feng Shen; National Science Foundation IOS-1656098 Dustin Reid Rubenstein; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 101-2313-B-001 -008 -MY3 Sheng-Feng Shen; Academia Sinica AS-SS-106-05 Sheng-Feng Shen; Academia Sinica AS-IA-106-L01 Sheng-Feng Shen; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,60,2,2,1,5,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,AUG 18,2020,9,,,,,,,,e57022,10.7554/eLife.57022,,,15,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,NF1RP,WOS:000563079800001,32807299,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Interspecific competition, however, may affect this relationship. Here we tested the hypothesis that local abundance of the gray slender opossumMarmosops incanusis affected by the local richness of potential competitors and environmental suitability derived from ecological niche models (ENMs). We also discuss the ability of distinct modelling methods to predict species' abundance. We compiled occurrence records and information aboutM. incanus' relative abundance from museums and published articles. Environmental suitability was derived from five algorithms using seven environmental predictors. To assess our hypothesis, we chose the best statistical models among generalised linear models and quantile regressions, and then tested whether the effects of richness of competitors on local abundance are stronger under highly suitable conditions. We found that environmental suitability given by presence-only methods are positively related to the maximum abundance ofM. incanus. That is, species' local abundance is low when suitability is low but can be either low or high when suitability is high. The richness of competitors, in turn, explains the abundance variation within sites with high environmental suitability. We strongly recommend that the relationship between abundance and suitability must be carefully interpreted when using ENMs to predict species' distribution because biotic interactions can be the main driver of local abundance within highly suitable environments.","[Braz, Alan Gerhardt] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Postgrad Program Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Viveiros Grelle, Carlos Eduardo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Dept Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Souza Lima Figueiredo, Marcos] Fed Univ State Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biosci, Postgrad Program Neotrop Biodivers, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Weber, Marcelo de Moraes] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Zootechny & Biol Sci, Palmeira Das Missoes, RS, Brazil","Braz, AG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Postgrad Program Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",brazagm@gmail.com,"Grelle, Carlos EV/A-9687-2017; Figueiredo, Marcos S.

This modification can prevent proteolysis caused by the excessive oxidation of protein cysteine residues under oxidative or nitrosative stress conditions. Recent studies have suggested that protein S-glutathionylation plays an essential role in the control of cell-signaling pathways by affecting the protein function in bacteria and even humans. In this study, we investigated the effects of S-glutathionylation on physiological regulation within Streptococcus mutans, the primary etiological agent of human dental caries. To determine the S-glutathionylated proteins in bacteria, the Cys reactive isobaric reagent iodoacetyl Tandem Mass Tag (iodoTMT) was used to label the S-glutathionylated Cys site, and an anti-TMT antibody-conjugated resin was used to enrich the modified peptides. Proteome profiling identified a total of 357 glutathionylated cysteine residues on 239 proteins. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these S-glutathionylated proteins were involved in diverse important biological processes, such as pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis. Furthermore, we studied a thioredoxin-like protein (Tlp) to explore the effect of S-glutathionylation on interspecies competition between oral streptococcal biofilms. Through site mutagenesis, it was proved that glutathionylation on Cys41 residue of Tlp is crucial to protect S. mutans from oxidative stress and compete with S. sanguinis and S. gordonii. An addition rat caries model showed that the loss of S-glutathionylation attenuated the cariogenicity of S. mutans. Taken together, our study provides an insight into the S-glutathionylation of bacterial proteins and the regulation of oxidative stress resistance and interspecies competition. Author summary S-glutathionylation is involved in many physiological processes such as antioxidation, detoxification and cell proliferation. However, the proteomics research on S-glutathionylation has never been performed in bacteria. The identification of and functional studies on glutathione reductase, glutathione synthesis dual-functional enzyme and glutathione-S-transferase in Streptococcus mutans, the main causative agent of dental caries, inspired the existence of complete S-glutathionylation system in this type of bacteria. It may impact various crucial physiological processes by regulating the function of modified proteins. Here, we explored the entire S-glutathionylation proteome through high-specific labeling and high-sensitivity mass spectrometry technologies. The results showed that about 11.7% of the total S. mutans proteins were S-glutathionylated, which indicated that S-glutathionylation plays a fundamental role in the regulation of cellular processes. Through functional analysis and domain prediction, we next uncovered a potential thioredoxin that contains two modified cysteines on its key active motif; S-glutathionylation of the sites affected the oxidative resistance, competition and cariogenecity of S. mutans. We anticipate that S-glutathionylation proteome studies could be performed on more refractory infectious diseases, revealing more mechanisms of pathogen infection and providing new methods to treat infectious diseases.","[Li, Zhengyi; Zhang, Chenzi; Li, Cheng; Zhou, Jiajia; Xu, Xin; Peng, Xian; Zhou, Xuedong] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Oral Dis, Natl Clin Res Ctr Oral Dis, West China Hosp Stomatol, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chenzi; Li, Cheng; Zhou, Jiajia; Xu, Xin; Zhou, Xuedong] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Oral Dis, Natl Clin Res Ctr Oral Dis, Dept Cariol & Endodont,West China Hosp Stomatol, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Peng, X; Zhou, XD (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Oral Dis, Natl Clin Res Ctr Oral Dis, West China Hosp Stomatol, Chengdu, Peoples R China.; Zhou, XD (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Oral Dis, Natl Clin Res Ctr Oral Dis, Dept Cariol & Endodont,West China Hosp Stomatol, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",pengx@scu.edu.cn; zhouxd@scu.edu.cn,,"Xu, Xin/0000-0003-4608-4556",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81700963]; Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2018JY0561],"The research performed in the Zhou lab was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81170959).

Along the subtropical Coast of Brazil, sessile communities from artificial habitats are mostly dominated by the NIS ascidian Didemnum perlucidum and the bryozoan Schizoporella errata, which show contrasting life-history traits. To understand the dynamics between these species and better predict the identity of the dominant NIS in the sessile community, we conducted an experiment where colonies of S. errata, D. perlucidum and the cryptogenic ascidian Botrylloides niger were submitted to the following three interaction scenarios: colonies growing without competition, under intraspecific competition and under interspecific competition. All competition treatments were crossed with the following two predation treatments: exposed or protected to predators. The experiment was repeated in two different seasons (Winter and Summer). When released from predation and competition, the three species grew at least 10 times faster in the Summer than in the Winter, and S. errata always grew slower than the ascidian species. Predation reduced D. perlucidum survival in the Winter but not during the Summer, when the fast colony growth seemed to buffer partial colony removal by predation. Colonial growth of B. niger was affected by competition only in treatments without predators, growing almost 50% more without competition than when competing, regardless of the competitors' identity. When exposed to predation, D. perlucidum was more limited by interspecific than intraspecific competition. S. errata growth was not affected by biotic interactions and was linked to intrinsic seasonal variation. Mineralized clonal organisms, such as bryozoans, were less predated than most of the ascidians species but they grew slower. Ascidians were more often predated but were also strong competitors that were able to overgrow several taxa. The contrasting growth strategies resulted in different successes of NIS and cryptogenic species at the studied locality. Ascidians were favored under low predation pressure while bryozoans were survivors when predation was intense.","[Oricchio, Felipe Theocharides; Dias, Gustavo Muniz] Univ Fed ABC, UFABC, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Humanas, Rua Arcturus 03, BR-09606070 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil","Oricchio, FT (corresponding author), Univ Fed ABC, UFABC, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Humanas, Rua Arcturus 03, BR-09606070 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil.",felipe.oricchio@ufabc.edu.br,"Dias, Gustavo Muniz/M-9169-2019","Dias, Gustavo Muniz/0000-0003-2180-6399","FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2016/17647-5, 2019/23276-8]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)","This work was supported by FAPESP (2016/17647-5 and 2019/23276-8) to G.M.D., and a CAPES grant to F.T.O.

If true, I predict that range and niche sizes of two congeners are more disproportionate within the previously glaciated areas (i.e. the areas of post-glacial expansion) than within areas that were not glaciated. I also predict that niche partitioning is reduced within previously glaciated areas. If true, range and climatic niche overlap of two congeners is smaller in the previously glaciated areas than in non-glaciated areas. Location North America. Taxon Non-volant mammals. Methods I calculate species range size for 87 congeneric species pairs and climatic niche hypervolume for 71 pairs, separately for areas that were and were not glaciated during the LGM. I then compare (a) range and climatic niche size ratio and (b) range and climatic niche overlap for each species pair between areas that were and were not glaciated using a paired t test. Results Congeneric species pairs exhibit more disproportionate range areas and climatic niche hypervolumes, and smaller range and climatic niche overlap within previously glaciated areas, in comparison with areas that were not glaciated during the LGM. Main conclusions Interspecific competition has likely hindered post-glacial range expansion of some species into deglaciated areas. Similarly to the founder effect documented on the intraspecific level, the founder species may hinder the expansion of the latecomer. Consequently, one species may expand over very large areas whereas its competitor may expand very little or not at all. Additionally, niche partitioning within the deglaciated areas may be reduced as the founder expands and fills biotopes that would otherwise be utilized by its competitor.","[Jezkova, Tereza] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Jezkova, T (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",jezkovt@miamioh.edu,,,,,,60,0,0,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

This hypothesis, often credited to Charles Darwin, is a pattern widely assumed to occur in nature. However, abiotic factors can impose constraints on both limits and there is scant evidence to support the latter prediction. Deviations from these predictions may arise from correlations between abiotic factors and biotic interactions, as a lack of data to evaluate the hypothesis, or be an artifact of scale. Combining two tenets of ecology-niche theory and predator-prey theory-provides an opportunity to understand how biotic interactions influence range limits and how this varies by trophic level. We propose an expansion of RLT, interactive RLT (iRLT), to understand the causes of range limits and predict range shifts. Incorporating the main predictions of Darwin's hypothesis, iRLT hypothesizes that abiotic and biotic factors can interact to impact both limits of a species' range. We summarize current thinking on range limits and perform an integrative review to evaluate support for iRLT and trophic differences along range margins, surveying the mammal community along the boreal-temperate and forest-tundra ecotones of North America. Our review suggests that range-limit dynamics are more nuanced and interactive than classically predicted by RLT. Many (57 of 70) studies indicate that biotic factors can ameliorate harsh climatic conditions along high-latitude/altitude limits. Conversely, abiotic factors can also mediate biotic interactions along low-latitude/altitude limits (44 of 68 studies). Both scenarios facilitate range expansion, contraction or stability depending on the strength and the direction of the abiotic or biotic factors. As predicted, biotic interactions most often occurred along lower limits, yet there were trophic differences. Carnivores were only limited by competitive interactions (n = 25), whereas herbivores were more influenced by predation and parasitism (77%; 55 of 71 studies). We highlight how these differences may create divergent range patterns along lower limits. We conclude by (a) summarizing iRLT; (b) contrasting how our model system and others fit this hypothesis and (c) suggesting future directions for evaluating iRLT.","[Siren, Alexej P.

Here, we address resource partitioning and interspecific competition among three main solitary parasitoid species attacking the same host resource, the aphid Sitobion avenae in wheat fields. Optimal host acceptance models predict that parasitoid species should prefer attacking unparasitized hosts when they are available in order to maximize their fitness, as already parasitized hosts are less valuable for laying eggs, especially for inferior competitors. Therefore, we expected the level of competition (multiparasitism) in the field to increase at low host density. By using a combination of taxonomical (determination) and molecular (PCR-based) approaches, we assessed the species of all parasitoid adults and immature stages within aphid hosts. Our results demonstrate that, early in the season, the multiparasitism rates were low, whereas they were high in the mid-late season, corresponding to an aphid density decrease over time. Moreover, parasitoid species could not have been exploiting host resources randomly and the better competitor, Aphidius ervi, seemed to be foraging preferentially on hosts already parasitized by the inferior competitor A. rhopalosiphi, even when unparasitized hosts were still available. This could be due to differences in their host detection capability, as species with a narrow host range may be better at detecting their hosts in comparison with species with a greater host range, such as A. ervi, with a greater host range within the guild. Our study suggests differences in the host exploitation of two prevalent parasitoid species through the main period of aphid colonization, which still allowed the coexistence of a third inferior competitor (A. rhopalosiphi) within the assemblage, in spite of some negative interactions (multiparasitism) and redundancies.","[Ortiz-Martinez, Sebastian; Zepeda-Paulo, Francisca; Lavandero, Blas] Univ Talca, Inst Ciencias Biol, Lab Control Biol, Avda Lircay S-N, Talca, Chile; [Pierre, Jean-Sebastien; van Baaren, Joan; Le Lann, Cecile] Univ Rennes, ECOBIO, UMR CNRS 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France","Lavandero, B (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Inst Ciencias Biol, Lab Control Biol, Avda Lircay S-N, Talca, Chile.",blavandero@utalca.cl,"Ortiz-Martinez, Sebastian/H-9302-2013","Ortiz-Martinez, Sebastian/0000-0002-7306-1424; Le Lann, Cecile/0000-0002-3949-4066; van baaren, joan/0000-0002-8552-9645; Zepeda Paulo, Francisca/0000-0001-5434-4667",National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (Fondecyt) Grant [1140632]; National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Universidad de Talca doctoral grant,"The authors would like to thank Cinthya Villegas, Nuri Cabrera and Pablo Martinez for their help with field collection samples and laboratory procedures.

Information about the predator trophic interactions i.e. cannibalism or feeding on heterospecific juveniles, is a key to understand the real impact of their combinations when introduced in biological control systems. The hypothesis here, assumed that the pairwise introduction of the female predatory mites, N. californicus (predator) + P. persimilis (heterospecific prey) and vice versa, A. swirskii (predator) + P. persimilis (heterospecific prey) and vice versa could exist in the Tetranychus urticae (main prey) scarcity. Three diets consisted of either conspecific or heterospecific six eggs, four eggs + four larvae and four protonymphs were introduced to the guilds. The predation and oviposition rates and the longevity of each female intraguild predator on detached bean leaf disc was recorded every three hours for 12 consecutive days. Neoseiulus californicus predation rate was estimated to be highest on conspecific eggs + larvae (11.35 +/- 1.12) and so was on those of P. persimilis (55.7 +/- 3.42). No significant difference was observed in N. californicus oviposition rate on three conspecific diets (P > 0.05), while its oviposition rate was highest on P. persimilis eggs + larvae (7.15 +/- 0.80). Phytoseiulus persimilis predation rate was estimated to be highest on eggs + larvae both on N. californicus and P. persimilisas prey. Its oviposition rate was estimated to be highest when feeding on conspecific eggs (2.25 +/- 0.19) and N. californicus eggs + larvae. Amblyseius swirskii fed on 45 +/- 2.79 P. persimilis and 12.90 +/- 1.51 A. swirskii eggs + larvae, which was significantly higher than predation rates on other stages (P < 0.01). Amblyseius swirskii oviposition rate was not significantly different on each of the three diets or on A. swirskii or P. persimilis as prey (P > 0.05). The oviposition rate of P. persimilis was the highest on A. swirskii eggs + larvae (1.45 +/- 0.19). When N. californicus fed on each of the three diet types, no significant difference was observed in its longevity. The greatest longevity of P. persimilis was recorded when feeding on N. californicus/P. persimilis eggs. Longevity of A. swirskii was the greatest on P. persimilis eggs and protonymphs. Similarly, P. persimilis had the greatest longevity feeding on A. swirskii eggs. We concluded that the predator species were capable of surviving under conditions of scarce prey when heterospecific species are present.","[Haghani, Somayeh; Zahedi-Golpayegani, Azadeh; Saboori, Alireza; Allahyari, Hossein] Univ Tehran, Dept Plant Protect, Fac Agr, Karaj, Iran","Zahedi-Golpayegani, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Dept Plant Protect, Fac Agr, Karaj, Iran.",haghani.somayeh86@gmail.com; zahedig@ut.ac.ir; saboori@ut.ac.ir; allahyar@ut.ac.ir,"Saboori, Alireza/AAW-2246-2021; Saboori, Alireza/AAF-4405-2021","Saboori, Alireza/0000-0002-3101-1330; Zahedi- Golpayegani, Azadeh/0000-0001-7668-8735",University of TehranUniversity of Tehran [06.6.73149051],The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of University of Tehran for this research under grant number 06.6.73149051.

Yet, empirical evidence on these interactions is very scarce and mostly available at small spatial scales, within populations. Because lipid-rich fruits are known to be preferred by migratory birds, here we test our prediction of competitive inferiority of a carbohydrate-rich fruited species (the hawthorn Crataegus monogyna) compared to lipid-rich co-fruiting species in a Mediterranean region where the bulk of seed dispersal relies on migratory birds. We assessed avian seed dispersal in both relative (fruit removal rate) and absolute terms (seed dispersal magnitude) in seven hawthorn populations distributed across an altitudinal gradient encompassing three contrasting fruiting contexts: hawthorn is scarce in the lowlands, common in the midlands, and the dominant fruit species in the highlands. We found evidence of seed dispersal reduction due to interspecific competition in the lowland populations, where lipid-rich fruits dominate. Besides, DNA barcoding analysis of bird-dispersed seeds revealed that only a small subset of the local frugivore assemblages consumed hawthorn fruits in the lowland communities. Instead, the consumers of hawthorn fruits resembled the local frugivore assemblages where hawthorn fruits were more dominant and frugivore choices more limited. Our study suggests mechanisms by which the rarity or dominance of plant species might be jointly influenced by environmental constraints (here, precipitation along the altitudinal gradient) and frugivore-mediated indirect interactions among plants hindering or facilitating seed dispersal.","[Rumeu, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Varo, Juan P.] UIB, CSIC, IMEDEA, Terr Ecol Grp, Esporles, Spain; [Alvarez-Villanueva, Miguel; Arroyo, Juan M.; Gonzalez-Varo, Juan P.] CSIC, EBD, Integrat Ecol Grp, Seville, Spain; [Rumeu, Beatriz; Gonzalez-Varo, Juan P.] Univ Oviedo, CSIC, Unidad Mixta Invest Biodiversidad, UO,PA, Oviedo, Spain","Rumeu, B (corresponding author), UIB, CSIC, IMEDEA, Terr Ecol Grp, Esporles, Spain.; Rumeu, B (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, CSIC, Unidad Mixta Invest Biodiversidad, UO,PA, Oviedo, Spain.",rumeubeatriz@uniovi.es,"Gonzalez-Varo, Juan P./E-6395-2011; Rumeu, Beatriz/ABF-6936-2020","Rumeu, Beatriz/0000-0002-9017-5466; Gonzalez-Varo, Juan P./0000-0003-1439-6475",Severo Ochoa Award for Centres of Excellence in R + D + I [SEV-2012-0262]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [H2020-MSCA-IF-2014-656572: MobileLinks]; Spanish 'Juan de la Cierva Incorporacion' Programme [IJCI-2017-33475]; Spanish 'Ramon y Cajal' ProgrammeSpanish Government [RYC-2017-22095],"We thank the 'Parque Natural Sierra de Grazalema' for the permission to work in this protected area and the 'Servicio de Cria Caballar de las Fuerzas Armadas' for permission to work at 'Garrapilos'.

Regulating competition is an integral part of silviculture, and therefore, deeper understanding of the competitor's influence on timber quality is important. Since mixed forest stands and the share of broadleaved tree species have increased in the recent past because of a changed forest policy in several countries, effects of mixture types on timber quality are of increasing importance. In this study, we investigated the effects of intra- and interspecific competition on the internal timber quality of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). To analyze the effects of competition intensity and competitor species identity on the timber quality of 82 target beech trees, three different approaches were used: terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), a quality assessment on the standing tree by local district foresters, and a quality assessment of the sawn wood (boards) after harvesting. We investigated the relationship between external and internal quality features and additionally compared the different approaches to assess quality. We found that the present competitive situation was partly related to internal timber quality, with increasing competition leading to increased internal timber quality. We further observed more discoloration in timber of beech trees growing in mixture with other broadleaved tree species. We also showed that predicting discoloration is possible through the number of bark anomalies on the stem surface. Also, the external quality assessment of local foresters on standing trees predicted the internal timber features well. Finally, TLS appeared to be a valuable addition for assessing timber quality in situ.","[Hoewler, Kirsten; Vor, Torsten; Seidel, Dominik; Annighoefer, Peter; Ammer, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Fac Forest Sci, Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Howler, K (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Fac Forest Sci, Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",Kirsten.Hoewler@forst.uni-goettingen.de; tvor@gwdg.de; dseidel@gwdg.de; pannigh@gwdg.de; Christian.Ammer@forst.uni-goettingen.de,"Annighofer, Peter/AAS-8418-2021; Ammer, Christian/ABG-4629-2020; Ammer, Christian/ABG-7360-2020; Seidel, Dominik/M-1122-2013","Annighofer, Peter/0000-0001-8126-5307; Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135; Seidel, Dominik/0000-0003-4131-9424",Niedersachsisches Ministerium fur Wissenschaft und Kultur embedded in the joint project 'Materialforschung Holz'; German Government [844732]; Department of Silviculture and Forest Ecology of the Temperate Zones,"This study was funded by Niedersachsisches Ministerium fur Wissenschaft und Kultur embedded in the joint project 'Materialforschung Holz'.

This divergence at microgeographic scales has been linked to dispersal ability and could be responsible for geographic variation in the strength of species interactions. For example, the spread of maladaptive traits across short distances could lead to inferior performance and local extinctions across the landscape. We utilized a model study system (headwater streams of New Hampshire) with known differences in dispersal, gene flow, and intraspecific competition to test for microgeographic variation in interspecific competition. We conducted a common garden experiment and measured survival and growth of larval Spring Salamanders from different stream reaches (fish and fishless) in response to the presence of conspecific salamanders or heterospecific Brook Trout fingerlings. We predicted that Spring Salamanders from reaches with fish would have higher competitive performance with fish than naive salamanders from reaches without fish. No significant differences were detected in salamander survival. Overall salamander growth was negative but was not affected by reach, heterospecific competitor, or the interaction between those two factors. Based on our results, microgeographic variation does not appear to be important in determining the strength of interactions between larval Spring Salamanders and Brook Trout. Salamander dispersal between our collection reaches is possible, and high gene flow of maladaptive traits could be responsible for the overall negative growth patterns. Our research highlights the importance and complexity of testing species interactions in model systems with known microgeographic variation.","[Davenport, Jon M.] Southeast Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA; [Lowe, Winsor H.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Davenport, JM (corresponding author), Southeast Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA.",davenportjm@appstate.edu; winsor.lowe@umontana.edu,"Davenport, Jon M/AAG-8457-2020","Davenport, Jon M/0000-0002-9911-2779",National Science Foundation grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1050459],"We would like to thank T.

Understanding the role of competition in structuring communities requires that we quantify competitive ability in a way that permits us to predict the outcome of competition over the long term. Given such a clear goal for a process that has been the focus of ecological research for decades, there is surprisingly little consensus on how to measure competitive ability, with up to 50 different metrics currently proposed. 2. Using competitive population dynamics as a foundation, we define competitive ability-the ability of one species to exclude another-using quantitative theoretical models of population dynamics to isolate the key parameters that are known to predict competitive outcomes. 3. Based on the definition of competitive ability we identify the empirical requirements and describe straightforward methods for quantifying competitive ability in future empirical studies. In doing so, our analysis also allows us to identify why many existing approaches to studying competition are unsuitable for quantifying competitive ability. 4. Synthesis. Competitive ability is precisely defined starting from models of competitive population dynamics. Quantifying competitive ability in a theoretically justified manner is straightforward using experimental designs readily applied to studies of competition in the laboratory and field.","[Hart, Simon P.; Levine, Jonathan M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Freckleton, Robert P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Hart, SP (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland.",simon.hart@usys.ethz.ch,"Hart, Simon Peter/B-6492-2013; Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014; Freckleton, Rob P/B-6455-2013","Hart, Simon Peter/0000-0001-7957-8689; ",,,,47,52,52,7,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

While the competitive exclusion principle suggests that species can only coexist if their ecological niches show considerable differences, newer theory proposes that local coexistence can be facilitated by so-called stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms. A prerequisite to identify such mechanisms is the understanding of the strength and the nature of competition (i.e., interference or exploitation). We studied the interaction between two open-space foraging bats by testing if common noctule bats Nyctalus noctula shift their space use in response to simulated aggregations of conspecifics or heterospecific Pipistrellus nathusii. When confronted with playbacks of heterospecifics, N. noctula increased their activity in early summer, but decreased activity in late summer. This pattern was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of large insects in late summer, suggesting a more intense competition for food in late compared to early summer. When confronted with playbacks of conspecifics, N. noctula did not change their activity, irrespective of season. Our results indicate that in early summer, intraspecific competition is more severe than interspecific competition for insectivorous bats. Likely, conspecifics engage in interference competition for flight space, and may suffer from reduced prey detectability as echolocation calls of conspecifics interfere with each other. During insect rich times, interspecific competition on the other hand may be mediated by fine scale vertical partitioning and the use non-interfering echolocation frequencies. In contrast, when food is scarce in late summer, bats may engage in exploitation competition. Our data suggests that N. noctula avoid aggregations of more agile bats like P. nathusii, probably due to impeded hunting success. Yet, as fast and efficient fliers, N. noctula may be able to escape this disadvantage by exploiting more distant foraging patches.","[Roeleke, Manuel; Johannsen, Lilith; Voigt, Christian C.] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Roeleke, Manuel; Johannsen, Lilith; Voigt, Christian C.] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Anim Behav, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany","Roeleke, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Berlin, Germany.; Roeleke, M (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Anim Behav, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany.",roeleke@izw-berlin.de,"Roeleke, Manuel/AAC-1734-2021","Roeleke, Manuel/0000-0001-5298-8071",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG-GRK 2118/1 - BioMove]; Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association,MR was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG-GRK 2118/1 - BioMove).

Plasticity of root traits in mixed plantations has been studied rarely although this could give important insights into mechanisms of root competition. This study examined root traits by branching order in 30-yr-old monocultures and their plasticity in mixed plantations. In monocultures, Manchurian walnut and larch differed in key fine root traits. Larch roots hold more absorptive root orders, larger diameter and lower specific root length/area. Walnut root orders featured greater cortex: stele ratios, N-concentrations and respiration rates. Under interspecific competition, the proportion of walnut root tips increased, the biomass/length of larch root orders 1-3 decreased. Larch possessed a greater morphological and anatomical plasticity of terminal root orders than walnut. Mycorrhizal colonization rates of walnut were reduced. Both species differed fundamentally in their fine root properties. Absorptive fine root orders reacted plastic under interspecific competition while traits of higher root orders remained unchanged. In mixture, larch roots possessed a greater plasticity in traits related to resource uptake (efficiency) than walnut roots whose reaction norm is suggested to be predominantly based on interference competition via juglone exudation.","[Salahuddin; Razaq, Muhammad; Yang Lixue; Li, Ji; Jie, Zhang] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Salahuddin] Agr Res Inst, Mingora, Pakistan; [Rewald, Boris] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Khan, Farmanullah] Univ Agr, Dept Soil & Environm Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan","Yang, LX (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",ylx_0813@163.com,"Ji, Li/Q-7588-2018; Rewald, Boris/L-2735-2019; Rewald, Boris/A-7315-2011","Ji, Li/0000-0002-2138-415X; Rewald, Boris/0000-0001-8098-0616; Rewald, Boris/0000-0001-8098-0616",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University [2572016EAJ1]; National Natural Science Fundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC31170583],The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University (2572016EAJ1) and National Natural Science Fundation of China (NSFC31170583) supported this work.

Biodiversity among species is usually promoted by competitions which can occur between two different species or among the same species. In this paper, we investigate how symmetry breaking of interspecific competitions can affect biodiversity on cyclic structured three species which may compete with themselves. From theoretical and numerical results of the deterministic system, we found that the symmetry breaking of interspecific competitions on the self-competitive species system can lead the emergence of new survival states in which are stable. Further, we figured out that these diverse survival states can be influenced by the moderate balance between interspecific and intraspecific competitions which is uncovered numerically.

Despite the recognition that salamanders have the potential to strongly affect ecosystem function through both direct and indirect pathways, little is known regarding the nature of interactions between small vertebrates and the large, predatory arthropods with which they share both microhabitat and prey. Our study was designed to explore interactions between Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, and spiders in the genus Wadotes in an eastern North American temperate forest ecosystem. We were particularly interested in teasing apart behaviors such as territoriality and intraguild predation in an attempt to determine specifically which interaction is most likely responsible for the observed negative relationship between salamander and spider abundance at our field site. Field data indicate that P. cinereus and large syntopic spiders exhibit negative spatial associations in the microhabitat beneath cover objects, a possible indication of interspecific territoriality. In our laboratory experiments, resident salamanders displayed agonistic postures similarly toward both intruding conspecifics and spiders, suggesting that salamanders may perceive large intruding spiders as competitors. Finally, we observed no injuries to individual P. cinereus or adult spiders even though occasional chases and bites by both were recorded during the behavioral trials. We found no evidence that adults or juveniles of P. cinereus were envenomated by adult Wadotes spp., and there were no instances of intraguild predation in this study. Multiple lines of evidence from this study, and others, suggest that the primary interaction between individuals of P. cinereus and large spiders is competitive in nature rather than predatory. We suggest that the cost associated with intraguild predation on salamanders with noxious skin secretions may preclude them from being preyed upon by spiders.","[Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.; Figura, Anna M.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0608239]; John Carroll University,This work was supported by The National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant [grant number DEB-0608239] to Cari-Ann M.

We investigated the N uptake competition between seagrasses and seaweeds through a series of N-15 surge uptake experiments combining single-species and mixed incubations across ammonium concentrations. N surge uptake rates of seagrasses were 2 to 14-fold higher than those of seaweeds in the majority of combinations, showing that seagrasses are generally in a competitive advantage over seaweeds in N-poor environments with N-pulses. No threshold concentration of ammonium was found beyond which seaweeds performed better than seagrasses. Mixed incubations revealed interspecific interactions that affected rates positively and negatively. Uptake rates obtained in single-species incubations, therefore, cannot always be used to predict the outcome of uptake competition. Only two (Zostera marina vs. Ulva rotundata and Zostera marina vs. Codium decorticatum) of the nine combinations tested (Z. marina, Z. noltei and Cymodocea nodosa vs. U. rotundata, C. decorticatum and Dictyota dichotoma) were found to enhance macroalgal uptake.

We found no significant density-dependent effects on either the predator or prey species, likely due to meiofaunal prey oversupply; however, the diet composition of the prey species Sillago spp. changed significantly in the presence of their potential predator.

This species was assumed to possess a wide thermal niche since it is able to adapt to cold climates, which is a factor that boosted its rapid expansion from south to many central-northern European Countries. However, the effect of variations in environmental temperatures on its competitive ability against other species has still not been investigated. In this paper, we analyzed the change in survival ability of Lasius neglectus during encounters with two Mediterranean dominant ants (Crematogaster scutellaris and Tapinoma nigerrimum) at four different temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C). Firstly, control tests were performed to provide the baseline survival ability of the three species at different temperatures. Secondly, competition tests were carried out at the same temperatures. Lasius neglectus survival was negatively affected by high temperature (30 degrees C) in control tests, and this impairment was much more pronounced in competition tests. On the contrary, the two opponent species were only marginally affected by temperatures in control tests. Crematogaster scutellaris was a better competitor than L. neglectus, particularly at high temperatures. Tapinoma nigerrimum was a weaker competitor and was always outcompeted by L. neglectus, particularly at low temperatures. This result could suggest that L. neglectus is at a disadvantage during interspecific encounters when temperatures are high and that the predicted future increase in environmental temperatures may potentially enhance this handicap.","[Frizzi, Filippo; Bartalesi, Viola; Santini, Giacomo] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Via Madonna Piano 6, I-50019 Florence, Italy","Frizzi, F (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Via Madonna Piano 6, I-50019 Florence, Italy.",filippo.frizzi@unifi.it,"Santini, Giacomo/H-7366-2013","Frizzi, Filippo/0000-0002-1419-0445",University of Florence (Progetto strategico),"The authors would like to thank all the laboratory staff and students who contributed their encouragement, suggestions, and help during all the phases of this work.

Species interactions have long been thought to be key drivers of trait evolution. However, models for comparative data that account for interactions between species are lacking. One of the challenges is that such models are intractable and difficult to express analytically. Here we present phylogenetic models of trait evolution that include interspecific competition among chosen species. Competition is modeled as a tendency of sympatric species to evolve toward difference from one another, producing trait overdispersion and high phylogenetic signal. The model predicts elevated trait variance across species and a slowdown in evolutionary rate both across the clade and within each branch. The model also predicts a reduction in correlation between otherwise correlated traits. We use an approximate Bayesian computation approach to estimate model parameters. We find reasonable power to detect competition in sufficiently large (20 + species) trees compared with Brownian trait evolution and with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and early burst models. We apply the model to examine the evolution of bill morphology of Darwin's finches and find evidence that competition affects the evolution of bill length.","[Clarke, Magnus; Thomas, Gavin H.; Freckleton, Robert P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Clarke, M (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",mclarke3@shef.ac.uk,"Thomas, Gavin/AAE-8959-2019; Freckleton, Rob P/B-6455-2013","Thomas, Gavin/0000-0002-1982-6051; Freckleton, Robert/0000-0002-8338-864X",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G012938/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G012938/2] Funding Source: researchfish,We thank N.

Recent theory predicts that both competition and predation (which causes apparent competition among prey) can either promote or limit species coexistence. Both mechanisms cause negative interactions between individuals, and each mechanism promotes stable coexistence if it causes negative interactions to be stronger between conspecifics than between heterospecifics. However, the relative importance of competition and predation for coexistence in natural communities is poorly known. Here, we study how competition and apparent competition via pre-dispersal seed predators affect the long-term fecundity of Protea shrubs in the fire-prone Fynbos biome (South Africa). These shrubs store all viable seeds produced since the last fire in fire-proof cones. Competitive effects on cone number and pre-dispersal seed predation reduce their fecundity and can thus limit recruitment after the next fire. In 27 communities comprising 49 990 shrubs of 22 Protea species, we measured cone number and per-cone seed predation rate of 2154 and 1755 focal individuals, respectively. Neighbourhood analyses related these measures to individual-based community maps. We found that conspecific neighbours had stronger competitive effects on cone number than heterospecific neighbours. In contrast, apparent competition via seed predators was comparable between conspecifics and heterospecifics. This indicates that competition stabilizes coexistence of Protea species, whereas pre-dispersal seed predation does not. Larger neighbours had stronger competitive effects and neighbours with large seed crops exerted stronger apparent competition. For 97% of the focal plants, competition reduced fecundity more than apparent competition. Our results show that even in communities of closely related and ecologically similar species, intraspecific competition can be stronger than interspecific competition. On the other hand, apparent competition through seed predators need not have such a stabilizing effect. These findings illustrate the potential of community demography', the demographic study of multiple interacting species, for understanding plant coexistence.","[Nottebrock, Henning; Treurnicht, Martina; Pagel, Joern; Schurr, Frank M.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, August von Hartmann Str 3, DE-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schurr, Frank M.] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, UMR 5554, Montpellier, France; [Schmid, Baptiste; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Schleuning, Matthias] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmid, Baptiste; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Schleuning, Matthias] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Frankfurt, Germany; [Boehning-Gaese, Katrin] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Frankfurt, Germany; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schmid, Baptiste; Treurnicht, Martina; Esler, Karen J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Biol & Entomol, Matieland, South Africa; [Nottebrock, Henning; Schmid, Baptiste; Treurnicht, Martina; Esler, Karen J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Matieland, South Africa","Nottebrock, H (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, August von Hartmann Str 3, DE-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",henning@nottebrock.net,"Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019; Schurr, Frank M./O-6575-2016; Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015","Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586; Schurr, Frank M./0000-0002-4518-0602; Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X; Pagel, Jorn/0000-0002-4817-1920; Schmid, Baptiste/0000-0002-7736-7527","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHU2259/3-1, SCHL 1934/1-1]","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation [grant no.

The thrips species Frankliniella occidentalis and Thrips tabaci are highly invasive and damaging agricultural pests throughout the world. Where the species co-occur, one species tends to eventually predominate over the other. Avermectin and beta-cypermethrin are commonly used insecticides to manage thrips in China, and laboratory bioassays demonstrated that F. occidentalis is significantly less susceptible than T. tabaci to these insecticides. In laboratory cage trials in which both species were exposed to insecticide treated cabbage plants, F. occidentalis became the predominant species. In contrast, T. tabaci completely displaced F. occidentalis on plants that were not treated with insecticides. In field trials, the species co-existed on cabbage before insecticide treatments began, but with T. tabaci being the predominant species. Following application of avermectin or beta-cypermethrin, F. occidentalis became the predominant species, while in plots not treated with insecticides, T. tabaci remained the predominant species. These results indicate that T. tabaci is an intrinsically superior competitor to F. occidentalis, but its competitive advantage can be counteracted through differential susceptibilities of the species to insecticides. These results further demonstrate the importance of external factors, such as insecticide applications, in mediating the outcome of interspecific interactions and produce rapid unanticipated shifts in the demographics of pest complexes.","[Zhao, Xueyin; Yuan, Huiguo; Lei, Zhongren; Gao, Yulin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Reitz, Stuart R.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Malheur Cty Extens, 710 SW 5th Ave, Ontario, OR 97914 USA; [Paini, Dean Ronald] CSIRO, Black Mt Labs, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia","Gao, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",gaoyulin@caas.cn,"Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019; Paini, Dean R/C-2341-2009",,"National Key Research and Development Program Key Special Projects [2016YFC1200603]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31371942]","This study is financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program Key Special Projects (2016YFC1200603), the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31371942).",,48,15,18,1,31,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JAN 13,2017,7,,,,,,,,,10.1038/srep40512,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,EI0OM,WOS:000392173800001,28084404,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Here, we studied the role of interspecific competition on the generation of trait diversity using a two-species model system of marine, surface-associated bacteria. Bacterial biofilms of Phaeobacter inhibens were established alone or in competition with Pseudoalteromonas tunicata and phenotypic traits of dispersal cells were assessed during biofilm development. P. inhibens dispersal isolates from competition biofilms displayed less phenotypic variation, were superior competitors, were less susceptible to predation, and reached higher planktonic biomass than isolates from noncompetition biofilms. Moreover, the maintenance of competitive ability exhibited by individual dispersal isolates from competition biofilms did not result in an obvious reduction (measured as a negative trait correlation) in other traits, but was rather positively correlated with planktonic growth. However, where negative correlations between traits were found, they were exhibited by individuals derived from noncompetitive biofilms, whose populations also had a higher degree of trait variation than those from biofilms experiencing competition. Our observations indicate that interspecific competition during biofilm formation is important for maintaining both competitive ability and affects variation in ecologically relevant traits. Given that most bacteria in biofilms exist in diverse, multispecies communities, an understanding of how bacteria respond to biotic factors such as interspecific competition is critical for understanding the dynamics of bacterial populations in both ecological and evolutionary time.","[Lutz, Carla; Thomas, Torsten; Steinberg, Peter; Kjelleberg, Staffan; Egan, Suhelen] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lutz, Carla; Thomas, Torsten; Kjelleberg, Staffan; Egan, Suhelen] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Steinberg, Peter] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Steinberg, Peter; Kjelleberg, Staffan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Ctr Environm Life Sci Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Steinberg, Peter] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, Australia","Lutz, C (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Lutz, C (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",clutz@ntu.edu.sg,"Kjelleberg, Staffan/C-9229-2015; Kjelleberg, Staffan/AAB-4641-2020","Kjelleberg, Staffan/0000-0003-4271-6413; Kjelleberg, Staffan/0000-0003-4271-6413; Thomas, Torsten/0000-0001-9557-3001; Egan, Suhelen/0000-0003-3286-4279","Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council; Centre for Marine Bio-innovation (CMB), at the University of New South Wales, Australia","The authors would like to acknowledge Frauke Bach and Wing Ka Ho for assistance with initial work detailing the biofilm formation and describing colony variation on P. inhibens 2.10.

To date, however, little empirical evidence exists on the strength of interspecific competition in shaping animal communities in fragmented landscapes. Our aim was to measure the degree of ongoing competitive interference between species in fragmented landscapes. Our model system was the community of ground-dwelling rodents in deciduous woodlands in central Italy, composed of a habitat generalist species (Apodemus sylvaticus) and two forest specialists (Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus). Our objectives were to test whether species were segregated among forest patches and whether spatial segregation was determined by interspecific competition or habitat and resource availability. We surveyed the populations inhabiting 29 woodland patches in a highly fragmented landscape using a capture-mark-recapture protocol, capturing > 4500 individuals. First we modelled species' distribution as a function of habitat, resource availability and landscape variables. The second stage of our analyses involved measuring the response of vital rate parameters (body mass, reproduction, survival, recruitment, population density) to competitor density. The relative distribution of species reflected a spatial segregation of habitat generalists and specialists according to habitat quality, cover and connectivity. Interspecific competition mainly affected individual level vital rates, whereas we found no substantial effects at the population level. Competitive exclusion of specialist species by generalist species was occurring. However, when compared to other factors such as habitat connectivity and resource availability, interspecific competition played a relatively minor role in shaping the studied community.","[Sozio, Giulia; Mortelliti, Alessio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Mortelliti, Alessio] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Environm Res Program, Australian Res Council Ctr Environm Decis, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Mortelliti, Alessio] Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Sozio, G (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",giulia.sozio@fastwebnet.it,"Sozio, Giulia/E-1725-2016","Sozio, Giulia/0000-0002-9659-0249",University of Rome La Sapienza''; CFS (Corpo Forestale dello Stato) through the University of Rome La Sapienza'',"Two anonymous reviewers provided valuable and constructive feedback on our manuscript.

If a less damaging herbivore indirectly suppresses the abundance of a more damaging herbivore via these mechanisms, then plants may ultimately benefit. Changes in herbivore density, however, can dictate the intensity of species interactions and may play a critical role in determining the outcome of plant-and predator-mediated herbivore interactions. We tested the effects of herbivore density on the strength of indirect interactions among phloem-feeding aphids and herbivorous caterpillars and the outcome of these interactions for their shared host plant, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). We quantified the survival of caterpillars on host plants that were infested with varying densities of aphids in the presence and absence of predators (ladybeetles). We found that aphids induced defensive proteins in cotton plants and that caterpillar survival was negatively affected by induced resistance. Likewise, we found that the presence of aphids increased predation of caterpillars by ladybeetles, but that apparent competition between aphids and caterpillars was density dependent. Ladybeetles consumed relatively high numbers of small caterpillars at low to intermediate aphid densities, but essentially became aphid specialists at high aphid densities. Aphid induced defenses and apparent competition combined such that plant damage by caterpillars was lowest when predators were present at low aphid density (induced resistance + highest level of apparent competition). This suggests that herbivores can benefit plants, but the effect on host plants is mediated by herbivore density. Indirect herbivore-plant mutualisms may increase plant quality, plant fitness, and yield of crop plants and these interactions need to be considered in ecologically based pest management plans. In addition, these interactions likely alter arthropod community structure and natural selection on anti-herbivore defense traits in plants in natural systems.","[Ramirez, Ricardo A.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Eubanks, Micky D.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Ramirez, RA (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ricardo.ramirez@usu.edu,"Ramirez, Ricardo/AAE-8394-2021",,U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI-2008-02341],"We thank P.

The model system is studied analytically and the threshold values for the existence and stability of various steady states are worked out. The global stability analysis is carried out. It is observed that if the intrinsic growth rate of prey population crosses a certain critical value, the system enters into Hopf bifurcation. The existence of bionomic equilibrium of the system has been discussed. Further, we study a path of optimal harvesting policy by introducing the Pontryagins maximum principle. Moreover we have found out a condition for diffusive instability of a locally stable equilibrium. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed to justify analytical findings.

However, the factors that influence the evolution of elevational distributions remain uncertain. I used a database of sister species of tropical montane birds from 41 families and three regionsthe Neotropics, the Himalayas, and New Guineato test whether patterns of elevational divergence were consistent with (1) a stochastic process, (2) ecological sorting of elevational divergence that occurred in allopatry, or (3) elevational divergence driven by competitive interactions upon secondary contact. The stochastic and ecological sorting hypotheses predict that increased elevational divergence in sympatric sister species is explained by their greater evolutionary age, whereas the competitive interactions hypothesis predicts that elevational divergence is explained by geographical overlap. I found that genetic distances were unrelated to elevational divergence and that allopatric sister species occupied similar elevational distributions regardless of genetic distance in each region. Instead, sympatry was the only significant predictor of elevational divergence; regardless of evolutionary age, sympatric sister species had greater elevational divergence than allopatric sister species in each region, as predicted by the competitive interactions hypothesis. Importantly, this pattern occurred in all three geographic regions, which suggests that competition-driven elevational divergence upon secondary contact is a general process of community assembly in tropical montane avifaunas.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bgf27@cornell.edu,,,Cornell Lab of Ornithology; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [2011083591],"W.

One of the most pervasive selective forces stems from antagonists such as parasites. Whereas hosts of microparasites developed sophisticated immune systems, social parasites select for behavioural host defences. Here, we investigated the link between parasite pressure exerted by the socially parasitic slavemaking ant Protomognathus americanus and colony-level aggression in Temnothorax ants from 17 populations. We studied almost the entire geographic range of two host species, including unparasitized populations. As previous studies have demonstrated that host colonies responding highly aggressively towards conspecifics fare better during slavemaker attacks, we predicted higher aggression levels in severely parasitized populations. Indeed, we demonstrate an increase in aggression towards conspecifics with parasite pressure, a pattern that was consistent over the two host species. In contrast to other studies, aggression against the parasite itself did not shift with parasite pressure. This may be explained by an absence of costs of parasite-specific aggression in parasite-free populations. The preferred host species T.longispinosus was generally more aggressive; however, the association between parasite pressure and aggression was found for both species, suggesting convergent co-adaptation. Two potentially confounding factors, colony density and the co-occurrence of a competing Temnothorax species in the community, could not explain the level of colony aggression in intra- and interspecific interactions. Instead, our study points to social parasite pressure as the determining factor shaping antagonistic interactions within, but not between, host species.","[Kleeberg, Isabelle; Jongepier, Evelien; Job, Sylwester; Foitzik, Susanne] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","Kleeberg, I (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool, Johannes von Muller Weg 6, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",kleeberi@uni-mainz.de,"Foitzik, Susanne/A-6504-2019","Foitzik, Susanne/0000-0001-8161-6306; Jongepier, Evelien/0000-0003-0206-5396","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Fo 298/9-2, Fo 298/11-2]; Huyck Preserve","We are thankful to the E.N.

Yet, whether intra- and interspecific competition can have non-additive effects has rarely been tested. The resulting fitness consequences of such non-additive interactions are important to provide the context necessary to advance our understanding of competition theory. We compared the strength of additive and non-additive intra- and interspecific competition by manipulating densities of a pair of larval salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum and A.maculatum) in experimental mesocosms within a response surface design. Intraspecific density had the strongest effect on the strength of competition for both species, and few observed comparisons indicated interspecific competition was an important factor in predicting body size, growth or larval period length of either species. Non-additive effects of intra- and interspecific competition influenced some response variables, including size and mass at metamorphosis in A.maculatum, but at a reduced strength compared to intraspecific effects alone. Intraspecific competition was thus the dominant biotic interaction, but non-additive effects also impact the outcome of competition in these species, validating the importance of testing for and incorporating non-additive density effects into competition models.","[Anderson, Thomas L.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 105 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",tlarkf@mail.missouri.edu,,,Watershed Studies Institute,"We would like to thank C.

They should therefore modify their resource exploitation decisions accordingly. In such a direct competition situation, theory predicts that individuals should stay longer on a resource patch than when foraging alone. However, models predicting patch residence time focus on intraspecific competition without agonistic interactions. Here, we investigate the patch use strategies of females of two parasitoid species, Eupelmus vuilleti and Dinarmus basalis, attacking the same host, Callosobruchus maculatus, knowing that D. basalis is more aggressive and can exclude E. vuilleti during pairwise contests for single hosts. Our results showed that time allocation and oviposition strategies differed in relation to the species and type of competition (i.e., presence/absence of competitor, simultaneous/sequential female introduction or resident/intruder female). Eupelmus vuilleti females tended to wait in the patch surroundings for D. basalis females' departure to return and exploit hosts parasitized by the opponent (after destruction of her eggs). In contrast, D. basalis females tended to self-superparasitize and stay motionless near the hosts. After detecting an E. vuilleti female entering the patch, they attacked and chased her permanently from the patch. Females of both species spent less time in the patch when faced with a competitor than when alone. This study is the first to test the influence of direct interspecific competition and arrival order on patch exploitation strategies in parasitoid species, and highlights the necessity to include agonistic behaviors in theoretical models predicting optimal patch residence time in competitive situations.","[Mohamad, Rihab; Monge, Jean-Paul; Goubault, Marlene] Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, UMR CNRS 7261, Inst Rech Biol Insecte, F-37200 Tours, France; [Wajnberg, Eric] INRA, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France","Goubault, M (corresponding author), Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, UMR CNRS 7261, Inst Rech Biol Insecte, Parc Grandmont, F-37200 Tours, France.",marlene.goubault@univ-tours.fr,"Goubault, Marlene/B-4771-2016; Wajnberg, Eric/A-4862-2009","Goubault, Marlene/0000-0002-9452-7668; Wajnberg, Eric/0000-0002-6700-7114",Institut de Recherche sur la Biologie de l'Insecte (France); Al-Baath University (Syria),"We thank R.

Where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the numerically dominant species within these infections, prognosis is significantly worse. However, in many individuals, Haemophilus influenzae predominates, a scenario associated with less severe disease. The mechanisms that determine which pathogen is most abundant are not known. We hypothesised that the distribution of H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa would be consistent with strong interspecific competition effects. Further, we hypothesised that where P. aeruginosa is predominant, it is associated with a distinct 'accessory microbiota' that reflects a significant interaction between this pathogen and the wider bacterial community. To test these hypotheses, we analysed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing data generated previously from 60 adult bronchiectasis patients, whose airway microbiota was dominated by either P. aeruginosa or H. influenzae. The relative abundances of the two dominant species in their respective groups were not significantly different, and when present in the opposite pathogen group the two species were found to be in very low abundance, if at all. These findings are consistent with strong competition effects, moving towards competitive exclusion. Ordination analysis indicated that the distribution of the core microbiota associated with each pathogen, readjusted after removal of the dominant species, was significantly divergent (analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), R = 0.07, P = 0.019). Taken together, these findings suggest that both interspecific competition and also direct and/or indirect interactions between the predominant species and the wider bacterial community may contribute to the predominance of P. aeruginosa in a subset of bronchiectasis lung infections.","[Rogers, Geraint B.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, SAHMRI Infect & Immun Theme, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Rogers, Geraint B.; Serisier, David J.] Univ Queensland, Translat Res Inst, Immun Infect & Inflammat Program, Mater Res Inst, Woolloongabba, Qld, Australia; [van der Gast, Christopher J.] NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Serisier, David J.] Mater Adult Hosp, Dept Resp Med, South Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Rogers, GB (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, SAHMRI Infect & Immun Theme, N Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",geraint.rogers@sahmri.com,"Rogers, Geraint/AAD-1011-2020; Rogers, Geraint B/N-1957-2013; van der Gast, Christopher/G-1153-2011","Rogers, Geraint B/0000-0003-4054-1947; van der Gast, Christopher/0000-0003-1101-4048",Mater Adult Respiratory Research Trust Fund; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [ceh020002] Funding Source: researchfish,This study was supported by the Mater Adult Respiratory Research Trust Fund.,,41,38,39,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1751-7362,1751-7370,,ISME J,ISME J.,JAN,2015,9,1,,,,,217,225,,10.1038/ismej.2014.124,,,9,Ecology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,AZ4SK,WOS:000348212800018,25036925,"Green Accepted, Bronze, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

Competition has historically been viewed as the predominant process affecting plant community structure. In particular, it is often assumed that the dominant resident species is the superior competitor and therefore has large impacts on plant community diversity. This assumption, however, is seldom tested. As well, there are a variety of other processes such as dispersal limitation and seed predation that can influence community structure, although the relative importance of these processes in relation to competition from resident species is still unclear. 2. We examined how interspecific competition, dispersal limitation and post-dispersal seed predation by mice individually and interactively influenced the richness and diversity of local plant assemblages in grasslands of western Montana. 3. We added seeds of 20 mostly locally uncommon native species to subplots in and out of larger rodent exclosure plots. Using a 'species-blind' approach, we manipulated competition from resident plants in these subplots by removing the same amount of cover of one dominant species or several common species. 4. The species richness and diversity of local assemblages was higher in subplots with seed addition than without. Across all levels of the other treatments, average richness for subplots without competitor removal was lower than for competitor removal treatments. However, the removal of one locally dominant species had similar effects to removal of several common species. In contrast, preventing seed predation by mice did not have significant effects on richness. There were no significant interactions between the treatments. 5. Synthesis. Our results reveal a hierarchy of filters that determine local community structure. Many regionally rare species were dispersal limited and established after the seed addition, regardless of release from competition or the presence of seed predators. Subsequently, we found competitive equivalence between dominant and common species.","[Pinto, Sarah M.; Pearson, Dean E.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Missoula, MT 59801 USA","Pinto, SM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",sarahmariannepinto@gmail.com,,,USDA Cooperative State ResearchUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35101-16040]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0614406]; U.S. Bureau of Land Management,"We thank Ray Callaway, Winsor Lowe, Lisa Eby and Yvette Ortega for their extensive guidance and feedback.

Such plant-plant interaction, often expressed in terms of biomass yields observed from field or laboratory experiments, reveals the plants' competitiveness for resources such as water and nutrients. In computational modelling of the coupled changes in hydrology and plant growth, the interaction between plants can be expressed by the competition coefficients in model algorithms such as the Lotka-Volterra system of equations. The competition coefficients determine the plant dynamics and the hydrological processes because vegetation distribution affects the partitioning of water. Therefore, it is imperative to apply appropriate competition coefficients to understand water partitioning by the plants for their growth. For such evaluation of competition coefficients, in this study, we used a coupled groundwater-vegetation predictive model, in which competition coefficients chosen to represent different competitive scenarios were input to simulate the plants' biomass and water use. The simulated biomass and water use were then used to calculate competition coefficients. The results demonstrated that rather than merely confirming the occurrence of competition, neither biomass nor water use measures, by themselves, will be sufficient for describing the entwined relationship that drives the competitive interaction between the plants. We therefore recommend a combined evaluation of both water use and biomass yield for better parameterization of competition coefficients implemented in ecohydrological models.

Previous studies revealed that A. macrophthalmus is able to host-shift to several mimosoid species. Here, we aim to test the host-shift potential to other mimosoid and non-mimosoid plants and possible roles of interspecific competition, genetic background, and plant chemistry in host-shift. First, we found that A. macrophthalmus predator completed development on two new hosts: pigeon pea Cajanus cajan and Cajanus scarabaeoides (Faboideae), by rearing from seeds collected in South/Southeast Asia and Hawaii. In contrast, in most regions, both Cajanus species were infested only by other beetle species. Second, we performed no-choice tests using 11 leguminous plants, covering all three subfamilies as potential hosts, including the two new hosts. A Taiwanese A. macrophthalmus population reared in the laboratory on Leucaena did not deposit eggs on any of the seeds of each tested species. To compare host-shift responses between populations, we also used a Hawaiian A. macrophthalmus population that had completed its development on freshly collected Leucaena seeds from the field. This population deposited eggs onto and hatching larvae burrowed into C. cajan seeds, although none developed beyond the larval stage. Third, the surface chemical composition of seed-pods of L. leucocephala and the two Cajanus species was dissimilar, although that of seeds was highly similar. Finally, all of the host-shifting A. macrophthalmus populations shared the same haplotypic group.","[Tuda, M.] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Inst Biol Control, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wu, L. -H.; Wu, W. -J.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Yamada, N.; Kagoshima, K.] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wang, C. -P.] Council Agr, Taiwan Forestry Res Inst, Silviculture Div, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Buranapanichpan, S.] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Chen, Z. -Q.] Yunnan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Teramoto, K.

However, theoretical approaches have largely focused on explaining steady-state behaviour and fitting snapshots of data. Here we show that local and niche interspecific competition can realistically and parsimoniously explain the observed non-equilibrium regime of permanent plots of nine tropical forests, in eight different countries. Our spatially-explicit model, besides predicting with accuracy the main biodiversity metrics for these plots, can also reproduce their dynamics. A central finding is that tropical tree species have a universal niche width of approximately 1/6 of the niche axis that echoes the observed widespread convergence in their functional traits enabling them to exploit similar resources and to coexist despite of having large niche overlap. This niche width yields an average ratio of 0.25 between interspecific and intraspecific competition that corresponds to an intermediate value between the extreme claims of the neutral model and the classical niche-based model of community assembly (where interspecific competition is dominant). In addition, our model can explain and yield observed spatial patterns that classical niche-based and neutral theories cannot.","[Fort, Hugo] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Inst Phys, Complex Syst Grp, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Inchausti, Pablo] Univ Republ, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Maldonado, Uruguay","Inchausti, P (corresponding author), Univ Republ, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Maldonado, Uruguay.",pablo.inchausti.f@gmail.com,,,"PEDECIBA; SNI of Uruguay; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0640386, DEB-0425651, DEB-0346488, DEB-0129874, DEB-00753102, DEB-9909347, DEB-9615226, DEB-9405933, DEB-9221033, DEB-9100058, DEB-8906869, DEB-8605042, DEB-8206992, DEB-7922197]; Center for Tropical Forest ScienceSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; John D. and Catherine T.

The ability of a species to respond appropriately to risk cues may determine the outcome of interspecific competition. We investigated whether two invasive mussel species, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and the quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, differ in their behavioural responses to risk cues released from round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, and rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus. In response to risk cues, both species increased their attachment strength, aggregated more, increased the use of a refuge habitat and decreased clearance rates. Although attachment strength, aggregation rate and refuge habitat use was greater for zebra than for quagga mussels, the strength of predator-induced responses was similar in the two mussel species for all behaviours except for filtering activity. Zebra mussels decreased clearance rates more when exposed to predator risk cues than quagga mussels. Both mussels decreased clearance rates the most with rusty crayfish risk cues present. Since these responses have a fitness cost associated with lower growth rates, the stronger response of zebra mussels may make this species competitively inferior to quagga mussels in an initial low-predation environment when few native predators are feeding on these mussels. This advantage may shift to zebra mussels over time if native predators learn or adapt to feed on the dreissenids. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In peatlands, Sphagnum faces the threat of drought and differentiates into hummock species (drought-tolerant) and hollow species. Whether interspecific interaction affects the influence of drought on bryophyte composition in peatlands is unknown. We established an experiment by simulating drought and building bryophyte communities with two hummock species (S. palustre and S. capillifolium) and one hollow species (S. fallax). In all three species, drought decreased biomass production, height increment and side-shoot production. Sphagnum stores water in the hyaline cells, and leaf hyaline cell percentage (HCP) in the two hummock species increased with drought while no effect was found in S. fallax, suggesting that adjusting HCP is not an effective response to drought for the hollow species. Morphological traits and carbon and nitrogen contents in hummock species responded more to drought than in the hollow species, indicating a rapid response in phenotypic plasticity is an important strategy to resist drought in the hummock species. The presence of neighboring Sphagnum species, rather than drought, decreased carbon content for all three species. All three bryophytes showed interaction between drought and neighbor in two or more plant traits. Our study, however, did not support SGH, and there were no changes from competition under wet to facilitation under dry treatments in any of the six species combinations. On the contrary, when S. fallax was the target species, a change from facilitation under wet to competition under dry treatments was observed. The results suggest that hummock species can facilitate hollow species in wet environments but they could suppress hollow species under drought conditions by competing for water resources. Both drought and strong competition are the probable reasons why hollow species rarely grow in hummocks.","[Bu, Zhao-Jun; Zheng, Xing-Xing; Ma, Jinze] NE Normal Univ, Inst Peat & Mire Res, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Veg, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Bu, Zhao-Jun] NE Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Rydin, Hakan] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Plant Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bu, Zhao-Jun; Moore, Tim] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Bu, Zhao-Jun; Moore, Tim] McGill Univ, Global Environm & Climate Change Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada","Bu, ZJ (corresponding author), NE Normal Univ, Inst Peat & Mire Res, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Veg, Renmin 5268, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",buzhaojun@nenu.edu.cn,,"Ma, Jinze/0000-0003-4652-614X","Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30700055, 40971036]; Operation Expenses for Universities' Basic Scientific Research of Central Authorities [11GJHZ003]","This study was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Contract No. 30700055 and No. 40971036) and Operation Expenses for Universities' Basic Scientific Research of Central Authorities (No. 11GJHZ003).

Pairwise AMOVA analyses of 277 mtDNA COI sequences supported significant population differentiation among the majority of sampling sites. The geographic mitochondrial structure was not supported by nuclear ITS-2 sequencing, probably attributed to a recent divergence. The three-host generalist, A. hebraeum, showed less mtDNA geographic structure, and a lower level of genetic diversity, while the more host-specific H. rufipes displayed higher levels of population differentiation and two distinct mtDNA assemblages (one predominantly confined to South Africa/Namibia and the other to Mozambique and East Africa). A zone of overlap is present in southern Mozambique. A mechanistic climate model suggests that climate alone cannot be responsible for the disruption in female gene flow. Our findings furthermore suggest that female gene dispersal of ticks is more dependent on the presence of juvenile hosts in the environment than on the ability of adult hosts to disperse across the landscape. Documented interspecific competition between the juvenile stages of H. rufipes and H. truncatum is implicated as a contributing factor towards disrupting gene flow between the two southern African H. rufipes genetic assemblages.","[Cangi, Nidia; Matthee, Conrad A.] Univ Stellenbosch, Evolutionary Genom Grp, Dept Bot & Zool, Matieland, South Africa; [Horak, Ivan G.] Univ Pretoria, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Vet Trop Dis, ZA-0110 Onderstepoort, South Africa; [Apanaskevich, Dmitry A.] Georgia So Univ, US Natl Tick Collect, James H Oliver Jr Inst Coastal Plain Sci, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Matthee, Sonja] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Matieland, South Africa; [das Neves, Luis C.

Competition is reduced by specializing on different prey and/or spatio-temporal separation, usually leading to different food habits. We predicted that two closely related species of large cats, the endangered snow leopard and the near-threatened common leopard, living in sympatry, would coexist through habitat separation and exploitation of different prey species. In central Himalaya, we assessed (2006-2010) habitat and diet overlap between these carnivores. The snow leopard used grassland and shrubland, whereas the common leopard selected forest. Contrary to our prediction, snow leopard and common leopard preyed upon similar wild (Himalayan tahr, musk deer) and domestic species (Bos spp., dogs). Dietary overlap between snow leopard and common leopard was 69% (yearly), 76% (colder months) and 60% (warmer months). Thus, habitat separation should be the result of other factors, most likely avoidance of interspecific aggression. Habitat separation may not always lead to the use of different prey. Avoidance of interspecific aggression, rather than exploitation of different resources, could allow the coexistence of potentially competing large predators.","[Lovari, S.; Minder, I.; Ferretti, F.; Pellizzi, B.] Ev K2 CNR, Bergamo, Italy; [Lovari, S.; Minder, I.; Ferretti, F.; Pellizzi, B.] Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Lovari, S.; Minder, I.; Ferretti, F.] Univ Siena, Biodivers & Conservat Network, BIOCONNET, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Mucci, N.; Randi, E.] ISPRA, Ozzano Dell Emilia, BO, Italy","Lovari, S (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",lovari@unisi.it,"; Preatoni, Damiano/A-8621-2010","LOVARI, Sandro/0000-0002-9945-0268; Preatoni, Damiano/0000-0001-8760-1316; Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0002-0414-1615","Project SHARE (Ev-K2-CNR, Italy); Italian Ministry of Foreign AffairsMinistry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy)","We are grateful to National Academy of Sciences and Technology and especially to A.

This study aimed to evaluate the intraspecific and interspecific competition between two contrasting tree species and to determine the distance over which competition can be observed. Competition was estimated using Hegyi's index, implemented using the Simile visual modeling environment, and calibrated using nonlinear least squares with PEST. Interactions were detected between pairs of stems closer than D (ij) < 40(d (i) + d (j) ) where D is distance (in centimeters) and d is stem diameter (in centimeters diameter at breast height). F. brayleyana trees surrounded by A. cunninghamii trees experience negligible competition, whereas A. cunninghamii surrounded by F. brayleyana trees suffer strong competition. Forty times diameter offers a useful guide to the extent of competition in even-aged stands planted with these species. Competition can be observed empirically when pairs of trees are closer than 40 times the sum of their diameters, but the intensity of the competition may vary considerably with species.","[Vanclay, Jerome K.; Cameron, David M.] So Cross Univ, Forest Res Ctr, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Lamb, David; Erskine, Peter D.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Mined Land Rehabil, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Vanclay, JK (corresponding author), So Cross Univ, Forest Res Ctr, POB 157, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.",jerry.vanclay@scu.edu.au; d.lamb@uq.edu.au; p.erskine@uq.edu.au,"Erskine, Peter D/U-3136-2018; Vanclay, Jerome/B-9266-2009","Erskine, Peter D/0000-0002-8298-2866; Vanclay, Jerome/0000-0002-5639-5481",Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC)Rural Industries R&D Corp [UQ-18A]; National Afforestation Program,"The trial was established on land generously made available by Don and Audrey Pickering, with funding provided to Greening Australia (Queensland) by the National Afforestation Program.

A potential mechanism is intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly competitive, it should include threat and display features associated with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack these features and be associated with feeding. In the first of two captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the aggressive response of ship rats towards mice lacked threat and display features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles predatory behaviour. Our findings provide a better understanding of the interactions between ship rats and house mice, which hinder their management where they coexist as damaging invaders. However, further research is required to determine whether the results of our captive experiments are consistent with wild rat behaviour. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea), two species of whip snakes (Colubridae) co-occur, one of them being abundant and widespread () and the other being localized and critically endangered (). A previous hypothesis suggested that the latter species would be confined to suboptimal habitats by the former species, which is a stronger competitor for food. As a consequence, would not only be rare but would also be smaller in body size in Sardinia than in other regions of its range where does not occur. In 1999-2010, we studied habitat selection, food habits, and body sizes of these two snakes in sympatric populations, applying a suite of statistical tools including null models and Monte Carlo simulations. We observed that dietary habits were different between species (compared to , more frequently preyed upon rodents and less frequently on lizards, and within rodent prey, more frequently upon and less frequently upon ), but not in a way compatible with competitively induced trophic niche partitioning. The two species were similar in terms of prey size and predator-size-prey-size relationships. They also differed in habitat selection (maquis was the preferred habitat for both, but was found significantly more often than in grasslands, cultivations, and artificial pinewoods) but again in a non-competitively directed way. In addition, there was no evidence for the hypothesis that was confined to suboptimal habitats. Body sizes were similar between species (with males being significantly larger than females), and Sardinian were not smaller than conspecifics inhabiting regions without . Overall, our study showed that the two species differed in some aspects of their ecology, but these differences could not be due to competitive interactions. The conservation implications of these results are also discussed.","[Luiselli, Luca; Rugiero, Lorenzo] Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Capula, Massimo] Museo Civ Zool, Herpetol Sect, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Salvi, Daniele] Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet CIBIO, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Akani, Godfrey C.] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, Port Harcourt, Nigeria","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Salvi, Daniele/I-6360-2013; Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020","Salvi, Daniele/0000-0002-3804-2690; ",Italian Ministry of Environment [DPN-2009-0005106]; Eni; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BPD/66592/2009],"We are grateful to Ricardo Jorge Lopes for kindly providing an data on feeding.

Both are natural enemies of herbivorous mites and insects and used in biological control of spider mites and thrips in various agricultural crops. Both are generalist predators that may also feed on plant-derived substances such as pollen. Irrespective of diet (pollen or spider mites), N. cucumeris females had higher predation and oviposition rates and shorter attack latencies on IG prey than N. californicus. Predation rates on larvae were unaffected by diet but larvae from pollen-fed mothers were a more profitable prey than those from spider-mite fed mothers resulting in higher oviposition rates of IG predator females. Pollen-fed protonymphs were earlier attacked by IG predator females than spider-mite fed protonymphs. Spider mite-fed N. californicus females attacked protonymphs earlier than did pollen-fed N. californicus females. Overall, our study suggests that predator and prey diet may exert subtle influences on mutual IGP between bio-control agents. Matching diets did not intensify IGP between N. californicus and N. cucumeris but predator and prey diets proximately influenced IGP through changes in behaviour and/or stoichiometry.","[Mendel, D.; Schausberger, P.] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Dept Appl Plant Sci & Plant Biotechnol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Dept Appl Plant Sci & Plant Biotechnol, Peter Jordanstr 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",peter.schausberger@boku.ac.at,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",,,,33,13,16,0,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-2048,1439-0418,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

Prior research suggests that emergence and early survival of these two weeds is far higher on bare ground than in areas with interspecific competition, but this relationship has not been well quantified. We studied the effects of microsite size and watering regime on the emergence and early survival of these invasive thistles. Microsite competition was found to significantly negatively affect successful emergence and first-month survivorship of both species, while additional water was not found to significantly increase seedling emergence. These findings suggest that adequate bare ground is an important predictor of successful thistle establishment, and thus that conservation practices aimed at reducing available microsites should help to limit the invasion of these two species.","[Ruggiero, D.

The main paradigms have shifted among the importance of competition, predation and abiotic conditions as determinants of community structure. Differential habitat selection is considered to reduce competition and hence allow co-existence. Our goal was to test hypotheses regarding how breeding site use of a population that was patchily distributed on a dynamic floodplain may facilitate coexistence: 1) do species co-occur randomly or do they occur more or less often than expected by chance? 2) Do species use the same habitat types in equal proportions or do they use them differentially? 3) If they use habitat types differentially, is this differential use related to abiotic and biotic conditions? 4) Does interspecific competition predict breeding site use or do abiotic conditions and predation risk better predict habitat use? We collected presence/absence (i.e. detection/nondetection) data of egg clutches and larvae of four pond-breeding anuran species during a two year study at a total of 353 ponds. We used site occupancy models and model averaging techniques to predict breeding site selection in relation to habitat types, abiotic and biotic factors. These parameters were corrected for imperfect detection of species. The rates of co-occurrence were consistently higher than expected by chance. Species differed in the use of the main habitat types. Habitat types that were used by multiple species were used in a species-specific manner in relation to both abiotic conditions and predation risk. Species preferred ponds where other species and fish were present. Although niche differentiation in breeding site selection is evident, our results do not support the pervasive role of competition avoidance in governing current breeding site selection. We conclude that differential habitat use and differences in response to abiotic conditionsand predation risk can override competitive interactions, thereby facilitating local co-existence and high species diversity.","[Indermaur, Lukas; Jokela, Jukka] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Indermaur, Lukas; Jokela, Jukka] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, IGB, Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, DE-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, DE-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolut Biol & Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] KARCH, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland","Indermaur, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",lukas.indermaur@eawag.ch,"Tockner, Klement/G-9265-2011; Jokela, Jukka/F-8626-2010; Schmidt, Benedikt R./B-8491-2008","Schmidt, Benedikt R./0000-0002-4023-1001; Tockner, Klement/0000-0002-0038-8151; Jokela, Jukka/0000-0002-1731-727X",MAVA Fondation pour la nature'' (Switzerland),"We are grateful to Fabienne Sutter and Simone Blaser for field data collection, and to Marc Kery and Jeff Laake for help in modelling issues.

In this study, we consider the importance of disturbance (salinity) and predator and competitor variables on mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in small ephemeral water bodies across the Wheatbelt of Western Australia. Similar to mosquitoes, and contrary to general perceptions, nonculicid aquatic fauna (aquatic fauna) had a common occurrence (number or percentage of water bodies occupied) and were abundant (average density) in ephemeral water bodies, albeit with a simplified trophic structure. The occurrence and density (number per unit area) of aquatic fauna between water bodies were highly variable, but general relationships of aquatic fauna with rainfall, water body surface area, salinity, and mosquitoes were apparent. In contrast to mosquitoes, the density of aquatic fauna declined with recent rainfall, implying mosquitoes may colonize newly created water bodies more quickly than aquatic fauna. Assemblages (richness and density of taxa) of aquatic fauna changed along a salinity gradient, as did mosquitoes, and this was pronounced for predator groups. Densities of mosquitoes were not limited by any single taxonomic group, by a negative relationship. However, the density and richness of mosquitoes generally declined in association with increased richness of predators and density of all other taxa (taxa not specifically classified as predators or competitors of mosquitoes). These relationships may account for higher densities of mosquitoes in smaller water bodies, where richness of predators is reduced and the density of other taxa does not differ from larger water bodies. Our results also suggest salinity in the Western Australia Wheatbelt may facilitate greater abundance of halotolerant mosquitoes, Aedes alboannulatus Macquart and Aedes camptorhynchus Thomson (a vector of Ross River virus [Togoviridae: Alphavirus]), by releasing them from biotic regulation.","[Carver, Scott] Univ Montana, Montana Tech, Dept Biol, Butte, MT 59701 USA; [Carver, Scott; Spafford, Helen; Storey, Andrew] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M085, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Carver, Scott; Weinstein, Philip] Univ Western Australia, Sch Populat Hlth M431, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Spafford, Helen] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Plant & Environm Protect Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Weinstein, Philip] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia","Carver, S (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Tech, Dept Biol, 1300 Pk St, Butte, MT 59701 USA.",scarver@mtech.edu,"Weinstein, Phil/C-9805-2011; Carver, Scott/J-7654-2014","Carver, Scott/0000-0002-3579-7588; Weinstein, Philip/0000-0001-9860-7166",Australian Government Bureau of Rural SciencesAustralian Government; Australian and Jean Rogerson postgraduate awards; Department of Environment and Conservation,"We acknowledge the contribution of Jessica Lynas and Lisa Chandler for assistance in the laboratory and numerous volunteers that helped with all aspects of the field work.

The mechanisms of this interspecific competition must be known to understand the growth characteristics and primary productivity of stream periphyton communities. In the present study, a numerical simulation model is presented to describe the growth and interspecific competition between filamentous and nonfilamentous periphyton on a flat channel bed, in which the processes of the interspecific competition are an integral part of the modeling of growth strategies. The temporal growth of each kind of periphyton is calculated by balancing primary production, immigration, respiration, and detachment. For the modeling of primary production and respiration, transportation of nutrients and other substances inside the biofilm is estimated using diffusion equations including the effect of turbulent diffusivity near the channel bed surface. In estimating the immigration rate, different immigration functions for filamentous and nonfilamentous periphyton are used in order to represent the different effect of turbulent flow on the immigration strategy of each type of periphyton. A series of numerical computations under different hydraulic conditions shows that the degree of dominance of filamentous periphyton increases with time, and the net primary production of periphyton increases with increasing friction velocity.","[Toda, Yuji; Tsujimoto, Tetsuro] Nagoya Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Chikusa Ku, Aichi, Japan","Toda, Y (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Aichi, Japan.",ytoda@cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,,,,21,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",1860-1871,,,LANDSC ECOL ENG,Landsc.

The reaction and strike distances of the four species were examined during predator-prey trials using natural amphipod prey Gammarus spp. under varying light intensities (0-130 lx) to compare input from the mechanosensory lateral line and Visual systems. Trials in the dark (0 lx) indicated that the sculpins and the round goby had similar lateral line sensitivity. However, all three native species had a significant advantage in reaction and strike distance over the round goby at higher light intensities, Interspecific resource competition was assessed by pairing a round goby with a native fish in an artificial stream. Round gobies gained significantly more weight than the native fishes during all trials. Slimy sculpins were able to maintain their weight in the presence of the round goby: however. spoonhead sculpins and logperch lost a significant amount of Weight during the trials. These experiments indicate that although the round goby does not possess an inherent sensory advantage. it can dominate resources and outcompete native fish. Thus, round gobies may pose risks for a wide variety of native benthic fishes.","[Bergstrom, Margot A.; Mensinger, Allen F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, Duluth, MN 55812 USA","Mensinger, AF (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, 1035 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",amensing@d.umn.edu,"Schwalbe, Margot/AAV-5431-2020; Goforth, Reuben/B-1646-2010","Goforth, Reuben/0000-0001-6891-3146",Visualization and Digital Image Laboratory; Minnesota Sea Grant College U.S. Department of Commerce,"We thank Toni Hrabik, Michael Lynch, and Jamie Sloan for insightful comments on the manuscript.

The field experiments required to test this hypothesis are complex to implement, but the recent revival of regression methods offers a viable alternative. Here we use the dynamic and static regression methods to determine the importance of D. aurita as a competitor and intraguild predator. Capture-recapture data from two localities in the Rio de Janeiro State were used, Garrafao (municipality of Guapimirim), a coastal forest of the Serra do Mar, and Barra de Marica, a costal sand dune vegetation. Population and microhabitat variables were monitored from April 1997 to April 2003 in Garrafao, and from January 1986 to July 1990 in Barra de Marica. Microhabitat variables were related to Canopy, Plant, Litter and Rock covers, Obstruction from 0 to 1.5 m, and Number of logs. Exploitation competition was tested by the dynamic method, which models the effects of D. aurita on the per capita growth rate of a species. Interference by predation or competition was tested by the static method, where the abundance of D. aurita at trap stations was regressed against the abundance of other small mammals, after removal of any variation associated with microhabitat factors. Exploitation competition was not detected, but the interference of D. aurita was pervasive, affecting all small mammals studied in the two localities. The clear avoidance of D. aurita by all small mammals tested in two localities of different physiognomies indicates that it functions as an intraguild predator, even if actual predation by D. aurita is an occasional event.","[Vieira, Marcus V.; Cerqueira, Rui] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Vertebrados, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Vieira, MV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Vertebrados, CP 68020, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mvvieira@biologia.ufrj.br,"Vieira, Marcus/U-5314-2019; Vieira, Marcus/D-2540-2011; Cerqueira, Rui/E-5321-2011","Vieira, Marcus/0000-0002-4472-5447; ",IBAMA/MMA; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPERJFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ); FUJB; PIBIC/CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"Many colleagues and partners assisted in the fieldwork, particularly Joana Macedo, Diogo Loretto, Rosana Gentile and Simone Freitas.

We demonstrated that interspecific competition with the exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) significantly increases the daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. The effect of intraspecific competition on the daytime activity of salmon was half that of interspecific competition. This indicates that the effect of rainbow trout was a combination of increasing density and the identity of the competitor. We also demonstrated that the effect of rainbow trout was probably the result of territorial interference between species. Moreover, we showed that water temperature simultaneously played an important role in explaining daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. During twilight, we observed no effect of competition on salmon activity, but environmental cues other than temperature (e.g., invertebrate drift, cloud cover) became significant predictors of activity. Feeding and growth rates of Atlantic salmon were not affected by the different levels of competition. Nevertheless, the exotic species may have a major impact by exposing the native species to increased risks of daytime predation.","[Blanchet, Simon; Bernatchez, Louis; Dodson, Julian J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, CIRSA, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Blanchet, Simon; Bernatchez, Louis; Dodson, Julian J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, QC Ocean, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Loot, Geraldine] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France","Blanchet, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, CIRSA, Pavillon Vachon, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",blanchet@cict.fr; julian.dodson@bio.ulaval.ca,"Blanchet, Simon/AAA-5871-2019; Blanchet, Simon/D-4850-2013; Loot, Geraldine/A-6365-2011; Blanchet, Simon/A-2313-2010","Blanchet, Simon/0000-0002-3843-589X; Blanchet, Simon/0000-0002-3843-589X; Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We sincerely thank J.F.

Alternatively, these dense layers may indirectly lower tree recruitment by providing a haven for seed and seedling predators that prey on neighboring plant species. To Simultaneously test for resource competition and indirect, habitat-mediated effects, we factorially manipulated understory plant cover (removed versus intact) and predation (exclosures Versus controls) at three forested sites. We found that vegetation cover created privileged fora in, areas that increased seed removal and seedling predation rates. Predator preference was directly related to seed size with larger seeded species including Prunus serotina Ehrh. and Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. removed more readily than smaller seeded species such as Fraxinus americana L. We found strong species-specific evidence for habitat-mediated indirect effects establishment of P. serotina and Acer saccharum Marsh. was significantly lower under an intact hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula (Michx.) T. Moore) canopy when small mammals were present. Competition also played a strong role; both P. serotina and Acer rubrum L. survival as well as A. rubrum emergence were reduced under a fern canopy with or without seed predators. The impact of habitat-mediated indirect effects and resource competition appear to vary predictably based upon predator preferences and differences in the timing of woody seed dispersal and germination relative to vegetation cover phenology. Overall, our results suggest that habitat-mediated indirect effects may be common and Occur wherever vegetation provides the potential for creating privileged foraging areas.","[Royo, Alejandro A.; Carson, Walter P.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Royo, AA (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, No Res Stn, POB 267, Irvine, PA 16329 USA.",aroyo@fs.fed.us,"Carson, Walter/A-2569-2013",,,,,48,47,50,1,39,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Nevertheless, despite their prevalence in natural systems, parasites have been examined less often than other organisms traditionally used for testing hypotheses of community assembly. In the present study, we investigate possible effects of competitive interactions on patterns of distribution (co-occurrence) and density among a group of streblid bat flies parasitic on short-tailed fruit bats, Carollia perspicillata. Using null model analyses of species co-occurrence, we did not find evidence that competition affects the distribution of bat fly species across hosts. Moreover, when non-infested hosts were included, analyses showed evidence for interspecific aggregation, rather than for the segregation predicted by competition theory. Partial Pearson correlations among bat fly species densities showed no evidence of negative covariation in two of three cases. In the species pair for which a significant negative correlation was found, a visual analysis of plotted covariation indicated a constraint line, suggesting that competition between these two species might become operational only in some infracommunities when abundances of bat flies approach a maximum set by one or more limiting resources. Moreover, when a community-wide estimation of the significance of density compensation was calculated, the result was not significant. Overall, we find no evidence that competition influences the distribution of bat flies on their hosts, and mixed support for effects of competition on the densities of species. These results are consistent with the idea that competition plays a role in structuring natural communities, but in many systems its effects are context-dependent and might not be important relative to other factors. Wider analyses across taxonomic and environmental gradients and a detailed consideration of the different hypothesized effects of competition are necessary to fully understand the importance of competition on natural communities.","[Tello, J.

Loud.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) often grow together with numerous tall shrubs such as green alder (Alnus crispa (Air.) Pursh) and little-tree willow (Salix spp.). In an area south of Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada, we examined the effects of shrubs, herbs and other trees on nutrient and light availability and growth of white spruce and lodgepole pine. For white spruce the best competition measure (tested against volume increments of the past 3 years) was visually estimated % ground cover times the height of the competitor (VCHT) with light (DIFN) ranking in third place. For lodgepole pine, DIFN was the best competition measure for predicting volume increment and the best competition index was again VCHT. Taller conifers had a stronger competitive effect than tall shrubs, with their effect on white spruce being larger than that on lodgepole pine. Comparison of the effects of alder and willow indicates that both species are having negative effects on growth of pine and spruce on these sites with green alder having a stronger influence on spruce than pine due to the smaller size of the spruce. Herbaceous cover was having more effect on white spruce than lodgepole pine and may be related to both their height and differences in rooting depth. The results did not show any significant relationship (p > 0.05) between nitrogen availability and cover of alder and willow and between conifer foliar nutrient concentrations and cover of alder and willow. Our study suggests that the current Alberta regeneration standards may be overestimating the effect that competing vegetation has on conifer growth since significant growth reduction occurs only at high shrub densities.

Tzvel., a perennial grass, is a dominant species from and to semi-arid steppes in northern China and eastern Mongolia. Phragmites communis Trin. is also a perennial grass, and is distributed widely in the world. In the natural grasslands of northeastern China, both species always co-exist as co-dominating species due to their common characteristics such as propagation both by seeds and vegetative reproduction. Replacement series experiments were used to test the effects of nutrient availability and competitive interaction on the growth performance of two clonal plant species. The experimental treatments included five nutrient levels (3.6, 7.2, 10.8, 14.4 and 18.0 kg organic matter per pot, 20 cm diameter and 15 cm deep) and five species proportions (20:0, 16:4, 10:10, 4:16 and 0:20 for L. chinensis and R communis, respectively) with twenty tillers in total per pot. Each treatment had 10 replications. Growth characteristics including tiller height, tiller number, plant biomass, rhizome length and bud number of plants in monoculture and mixture culture were recorded and compared to examine the effects of nutrient and competitive interaction on the plant performance. The growth of L. chinensis and R communis in mixture was influenced by the nutrient availability and competition, which depended on the combination between nutrient level and species proportion. The results implied that the intensity of competition should be lower in nutrient-poor habitats when the co-existing species demanded on the same limiting resource. R communis benefited from coexisting with L. chinensis, especially under nutrient-rich conditions. The aboveground relative yield (RYabove) expressed in units of tiller height, dry biomass and daughter tiller number was recommended as an effective and simple index to predict the relative competitive ability for clonal plants. It was based on the regression for RYabove and RYbelow (the belowground relative yield) against RY (relative yield), measured as yield in mixture divided by that in monoculture.","[Ba, Lei; Xu, Wei; Wang, Deli] NE Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Naizhong] Jilin Univ, Coll Environm & Resources, Changchun 130026, Peoples R China","Wang, DL (corresponding author), NE Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",wangd@nenu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2007CB106801]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30571318, 30600427]; Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [IRT0519]; Science Foundation for Young Teachers of Northeast Normal University [20060402]","This work was financially supported by the National Key Basic Research Program (2007CB106801), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30571318 and No. 30600427), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University from the Ministry of Education of China (IRT0519), and partly from the Science Foundation for Young Teachers of Northeast Normal University (No. 20060402), respectively.",,46,0,0,0,20,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

Given the reported negative relationship between seed size and RGR, we predicted a negative relationship between seed size and competitive ability among these three species (i.e., D. winteri > P. boldus > P. lingue). Seedlings of D. winteri, the species producing the smallest seeds, had clear and strong negative effects on the growth of seedlings of both P. boldus and P. lingue. Likewise, P. boldus, the species producing medium-sized seeds, had strong negative effects on the growth of seedlings of the other two species. In addition, negative effects of D. winteri on P. boldus were generally greater than vice versa. Seedlings of P. lingue did not affect the growth of the other two species.

Although outbreeding populations of many grassland plants exhibit substantial genetic and phenotypic variation at fine spatial scales (< 100 m(2)), the implications of local genetic diversity for community structure are poorly understood. Genetic diversity could contribute to local species diversity by mediating the effects of competition between species and by enhancing species persistence in the face of environmental variation. 2. We assayed the performance of three genotypes each of a dominant tussock grass (Koeleria macrantha [Ledeb.] J.A. Schultes) and dominant sedge (Carex caryophyllea Lat.) derived from a single 10 x 10 m quadrat within a limestone grassland in Derbyshire, UK. Genotypes were grown in monoculture and grass-sedge mixtures of different genetic composition in two environments of contrasting fertility. Species mixtures also included one genotype of the subordinate forb Campanula rotundifolia L. 3. When grown without neighbours, intraspecific genotypes responded similarly to environmental treatments. One genotype of the sedge performed worse in both environments than the other two sedge genotypes. 4. When grown in species mixtures, genotype performance was significantly influenced by the genetic identity of the neighbouring species for both the sedge and the grass. At high fertility, differential genotype performance was not sufficient to alter the expectation of competitive exclusion of the sedge by the grass. However, at low fertility, the competitive dominant depended on the genetic identity of both the grass and the sedge. In addition, each genotype of the grass performed best next to a different genotype of the sedge, and the identity of the best genotype pairings switched with environment. 5. Performance of a single genotype of the subordinate Campanula was not predictable by fertility alone, but by how fertility interacted with different neighbouring genotypes of both the grass and the sedge. 6. Results support the hypothesis that the genetic identity of interspecific neighbours influences plant performance in multispecies assemblages and mediates species' responses to environmental variation. Such interactions could be a key factor in the contribution of local intraspecific genetic diversity to species diversity.","Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13066 USA; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Unit Comparat Plant Ecol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Macaulay Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland","Fridley, JD (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, 130 Coll Pl, Syracuse, NY 13066 USA.",fridley@syr.edu,,,,,,56,108,112,0,85,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We examined interactions among four common old-field herbaceous dicots (Dactylis glomerata, Festuea elatior, Trifolium pratense, Plantago lanceolata) with pairwise monoculture and polyculture competition experiments at two levels each of light and water. We constructed competitive hierarchies for unique treatment combinations based on competitive effect and response scores. Biomass production and relative yield were affected by presence and identity of neighbor species and inter- and intraspecific competition were typically not distinguishable. Competitive effect and response scores were inversely correlated, but depended on treatment factor as well as levels within factors. Competitive rankings among these four common plant species varied along resource gradients, although the extreme ends of the hierarchy were relatively stable: under most conditions P. lanceolata was most competitive whereas F. elatior was least competitive.

Fish were sampled using plastic minnow traps and results were analysed separately for three size categories. Toothcarps were clearly more abundant in the allopatric population than in the sympatric one, though the difference was less apparent in the smallest size category. In coexistence with other species, toothcarp occupied shallower microhabitats, but in both sites in the absence of shelter fish selected deeper positions than in its absence. While in the sympatric site sheltered microhabitats were used predominately by small individuals, in the allopatric ones they were used by larger ones. Observed patterns strongly suggest that predation is the main mechanism involved in the differences in abundance and microhabitat use between sites. Our results confirm that the presence or absence of coexisting species is an important habitat feature for Andalusian toothcarp populations.","Univ Girona, Inst Ecol Aquat, Girona 17071, Spain; Univ Huelva, Dept Biol Ambiental & Salud, Huelva 21007, Spain","Clavero, M (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Inst Ecol Aquat, Girona 17071, Spain.",miguel.clavero@udg.es,"Clavero, Miguel/A-9040-2015; PRENDA, JOSE/K-4994-2014","Clavero, Miguel/0000-0002-5186-0153; Prenda, Jose/0000-0002-1505-8331",,,,43,12,14,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

The basic formulation is motivated by a desire to understand the effects of asymmetries in multidimensional Lotka-Volterra systems. We first study the effects of perfectly specialist predators and find a rich collection of possible behaviors of the system including (1) extinction of all predators and subsequent extinction of the subordinate competitor, (2) dominant competitors and their predators coexist but the subdominant competitor goes extinct, (3) all species except the predator of the subordinate competitor coexist in coordinated phase-reversed chaos, (4) exclusion of one or more species occurs through an expanding heteroclinic cycle, and (5) all species coexist in an uncoordinated chaos. We then study the effects of five qualitatively distinct forms of polyphagy. In one case, corresponding to the well-known vulnerability to predation versus competitive ability trade-off, it is possible to have the subordinate competitor be the only survivor in the system. The other three cases of polyphagy lead to distortions in the basic pattern seen in the previously analyzed specialist case. Studying this case of ecologically motivated asymmetries in the basic Lotka-Volterra formulation is a step in the direction of fully understanding interacting populations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

As predators can influence habitat use in rodents, Pearl Island was selected because no mammalian predators of rodents are present. Rats were trapped in two other habitats to clarify rat distribution on the island and to obtain samples for stable isotope investigation of food partitioning within habitats. The experimental removal of ship rats failed, as Pacific rats were found to share forest and shrubland with ship rats. This result contrasted with the restricted distribution of Pacific rats on Stewart Island. Ship rats were ubiquitous, and appear to have been the dominant species in podocarp-broadleaf forest oil Pearl Island. The largest species, the Norway rat, was trapped only oil the foreshore of Pearl Island, but on Stewart Island it is more widespread. Ship rats and Norway rats were partitioning the coastal habitat by exploiting different food sources. Stable isotopic ratios (delta N-15 and delta C-13) in muscle samples from Norway rats revealed a strong marine signature, Suggesting intensive foraging in the intertidal zone. Ship rats trapped in the same habitat exhibited mixed terrestrial and marine sources in their diet. There was little obvious partitioning between ship rats and Pacific rats in forest, except a possible delay in breeding in Pacific rats relative to ship rats. Whether Norway rats select the intertidal zone to forage, or were excluded from forest by ship rats is unknown, but competitive exclusion is likely. Estimated densities of rats were low (2.1 - 5.1 rats ha(-1) in forest, 1.42 rats ha(-1) in shrubland) and similar to other New Zealand sites with low soil fertility. Further research will be required to elucidate the roles of food quality, habitat structure and predation in facilitating habitat selection in these species.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Harper, GA (corresponding author), Dept Conservat, POB 743, Invercargill, New Zealand.",gharper@doc.govt.nz,,,,,,68,25,26,0,24,NEW ZEALAND ECOL SOC,CHRISTCHURCH,"PO BOX 25178, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",0110-6465,,,NEW ZEAL J ECOL,N.

A laboratory examination of coccinellid egg predation, including cannibalism, revealed that eggs of two native species, Colecomegilla maculata and Olla v-nigrum, had significantly higher egg predation than did H. axyridis eggs. The addition of an alternative food source reduced egg cannibalism and predation. However, in the absence of an alternative food source, both native species attacked exotic eggs less than native eggs whereas, the exotic H. axyridis attacked all egg species similarly. This laboratory study shows that under conditions of low food availability, native coccinellid eggs would suffer from both cannibalism and predation whereas, cannibalism would be the larger threat to H. axyridis eggs.

The age at maturity of males and females was inversely related to the intensity of both fishing and interspecific competition. Fishing and interspecific competition affect the age at maturity through their effect on adult survival but not on growth, supporting predictions of life history models based on survival. In contrast, we did not find consistent effects of interspecific competition and fishing on the gonadosomatic index of females, which was directly related to survival (in all populations) and to the age at maturity (in exploited populations). These latter results are contrary to the predictions of life history models under the assumption that survival is directly related to growth rate.

We conducted an outdoor artificial pool experiment to assess the individual and interactive effects of a predator (Anax imperator) and controphic species (primarily Daphnia magna) on larval populations of two common mosquitoes, Culex pipiens and Culiseta longiareolata. Controphic species did not significantly affect survival to pupation of C. pipiens but did increase time to metamorphosis and reduce size at metamorphosis. Culex pipiens and D. magna, both primarily filter feeders, probably compete for food resources. Controphic species caused a small reduction (21.9%) in C. longiareolata survival, an unexpected result given that C. longiareolata larvae are thought to be primarily periphyton grazers while D. magna is a filter feeder. Controphic species did not affect C. longareolata time to, or size at, pupation. Anax imperator reduced C. longiareolata survival to pupation (78%) and size at pupation (11.5%) while increasing development time in males only (11.3%). Anax imperator caused a smaller (32.4%), but statistically significant, reduction in the number of C. pipiens surviving to the pupal stage but did not significantly affect size at or time to pupation. The predator did not reduce controphic species densities, and controphic species did not result in increased predator growth. We predicted that controphic species, by serving as competitors, would result in fewer C. pipiens surviving to pupation in the absence of predators. In the presence of the predator, the negative competitive effect of controphic species would be attenuated by the positive effect of serving as alternative prey. Our results followed this pattern although the predator X controphic species interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.157). Because previous studies showed that D. magna did not affect predation rates by A. imperator on C. longiareolata larvae, and because controphic species did not have a strong competitive effect, we did not predict and did not find a predator X controphic species interactive effect.","Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biol, Ctr Biol Control, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",leon@research.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,76,44,47,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Microhabitat selection of Calopteryx splendens and Erythromnia najas was further examined in the laboratory, individually at different larval densities and in the presence of the other species and a predator. - E. najas, Ischnura elegans and Platycnemis pennipes showed significant preferences for particular aquatic macrophytes compared to others in the field, whereas C. splendens did not discriminate between the investigated plant species. Only limited spatial separation was apparent between the larvae of different species, as preferences for the same macrophyte species were found. - When kept separate and at low densities, larvae of C. splendens and E. najas inhabited significantly different microhabitats in the laboratory. At high intraspecific abundances, spatial overlap between the two species became apparent as both increasingly occupied less preferred substrata, which is in concurrence with the ideal free distribution model of habitat selection. E. najas showed no change in perch selection in the presence of C. splendens at high densities. - In this instance, intraspecific competition therefore appeared to be more important than interspecific competition with other Zygoptera in determining the microdistribution of E. najas. In the field, the niches of the two species may be more adequately separated on the basis of prey selection or hunting behaviour. E. najas also actively reacted to the presence of a predator, indicating some flexibility of response regarding perch selection.","Univ Essex, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","Hofmann, TA (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Dept Biol Sci, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",tahofmp@essex.ac.uk,,,,,,25,5,6,1,7,SOC INT ODONATOLOGICA,BILTHOVEN,"PO BOX 256, 3720 AG BILTHOVEN, NETHERLANDS",0375-0183,,,ODONATOLOGICA,Odonatologica,MAR 1,2005,34,1,,,,,27,36,,,,,10,Entomology,Entomology,903FX,WOS:000227412300003,,,,,2021-09-21,

In particular, biotic interactions may enhance the resistance of communities to invasion. Invading organisms typically encounter a novel suite of competitors and predators, and thus their invasiveness may be affected by how they cope with these interactions. Behavioral plasticity may help invaders to respond appropriately to novelty. We examined the behavioral responses of highly invasive mosquitofish to representative novel competitors and predators they might encounter as they spread through North America. We compared the behavior of invasive Gambusia holbrooki and G. affinis to that of two close relatives of lower invasive potential (G. geiseri and G. hispaniolae) in order to elucidate whether responses to novelty related to invasiveness. In short-term assays, female Gambusia were paired with a novel competitor, Pimephales promelas, and a novel predator, Micropterus dolomieu. Behavioral responses were measured in terms of foraging success and efficiency, activity, refuge use, predator inspections, and interspecific aggression. Contrary to a priori predictions, invasive and non-invasive responses to novel interactions did not differ consistently. In response to novel competition, both invasive species increased foraging efficiency, but so did G. geiseri. In response to novel predation, only G. holbrooki decreased consumption and activity and increased refuge use. No antipredator response was observed in G. affinis. We found consistent differences, however, between invasives and non-invasives in foraging behavior. Both in the presence and absence of the competitor and the predator, invasives foraged more efficiently and consumed more prey than non-invasives.","Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Rehage, JS (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",rehagej@fiu.edu,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,92,58,59,4,58,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

We conducted two mesocosm experiments to determine whether breeding phenology and presence of Rana affect the growth, time to metamorphosis, and survival of Ambystoma (Experiment 1) and whether Rana density and access to Ambystoma embryos affect the growth, duration of larval period, and survival of both species (Experiment 2). Rana did not affect Ambystoma embryonic survival in either experiment. In Experiment 1, seasonal time of oviposition did not affect the overall response of Ambystoma larvae; however, Rana presence decreased larval survival and prolonged time to metamorphosis. In Experiment 2, relatively high tadpole density significantly reduced Ambystoma survival and decreased Rana survival, growth, and development. The results of this and other studies suggest that R. sylvatica may adversely affect A. maculatum through an array of context-dependent interactions, including indirect food web alteration, direct competition for benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton, and consumption of embryos.

To test this prediction, we studied how predation and competition affected the responses of two ciliates, Colpidiumstriatum and Parameciumtetraurelia, to temperature change in laboratory microcosms. We found that neither predation nor competition altered the responses of Colpidiumstriatum to temperature change, and that competition but not predation altered the responses of Paramecium tetraurelia to temperature change. Asymmetric interactions and temperature-dependent interactions may have contributed to the disparity between model predictions and experimental results.

The influence of exchange was assumed by similarity between the species composition of plankton and periphyton. At early stages of succession when the diatoms dominated in periphyton the community was formed mainly by phytoplankton sedimentation, while the competition for substratum didn't result in decrease of species diversity because the poor competitors were partly displaced by new colonists from the water column. Later when the green filamentous algae abundantly developed in periphyton, their numbers were probably controlled by factors not related to exchange of propagules. At the same time, the species structure of secondary periphyton cover developing on the thallus of filamentous algae depended mainly on the plankton sedimentation. At the last stages of seasonal succession when periphyton was represented by colonies of cyanobacteria and diatoms closely covering the substratum, the exchange of organisms between substratum and water column was not so important as interspecific competition for surface. As one could suppose, increase in biomass in this period resulted in the decrease of specity as it was predicted by hypothesis of interactive community. In such a way, both mechanisms (interactive and noninteractive ones) took part in development of periphyton structure. Their relative influence changed in the course of seasonal succession.","Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Gen Ecol, Moscow 119899, Russia","Lukin, VB (corresponding author), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Gen Ecol, Moscow 119899, Russia.",,,,,,,27,3,4,0,6,MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA,MOSCOW,"39 DIMITROVA UL., MOSCOW, 113095, RUSSIA",0044-4596,,,ZH OBSHCH BIOL,Zhurnal Obshchei Biol.,MAY-JUN,2003,64,3,,,,,263,272,,,,,10,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,688JT,WOS:000183431500006,12815943,,,,2021-09-21,

Previous research on nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) concluded that competitive superiority of the typically more intensively begging and larger cowbird chick leads to preferential feeding by foster parents and causes a reduction in the hosts' own brood. The larger size of cowbird nestlings can be the result of at least two causes: (1) cowbirds preferentially parasitize species with smaller nestlings and lower growth rates; and/or (2) cowbirds hatch earlier than hosts. I estimated the cost of cowbird parasitism for each of 29 species by calculating the difference between hosts' published brood sizes in nonparasitized and parasitized nests and using clutch size to standardize values. In this analysis, greater incubation length and lower adult mass, surrogate measures of the hatching asynchrony and size difference between parasite and hosts, were both related to greater costs of cowbird parasitism without bias owing to phylogeny. To establish causality, I manipulated clutch contents of eastern phoebes (Sayornis phoebe) and examined whether earlier hatching by a single cowbird or phoebe egg reduces the size of the rest of the original host brood. As predicted, greater hatching asynchrony increased the proportion of the original phoebe brood that was lost. This measure of the cost of parasitism was partially owing to increased hatching failure of the original eggs in asynchronous broods but was not at all related to the size differences of older and younger conspecific nestmates. However, proportional brood loss owing to an earlier hatching conspecific was consistently smaller than brood loss owing to asynchronous cowbirds in both naturally and experimentally parasitized phoebe nests. These results imply that although hatching asynchrony is an important cause of the reduction of host broods in parasitized clutches, competitive features of cowbird nestlings remain necessary to explain the full extent of hosts' reproductive costs caused by interspecific brood parasitism.","Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Hauber, ME (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hauberm@socrates.berkeley.edu,,,,,,79,99,100,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Competition between two species in a metapopulation involves each inhibiting the other's ability firstly to colonize an already occupied area and then to persist in it. Models for regional competition of this kind have 3-D dynamics, from which it has proved difficult to extract useful predictions except for special conditions. We introduce a 2-D general model for species that are equally vigorous at inhibiting the ability of others to remain in an occupied patch as to arrive there. The model covers the full spectrum of competitive interactions, from weak to strong and symmetrical to asymmetrical. Its Lotka-Volterra dynamics extend the general theory of competitive coexistence by generating clear predictions for community structure, amenable to cross-system comparisons and experimental manipulations. 2. Previous 2-D models of interactions between dominant and fugitive species are special cases of the 2-D general model. Moderately asymmetrical competition has two outcomes distinctly different from dominant-fugitive interactions, at both the scale of metapopulation and population: (i) slow growing and weak competitors coexist with faster growing superior competitors, albeit at reduced densities; and (b) habitat removal always yields relative gains in abundance for species with higher growth capacity, but the gains are absolute only for species subjected to competitive impacts that exceed within-species impacts. Extinctions of slow growing and weak competitors provide the most sensitive indication of habitat degradation, and their losses also have the least effect on community structure. 3. The 2-D general model further predicts that highly productive communities will tolerate differences between species in their capacity for population growth, whereas less productive communities will tolerate stronger competitive interactions between species. This prediction applies equally to a population of resource consumers as to a metapopulation of colonists. The model explicitly links local and regional population dynamics to r-K selection in community structure by predicting a prevalence of growth-orientated species in resource-poor habitats and competition-orientated species in resource-rich habitats.","Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Dept Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Doncaster, CP (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Bassett Crescent E, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England.",cpd@soton.ac.uk,"Doncaster, C.

Four types of microcosms that differed in capacity and litter input were set. In the hillside bamboo grove, where multiple species occurred, succession of the predominant species from Aedes albopictus to Tripteroides bambusa was observed in control microcosms from which no mosquito larvae were removed. Weekly removal of competitive species resulted in increased pupation of A. albopictus and adult body weight under both rich and poor resource conditions. In the late period of the experiments, the effect of competitor removal on pupation of A. albopictus was greater in deep containers that never dried than in shallow containers that were dried in the laboratory. The number of eggs showed a slight difference between competitor-excluded and deep control microcosms. These results indicate that interspecific competition limits pupation of A. albopictus more strongly in deep containers than in shallow and drought-prone containers. Compared with the hillside site, the larval density of A. albopictus attained a higher density in the bamboo grove in the plain where no competitive species occurred, due to a higher oviposition rate. Lower rate of pupation and lower adult weight at the plain site than at the hillside site indicated that resource limitation was more severe at the plain site. Populations of A. albopictus at hillside and plain sites appeared to suffer from strong inter- and intraspecific, competition, respectively. At the hillside site, the intensity of interspecific competition appeared to increase later in the breeding season, with a high larval density of T. bambusa. In contrast, at the plain site, intensity of intraspecific competition appeared to be reduced later in the breeding season with decreasing larval density of A. albopictus.","Saga Med Sch, Dept Microbiol, Div Parasitol, Saga 8498501, Japan","Sunahara, T (corresponding author), Saga Med Sch, Dept Microbiol, Div Parasitol, Saga 8498501, Japan.",,,,,,,37,9,9,0,26,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2002,97,1,,,,,87,96,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970109.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,559JC,WOS:000176022200009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Here, we use these disjunctions as the basis for a natural removal experiment to investigate competitive interactions between Nothofagus and a range of other widespread conifer and broad-leaved tree species. We first model the abundance of non-Nothofagus species as a function of environment, using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and an extensive data set sampling much of New Zealand's remaining old-growth forests. We then assess the effects of competitive interaction with Nothofagus by adding statistical terms describing (1) Nothofagus abundance, and (2) interactions between Nothofagus abundance and annual temperature, the dominant environmental gradient. Results indicate substantial reductions in the abundance of many species as Nothofagus abundance increases. The magnitude of this reduction varies with position along the dominant environmental gradient; species overlapping most strongly with Nothofagus are generally most sensitive to increases in Nothofagus abundance. In addition, both the shapes of species responses to mean annual temperature and the positions of their optima change as Nothofagus abundance increases. This demonstration of competition using community compositional data has implications both for vegetation theory and for prediction of the likely impacts of global warming on New Zealand's forest pattern.","Landcare Res New Zealand, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton, New Zealand; CSIRO Wildlife & Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Leathwick, JR (corresponding author), Landcare Res New Zealand, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton, New Zealand.",Leathwickj@landcare.cri.nz,"Austin, Mike P./G-2199-2010",,,,,74,168,176,1,98,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2001,82,9,,,,,2560,2573,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[2560:CIBTSI]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,473MX,WOS:000171049100015,,,,,2021-09-21,

In contrast, swimming speed was significant reduced at high algal concentrations and in the presence of green colour. Moreover, starved animals had lost their rheotaxis. Neither Daphnia magna nor Daphnia pulex had a preference for either clean medium or medium that had contained conspecifics, but D. magna significantly chose clean medium when medium which had been inhabited by D. pulex was the alternative. No avoidance of medium from Chaoborus cultures was found, but D. magna significantly avoided medium that had been inhabited by ides (Leuciscus idus L.). The responses observed could result in aggregation of animals by reduced swimming speed at high algal densities and by avoidance of areas with predators. When these cues have become less important due to food depletion and decreased predation pressure, the interspecific-competitor-related cues might result in desegregation.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Environm Sci, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands","Roozen, F (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Environm Sci, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, POB 8080, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,56,33,34,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

To generate testable predictions on the role of competition in such communities, information is required about the competitive abilities of the species involved. In this study we test whether larval development time, an important life-history trait, can be used to predict interspecific competitive ability in neotropical Drosophila species. Based on earlier work, we predicted a negative relationship between larval development time and competitive ability. Pairwise competition experiments were conducted with seven Drosophila species (in all possible combinations) that are known to coexist in central Panama and represent a wide range of larval development times. We used a novel approach to determine experimental densities, standardising total larval food requirements, and thereby increasing the resolution for detecting general traits involved in exploitation competition. The effects of competition were measured by comparing values for three fitness-related parameters (thorax length, larval survival, and total mass of emerged adults) against their values at two levels of intraspecific competition. The outcomes of the pairwise competition were significantly explained by the differences in larval development times: within species pairs, species with a longer development suffered more from interspecific competition than those with shorter development. It is argued that larval development time is a major determinant of competitive rank order among drosophilid species, allowing testable community-wide predictions. In addition, this relationship provides a basis for studying the role of life-history trade-offs in community-level processes. Given the generality of the Drosophila biology, development time is expected to play a similar role in other insect communities exploiting ephemeral and fragmented resources.","Leiden Univ, Inst Evolutionary & Ecol Sci, Sect Anim Ecol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Krijger, CL (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Inst Evolutionary & Ecol Sci, Sect Anim Ecol, POB 9516, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",,,,,,,32,40,40,0,25,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2001,92,2,,,,,325,332,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920215.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,412NF,WOS:000167560700015,,,,,2021-09-21,

Monocultures, three-species mixtures, and the four-species mixture were sown at two densities and with either random or intraspecifically aggregated distributions. There was a hierarchy of competitive abilities among the four species. The weaker competitors showed higher aboveground biomass in the aggregated distribution compared to the random distribution, especially at high density. In one species, intraspecific aggregation resulted in an 86% increase in the number of flowering individuals and a 171% increase in the reproductive biomass at high density. The competitively superior species had a lower biomass in the aggregated distribution than in the random distribution at high density. The data support the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of plants profoundly affects competition in such a way that weaker competitors increase their fitness while stronger competitors are suppressed when grown in the neighborhood of conspecifics. This implies that the spatial arrangement of plants in a community can be an important determinant of species coexistence and biodiversity.","Univ Bern, Geobot Inst, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Germany","Stoll, P (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Geobot Inst, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",stoll@sgi.unibe.ch,"Stoll, Peter/A-8881-2010","Stoll, Peter/0000-0003-1509-1702",,,,28,249,268,3,149,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2001,82,2,,,,,319,327,,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,403VX,WOS:000167064100003,,Green Published,,,2021-09-21,

Negative associations of T. pyri with other predators were the strongest, which is consistent with evidence that this mite can detect other predators on a leaf. Predator-prey seasonal associations were mixed, with some positive and others negative, with most significant associations occurring in the mid season. One prey-prey interaction was positive, again in mid season, most likely because of similar habitat preferences.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Entomol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Slone, DH (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Entomol Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,,"Slone, Daniel/0000-0002-9903-9727",,,,36,20,24,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Activities range from reduced harvest restrictions on fish predators and competitors to more aggressive removal programs. Chemical treatment and predator hazing also have been considered for potential benefits to more desirable fish populations. This paper describes a systematic decision-making process to determine for any given case if: (1) predation or competition is likely to be important, (2) potential predators or competitors can be affected by changes in harvest or other management actions, and (3) biological benefits outweigh costs and social/political considerations.

We studied the effects of a pathogenic water mold, Saprolegnia ferax, on competitive interactions between the Cascades frog Rana cascadae and the Pacific treefrog Hyla regilla. Previous studies have shown that outbreaks of Saprolegnia infection in the Cascade mountains of Oregon, USA, result in high embryonic mortality for Rana but not for Hyla. Thus, we examined how infections of Saprolegnia during amphibian embryonic development could influence larval recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Rana and Hyla. We manipulated the presence of Saprolegnia and embryonic Hyla and Rana in replicated artificial ponds and determined mean survivorship to hatching per pool from daily observations during embryonic development. Pools were then followed throughout larval development, and we recorded mean mass of tadpoles at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis per pool. The presence of Saprolegnia differentially affected larval recruitment of the two species; larval recruitment of Rana was reduced by 46.2% in the presence of Saprolegnia, whereas Hyla survival was not affected. However, larval Rana that survived Saprolegnia infection developed faster and were larger at metamorphosis compared to individuals not exposed to Saprolegnia. In the absence of Saprolegnia, Rana had strong negative effects on the growth, development, and survival of Hyla. However, in the presence of Saprolegnia, the outcome of competitive interactions between the two species was reversed. Saprolegnia may have positive indirect effects on both Hyla and Rana by regulating both intra- and interspecific competition. These results suggest that pathogens can have strong effects on species interactions and may ultimately influence community structure.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kiesecker, JM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",,,,,,,48,78,82,1,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1999,80,7,,,,,2442,2448,,10.2307/176924,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,243QU,WOS:000083009400027,,,,,2021-09-21,

Results were consistent among experimental plots that contained a variety of competing plant species with different growth forms. Measurements of PAR transmission once during the growing season performed as well as PAR measurements taken throughout the growing season.

The enhanced competitive ability of loaded seedlings over naturally occurring vegetation was probably due to the contrasting nutrient utilization traits induced by greenhouse fertilization. Nutrient-loaded seedlings translocated more nutrients to actively growing parts from reserves built up during the greenhouse preconditioning phase than did conventionally fertilized seedlings. First-season growth and nutrient responses in the field and in previous greenhouse trials were significantly correlated, demonstrating the effectiveness of using intact bioassays to simulate and predict short-term field responses to competition treatments.",,"Malik, V (corresponding author), UNIV TORONTO,FAC FORESTRY,TORONTO,ON M5S 3B3,CANADA.",,,,,,,36,57,60,1,20,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

These two species co-occur over much of northern North America and exhibit changing patterns of between-habitat distribution and abundance in western Canada. In our experiments, adult survival of P. adstrictus was ca. 35% lower in the presence of the larger-bodied P. melanarius. Because starvation of individually isolated beetles did not elevate mortality for either species, we conclude that predation, and not interspecific competition for food, was responsible for reduced survival of P. adstrictus in the mixed-species trials. Although beetle survival was not affected by reduced food, gravid P. melanarius lost mass when food was limited and showed potential increased egg production with increased food. Larvae of both species had high survivorship when held alone, but predation by both conspecific and heterospecific adults significantly reduced larval survival. All of these effects occurred in the presence of suitable alternative food but many were exacerbated when food levels were lowered experimentally. We conclude that intraguild predation and interspecific competition for food could reduce survival and reproductive potential, thus affecting the population dynamics of these two species in nature.","UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT BIOL SCI, EDMONTON, AB T6G 2E9, CANADA",,,,,,,,47,43,47,0,23,COLEOPTERISTS SOC,ATHENS,"UNIV GEORGIA, 413 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES BUILDING, ATHENS, GA 30602-2603 USA",0010-065X,1938-4394,,COLEOPTS BULL,Coleopt.

Disturbance, interspecific competition between seedlings and between seedlings and adults, and access for potential predators were manipulated in the field after a fire to identify mechanisms to explain between- and within-habitat species coexistence. When soil surfaces are disturbed or seeds are buried, dry-heath species can establish in the wet heath. Under natural conditions, however, wet heath is rarely disturbed by animal foragers and lack of safe sites may preclude establishment of dry-heath species. In contrast, dry heath is often disturbed by ground foragers such as bandicoots and safe sites are plentiful for establishment of all heath species. Nevertheless, while wet-heath species can establish in dry heath, their seedlings are apparently unable to survive there due to the drier conditions. No evidence for competition among species was detected in either type of habitat during the first 3 years of the experiment, even at elevated seedling densities. Lack of early competition and unsaturated seed-banks may promote coexistence of species. Seedling predation from vertebrates was low and did not appear to influence patterns of coexistence within or between habitats. In terms of community theory we suggest that several interacting mechanisms are responsible for community structure in heaths after a fire. Chance and microsite disturbance are important during dispersal, while resources are critical during establishment and early survival of seedling populations. In these heath systems where fires burn extensive areas, seed-banks may be more important in temporal storage of species than patch or spatial storage as a mechanism for maintaining coexistence and plant diversity.","UNIV SYDNEY,SCH BIOL SCI,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA; UNIV SYDNEY,INST WILDLIFE RES A12,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA",,,"Clarke, Peter/D-6403-2012",,,,,23,9,9,0,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

Ideal free models for unequal competitors predict a truncated competitor phenotype distribution among patches when relative payoffs of phenotypes vary across patches. Partial truncation is expected under field conditions. This prediction was tested in a field experiment with an overwintering population of mute swans (Cygnus olor). 2. Two food patches were generated in which adult and subadult swans were expected to have different relative success. In one patch ('clumped'), pieces of bread were thrown over a small area on the water surface. In the other patch, pieces of bread were scattered over a larger area. 3. When only one patch was offered at a time (no choice situation), adult swans were more successful than subadult swans in the 'clumped' patch, but were similarly successful in the 'scattered' patch. Relative payoffs of adult and subadult swans differed significantly between patches. 4. When the two patches were offered simultaneously, black-headed gulls (Larns ridibundus) competed with the swans to a considerable extent in some replicates. The gulls appeared to be the poorest competitors. They snatched more bread in the scattered than in the clumped patch. Both classes of swans avoided the scattered patch but not the clumped patch with increasing competition from gulls. Gulls preferred the scattered patch and swans increasingly preferred the clumped patch under gull competition, creating a partially truncated distribution. 5. Without the four replicates in which the gulls had consumed more than 25% of the bread, the percentage of adult swans that chose the clumped patch was significantly higher than the percentage of subadult swans that chose that patch. This is the first experimental verification of a partially truncated phenotype distribution. Subadult swans significantly preferred the scattered patch whereas adults tended to prefer the clumped patch. This distribution was predicted from the 'no choice' experiment, where competition by gulls had been similarly weak.",,"MILINSKI, M (corresponding author), UNIV BERN, INST ZOOL, VERHALTENSOKOL ABT, WOHLENSTR 50A, CH-3032 HINTERKAPPELEN, SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,42,24,24,1,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The effects of varying crop and weed density were modelled in terms of weed biomass over time, weed seed production and crop yield. Biomass model parameters, representing maximum weed biomass and intra and interspecific competition, were obtained for different assessment dates, enabling biomass levels to be predicted during the two growing seasons. Weed biomass declined, and its maximum level was reached earlier, with increasing crop density. Intraspecific competition was higher in the absence than in the presence of crop, increasing with time and with weed density. Halving the wheat population increased June biomass of V. arvensis by 74% and of P. rhoeas by 63%. Crop yield losses with increasing weed density were greater with low than with medium and high crop populations. P. rhoeas was significantly more competitive than V. arvensis in both years. Weed biomass in 1989 responded more to reductions in crop density following the milder winter of 1988/89 than in the previous year; however crop yields were less affected in 1989 due to summer drought, restricting late weed growth and competition. Weed seed production was related to weed biomass; the progressive lowering of crop density increased seed production, and both species were very prolific in the absence of crop. By combining models, seed production could be derived for a given competitive effect on the crop. Threshold weed populations, based on low weed levels that are not economic to control, could then be equated with the accompanying weed seed production.","UNIV W ENGLAND,DEPT COMP STUDIES & MATH,BRISTOL BS16 1QY,AVON,ENGLAND; UNIV BATH,SCH MATH SCI,BATH BA2 7AY,AVON,ENGLAND","WILSON, BJ (corresponding author), UNIV BRISTOL,LONG ASHTON RES STN,DEPT AGR SCI,IARC,BRISTOL BS18 9AF,AVON,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,18,68,70,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0043-1737,,,WEED RES,Weed Res.,AUG,1995,35,4,,,,,265,278,,,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,RW466,WOS:A1995RW46600007,,,,,2021-09-21,

It was hypothesized that the armour and spines of brook stickleback would be of greatest benefit during a direct encounter with a predator. I attempted to simulate this condition with turbid water and predator present. Feeding rates of the two species were significantly different, with fathead minnow feeding at a greater rate than brook stickleback in the absence of a predator. In the presence of a predator the feeding rate of fathead minnow declined significantly whereas that of brook stickleback was unaffected. This resulted in similar feeding rates for the two species in the presence of a predator.

In experiment 1, courtship interactions resulting in spermatophore deposition were inhibited in the presence of a restrained species of salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) known to prey on D. ochrophaeus. Probability of successful courtship was not affected by the presence of a restrained species that is not predatory (Plethodon teyahalee).

Roaches were dissected, volume of hindgut estimated, and the number of female worms of each species was recorded. Female worms were dissected and the number of uterine eggs was counted. Gut volume was a significant predictor of numbers of all species except H. diesingi, numbers of which were correlated positively with those of its 2 interspecific associates. There was little evidence of interspecific competition within the host. In the mixed colony, L. appendiculatum occurred with Thelastoma sp. less often than expected, but this was the only negative interspecific interaction observed. Fecundity was not significantly correlated with numbers of interspecifics but was strongly and negatively correlated with numbers of intraspecifics in all species. Leidynema appendiculatum occurred at about the same intensity in isolate and mixed colonies. These results suggest that the number of each species is independently regulated. Typically this occurs through nonoverlapping niches, but all evidence points to there being broad niche overlap in the species. Unpublished findings suggest that L. appendiculatum and Thelastoma sp. limit their own numbers by intraspecific interference, a phenomenon reported in several other pinworms. Reduced fecundity is presumably a sublethal manifestation of this interference. We propose that intraspecific interference holds numbers of each species below carrying capacity and permits their coexistence despite broad niche overlap. Prevalence was below 50% in the mixed colony and was 100% in the isolate colony. This suggests that the community in the mixed colony is the result of a 2-stage process where interspecific effects play an important role in establishment of a species but where intraspecific effects dominate the in-host environment.",,"ADAMSON, ML (corresponding author), UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,DEPT ZOOL,VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4,BC,CANADA.",,,,,,,14,23,24,0,40,AMER SOC PARASITOLOGISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0022-3395,,,J PARASITOL,J.

By allowing coevolution both within and between trophic levels the model breaks the traditional dichotomy between coevolution among competitors and coevolution between a prey and its predator. By allowing the diversity of prey and predator species to emerge as a property of the evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), the model breaks another constraint of most approaches to coevolution that consider as fixed the number of coevolving species. The number of species comprising the ESS is influenced by a parameter that determines the predator's niche breadth. Depending upon the parameter's value the ESS may contain: 1) one prey and one predator species, 2) two prey and one predator, 3) two prey and two predators, 4) three prey and two predators, 5) three prey and three predators, etc. Evolutionarily, these different ESSs all emerge from the same model. Ecologically, however, these ESSs result in very different patterns of community organization. In some communities the predator species are ecologically keystone in that their removal results in extinctions among the prey species. In others, the removal of a predator species has no significant impact on the prey community. These varied ecological roles for the predator species contrasts sharply with the essential evolutionary role of the predators in promoting prey species diversity. The ghost of predation past in which a predator's insignificant ecological role obscures its essential evolutionary role may be a frequent property of communities of predator and prey.","UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT AEROSP & MECH ENGN,TUCSON,AZ 85721","BROWN, JS (corresponding author), UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,BOX 4348,CHICAGO,IL 60680, USA.",,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012",,,,,50,140,146,1,53,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,OCT,1992,46,5,,,,,1269,1283,,10.2307/2409936,,,15,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,JV371,WOS:A1992JV37100002,28569003,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

The hypothesis that this difference results directly from their relative adaptations to extreme cold is evaluated and dismissed. An alternative hypothesis is developed from considerations of body size and biogeographic effects on productivity. This suggests that the northern limit of the red fox's geographic range is determined directly by resource availability (and thus ultimately by climate), whereas the southern limit of the arctic fox's range is determined, through interspecific competition, by the distribution and abundance of the red fox. Predictions from this hypothesis are fulfilled, particularly by data on fur harvests. The argument is extended to other pairs of similar canid species, with thc conclusion that equivalent interactions between body size, secondary productivity and direct competition have general relevance to their geographical distributions.","UNIV OXFORD, DEPT ZOOL, WILDLIFE CONSERVAT RES UNIT, OXFORD OX1 3PS, ENGLAND","HERSTEINSSON, P (corresponding author), WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT UNIT, POB 5032, IS-125 REYKJAVIK, ICELAND.",,"Hersteinsson, Pall/A-6278-2008",,,,,107,227,237,1,220,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1992,64,3,,,,,505,515,,10.2307/3545168,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JG510,WOS:A1992JG51000010,,,,,2021-09-21,

Moreover, the direct pairwise links between species, once embedded in the complicated network of species interactions in entire communities, may become diluted and confused by the indirect interactions of still other species, particularly predators.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of rodent cyclic fluctuations in the interspecific interactions of a guild of small- and medium-sized predators: red fox (Vulpes vulpes), pine marten (Martes martes), and weasels (Mustela erminea and Mustela nivalis) in the boreal ecosystem. We analyzed eight years (2007-2014) of snow tracking data from southeastern Norway using structural equation models to assess hypothesized networks of causal relationships. Our results show that fluctuations in rodent abundance alter the strength of predator's interactions, as well as the effect of determinant environmental variables. Pine marten and weasel abundances were positively associated with rodent population growth rate, but not red fox abundance. All predators were positively associated with each other; however, the association between red fox and the other predators weakened when rodents increased. Rodent fluctuations had variable effects on the habitat use of the predators. The presence of agricultural land was important for all predators, but this importance weakened for the mustelids as rodent abundance increased. We discuss the shifting role of interference and exploitative competition as possible mechanisms behind these patterns. Overall, we highlight the importance of accounting for the dynamics of prey resources when studying interspecific interactions among predators. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of monitoring the predator populations in order to anticipate undesirable outcomes such as increased generalist predator abundances to the detriment of specialists.","[Cano-Martinez, Rocio; Carricondo-Sanchez, David; Devineau, Olivier; Odden, Morten] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Campus Evenstad, NO-2480 Koppang, Norway","Cano-Martinez, R (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Campus Evenstad, NO-2480 Koppang, Norway.",rocio.martinez@inn.no,,"Devineau, Olivier/0000-0002-7625-2816",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences - Norwegian Environment Agency,Open Access funding provided by Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences.

Understanding how novel interactions can affect mosquito population dynamics is necessary to predict transmission risk at invasion fronts. Mosquito life-history traits are extremely sensitive to temperature, and this can lead to temperature-dependent competition between competing invasive mosquito species. We explored temperature-dependent competition between Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi, two invasive mosquito species whose distributions overlap in India, the Middle East, and North Africa, where An. stephensi is currently expanding into the endemic range of Ae. aegypti. We followed mosquito cohorts raised at different intraspecific and interspecific densities across five temperatures (16-32 degrees C) to measure traits relevant for population growth and to estimate species' per capita growth rates. We then used these growth rates to derive each species' competitive ability at each temperature. We find strong evidence for asymmetric competition at all temperatures, with Ae. aegypti emerging as the dominant competitor. This was primarily because of differences in larval survival and development times across all temperatures that resulted in a higher estimated intrinsic growth rate and competitive tolerance estimate for Ae. aegypti compared to An. stephensi. The spread of An. stephensi into the African continent could lead to urban transmission of malaria, an otherwise rural disease, increasing the human population at risk and complicating malaria elimination efforts. Competition has resulted in habitat segregation of other invasive mosquito species, and our results suggest that it may play a role in determining the distribution of An. stephensi across its invasive range.","[Evans, Michelle V.; Drake, John M.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Evans, Michelle V.; Drake, John M.] Univ Georgia, Ctr Ecol Infect Dis, 203 DW Brooks Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Jones, Lindsey] Albany State Univ, Dept Biol, 504 Coll Dr, Albany, GA 31705 USA; [Murdock, Courtney C.] Univ Georgia, Coll Vet Med, Dept Infect Dis, 501 DW Brooks Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Murdock, Courtney C.] Cornell Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Entomol, 2126 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Evans, MV (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.; Evans, MV (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Ctr Ecol Infect Dis, 203 DW Brooks Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",mv.evans.phd@gmail.com,"Evans, Michelle V./S-1027-2019","Evans, Michelle V./0000-0002-5628-0502",National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Science Foundation Research Experiences for UndergraduatesNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1156707]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5R01AI110793-04],"We would like to thank Justine Shiau for her help in the insectary and Paige Miller for her editorial feedback.

For both species, no significant differences in growth and survival rates were found between animals reared in the presence versus the absence of heterospecifics, indicating no direct deleterious interspecific effects. Behavioural observations revealed that fish and crayfish competed for shelter and food. Both species reduced the foraging in the presence of heterospecifics during feeding period, in the daytime.

Antlion larvae usually occur in clusters with a high density of individuals; therefore, competition can be intense. We observed two abundant antlion species, E. nostras and M. formicarius, which co-occur in some habitats. In a simple habitat choice experiment where substrates differed according to sand particle size, we found that E. nostras exhibited dominance over M. formicarius. Most E. nostras larvae remained in the more suitable substrate and constructed pits, while all the M. formicarius larvae moved out of the suitable area, and did not build pits. In the second experiment, we observed the characteristics of the pit-fall traps and scored the occurrence of larval relocation in relation to interactions and in the control group, where larvae were kept in containers separately. In interactions, the larvae of E. nostras constructed smaller pits, but pit enlargement was greater in comparison to the control group. M. formicarius larvae constructed similar sized pits in both groups; however, enlargement was greater in the control group. Relocation of larvae occurred only during interactions. In direct interactions, we found 15 behavioural patterns, which are described in detail for the first time. In the presence of a competitor, larvae showed intense territorial behaviour. We recorded several behavioural patterns during larval confrontation, and interestingly, intraguild predation rarely occurred. In most cases, E. nostras larvae outcompete M. formicarius, which was evident from the larger pits and the rate of pit-construction.","[Klokocovnik, Vesna; Veler, Eva; Devetak, Dusan] Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Koroska Cesta 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia","Klokocovnik, V (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Koroska Cesta 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",vesna.klokocovnik@um.si,,,Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia; Research Programme Computationally Intensive Complex Systems [P1-0403],This research was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency and the Research Programme Computationally Intensive Complex Systems (Grant No. P1-0403).,,50,2,2,1,1,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

According to ecological theory, the potential for an IG(predator) and IG(prey) to coexist depends on whether the direct consumptive benefits for the IG(predator) are substantial (IGP) or insignificant (IK), the extent to which the IG(prey) is the superior exploitative competitor on shared prey resources, and overall ecosystem productivity. We used resource selection models and spatially explicit age and harvest data for two closely related mesopredators that engage in IG interactions, American martens (Martes americana; IG(prey)) and fishers (Pekania pennanti; IG(predator)), to identify drivers of distributions, delineate areas of sympatry and allopatry, and explore the role of an apex predator (coyote; Canis latrans) on these interactions. Model selection revealed that fisher use of this landscape was strongly influenced by late winter abiotic conditions, but other bottom-up (forest composition) and top-down (coyote abundance) factors also influenced their distribution. Overall, fisher probability of use was higher where late winter temperatures were warmer, snowpack was deeper, and measures of productivity were greater. Martens were constrained to areas of the landscape where the probability of fisher use, coyote abundance, and productivity were low and selected for forest conditions that presumably maximized prey availability. Marten age data indicated an increased proportion of juveniles outside of the predicted area of sympatry, suggesting that few animals survived >1.5 years in this area that supported higher densities of fishers and coyotes. Consistent with asymmetrical IG interaction theory, the IG(predator) (fishers and, to a lesser degree, coyotes) competitively excluded the IG(prey) (martens) from more productive, milder temperature habitats, whereas IG(predators) and IG(prey) coexisted in low productivity environments, where a combination of abiotic and biotic conditions enabled the IG(prey) to be the superior exploitative competitor.","[Jensen, Paul G.; Humphries, Murray M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Jensen, Paul G.] New York State Dept Environm Conservat, Div Fish & Wildlife, Ray Brook, NY 12977 USA","Jensen, PG (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada.; Jensen, PG (corresponding author), New York State Dept Environm Conservat, Div Fish & Wildlife, Ray Brook, NY 12977 USA.",paul.jensen@dec.ny.gov,,"Jensen, Paul/0000-0003-2224-1270",,,,94,6,6,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Data from monthly monitoring of pelagic whitefish (Coregonus wartmanni Bloch, 1784) were used to compare weight-at-age and abundance of pelagic whitefish for years before (1997-2012) and after the invasion (2013-2015). Growth and abundance of pelagic whitefish is shown to be heavily influenced by stickleback presence. Mean autumn weight-at-age of whitefish decreased by 33.3% after the invasion took place and a significant decline in autumn CPUE in otherwise unfished cohorts of the population was also recorded. The results imply direct effects of stickleback presence on pelagic whitefish, including interspecific competition for food leading to reduced growth and survival, and predation of eggs and larvae, hampering recruitment. These observations coincide with a sharp decline in whitefish yield.

Competition-defence trade-offs have long been thought to promote plant coexistence and increase species diversity. However, insights from modern coexistence theory clarify that such trade-offs alone cannot sustain coexistence. Coexistence also requires stabilising niche differences and the ability of competitor populations to persist under consumer pressure. Despite the breadth of potential consequences of competition-defence trade-offs, we have little mechanistic understanding of how they affect diversity in natural communities. 2. We investigated the effects of seed harvesting by ants on coexistence in an annual plant community. We parameterised a model of plant competitive population dynamics with data from two field experiments: (a) plant demographic rates and competition coefficients determined by growing plants alone and against intra- and interspecific competitor density gradients; (b) plant fitness losses to ant consumers determined by measuring seed removal from experimental depots. We tested for a trade-off between a plant species' demographic potential and its susceptibility to consumption and then determined the bounds of ant effects on pairwise and multispecies coexistence by comparing mod& projections with and without seed consumption. 3. Ants harvested seeds of all plant species, but they strongly preferred the competitively superior large seeded species, inducing a competition-defence trade-off. Unequal seed loss to ants changed competition-based fitness hierarchies, affecting both the number and identities of plant species pairs that were predicted to coexist compared to a scenario without ants. The trade-off most often prevented coexistence by severely disadvantaging the superior competitor or excluding species directly through overconsumption, and a simulated reduction in the overall consumption rate opened few additional opportunities for coexistence. Ant exacerbation of average fitness differences was particularly disruptive to multispecies coexistence, where niche differences were insufficient to stabilise the coexistence of plant triplets and quadruplets. 4. Synthesis. Our results show that the presence of a competition-defence trade-off in a community with stabilising niche differences does not always increase diversity. Instead, the full range of diversity outcomes-positive and negative changes in species number and changes in the identity of the dominant-are possible. Taken together, our results support the emerging paradigm that consumers have wide ranging impacts on plant diversity and suggest that variation in consumer pressure may be an important driver of large-scale diversity patterns.","[Petry, William K.; Levine, Jonathan M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kandlikar, Gaurav S.; Kraft, Nathan J.

Moreover, there is growing awareness that the presence of natural stressors, such as predation risk may magnify the negative effects of pesticides. This is because perception of predation risk can by itself lead to changes on behaviour and physiology of prey species. To evaluate the potential combined effects of both stressors on freshwater detritivores we studied the behavioural and developmental responses of Chironomus riparius to chlorantraniliprole (CAP) exposure under predation risk. Also, we tested whether the presence of a shredder species would alter collector responses under stress. Trials were conducted using a simplified trophic chain: Alnus glutinosa leaves as food resource, the shredder Sericostoma vittatum and the collector C. riparius. CAP toxicity was thus tested under two conditions, presence/absence of the dragonfly predator Cordulegaster boltonii. CAP exposure decreased leaf decomposition. Despite the lack of significance for interactive effects, predation risk marginally modified shredder effect on leaf decomposition, decreasing this ecosystem process. Shredders presence increased leaf decomposition, but impaired chironomids performance, suggesting interspecific competition rather than facilitation. C. riparius growth rate was decreased independently by CAP exposure, presence of predator and shredder species. A marginal interaction between CAP and predation risk was observed regarding chironomids development. To better understand the effects of chemical pollution to natural freshwater populations, natural stressors and species interactions must be taken into consideration, since both vertical and horizontal species interactions play their role on response to stress.","[Rodrigues, Andreia C.

This study assesses the possible direct and indirect impact of the mass occurrence on native fish species in the lake. Laboratory foraging experiments showed that larvae of roach Rutilus rutilus L., perch Perca fluviatilis L. and whitefish Coregonus lavaretus L are accessible to sticklebacks as food. However, distinct species effects were apparent, with whitefish showing no effective predator avoidance strategy and therefore experiencing drastically increased mortality risk compared to the other predator adapted prey species. Furthermore, in absence of larval prey, sticklebacks were shown to feed predominantly on Daphnia in the field, indicating a strong interspecific food competition with whitefish. The results suggest that sticklebacks, acting as both an invasive species and a predator in the pelagic zone where prior no predator or neozoon existed, create a unique challenge to the unadapted autochthonous fish, and thus threaten the ecological resilience of the lake. Impacts on recruitment, e.g. through larval predation and interspecific competition for zooplankton could explain recent drastic declines in fishing yields.","[Roch, S.; von Ammon, L.; Brinker, A.] Fisheries Res Stn Baden Wurttemberg, Argenweg 50-1, D-88085 Langenargen, Germany; [Geist, J.] Tech Univ Munich, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Muehlenweg 22, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Brinker, A.] Univ Konstanz, Mainaustr 252, D-78464 Constance, Germany","Roch, S (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Stn Baden Wurttemberg, Argenweg 50-1, D-88085 Langenargen, Germany.",samuel.roch@lazbw.bwl.de,"Geist, Juergen/C-4933-2008; Brinker, Alexander/ABF-4644-2020","Geist, Juergen/0000-0001-7698-3443; Brinker, Alexander/0000-0002-2433-5652",,,,78,12,12,3,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-7836,1872-6763,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,AUG,2018,204,,,,,,172,180,,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.014,,,9,Fisheries,Fisheries,GG5XB,WOS:000432768000019,,,,,2021-09-21,

The greater the difference between intra- and interspecific limitations, the more stable the coexistence, and the weaker the competitive release any species should experience following removal of competitors. We conducted a removal experiment to test whether a previously estimated model, showing surprisingly weak interspecific competition for four dominant species in a sagebrush steppe, accurately predicts competitive release. Our treatments were (1) removal of all perennial grasses and (2) removal of the dominant shrub, Artemisia tripartita. We regressed survival, growth, and recruitment on the locations, sizes, and species identities of neighboring plants, along with an indicator variable for removal treatment. If our baseline regression model, which accounts for local plant-plant interactions, accurately explains the observed responses to removals, then the removal coefficient should be non-significant. For survival, the removal coefficients were never significantly different from zero, and only A.tripartita showed a (negative) response to removals at the recruitment stage. For growth, the removal treatment effect was significant and positive for two species, Poa secunda and Pseudoroegneria spicata, indicating that the baseline model underestimated interspecific competition. For all three grass species, population models based on the vital rate regressions that included removal effects projected 1.4- to 3-fold increases in equilibrium population size relative to the baseline model (no removal effects). However, we found no evidence of higher response to removal in quadrats with higher pretreatment cover of A.tripartita, or by plants experiencing higher pre-treatment crowding by A.tripartita, raising questions about the mechanisms driving the positive response to removal. While our results show the value of combining observations with a simple removal experiment, more tightly controlled experiments focused on underlying mechanisms may be required to conclusively validate or reject predictions from phenomenological models.","[Adler, Peter B.; Kleinhesselink, Andrew; Teller, Brittany] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adler, Peter B.; Kleinhesselink, Andrew; Teller, Brittany] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5230 Old Main, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hooker, Giles] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, 1198 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY USA; [Taylor, Joshua B.] ARS, USDA, US Sheep Expt Stn, 19 Off Loop, Dubois, ID USA; [Ellner, Stephen P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, E145 Corson Hall, Ithaca, NY USA","Adler, PB (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Adler, PB (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5230 Old Main, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.adler@usu.edu,"Kleinhesselink, Andrew R/O-8956-2019","Kleinhesselink, Andrew R/0000-0003-2149-2027","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353078, DEB-1054040, DEB-1353039]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1353078] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","P.

Several functional explanations predict positive covariation between eggshell pigmentation and phenotypic quality of nestlings. We test this prediction in spotless starlings Sturnus unicolor by using biometric measurements and telomere length of hatchlings and fledglings as proxies of phenotypic quality. Female spotless starlings lay immaculate blue-green eggs, a sexually selected signal directed to males. Pigmentation predicts positive associations with concentration of antioxidants and testosterone in the yolk and with paternal provisioning effort during nestling growth. Eggshell pigmentation (blue-green chroma) is not associated with telomere length of hatchlings, which suggests weak maternal effects on this trait. However, we find negative associations of eggshell colouration with both body condition and telomere length of fledglings. Moreover, we find positive associations between eggshell colouration and clutch size, which suggests that sibling competition is higher in nests with more coloured eggshells. Previous works demonstrated that level of sibling competition is positively related to telomere erosion and, thus, the detected negative associations between eggshell colouration, body condition and telomere length of fledglings would reflect higher level of competition in nests with more coloured eggshells. We therefore speculate with the possibility that females that lay larger clutches also lay more coloured eggshells that elicit increased paternal provisioning effort and, thus, raise larger broods at the expense of telomere erosion of their offspring.","[Soler, Juan J.; Ruiz-Castellano, Cristina; Tomas, Gustavo] Estn Expt Zonas Aridas CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Almeria, Spain; [Figuerola, Jordi; Martinez-de la Puente, Josue] Estn Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Ecol Humedales, Seville, Spain; [Figuerola, Jordi; Martinez-de la Puente, Josue] CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz-Rodriguez, Magdalena] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Observ Oceanol, Banyuls Sur Mer, France","Soler, JJ (corresponding author), Estn Expt Zonas Aridas CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Almeria, Spain.",jsoler@eeza.csic.es,"Soler, J.

Sustainable cropping systems are needed for future food security. One aspect of sustainable cropping is to manage for desirable grain quality of crops including seed size, protein, oil and metabolite composition. 2. Plant ecology theory on niche relationships and interspecific competition predicts that subordinate species mixtures (i.e. weed species) will affect dominant (i.e. crop) species offspring quality. Beyond individual weed species effects on crop quality, we hypothesise that the integrated effect of weed mixtures will be influenced by taxonomic, functional trait and phylogenetic diversity. 3. Reviewing Glycine max (soybean)-weed systems, we show a complex relationship between the weed community and G. max seed protein, oil, mean seed mass and physiological markers (relative water content, trigonelline leaf content, fluorescence, foliar Cu, Fe and Zn). Increased levels of weed competition led to increased seed protein, at the expense of seed oil. 4. Synthesis. We propose that research on interspecific relationships between crops and weeds consider weed species diversity, weed functional traits associated with the Leaf-Height-Seed strategy and phylogenetic relationships to identify weed mixtures (either sown or manipulated through herbicide control) best suited to minimise their detrimental effects on yield while maximising crop quality as part of sustainable cropping systems.","[Gibson, David J.; Wood, Andrew J.] Southern Illinois Univ Carbondale, Dept Plant Biol, Ctr Ecol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Young, Bryan G.] Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Gibson, DJ (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ Carbondale, Dept Plant Biol, Ctr Ecol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",djgibson@siu.edu,,"Wood, Andrew/0000-0001-8113-4120; Gibson, David/0000-0002-0308-7506",US Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"The US Department of Agriculture funded the soybean-weed research summarised here.

Breeding site selection may be based on previous experience, or on social information from the density and success of competitors with an earlier phenology. Variation in animal breeding phenology is often correlated with variation in habitat quality. Generally, animals breed earlier in high-quality habitats that allow them to reach a nutritional threshold required for breeding earlier or avoid nest predation. In addition, habitat quality may affect phenological overlap between species and thereby interspecific competition. Therefore, we hypothesized that competitor breeding phenology can be used as social cue by settling migrants to locate high-quality breeding sites. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally advanced and delayed hatching phenology of two resident tit species on the level of study plots and studied male and female settlement patterns of migratory pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca. The manipulations were assigned at random in two consecutive years, and treatments were swapped between years in sites that were used in both years. In both years, males settled in equal numbers across treatments, but later arriving females avoided pairing with males in delayed phenology plots. Moreover, male pairing probability declined strongly with arrival date on the breeding grounds. Our results demonstrate that competitor phenology may be used to assess habitat quality by settling migrants, but we cannot pinpoint the exact mechanism (e.g. resource quality, predation pressure or competition) that has given rise to this pattern. In addition, we show that opposing selection pressures for arrival timing may give rise to different social information availabilities between sexes. We discuss our findings in the context of climate warming, social information use and the evolution of protandry in migratory animals.","[Samplonius, Jelmer M.; Both, Christiaan] Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","Samplonius, JM (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands.",jelmersamplonius@gmail.com,"Both, Christiaan/E-6459-2011; Samplonius, Jelmer M./H-6689-2019","Both, Christiaan/0000-0001-7099-9831; Samplonius, Jelmer Menno/0000-0002-8700-4041",University of Groningen,"This project was supported by the University of Groningen.

Several studies have examined facilitative invader-invader interactions, potentially leading to invasional meltdown. However, if invader interactions are negative, invasional interference may lead to lower invader abundance and spread. To explore this possibility, we develop models of two competing invaders. A landscape simulation model examines the patterns created by two such species invading into the same region. We then apply the model to a case study of Carduus nutans L. and C. acanthoides L., two economically important invasive weeds that exhibit a spatially segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, USA. The results of these spatially-explicit models are generally consistent with the results of classic Lotka-Volterra competition models, with widespread coexistence predicted if interspecific effects are weaker than intraspecific effects for both species. However, spatial segregation of the two species (with lower net densities and no further spread) may arise, particularly when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. A moving area of overlap may result when one species is a superior competitor. In the Carduus system, our model suggests that invasional interference will lead to lower levels of each species when together, but a similar net level of thistle invasion due to the similarity of intra- and interspecific competition. Thus, invasional interference may have important implications for the distribution and management of invasive species.","[Rauschert, Emily Sofia Jalics] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, 2121 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Shea, Katriona] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Rauschert, ESJ (corresponding author), Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, 2121 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",e.rauschert@csuohio.edu,"Shea, Katriona/B-7954-2008","Shea, Katriona/0000-0002-7607-8248","United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service National Research InitiativeUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2002-35320-1228]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Grant Fellowship","This work was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service National Research Initiative (Biology of Weedy and Invasive Plants) Grant #2002-35320-1228 to KS and a National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Grant Fellowship to ER.

Exploitative competition is an indirect effect that occurs through use of a shared resource and depends on resource availability. Interference competition occurs by obstructing access to a resource and may not depend on resource availability. Our study tested whether the strength of interference competition changes with protozoa population density. We grew experimental microcosms of protozoa and bacteria under different combinations of protozoan density and basal resource availability. We then solved a dynamic predator-prey model for parameters of the functional response using population growth rates measured in our experiment. As population density increased, competition shifted from exploitation to interference, and competition was less dependent on resource levels. Surprisingly, the effect of resources was weakest when competition was the most intense. We found that at low population densities, competition was largely exploitative and resource availability had a large effect on population growth rates, but the effect of resources was much weaker at high densities. This shift in competitive mechanism could have implications for interspecific competition, trophic interactions, community diversity, and natural selection. We also tested whether this shift in the mechanism of competition with protozoa density affected the structure of the bacterial prey community. We found that both resources and protozoa density affected the structure of the bacterial prey community, suggesting that competitive mechanism may also affect trophic interactions.","[Holdridge, Erica M.; terHorst, Casey P.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Holdridge, Erica M.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Cuellar-Gempeler, Catalina] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Nat Sci, 120 Inner Campus Dr, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Holdridge, EM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",erica.holdridge@yale.edu,,"Holdridge, Erica/0000-0002-7508-9981",Division of Mathematical SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1312490]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1312490] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Mathematical Sciences (Grant/Award Number: 1312490).,,57,15,15,0,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Recently, however, a number of studies demonstrated that intraspecific variation can have profound consequences for species interactions and thereby alter community dynamics in solitary organisms. Here, we study how intraspecific variation in collective behaviors (also called collective personalities) affects the outcome of resource contests between 2 co-occurring species of ants, Temnothorax longispinosus and T. curvispinosus. Our results revealed that intraspecific variation in colonies' exploration behavior and aggressiveness predicts the outcome of interspecific contests for food and nest sites. How exploratory behavior affected the outcome of the foraging and nest site contests depended on the species: exploratory behavior seemed to enhance performance in foraging contests in T. curvispinosus but diminish it in T. longispinosus. More interestingly, whether a species was successful in nest site contests depended not only on its collective personality but also on the personality of its opponent colony. Temnothorax longispinosus experienced greater success if its opponent colony had similar exploratory tendencies to its own. In contrast, T. curvispinosus performed best when its opponent colony exhibited a contrasting exploratory tendency to its own. Our data demonstrate that intraspecific variation in colony behavior can have consequences for contest outcomes and ensure that no one species or behavioral strategy consistently experiences superior success. This, in turn, might help to maintain variation in collective behavior in multiple interacting populations and prevent competitive exclusion of one of the species.","[Lichtenstein, James L.

However, relatively little is known about how urbanization influences competitive interactions among mammalian carnivores, particularly related to wild felids. We evaluated interspecific interactions between medium-and large-sized carnivores across a gradient of urbanization and multiple scales. Specifically, we investigated spatial and temporal interactions of bobcats and pumas by evaluating circadian activity patterns, broad-scale seasonal interactions, and fine-scale daily interactions in wildland-urban interface (WUI), exurban residential development, and wildland habitats. Across levels of urbanization, interspecific interactions were evaluated using two-species and single-species occupancy models with data from motion-activated cameras. As predicted, urbanization increased the opportunity for interspecific interactions between wild felids. Although pumas did not exclude bobcats from areas at broad spatial or temporal scales, bobcats responded behaviorally to the presence of pumas at finer scales, but patterns varied across levels of urbanization. In wildland habitat, bobcats avoided using areas for short temporal periods after a puma visited an area. In contrast, bobcats did not appear to avoid areas that pumas recently visited in landscapes influenced by urbanization (exurban development and WUI habitat). In addition, overlap in circadian activity patterns between bobcats and pumas increased in exurban development compared to wildland habitat. Across study areas, bobcats used sites less frequently as the number of puma photographs increased at a site. Overall, bobcats appear to shape their behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales to reduce encounters with pumas, but residential development can potentially alter these strategies and increase interaction opportunities. We explore three hypotheses to explain our results of how urbanization affected interspecific interactions that consider activity patterns, landscape configuration, and animal scent marking. Altered competitive interactions between animals in urbanized landscapes could potentially increase aggressive encounters and the frequency of disease transmission.","[Lewis, Jesse S.; Bailey, Larissa L.; Crooks, Kevin R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [VandeWoude, Sue] Colorado State Univ, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Lewis, JS (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",jslewis@rams.colostate.edu,"Bailey, Larissa/A-2565-2009; Bailey, Larissa/ABH-3513-2020","VandeWoude, Sue/0000-0001-9227-1622","Colorado State University; Colorado Parks and Wildlife; National Science Foundation-Ecology of Infectious Diseases Program (NSF) [EF-0723676, EF-1413925]; Boulder County Parks and Open Space; Boulder City Open Space and Mountain Parks; Bureau of Land Management; US Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1413925] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Funding and support were provided by Colorado State University, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Boulder County Parks and Open Space, Boulder City Open Space and Mountain Parks, the Bureau of Land Management, US Forest Service, and grants from the National Science Foundation-Ecology of Infectious Diseases Program (NSF EF-0723676; EF-1413925).",,84,29,30,6,129,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, since omnivorous fish utilise different ecological formations, data relating to ATC are very noisy, since an identified ATC comprises remains that can be determined according to the species level, determined only according to general food categories (i.e. higher taxonomic levels) as well as amounts of fragmented and digested remains that cannot be determined taxonomically. Thus, a variety of scales of precision can be applied during work on ATC. Up until now, there has been no evidence as to whether and how precision in ATC estimation can affect the results. This study aims at assessing how three different options of the same database influence the effectiveness and concurrency of indexes commonly used to describe the food niche of fish. The options include: (1) only general (higher than species level) food categories; (2) categories of different levels of generality; and (3) only detailed (species level) food categories. The study shows that the use of detailed (species level) food categories only, with the exclusion of general food categories, is the best method to recognise food niche partitioning and competitive interactions among fish. The food categories estimated in detail were cladocerans, and the possibility to use cladocerans as specific markers to find similarities in fish diets is discussed. (C) 2015 Academie des sciences.

Many of these sperm parameters are associated with sperm ATP content, which has led to predictions of trade-offs between ATP content and sperm motility and velocity. Selective pressures imposed by sperm competition have been proposed as evolutionary causes of this pattern of diversity in sperm traits. Here, we examine variation in sperm viability, acrosome integrity, motility, swimming velocity, and ATP content over time, among 18 species of closely related muroid rodents, to address the following questions: (a) Do sperm from closely related species vary in ATP content after a period of incubation? (b) Are these differences in ATP levels related to differences in other sperm traits? (c) Are differences in ATP content and sperm performance over time explained by the levels of sperm competition in these species? Our results revealed a high degree of interspecific variability in changes in sperm ATP content, acrosome integrity, sperm motility and swimming velocity over time. Additionally, species with high sperm competition levels were able to maintain higher levels of sperm motility and faster sperm swimming velocity when they were incubated under conditions that support sperm survival. Furthermore, we show that the maintenance of such levels of sperm performance is correlated with the ability of sperm to sustain high concentrations of intracellular ATP over time. Thus, sperm competition may have an important role maximizing sperm metabolism and performance and, ultimately, the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa.","[Tourmente, Maximiliano; Villar-Moya, Pilar; Varea-Sanchez, Maria; Roldan, Eduardo R.

Environmental changes in human disturbance, land use and climate are predicted to have widespread impacts on interactions between species, especially in the order Lagomorpha due to the higher latitudes and more extreme environmental conditions they occupy. We reviewed the published literature on interspecific interactions in the order Lagomorpha and compared the biogeography, macroecology, phylogeny and traits of species known to interact with those of species with no reported interactions, to investigate how projected future environmental change may affect interactions and potentially alter species' distributions. Thirty-three lagomorph species have competitive interactions reported in the literature; the majority involve hares (Lepus sp.) or the eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus). Key regions for interactions are located between 30-50 degrees N of the Equator, and include eastern Asia (southern Russia on the border of Mongolia) and North America (north-western USA). Closely related, large-bodied, similarly sized species occurring in regions of human-modified, typically agricultural landscapes, or at high elevations, are significantly more likely to have reported competitive interactions than other lagomorph species. We identify species' traits associated with competitive interactions, and highlight some potential impacts that future environmental change may have on interspecific interactions. Our approach using bibliometric and biological data is widely applicable, and with relatively straightforward methodologies, can provide insights into interactions between species. Our results have implications for predicting species' responses to global change, and we advise that capturing, parameterizing and incorporating interspecific interactions into analyses (e.g. species distribution modelling) may be more important than suggested by the literature.","[Leach, Katie] Queens Univ Belfast, Quercus, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Montgomery, W.

The presented study investigates this in a nutrient and species poor ecosystem. The study presents a methodology for inferring competitive interactions from yearly vegetation inventories and uses this to assess the outcome of competitive interactions and to predict community patterns and dynamics in a Northwest-European dry heathland. Inferred competitive interactions from five consecutive years of measurements in permanent vegetation frames at a single dry heathland site were used to predict the community dynamics of C. vulgaris and D. flexuosa. This was compared with the observed plant community structure at 198 Danish dry heathland sites. Interspecific competition will most likely lead to competitive exclusion of D. flexuosa at the observed temporal and spatial scale, but the possibility of founder controlled alternative stable states (one dominated by C. vulgaris, the other by D. flexuosa) cannot be dismissed. The observed competitive interactions can only yield a vegetation pattern similar to the pattern observed across Danish dry heathland sites when disturbances are followed by initial dominance of D. flexuosa. The observed inter-annual variability in climatic conditions (summer precipitation and soil water content) affected both species in a similar way and did not substantially alter the competitive balance between the species. Our study supports the successional mosaic hypothesis where the maintenance of coexistence between C. vulgaris and D. flexuosa requires a storage effect and disturbance events followed by initial colonisation by D. flexuosa.","[Ransijn, Johannes; Schmidt, Inger Kappel] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Damgaard, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark","Ransijn, J (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",jran@ign.ku.dk,"Damgaard, Christian/G-2441-2010; Schmidt, Inger K/A-6230-2015; Ransijn, Johannes/D-5324-2015","Damgaard, Christian/0000-0003-3932-4312; Schmidt, Inger K/0000-0003-3880-2060; Ransijn, Johannes/0000-0003-0416-2210",INCREASE project - FP7-INFRASTRUCTURE-1 [227628]; Villum Kann Rasmussen foundation; Air Liquide Denmark A/S,"The study has been supported by the INCREASE project funded by FP7-INFRASTRUCTURE-2008-1, Grant agreement No. 227628 and the Villum Kann Rasmussen foundation and is further supported by, Air Liquide Denmark A/S and the participating institutions.

We investigated this hypothesis in Allenby's gerbils, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi, by comparing foraging behaviors of single vs. pairs of gerbils. We recorded strong interference competition within the foraging pairs. Competition reduced the amount of time the gerbils spent foraging, as well as foraging efficiency since part of the foragers' attention was directed toward detecting competitors (apparent predation risk). Single gerbils harvested significantly more food than the combined efforts of two gerbils foraging together. Competition reduced the success of both individuals within a pair by more than 50%, making this a case of the tragedy of the commons where each individual's investment in competition reduces the success of all individuals within the group, including its own. Despite their great costs, competitive behaviors will be selected for as long as one individual achieves higher fitness than the other. In nature, interspecific interactions, such as predation risk, may act to reduce and regulate the deleterious effects of intraspecific competition.","[Berger-Tal, Oded; Embar, Keren; Kotler, Burt P.; Saltz, David] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Berger-Tal, O (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",oded.berger.tal@gmail.com,"Saltz, David/AAC-7054-2019; Berger-Tal, Oded/P-9189-2014; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Berger-Tal, Oded/P-1670-2019","Saltz, David/0000-0002-7437-0472; Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X; Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X",Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities; ISFIsrael Science Foundation [1397/10],"We wish to dedicate this paper to Dr. Keren Embar, forever bright and cheerful, who passed away doing what she loved-science.

However, how interspecific differences in defence ability affect habitat partitioning amongst competing prey species remains unresolved. We examined how prey defences affect species distribution in a natural ecosystem: the aquatic food web within Neotropical bromeliads. We first related differences in prey (mosquito) density to the presence and absence of predatory damselfly larvae. We then quantified behavioural responses to predators in the two most abundant mosquito species, and the effects of these behaviours on predator consumption rates. In the absence of damselflies, Wyeomyia was the most abundant mosquito genus in natural bromeliads. However, Wyeomyia numbers were reduced in the presence of damselflies. Numbers of the genus Culex increased with bromeliad size irrespective of the presence of damselflies. As a result of the differing effects of plant size and damselflies on the two genera of mosquito larvae, Culex were more numerous in large bromeliads containing damselflies. The most abundant Culex species, Culex jenningsi, had two kinds of behavioural defences: reduced movement and increased time at the water surface. These defences reduced damselfly attack rate on C.jenningsi, but not handling time. Consequently, consumption rate was reduced at all but the highest prey densities, altering the damselfly's functional response. Inducible defences were not seen in the most abundant Wyeomyia species, Wyeomyia abebela, and pre-exposure to predation risk did not reduce predation on this species. Inducible behavioural defences, and the associated reductions in predation rate, evidently allow C.jenningsi to coexist with predators at a higher density than W.abebela. As predation risk is non-randomly distributed amongst bromeliads, divergence between mosquito species in their response to predation may contribute to the coexistence of a number of mosquito species across the landscape.","[Hammill, Edd; Corvalan, Paloma; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Hammill, Edd; Corvalan, Paloma; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Corvalan, Paloma] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","Hammill, E (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Cnr Harris & Thomas St, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",edd_hammill@hotmail.com,,"Corvalan, Paloma/0000-0001-8932-4017",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The authors would like to thank Jose Mario Moraga Rios and Sarah and Trevor Amundrud for invaluable help in the field.

However, geographical variation, the mechanisms, temporal dynamics and predictors of biased sex ratios are notoriously difficult to explain. We studied 334 wild populations of four species of African annual fish (Nothobranchius furzeri, N. kadleci, N. orthonotus, N. rachovii) across their ranges to compare their adult sex ratio, its seasonal dynamics, interpopulation variation and environmental predictors. Nothobranchius populations comprise a single age cohort and inhabit discrete isolated pools, with wide-ranging environmental conditions (habitat size, water turbidity, structural complexity, predators), making them ideal to study adult sex ratio variation. In captivity adult sex ratios were equal. In natural populations, adult sex ratios were biased 1:2 toward females in three study species while N. kadleci had sex ratios at unity. There was a decline in the proportion of males with age in one species, but not in the other species, implying most severe male mortality early after maturation, declining later perhaps with a decrease in male abundance. In general, the populations at vegetated sites had relatively more males than populations at sites with turbid water and little vegetation. Selective avian predation on brightly coloured male fish likely contributed to female dominance and vegetation cover may have protected males from birds. In addition, an aquatic predator, a large belastomid hemipteran, decreased the proportion of males in populations, possibly due to greater male activity rather than conspicuous colouration. Alternative explanations for a sex ratio bias, stemming from male-male contests for matings, are discussed. We conclude that the effect of environmental conditions on adult sex ratio varies dramatically even in closely related and ecologically similar sympatric species. Therefore, difficulties in explaining the ecological predictors of sex ratio biases are likely due to high stochasticity rather than limited sample size.","[Reichard, Martin; Polacik, Matej; Blazek, Radim; Vrtilek, Milan] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, CS-60365 Brno, Czech Republic; [Vrtilek, Milan] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Inst Bot & Zool, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic","Reichard, M (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, CS-60365 Brno, Czech Republic.",reichard@ivb.cz,"Polacik, Matej/A-8260-2010; Reichard, Martin/C-6563-2009; Vrtilek, Milan/C-8725-2016; Blazek, Radim/L-9163-2013","Polacik, Matej/0000-0003-1309-2146; Reichard, Martin/0000-0002-9306-0074; Vrtilek, Milan/0000-0002-9058-9220; Blazek, Radim/0000-0003-1150-0273",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P506/11/0112],"Funding came from the Czech Science Foundation (P506/11/0112).

However, while our current understanding of competition provides the foundation for solving many derived ecological problems, this understanding is fractured because competition theory and data are rarely unified. Conclusions from seminal studies in space-limited benthic marine systems, in particular, have been very influential for our general understanding of competition, but rely on traditional empirical methods with limited inferential power and compatibility with theory. Here we explicitly link mathematical theory with experimental field data to provide a more sophisticated understanding of competition in this classic model system. In contrast to predictions from conceptual models, our estimates of competition coefficients show that a dominant space competitor can be equally affected by interspecific competition with a poor competitor (traditionally defined) as it is by intraspecific competition. More generally, the often-invoked competitive hierarchies and intransitivities in this system might be usefully revisited using more sophisticated empirical and analytical approaches.","[Hart, Simon P.; Burgin, Jacqueline R.; Marshall, Dustin J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Marshall, Dustin J.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Hart, SP (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",simon.hart@env.ethz.ch,"Marshall, Dustin/A-4185-2008; Marshall, Dustin/C-3450-2016; Hart, Simon Peter/B-6492-2013","Hart, Simon Peter/0000-0001-7957-8689; Marshall, Dustin/0000-0001-6651-6219",ARCAustralian Research Council; University of QueenslandUniversity of Queensland,This work was funded by an ARC grant to D.

By December 2008, both A. aurita and M. leidyi populations had disappeared for the winter. In 2009, the first A. aurita appeared in February and the medusae attained their maximum umbrella diameter by the end of June, when the estimated half-life of copepods was only 1.6 +/- 1.1 d. Low densities of M. leidyi in early July (< 0.5 m(-3)) increased to high densities by late August (66.2 to 224.9 ind. m(-3)). In 2009, the estimated time to clear the central part of Limfjorden (Skive Fjord) of zooplankton by A. aurita and M. leidyi feeding was between 0.5 d (4 June) and 2.9 d (26 August). During that period, copepods and other mesozooplankton organisms were virtually absent while ciliates were a substantial part of the zooplankton biomass. In pre-Mnemiopsis years, there seems to have been large variability in the grazing impact on zooplankton depending on the seasonal abundance of A. aurita. With the addition of the second carnivore M. leidyi, however, additional predation pressure caused the zooplankton stocks to be severely depressed throughout 2008 and 2009 when copepods and cladocerans no longer showed the high seasonal peaks in abundance typical of previous years.","[Riisgard, Hans Ulrik; Madsen, Caroline V.; Barth-Jensen, Coralie] Univ So Denmark, Marine Biol Res Ctr, DK-5300 Kerteminde, Denmark; [Purcell, Jennifer E.] Western Washington Univ, Shannon Point Marine Ctr, Anacortes, WA 98221 USA","Riisgard, HU (corresponding author), Univ So Denmark, Marine Biol Res Ctr, Hindsholmvej 11, DK-5300 Kerteminde, Denmark.",hur@biology.sdu.dk; cmvm@live.dk; barthjensen@gmail.com; Jennifer.Purcell@wwu.edu,"Riisgard, Hans Ulrik/G-2568-2010","Riisgard, Hans Ulrik/0000-0002-8188-2951; Barth-Jensen, Coralie/0000-0001-9318-2605","FNU, the Danish Agency for Science Technology and InnovationDanish Natural Science Research Council [09-073291]","Thanks are due to Ole S.

However, the mechanisms underlying environmental changes, such as a decrease in the relative abundance of native species, are poorly understood. Since the introduction of the ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), in Chile in the 1970s for biological control of aphids, a reduction in the relative abundance of the native ladybird beetle Eriopis connexa (Germar) has been noticed. To explore the role of cannibalism, intraguild predation (IGP) or competition as possible mechanisms that might increase dominance of H. variegata over E. connexa, several laboratory experiments were carried out. The native and the exotic species were very similar in their voracity and biotic interactions. Although H. variegata was able to maintain constant reproductive performance, E. connexa reproduction decreased at lower densities of aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The impacts of cannibalism, IGP, and competition exerted by these species were very symmetrical in both larvae and adults. We conclude that these biotic factors may not fully explain the increase in relative abundance of H. variegata. The higher sensitivity of E. connexa to prey patch size, along with other factors such as chemical-mediated negative interspecific interactions may be operating in alfalfa fields, changing the composition of associated coccinellid assemblages.","[Grez, A.

Schindl. are two co-dominant species of great importance in reducing soil and water loss and maintaining the distinctive natural scenery of the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. Our aim was to determine the growth and interspecific competition between these species under water stress to facilitate the prediction of community succession and guide the selection of appropriate methods of conservation and use in the area. A pot experiment was designed to investigate the effects of water stress and competition on biomass production and allocation, relative competitive ability and water use efficiency of the two species. Bothriochloa ischaemum (a C-4 perennial herbaceous grass) was planted in the same pot with L. davurica (a C-3 perennial leguminous subshrub) at density ratios of 12: 0, 10: 2, 8: 4, 6: 6, 4: 8, 2: 10, and 0:12. The response of the species to their mutual presence at the different ratios was evaluated at three levels of soil moisture (80%+/- 5% field capacity, FC (HW), 60%+/- 5% FC (MW) and 40%+/- 5% FC (LW)). Indices of aggressivity (A), competitive ratio (CR) and relative yield totals (RYTs) were calculated from the dry shoot, root and total weight data. Water stress decreased the biomass production by both species whether in monoculture or mixture, but B. ischaemum was more sensitive to water deficit. Across moisture levels, the growth of L. davurica was more adversely affected by mixed planting. Bothriochloa ischaemum had significantly (P<0.05) smaller root: shoot ratios than L. davurica and the root mass of both species tended to increase relative to shoot mass as soil water deficit increased. The aggressivity (A), competitive ratio (CR) and relative yield totals (RYTs) of B. ischaemum were positive across treatments. Bothriochloa ischaemum had much higher CR under each water treatment, but water stress considerably reduced its relative CR while increasing that of L. davurica. The RYT values of the two species indicated some degree of resource complimentarity under both water sufficient and deficit conditions. Our results suggest that it is advantageous to grow the two species together to maximize biomass production. We recommend a mixture ratio of 8: 4 of B. ischaemum to L. davurica because it gave significantly higher RYT and transpiration water use efficiency under deficit water conditions.","[Xu, Bingcheng; Huang, Jin; Shan, Lun] NW A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bingcheng; Huang, Jin; Shan, Lun] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bingcheng; Huang, Jin; Shan, Lun] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Weizhou] NW A&F Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Fengmin] Lanzhou Univ, MoE Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, Sch Life Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Xu, BC (corresponding author), NW A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",Bcxu@ms.iswc.ac.cn,"Li, Fengmin/K-8740-2012; Xu, Bingcheng/I-5854-2019","Li, Fengmin/0000-0002-2144-3498; Xu, Bingcheng/0000-0002-1702-491X",CASChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-QN412]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41071339]; International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China [2010DFA91930],"We are particularly grateful to Prof. A.

Juvenile and adult SMB appeared to outcompete WAE when fed during the daytime; neither species dominated when fed near dusk. Attack rates and capture efficiencies of both species were similar with an intra-or interspecific competitor, but SMB often exploited prey before the competitor had a chance to feed (exploitative competition) or displayed agonistic behaviors toward a potential competitor (interference competition). Prey selectivity of WAE or SMB did not differ when by themselves or with a potential competitor. These results indicate that SMB could outcompete WAE under limiting prey conditions due to the aggressive nature of SMB, but resources may be partitioned at least along a temporal scale.","[Wuellner, Melissa R.; Graeb, Brian D.

This limits our understanding of how growth of coexisting tree species varies along environmental gradients in these forests, and the implications for species interactions and community assembly under current and future climatic conditions. Here, we quantify the absolute effect and relative importance of climate, tree size and competition as determinants of tree growth patterns in Iberian forests, and explore interspecific differences in the two components of competitive ability (competitive response and effect) along climatic and size gradients. Spatially explicit neighborhood models were developed to predict tree growth for the 15 most abundant Iberian tree species using permanent-plot data from the Spanish Second and Third National Forest Inventory (IFN). Our neighborhood analyses showed a climatic and size effect on tree growth, but also revealed that competition from neighbors has a comparatively much larger impact on growth in Iberian forests. Moreover, the sensitivity to competition (i.e. competitive response) of target trees varied markedly along climatic gradients causing significant rank reversals in species performance, particularly under xeric conditions. We also found compelling evidence for strong species-specific competitive effects in these forests. Altogether, these results constitute critical new information which not only furthers our understanding of important theoretical questions about the assembly of Mediterranean forests, but will also be of help in developing new guidelines for adapting forests in this climatic boundary to global change. If we consider the climatic gradients of this study as a surrogate for future climatic conditions, then we should expect absolute growth rates to decrease and sensitivity to competition to increase in most forests of the Iberian Peninsula (in all but the northern Atlantic forests), making these management considerations even more important in the future.","[Gomez-Aparicio, Lorena] CSIC, IRNAS, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Garcia-Valdes, Raul] INIA, CIFOR, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dpto Ecol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Gomez-Aparicio, L (corresponding author), CSIC, IRNAS, POB 1052, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",lorenag@irnase.csic.es,"Gomez-Aparicio, Lorena/K-6905-2014; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012; Garcia-Valdes, Raul/W-4226-2017; Zavala, Miguel A./H-3603-2015","Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870; Garcia-Valdes, Raul/0000-0001-6399-4709; Zavala, Miguel A./0000-0003-1456-0132","Spanish Ministry of the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL2008-04503-C03-01, INTERBOS3-CGL200804503-C03-03]; INIA projectInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [SUM2008-00004-C03-01]; FPI-MCI [BES-200714404]; FPU-MECSpanish Government [AP2008-01325]","We thank the Spanish Ministry of the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs for granting access to the forest inventory data.

Congeneric species that overlap in geographic distribution provide an excellent opportunity to explore the mechanisms of coexistence. Two monitor lizards, Varanus gouldii and V. rosenbergi (Varanidae), are sympatric at a local scale in the northern Jarrah Forest of Western Australia. Both species are wide-ranging terrestrial predators of a similar size and may differentiate their ecological niche by utilizing alternative foraging strategies resulting in dietary separation. Because varanid lizards are an important group of terrestrial high-order predators in the Old World, any such separation may have important implications for faunal community structure. In total, 169 scat and stomach samples were analyzed revealing extensive dietary overlap between the species. Dietary intake was not distinguishable between species or related to individual body size. Invertebrates were most important in terms of frequency and volume, although reptiles, mammals and birds were also commonly identified. Dietary partitioning is not the mechanism allowing these congeneric varanid lizards to coexist.","[Sutherland, Duncan R.] Dept Environm & Conservat, Dwellingup, WA 6213, Australia; [Sutherland, Duncan R.] Invas Anim Cooperat Res Ctr, Dwellingup, WA 6213, Australia","Sutherland, DR (corresponding author), Phillip Isl Nat Pk, Res Dept, POB 97, Cowes, Vic 3922, Australia.",dsutherland@penguins.org.au,"Sutherland, Duncan/E-7763-2011","Sutherland, Duncan/0000-0003-0893-4425","Invasive Animals Cooperative Research CentreAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme","Special thanks to J.

The 21 species of Desmognathus can be sorted into three life-history categories, namely, stream, streamside, and forest, based on duration of the larval phase and a suite of other life-history and morphological traits that are correlated with habitat use of the several life-history stages. in most assemblages having all three life-history categories, stream species are larger than streamside species, and the latter species are larger than forest species. An evaluation of the literature on interspecific competition and predation (i.e., intraguild predation) in Desmognathus indicates that these processes are important in structuring assemblages of these salamanders. Thus, niche assembly, as opposed to dispersal assembly (i.e., neutral model), seems to be a valid model of community assembly in Desmognathus. Only streamside species occur throughout the range of the genus, and these forms alone are found around the periphery of the range. One to three streamside species form the base of extant assemblages of Desmognathus, with stream and forest species contributing to the. more diverse assemblages of the southern Appalachian region. The maximum numbers are two or three streamside species, two or three stream species, and two forest species, although assemblages of more than six species are undocumented. I suggest that the rapid evolutionary diversification in body size and life history in Desmognathus that has generated the complex assemblages of this genus in the Appalachians has been facilitated by a high level of life-history symmetry in these salamanders.","[Bruce, Richard C.] Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA","Bruce, RC (corresponding author), 200 Breeze Way, Aurora, NC 27806 USA.",cbruce1563@aol.com,,,Highlands Biological Station; Western Carolina University,"I thank Highlands Biological Station and Western Carolina University for support of my research on Desmognathus over many years.

We evaluated the hypothesis that varying the type and ratio of two food resources (Foxtail grass: American elm) alters the competitive outcome of Ae. albopictus and Culex pipiens (L.). We measured survivorship, development time, size, and adult longevity, and estimated the population growth index (lambda') of populations raised both alone and in equal number with the interspecific competitor, across five ratios of the two food resources. Competition was asymmetric with Ae. albopictus, the superior competitor across all resource treatments; however, the competitive advantage Ae. albopictus had over Cx. pipiens was reduced as grass became the predominant resource. With elm as the predominant resource, the population growth index (lambda') for both Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens was lower in intraspecific and interspecific competition treatments, respectively. The treatments also impacted adult life history, as life spans of both Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens varied when they emerged from larval conditions with different resource and competition treatments. We discuss the possible differences in the two species' efficiencies in exploiting the two resource types. Despite some resource conditions alleviating the competitive effects of Ae. albopictus on Cx. pipiens, competition remained asymmetric; thus, additional mechanisms are likely operating under field conditions when the two species coexist.","[Costanzo, K.

Sixty percent of the variation among genera for female reproductive allocation was due to differences between the family Pisauridae and the family Lycosidae. Temporal variation in reproductive allocation during the reproductive season was not observed for the majority of species examined. We found significantly different patterns of reproductive allocation among species within genera, suggesting that each species has responded to distinct selection pressures. Preliminarily, this extensive variation appears to be due mostly to interspecific competition and predation risk from other spiders. However, the patterns of reproductive allocation of species within a single guild (i.e., a group of species potentially competing for the same resources) for the two families are very different. Larger species of wolf spiders (family Lycosidae) within a given guild produce smaller numbers of larger offspring relative to the size of the mother, and smaller species produce the reverse. However, in nursery-web spiders (family Pisauridae) the larger species within a guild produce larger numbers of smaller offspring than expected. The current study provides an example of the flexibility of life history evolution despite phylogenetic constraints. It also demonstrates the potential for varying life history strategies to mediate competition, allowing similar species to coexist.","[Nicholas, Amy C.; Stratton, Gail E.; Reed, David H.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA","Reed, DH (corresponding author), Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",dhreed01@louisville.edu,,,University of Mississippi,"The University of Mississippi provided partial funding for this research.

Predation among consumers competing for food is termed intraguild predation (IGP). From the perspective of individual prey, IGP differs from classical predation in the likelihood of occurrence because IG prey is usually more rarely encountered and less profitable because it is more difficult to handle than classical prey. It is not known whether IGP is a sufficiently strong force to evolve interspecific threat sensitivity in antipredation behaviours, as is known from classical predation, and if so whether such behaviours are innate or learned. We examined interspecific threat sensitivity in antipredation in a guild of predatory mite species differing in adaptation to the shared spider mite prey (i.e. Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus californicus and Amblyseius andersoni). We first ranked the players in this guild according to the IGP risk posed to each other: A. andersoni was the strongest IG predator; P. persimilis was the weakest. Then, we assessed the influence of relative IGP risk and experience on maternal strategies to reduce offspring IGP risk: A. andersoni was insensitive to IGP risk. Threat sensitivity in oviposition site selection was induced by experience in P. persimilis but occurred independently of experience in N. californicus. Irrespective of experience, P. persimilis laid fewer eggs in choice situations with the high- rather than low-risk IG predator. Our study suggests that, similar to classical predation, IGP may select for sophisticated innate and learned interspecific threat-sensitive antipredation responses. We argue that such responses may promote the coexistence of IG predators and prey. (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of predators can be complex, and mechanisms by which predators affect invasion success and impact are understood for only a few well-studied communities. We tested experimentally whether a native predator limits an invasive species' success and impact on a native competitor for a community of aquatic insect larvae in water-filled containers. The native mosquito Aedes triseriatus alone had no significant effect on abundance of the invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus. The native predatory midge Corethrella appendiculata, at low or high density, significantly reduced A. albopictus abundance. This effect was not caused by trait-mediated oviposition avoidance of containers with predators, but instead was a density-mediated effect caused by predator-induced mortality. The presence of this predator significantly reduced survivorship of the native species, but high predator density also significantly increased development rate of the native species when the invader was present, consistent with predator-mediated release from interspecific competition with the invader. Thus, a native predator can indirectly benefit its native prey when a superior competitor invades. This shows the importance of native predators as a component of biodiversity for both biotic resistance to invasion and resilience of a community perturbed by successful invasion.","[Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Lounibos, L.

This has prompted research into the potential density enhancement of juvenile lobsters with 'casitas', large (1.1 m(2) surface area) but low-lying (3.8 cm entrance height) artificial shelters that exclude large predators. Moray eels (Muraenidae), however, fit into casitas and could therefore pose a threat to lobster enhancement. In a shelter-poor reef lagoon, we examined potential interactions between juvenile lobsters and the locally dominant morays Gymnothorax vicinus and G. moringa in the absence (four 1 ha control sites) and presence of casitas (five 1 ha 'casita sites', each with 10 casitas), before (6 surveys) and after (22 surveys) deployment. Morays and lobsters did not interact as predator-prey, as morays neither consumed nor intimidated co-occurring lobsters. Rather, the 2 taxa appeared to compete for limited shelter on the reef lagoon, as suggested by a significant increase in density and mean size of both taxa on casita sites after deployment. Casitas significantly increased cohabitation of morays and lobsters, yet they tended to co-occur less often than expected by chance, but this result likely reflects behavioral differences between the highly gregarious, more numerous lobsters and the typically solitary, cannibalistic morays. Our study exemplifies the influence of habitat complexity on the nature of interspecific interactions and shows that G. vicinus and G. moringa would not pose a threat to lobster enhancement with casitas.","[Lozano-Alvarez, E.; Briones-Fourzan, P.; Alvarez-Filip, L.; Negrete-Soto, F.; Barradas-Ortiz, C.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Cancun 77500, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Weiss, H.

Much attention has focused on the consequences of predator-regulation of herbivore populations, and associated trophic cascades. However apex predators may also control smaller 'mesopredators' through intraguild interactions. Removal of apex predators can result in changes to intraguild interactions and outbreaks of mesopredators ('mesopredator release'), leading in turn to increased predation on smaller prey. Here we provide a review and synthesis of studies of predator interactions, mesopredator release and their impacts on biodiversity. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators is widespread geographically and taxonomically. Apex predators suppress mesopredators both by killing them, or instilling fear, which motivates changes in behaviour and habitat use that limit mesopredator distribution and abundance. Changes in the abundance of apex predators may have disproportionate (up to fourfold) effects on mesopredator abundance. Outcomes of interactions between predators may however vary with resource availability, habitat complexity and the complexity of predator communities. There is potential for the restoration of apex predators to have benefits for biodiversity conservation through moderation of the impacts of mesopredators on their prey, but this requires a whole-ecosystem view to avoid unforeseen negative effects.

A weakness of this approach is that it typically does not consider effects of biotic interactions, including competition, on species' distributions. Here we identify and quantify the contribution of environmental factors relative to biotic factors (interspecific competition) to the distribution and abundance of three large, wide-ranging herbivores, the antilopine wallaroo (Macropus antilopinus), common wallaroo (Macropus robustus) and eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), across an extensive zone of sympatry in tropical northern Australia. To assess the importance of competition relative to habitat features, we constructed models of abundance for each species incorporating habitat only and habitat + the abundance of the other species, and compared their respective likelihoods using Akaike's information criterion. We further assessed the importance of variables predicting abundance across models for each species. The best-supported models of antilopine wallaroo and eastern grey kangaroo abundance included both habitat and the abundance of the other species, providing evidence of interspecific competition. Contrastingly, models of common wallaroo abundance were largely influenced by climate and not the abundance of other species. The abundance of antilopine wallaroos was most influenced by water availability, eastern grey kangaroo abundance and the frequency of late season fires. The abundance of eastern grey kangaroos was most influenced by aspects of climate, antilopine wallaroo abundance and a measure of cattle abundance. Our study demonstrates that where census and habitat data are available, it is possible to reveal species' interactions (and measure their relative strength and direction) between large, mobile and/or widely-distributed species for which competition is difficult to demonstrate experimentally. This allows discrimination of the influences of environmental factors and species interactions on species' distributions, and should therefore improve the predictive power of species distribution models.","[Ritchie, Euan G.; Martin, Jennifer K.; Johnson, Christopher N.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Martin, Jennifer K.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Fox, Barry J.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Ritchie, EG (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",euan.ritchie@jcu.edu.au,"Johnson, Christopher N/J-7894-2014; Ritchie, Euan/N-1088-2014; Johnson, Chris N/A-7275-2008","Johnson, Christopher N/0000-0002-9719-3771; Ritchie, Euan/0000-0003-4410-8868; ",,,,48,43,45,0,63,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

It was suggested that interspecific brood care (IBC) evolved to propagate C. dovii as a predator of another herbivorous fish Neetroplus nematopus, which is superior to C. nicaraguense in competition for breeding territory. However, it is still unclear how IBC is maintained in the face of cheaters that do not provide IBC. In this study, to elucidate the conditions for maintenance of IBC, we developed a spatially structured model, assuming a trade-off between reproduction and IBC (i.e., intra- and interspecific competition) and behavioral plasticity in IBC. The model predicted the following maintenance conditions: the probability of expressing (or suppressing) IBC in response to competitor invasion (or exclusion) is low, or, if the probability is high, then IBC is less effective for exclusion of competitors. Furthermore, we also predicted that IBC can be maintained without spatial structure if it is plastic behavior. Our model contributes to understanding of maintenance of IBC by providing empirically testable predictions. We discuss how this model is applicable to more general relationships, such as those in competitive or mutualistic systems.","[Nakazawa, Takefumi] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Yamamura, Norio] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038047, Japan","Nakazawa, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",nkzw@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Global COE Program A06Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Fellowship for Young ScientistsMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank Kenneth R.

Our overall objective of this study was to determine the potential to favor desired native perennial bunchgrasses over annual grasses by altering plant available mineral nitrogen (N). In the first study, we grew cheatgrass and three native bunch grasses (native grasses were combined in equal proportions) in an addition series experimental design and applied one of three N treatments (0, 137, and 280 mg N/kg soil). Regression models were used to derive the effects of intra-and interspecific competition on individual plant yield of cheatgrass and the native bunch grasses (combined). In our second study, we compared the absolute growth rate of the four plant species grown in isolation in a randomized complete block design for 109 days under the same soil N treatments as the competition study. Predicted mean average weight of isolated individuals increased with increasing soil N concentrations for both cheatgrass and the three native perennials (P < 0.05). Biomass of cheatgrass and its competitive ability increased with increasing soil N concentrations (P < 0.0001) compared to the combined native bunchgrasses. However, the greatest resource partitioning occurred at the 137 mg N/kg soil N treatment compared to the 0 (control) and 280 mg N/kg soil treatments, suggesting there may be a level of N that minimizes competition. In the second study, the absolute growth of cheatgrass grown in isolation also increased with increasing N levels (P = 0.0297). Results and ecological implications of this study suggest that increasing soil N leads to greater competitive ability of cheatgrass, and that it may be possible to favor desired plant communities by modifying soil nutrient levels.","[Vasquez, Edward; Sheley, Roger; Svejcar, Tony] USDA, Agr Res Serv, Burns, OR 97720 USA","Vasquez, E (corresponding author), USDA, Agr Res Serv, 67826-A Highway 205, Burns, OR 97720 USA.",ed.vasquez@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,48,71,77,3,48,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1939-7291,1939-747X,,INVAS PLANT SCI MANA,Invasive Plant Sci.

Henry Wilbur's model of population regulation in amphibians serves as a framework for the arguments. Much of the discussion is based on studies of eastern North American plethodontids that have been the focus of most of the research. Ensembles of plethodontids in this region include species with complex fife cycles (i.e., larval development) and simple life cycles (i.e., direct development). Interactions between members of these two life-history categories appear to be weaker than those within categories. Whereas there is no definitive evidence of factors that regulate populations of plethodontid salamanders, interspecific competition and intraguild predation do appear to contribute in some ensembles. Food and space have been identified as limiting resources in interspecific competition. Although predation of larger on smaller salamanders may be relatively rare in nature, the threat of predation appears to promote behavioral responses in members of the smaller species that reduce risks but may lower fitness through other effects. The role of extralimital predators and competitors in regulation of these salamanders is largely untested. ideally, future research should involve manipulative experiments on unenclosed field plots that examine effects of resources, intraguild competitors and predators, and extralimital predators on populations of key species of plethodontids.","Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA","Bruce, RC (corresponding author), Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA.",ebruce1563@aol.com,,,Highlands Biological Station; Western Carolina University,"I benefited immensely front insightful discussions of plethodontid ecology, over many years with the late Nelson G Hairston, Sr. (1917-2008), I dedicate this paper to his memory.

Larval competition experiments, i.e., coinfestations of the same fruit, and behavioral interference experiments measuring the ability of one female to displace another from a fruit, were performed among all pairs of the four species. We observed asymmetric and hierarchical interactions among species in both larval and adult interference competition. In agreement with the hypothesis that invasion is competition-limited, the competitive hierarchy coincided with the temporal sequence of establishment on the island, i.e., each newly established species tended to be competitively dominant over previously established ones.","CIRAD Pole Protect Plantes 3P, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu T, F-97410 St Pierre, La Reunion, France; CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Duyck, PF (corresponding author), CIRAD Pole Protect Plantes 3P, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu T, 7 Chemin IRAT, F-97410 St Pierre, La Reunion, France.",duyck@cirad.fr,"Duyck, Pierre-Francois/C-2416-2008; BPA, UPR SDC/B-8097-2009","Duyck, Pierre-Francois/0000-0001-5484-1970; ",,,,55,60,64,3,36,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2006,87,7,,,,,1770,1780,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1770:IOCMIS]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,069OK,WOS:000239457900015,16922326,,,,2021-09-21,

Similarity of body size has been proposed to lead competitors to seek similar prey, which increases the likelihood of interference encounters, including lethal ones. We explored the influence of body size, diet, predatory habits, and taxonomic relatedness on interspecific killing. The frequency of attacks depends on differences in body size: at small and large differences, attacks are less likely to occur; at intermediate differences, killing interactions are frequent and related to diet overlap. Further, the importance of interspecific killing as a mortality factor in the victim population increases with an increase in body size differences between killers and victims. Carnivores highly adapted to kill vertebrate prey are more prone to killing interactions, usually with animals of similar predatory habits. Family-level taxonomy influences killing interactions; carnivores tend to interact more with species in the same family than with species in different families. We conclude that although resource exploitation (diet), predatory habits, and taxonomy are influential in predisposing carnivores to attack each other, relative body size of the participants is overwhelmingly important. We discuss the implications of interspecific killing for body size and the dynamics of geographic ranges.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Donadio, E (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",emiliano@uwyo.edu; marten@uwyo.edu,"Buskirk, Steven W/K-2871-2016","Buskirk, Steven W/0000-0003-0611-6648; Donadio, Emiliano/0000-0001-5257-4100",,,,74,269,281,3,134,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

This edge habitat facilitates invasion of exotic species into remaining fragments. The ability of native species to resist invasion varies and may depend on intrinsic variables such as dispersal and reproductive rates as well as external factors such as rate of habitat change and the density of populations of introduced species in edge habitat. We examined the distributional and competitive relationships of two members of the class Chilopoda, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus, a centipede native to the eastern US, and Lithobius forficatus, an exotic centipede introduced from Europe. We found that L. forficatus was most abundant in edge habitat and S. sexspinosus was most abundant in the interior habitat at our field sites. Although L. forficatus was present in habitat interiors at 11 of 12 sites, there was no correlation between fragment size and numbers of L. forficatus in interior habitat. The native centipede was rarely found occupying fragment edges. We used laboratory microcosms to examine potential competitive interactions and to indirectly assess prey preferences of the two species. In microcosms both species consumed similar prey, but the native centipede, S. sexspinosus, acted as an intraguild predator on the introduced centipede. Native centipedes were competitively superior in both intraspecific and interspecific pairings. Our results suggest that intraguild predation may aid native centipedes in resisting invasion of introduced centipedes from edge habitat.","Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA","Hickerson, CAM (corresponding author), Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",chickerson2@msn.com,"Hickerson, Cari-Ann/A-8013-2008",,,,,61,25,26,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2005,146,1,,,,,110,119,,10.1007/s00442-005-0197-y,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,977HZ,WOS:000232795400012,16041613,,,,2021-09-21,

In this paper, we model the effect of size-dependent shifts in competitive ability on the coexistence of canopy-forming and understory coral species, and we predict how these shifts influence patterns of community structure along large-scale gradients in disturbance and recruitment limitation. We consider three models, representing a gradient from purely hierarchical competition in which the canopy-former is dominant, to competition involving standoffs and reversals between the understory species and juvenile canopy-formers. Analysis of these models leads to two key conclusions. First, as competition becomes less transitive, coexistence may be promoted or inhibited, depending upon the extent to which the canopy-former can sustain itself by clonal propagation. Specifically, when clonal growth alone is adequate to sustain the canopy-former, increasing nontransitivity promotes coexistence. When it is not, nontransitivity inhibits coexistence. Secondly, size-dependent nontransitivity dramatically changes how gradients in disturbance and recruitment affect species coexistence. In contrast to hierarchical interactions, standoffs and reversals do not show an intermediate recruitment phenomenon, in which coexistence is facilitated at intermediate levels of recruitment. Moreover, under hierarchical competition, the dominant always benefits mote than the subordinate as recruitment is increasingly facilitated. Under standoffs and reversals, however, increasing recruitment often favors the canopy-former at some levels of disturbance, but the understory species at other levels of disturbance. These results differ markedly from previous models of stage-dependent competition, suggesting that promotion of coexistence by ontogenetic shifts in competitive ability depends upon the mechanisms by which competition occurs in particular ecological contexts. The results also indicate that the effects of gradients in disturbance and recruitment on community structure depend fundamentally on how species compete for space.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Connolly, SR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",sean.connolly@jcu.edu.au,"Connolly, Sean R./E-7773-2011","Connolly, Sean R./0000-0003-1537-0859",,,,57,28,29,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2003,84,11,,,,,2979,2988,,10.1890/02-0347,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,754ZK,WOS:000187363200016,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

We conducted laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions on the use of food resources and behavior of the sea stars Leptasterias polaris and Asterias vulgaris, 2 major predators in subtidal communities of the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, We demonstrate interference (encounter) competition between the two. For both species, the presence of the other (as detected by both contact and chemical signals) decreased feeding activity and provoked behavioral changes (avoidance, decrease in percentage feeding). These effects were reversible and short-lived, and were more pronounced when there was a shortage of food and when sea stars were exposed to simulated attacks by the other species (involving pedicellarial pinching). L. polaris seemed to be the inferior competitor as (1) it switched to less profitable prey size (smaller mussels, Mytilus edulis) when A. vulgaris was present, and (2) it avoided A. vulgaris and reduced its feeding activity when food was scarce, The dominance of A. vulgaris is possibly attenuated at our study site (near its northern distributional limit) by the reduction of its fitness when water temperatures are low (most of the year) and during the winter when it migrates to deeper water, Competition for food resources seems to occur periodically (mainly summer), in localized areas (patches and beds of mussels) or when sea stars form dense aggregations in which they are likely to interact frequently, Interactions, and thus the chance of competition, are less likely at greater depths.

It has been shown that the two common granivorous gerbil species Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum that coexist in the sand dunes of the Israeli Negev show temporal partitioning in their time of activity. The bigger species, G. pyramidum, aggressively displaces the smaller species from early night-time. We examined the change in the activity pattern of G. allenbyi in pure and mixed populations in two 1-ha field enclosures. 2. We confirmed the temporal pattern reported by Ziv et al. (1993) and Kotler et al. (1993). 3. We also measured how much energy it takes (in g of millet seeds) to compensate for the costs, associated with interference and exploitation competition, by adding millet seeds to 18 seed trays/enclosure. We added 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 g of seeds/seed-tray. In each seed-tray we mixed the seeds in 2 L of sand. 4. It took 3-5 g of seeds/seed-tray (1.8-3 g seeds/day/ha/individual) to completely overcome the competition by G. pyramidum. This is the cost of the interference and exploitation competition from G. pyramidum (in the currency of millet seeds). 5. The result suggests that there is a trade-off between interference competition and food to which gerbils respond behaviourally.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zvika@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012",,,,,43,36,36,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Metapopulation theory is a potentially powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of such competing species, but metapopulation models with competition are often too complex to be useful as guides for empirical investigation. In this paper I employ two techniques from dynamical systems theory (perturbation expansion and the examination of invariant manifolds) in a qualitative and quantitative analysis of two-species competition within a metapopulation, with the goal of using geometric ideas to provide insight into how competition affects species living in a fragmented habitat. Four-state metapopulation competition models (where habitat patches may be occupied by either of two competing species, both, or neither) can be analyzed as perturbations of simpler three-state models (those without doubly occupied patches as one of the state variables). Symmetric competition for patches is always unstable in three-state Levins-type metapopulations, but generally stable in analogous mainland-island systems. The attracting manifold of a three-state system has the form of an invariant curve joining the two species' Levins equilibria. Under asymmetric competition for patches, coexistence is possible only if the inferior competitor possesses a higher equilibrium proportion of occupied patches in the absence of competition. Asymmetric competition changes the nature of the attracting manifold, with the limit case a curve that is locally tangent to a line parallel to the axis for the proportion of occupied patches of the inferior competitor. The interior equilibrium of a four-state model can be calculated as a perturbation expansion in a parameter alpha, the fraction of doubly occupied patches that contribute to recolonization. The perturbation method in conjunction with center manifold analysis proves that coexistence of like species within a metapopulation is possible if and only if there is recolonization from doubly occupied patches. Rescue effects may make competitive coexistence impossible via the creation of a saddle-point equilibrium having one-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds. Application of the theory to published data from several species of Daphnia in Fennoscandia shows good quantitative agreement with observations and makes several new qualitative predictions. The results are discussed in connection with ecological dynamics of similar forms, including those in the process of speciation.","Univ Paris 11, CNRS URA 2154, F-91405 Orsay, France","Taneyhill, DE (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",bgydgt@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,67,25,27,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12 degrees C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6 degrees C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600808, Japan; Hokkaido Univ Forests, Tomakomai Res Stn, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan","Taniguchi, Y (corresponding author), Yamaguchi Prefectural Univ, Dept Life Environm Sci, 3-2-1 Sakurabatake, Yamaguchi 7538502, Japan.",ytani@ws1.yamaguchi-pu.ac.jp,,,,,,78,163,169,1,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2000,81,7,,,,,2027,2039,,10.2307/177290,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,334YQ,WOS:000088214400022,,,,,2021-09-21,

We investigated interactions and the potential for competition between larvae of these two species under conditions of community transition. Survival, growth rates, and spatial and feeding niche overlaps of larvae as well as abundance of the unicellular microorganism Prototheca richasdsi (a mediator of interference competition between tadpoles) were measured in three duplicated sets of ponds in the same habitat. One set was used by B. bufo only, one by B. calamita only, and one by both species. B. bufo larvae survived and grew as well, or better, in mixed-species ponds as they did when alone. By contrast, B. calamita larvae grew more slowly, suffered higher premetamorphic mortality, and emerged as smaller toadlets in mixed-species ponds, compared with single-species ponds. B. calamita changed its spatial niche in mixed-species ponds much more markedly than did B. bufo, but spatial and feeding niche overlaps remained high. P. richardsi was rare in guts and feces of larvae in single-species ponds, but it occurred in large numbers in guts and feces of larvae from mixed-species ponds. The data indicate that B. bufo is a superior competitor to B. calamita and that both resource and interference competition may occur between the two species in this transitional situation.","Univ Sussex, Sch Biol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Bardsley, L (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Biol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,43,37,40,0,14,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1998,79,5,,,,,1751,1759,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1751:ICBBLU]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101CX,WOS:000074853000024,,,,,2021-09-21,

Because spring peepers are believed to be poor competitors, I hypothesized that competition from green frog larvae limits the distribution of spring peeper larvae. I stocked field enclosures with a constant density of spring peeper larvae, and one of four densities of green frog larvae (a ''target-neighbor'' design). Increased green frog density had a small effect on metamorphic size and no effects on survivorship, larval period or growth rates of spring peepers. In contrast to these small interspecific effects, green frogs had a large effect on their own performance. Intraspecific competition resulted in a 50% decline in growth rate and an 11% decline in metamorphic size. These results suggest that the species are segregated in resource use, or that compared with green frogs, spring peepers are better able to cope with depressed resource densities. In either case, this field experiment provides no evidence that interspecific competition from green frogs limits distributions of spring peepers.

Following introductions in the 1950s, Gammarus pulex has replaced the native Irish freshwater amphipod G. duebeni celticus in several river systems. We show that G. pulex has eliminated and replaced G. d. celticus in lower sections of the River Lagan system, N. Ireland, although G. d. celticus maintains pure populations upstream-from G. pulex. More rarely, the two species may be found together. 2. We investigate the potential roles of cannibalism and mutual predation in explaining these replacement patterns. G. d. celticus was significantly more cannibalistic on moulted conspecifics than G. pulex. Mutual predation by intermoult individuals on moulted congenerics was observed in all combinations of adult males and females, including those in the precopulatory mate-guarding phase, and juveniles. In general, predation between species exceeded cannibalism within species, particularly predation by G. pulex on G. d. celticus. Predation was differentially in favour of G. pulex in most combinations. These differences in predation frequencies were not dependent on body size. 3. A model is presented incorporating resource exploitation competition, cannibalism and mutual predation. The behaviour of the model agrees with our intuitive predictions and our conclusions based on empirical findings. Cannibalism in the absence of predation promotes coexistence, whereas mutual but differential predation in the absence of cannibalism may lead to elimination, depending on relative resource competitive ability. When cannibalism and predation occur together, predation of equal magnitude or greater than cannibalism leads to rapid elimination. Predation in favour of species 1 may overcome a competitive advantage for species 2, leading to elimination of species 2. 4. We conclude that the superior abilities of G. pulex to resist predatory attacks and to prey on moulted G. d. celticus may be major features of the elimination and replacement of the latter species by the former. 5. We encourage examination of replacements involving other crustaceans in terms of predatory behaviour and, more generally, urge adoption of approaches at the individual level to elucidate mechanisms underlying interspecific relationships.",,"DICK, JTA (corresponding author), QUEENS UNIV BELFAST,SCH BIOL & BIOCHEM,MED BIOL CTR,DIV ENVIRONM & EVOLUT BIOL,BELFAST BT9 7BL,ANTRIM,NORTH IRELAND.",,,,,,,44,108,111,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Focal individuals were observed alone and in pairs with conspecifics and allospecifics at four prey (Baetis bicaudatus, Baetidae, Ephemeroptera) densities to determine whether competitors and prey resource levels affected prey capture rates. Presence of conspecific or allospecific competitors reduced stonefly prey capture rates, especially for Kogotus, the smaller of the two species, due to a significant decline in predator-prey encounter rates with competitors present. This competitive effect was not observed at the lowest and highest prey densities due to very low or very high predator-prey encounter rates, respectively. Thus, interference affected feeding rates only at intermediate prey densities. Competitors had no effect on the probability of attacks per prey encounter or capture success per attack. Within each stonefly species the effects of intra- and interspecific interference on feeding rates were similar, even though behavioral responses by both stoneflies to interspecific encounters were more frequent than to encounters with conspecifics. Kogotus showed the highest levels of response to encounters with other stone-flies, maintaining those high levels of response to Megarcys over all prey densities. Further, male Kogotus, which are the smaller sex, responded more frequently to competitive interactions than did females. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that interspecific interference was asymmetrical with Megarcys, the larger species, being the superior competitor.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA","PECKARSKY, BL (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,51,49,50,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,85,4,,,,,521,529,,10.1007/BF00323764,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY036,WOS:A1991EY03600009,28312499,,,,2021-09-21,

The competitive interactions between these species are of interest to biologists due to the furbearer status of bobcats, the recent range expansion of coyotes, and the recolonisation of several parts of North America by bobcats following their extirpation. Although studies exploring the dynamics and competition between bobcats and coyotes span decades, there is a lack of understanding regarding what factors influence exploitative or interference competition, and what methodologies are conducive to identifying these types of competition. We gathered a comprehensive list of research papers (n = 41) exploring bobcat-coyote competitive interactions in North America. From them, we collected the following: study site characteristics, number and types of research methods, number and types of metrics explored, history of sympatry of the two species at the study location, presence of apex predators, and documentation of interference and/or exploitative competition. Using generalised linear models, we determined that interference competition between bobcats and coyotes was observed primarily in open habitat. However, habitat heterogeneity, the number of research methods and metrics used, presence of an apex predator, and history of sympatry could not be used to predict the occurrence of interference competition. Studies that included diet overlap were less likely to observe interference competition than studies that used other metrics to infer competition. Competitive interactions between coyotes and bobcats are largely a function of prey availability. Our findings suggest that habitat type may be a surrogate for prey availability, which many researchers mention, but do not explicitly measure. Future studies investigating bobcat-coyote interactions should include the quantification of prey densities to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the system at large, and should avoid using solely diet or habitat overlap as metrics to assess competition.","[Dyck, Marissa A.; Wyza, Eileen; Popescu, Viorel D.] Ohio Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 57 Oxbow Trail,107 Irvine Hall, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Popescu, Viorel D.] Univ Bucharest, Ctr Environm Res, 1 N Balcescu Blvd, Bucharest 010042, Romania","Dyck, MA; Wyza, E (corresponding author), Ohio Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 57 Oxbow Trail,107 Irvine Hall, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",md441717@ohio.edu; en660715@ohio.edu; popescu@ohio.edu,,,"Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program (Wildlife Management in Ohio, USA) [W-134-P-20]; Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS-UEFISCDIConsiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI) [PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2019-0835]; Department of Biological Sciences at Ohio University","This project was funded by the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program (W--134-P-20, Wildlife Management in Ohio, USA), administered jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Ohio Division of Wildlife, and the Department of Biological Sciences at Ohio University.

In Scandinavia, recent research has reported that brown bear presence influences gray wolf habitat selection and kill rates. Here, we characterized the temporal use of a common prey resource by sympatric wolves and bears and described individual and seasonal variation in their direct and/or indirect interactions. Most bear-wolf interactions were indirect, via bear scavenging of wolf kills. Bears used >50% of wolf kills, whereas we did not record any wolf visit at bear kills. Adult and subadult bears visited wolf kills, but female bears with cubs of the year, the most vulnerable age class to conspecifics and other predators, did not. Wolf and bear kill rates peaked in early summer, when both targeted neonate moose calves, which coincided with a reduction in bear scavenging rate. Some bears were highly predatory and some did not kill any calf. Individual and age-class variation (in bear predation and scavenging patterns) and seasonality (in bear scavenging patterns and main prey availability of both wolves and bears) could mediate coexistence of these apex predators. Similar processes likely occur in other ecosystems with varying carnivore assemblages.","[Ordiz, Andres; Milleret, Cyril; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, Postbox 5003, NO-5003 As, Norway; [Ordiz, Andres; Wikenros, Camilla; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Ordiz, Andres; Uzal, Antonio] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0FQ, Notts, England; [Zimmermann, Barbara; Wabakken, Petter] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol Agr Sci & Biotechnol, NO-2480 Evenstad, Koppang, Norway; [Kindberg, Jonas] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Kindberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, Postbox 5003, NO-5003 As, Norway.; Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.; Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0FQ, Notts, England.",andres.ordiz@gmail.com; cyril.milleret@gmail.com; antonio.uzal@ntu.ac.uk; barbara.zimmermann@inn.no; petter.wabakken@inn.no; camilla.wikenros@slu.se; hakan.sand@slu.se; jon.swenson@nmbu.no; jonas.kindberg@rovdata.no,"Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020; Milleret, Cyril/AAW-2388-2021; Uzal, Antonio/ABE-3885-2020","Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Uzal, Antonio/0000-0001-6478-1895; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457; Zimmermann, Barbara/0000-0001-5133-9379",Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF); Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Office of Environmental Affairs in Hedmark County; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; WWF (Sweden); Swedish Carnivore Association; Signhild Engkvists Foundation; Carl Tryggers Foundation; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Foundation; Nottingham Trent University; Olle Foundation,"The Scandinavian wolf and bear research projects (SKANDULV and SBBRP, respectively) have been funded by the Norwegian Environment Agency, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Norwegian Research Council, Swedish Research Council Formas, Austrian Science Fund, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, O ffice of Environmental Affairs in Hedmark County, Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, WWF (Sweden), Swedish Carnivore Association, Olle and Signhild Engkvists Foundations, Carl Tryggers Foundation, and Marie-Claire Cronstedts Foundation.

Thus, ecomorphological patterns can be disrupted locally by biotic interactions, such as competition, and may not be consistent across lineages. Here, we studied the evolution of claws and toepads in relationship to macrohabitat (vegetation), use of structural microhabitat (perch height) and congeneric competition for two distantly related Lesser Antillean anole clades: the Anolis bimaculatus and Anolis roquet series. We collected univariate and geometric morphometric data from 254 individuals across 22 species to test the hypotheses that functional morphology should covary with both vegetation and perch height and that the presence of a competitor may disrupt such covariation. Our data showed predictable associations between morphology and macrohabitat on single-species islands but not when a congeneric competitor was present. The outcomes of competition differed between series, however. In the A. bimaculatus series, species with a sympatric congener diverged in claw and toepad traits consistent with functional predictions, whereas A. roquet series anoles showed either no association between habitat and morphology or the opposite pattern. Our results demonstrated that ecomorphological patterns across macrohabitats can be disrupted by competition-driven microhabitat partitioning and that specific morphological responses to similar ecological pressures can vary between lineages.","[Yuan, Michael L.; Jung, Catherine; Wang, Ian J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yuan, Michael L.; Wake, Marvalee H.; Wang, Ian J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yuan, Michael L.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Wake, Marvalee H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Letters & Sci, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Yuan, ML (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Yuan, ML (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Yuan, ML (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",michael.yuan@berkeley.edu,,"Yuan, Michael/0000-0002-0298-0781",Philomathia Fellowship in the Environmental Sciences from UC Berkeley; Smithsonian Institution Predoctoral FellowshipSmithsonian Institution; UC Berkeley Sponsored Projects for Undergraduate Research program; Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Field Research from the American Philosophical Society; Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley; NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity grantNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-1542534],"We thank the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the California Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History for access to the materials examined in this study.

For this purpose, we used single-species and two-species occupancy models using records of D. albiventris, considered the dominant species, and D. aurita from a cameratrap survey conducted in an agricultural and conservation landscape in the Atlantic Forest of Argentina. We evaluated which factors determined the probability of species occurrence: habitat preferences or interspecific relationships. We also estimated the overlap in daily activity patterns between species, and evaluated changes in D. aurita activity in response to the occupancy probability of D. albiventris. Didelphis aurita had higher occupancy probabilities in the continuous native forest, whereas D. albiventris had higher occupancy probabilities in fragmented forests with less complex and more open vegetation structure, and greater proximity to buildings. Both opossums were almost absent in pine plantations. Results of the co-occurrence models and the overlap in diel activity suggest that D. aurita is not avoiding D. albiventris. Occurrences of these two opossums most probably reflect different adaptations by each species to different habitats, and competitive interactions seem to play a minor role in shaping their current distributions. Didelphis albiventris may be replacing D. aurita mainly as a result of changing environmental conditions, which become unfavorable to the latter but promote the creation of new habitat for the former.","[Cruz, Paula; Eugenia Iezzi, Maria; De Angelo, Carlos; Varela, Diego; Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, CONICET, Inst Biol Subtrop, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [Cruz, Paula; Eugenia Iezzi, Maria; De Angelo, Carlos; Varela, Diego; Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Asociac Civil Ctr Invest Bosque Atlantico, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Bertoni 124, RA-3380 Eldorado, Misiones, Argentina","Cruz, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, CONICET, Inst Biol Subtrop, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina.; Cruz, P (corresponding author), Asociac Civil Ctr Invest Bosque Atlantico, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina.",policruz@hotmail.com,,"Varela, Diego/0000-0003-3123-6756","Ministry of Ecology of Misiones Province; Fundacion Vida Silvestre Argentina; National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), Cataratas del Iguazu International Airport, Argentine Army; Department of Forestry and Renewable Forest Resources; ESRI Conservation Program; Society for Conservation GIS - UCAR (Unidad para el Cambio Rural); Ministerio de Agroindustria, Argentina [10102]; ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Argentina) through PICTANPCyT [1904]; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 2012-2014.112-201101-00616]; Project UE IBS [22920160100130CO]; Ministerio de Ecologia de Misiones through Proyecto de Implementacion del Plan de Manejo del Parque Provincial Uruguai [256/09]","We are grateful to all the students and park rangers that helped us with the field activities, especially to J.

Detailed, parameter-rich models often provide accurate estimates of system behaviour but can be data-hungry and difficult to operationalize. Moreover, complexity increases the danger of 'over-fitting', which leads to poor performance when models are applied to novel conditions. This challenge is typically described in terms of a trade-off between bias and variance (i.e. low accuracy vs. low precision). In studies of ecological communities, this trade-off often leads to an argument about the level of detail needed to describe interactions among species. Here, we used data from a grassland biodiversity experiment containing nine locally abundant plant species (the Jena 'dominance experiment') to parameterize models representing six increasingly complex hypotheses about interactions. For each model, we calculated goodness-of-fit across different subsets of the data based on sown species richness levels, and tested how performance changed depending on whether or not the same data were used to parameterize and test the model (i.e. within vs. out-of-sample), and whether the range of diversity treatments being predicted fell inside or outside of the range used for parameterization. As expected, goodness-of-fit improved as a function of model complexity for all within-sample tests. In contrast, the best out-of-sample performance generally resulted from models of intermediate complexity (i.e. with only two interaction coefficients per species-an intraspecific effect and a single pooled interspecific effect), especially for predictions that fell outside the range of diversity treatments used for parameterization. In accordance with other studies, our results also demonstrate that commonly used selection methods based on AIC of models fitted to the full dataset correspond more closely to within-sample than out-of-sample performance. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that models which include only general intra and interspecific interaction coefficients can be sufficient for estimating species-level abundances across a wide range of contexts and may provide better out-of-sample performance than do more complex models. These findings serve as a reminder that simpler models may often provide a better trade-off between bias and variance in ecological systems, particularly when applying models beyond the conditions used to parameterize them.","[Clark, Adam Thomas; Harpole, W.

In practice, however, these models rarely generate accurate predictions in diverse communities. We propose that this difference between theory and practice may be caused by how uncertainty propagates through Lotka-Volterra systems. In approximating mechanistic relationships with Lotka-Volterra models, associations among parameters are lost, and small variation can correspond to large and unrealistic changes in predictions. We demonstrate that constraining Lotka-Volterra models using correlations among parameters expected from hypothesized underlying mechanisms can reintroduce some of the underlying structure imposed by those mechanisms, thereby improving model predictions by both reducing bias and increasing precision. Our results suggest that this hybrid approach may combine some of the generality of phenomenological models with the broader applicability and meaningful interpretability of mechanistic approaches. These methods could be useful in poorly understood systems for identifying important coexistence mechanisms, or for making more accurate predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In such life-history intraguild predation (LHIGP) systems, prey can therefore also regulate the recruitment and thus population dynamics of their predator via competition. Theory predicts that such stage-structured systems exhibit a wide range of dynamics, including alternative stable states. Here we show that cannibalism is an exceedingly common interaction within natural LHIGP systems that determines what coexistence states are possible. Using a modeling approach that simulates a range of ontogenetic diet shift scenarios along a productivity gradient, we demonstrate that only if the predator is competitively dominant can cannibalism promote coexistence by allowing prey to persist. If the prey is competitively dominant, cannibalism instead results in competitive exclusion of the predator and the loss of potential alternative stable states. Further, predator exclusion occurs at low cannibalistic preference relative to empirical estimates and is consistent across LHIGP systems in which the predator undergoes a complete diet shift or diet broadening over ontogeny. Given that prey is frequently competitively dominant in natural systems, our results demonstrate that even weak cannibalism can inhibit predator persistence, prompting exploration of mechanisms that reconcile theory with the common occurrence of such interactions in nature.","[Toscano, Benjamin J.; Rudolf, Volker H.

Whether and how warming-induced effects on competitive interactions are modified by predation remains unknown. We hypothesized that predation will offset the competitive advantage of smaller prey species in warmer environments because of their greater vulnerability to predation. To test this, we assembled a litter arthropod community with two Collembola species (Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta) of different body sizes across a temperature gradient (three thermal environments) and in the presence and absence of predatory mites. Predatory mites reduced Collembola coexistence with increasing temperatures. Contradicting our hypothesis, the larger prey species always outperformed the smaller prey species in warmer environments with predators. Larger prey probably benefited as they expressed a greater trait (body length) plasticity to warming. Warming can thus magnify predation effects and reduce the probability of prey coexistence.","[Thakur, Madhav P.; Kuenne, Tom; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Thakur, Madhav P.; Kuenne, Tom; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Griffin, John N.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Wallace Bldg,Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales","Thakur, MP (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.; Thakur, MP (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",madhav.thakur@idiv.de,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019","Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Griffin, John/0000-0003-3295-6480; Thakur, Madhav/0000-0001-9426-1313",German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ei 862/2]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FZT 118]; European Research Council (ERC starting grant)European Research Council (ERC) [677232],"M.P.T. and N.E. acknowledge the funding of German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG; Ei 862/2).

This study compared the relative and interacting effects of competition and predation on two competing species of coral reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. moluccensis (Pomacentridae), using a multifactorial experiment. Fish were subjected to the sight and smell of a known predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), the presence of the heterospecific competitor (i.e., P. amboinensis vs. P. moluccensis), or a combination of the two for a period of 19 days. The sub-lethal effects of predator/competitor treatments were compared with controls; a combination of otolith microstructure analysis and observations were used to determine otolith growth patterns and behaviour. We predicted that the stress of competition and/or predation would result in strong sub-lethal impacts, and act synergistically on growth and behavioural patterns. We found strong evidence to support this prediction, but only for P. amboinensis, which suffered reductions in growth in both predator and competitor treatments, with the largest reductions occurring when subjected to both predation and competition concurrently. There was strong evidence of asymmetrical competition between the two damselfish species, with P. moluccensis as the dominant competitor, displaying strong aggressive behaviour towards P. amboinensis. Growth reductions for P. amboinensis in predator/competitor treatments appeared to come about primarily due to increases in shelter seeking behaviour, which significantly reduced the foraging rates of individuals compared with controls. These data highlight the importance of predator/competitor synergisms in influencing key behaviours and demographic parameters for juvenile coral reef fishes.","[Hall, April] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Hall, A (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",april.hall3110@gmail.com,"Kingsford, Michael J/C-2015-2008","Kingsford, Michael J/0000-0003-1704-6198; Hall, April/0000-0003-3672-2761",ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies grantAustralian Research Council,All funding was from an ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies grant to Michael Kingsford.,,71,6,6,0,23,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 18,2016,11,3,,,,,,,e0151778,10.1371/journal.pone.0151778,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,DH1ZE,WOS:000372582800101,26992169,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-21,

However, research into the behavioral mechanism underlying competition between co-cultured species is lacking. For the first time in co-cultured fish and crustaceans, this study explored experimentally the behavioral interaction between red tilapia and red-claw crayfish in the context of food competion. The effects of the presence of heterospecifics (absent or present), the size of fish relative to crayfish (larger or smaller) and the number of food patches available for the fish (one- versus two-patch conditions) on the foraging decisions and aggression of fish and crayfish were tested. Time spent by fish in the bottom food patch (accessible for fish and crayfish) was shorter in the presence of crayfish, for small but not large fish and when there was an alternative patch for the fish (accessible only for fish). Time spent by crayfish in the bottom food patch was reduced in the presence of large, but not small, fish and when there was no alternative food patch for the fish. Fish were most aggressive towards conspecifics whereas interspecific aggression was exhibited only by crayfish. At the individual level, the dominant fish and crayfish spent more time in the bottom patch and performed more aggressive actions than the other conspecifics. In fish, this was not altered in the presence of crayfish. In crayfish, the overall reduction in foraging duration and aggression was due to an effect of large fish on the dominant individual. The implication of these findings for fish-crayfish communal culture is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

During the last decades, the influence of different time scales through the local/regional dynamics of animal communities has received an increasing attention. Nevertheless, different time scales involved in interspecific competition can result form other processes than spatial dynamics. Here, we envision and analyze a new theoretical framework that couples a game theory approach for competition with a demographic model. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the total densities of the two populations and we study how these two time scales interfere and influence outcomes of species competition. We find that a competition process occurring on a faster time scale than demography yields a priority effect where the first species introduced outcompetes the other one. We then confirm previous findings stipulating that species coexistence is favored by large difference in time scales because the extinction/recolonization process. Our results then highlight that an integration of demographic and competition time scales at both local and regional levels is mandatory to explain communities assemblages and should become a research priority.","[Moussaoui, Ali] Univ Tlemcen, Dept Math, Tilimsen 13000, Algeria; [Auger, Pierre; Roche, Benjamin] IRD France Nord, IRD, UMI 209, UMMISCO, F-93143 Bondy, France","Moussaoui, A (corresponding author), Univ Tlemcen, Dept Math, Tilimsen 13000, Algeria.",moussaouidz@yahoo.fr; pierre.auger@ird.fr; benjamin.roche@ird.fr,"Ali, Moussaoui/B-3847-2014","Ali, Moussaoui/0000-0001-9630-0742; Auger, Pierre/0000-0003-2066-8174; Roche, Benjamin/0000-0001-7975-4232",Franco-Algerian project: Tassili [10MDU800]; National Research Project: PNR [08/U13/1030],This work was partially supported by the Franco-Algerian project: Tassili 10MDU800 and the National Research Project: PNR 08/U13/1030.

Less competitive species benefit from evading direct encounters with aggressive dominants, whereas dominant species could use cues left by subordinates to steal their resources or to chase them off. Here, we studied competitive interactions among five common and syntopic ant species in Central Europe (Formica polyctena, Formica rufibarbis, Lasius niger, Myrmica rubra and Tetramorium caespitum) and investigated their ability to react to heterospecific chemical cues. Using aggression assays, we established a clear dominance hierarchy of these species, with L. niger and F. polyctena as the most dominant species. Using Y-mazes, we then tested whether ants avoid or prefer areas with cues of either dominant or subordinate species. These cues included trail pheromones, cuticular hydrocarbons and chemical footprints. Ants of all species ignored heterospecific trail pheromone extracts, but two of the three subordinate species avoided cuticular hydrocarbons of the dominant species. In contrast, dominants either ignored or were attracted to cuticular hydrocarbon extracts of subordinates. The avoidance behaviour of the subordinates might be quantity-dependent, as footprints of the dominant species L. niger attracted two subordinates. The lowest ranking species M. rubra was unresponsive to cues of heterospecifics but avoided following the traces of their own colony members. Our study shows that ants exploit heterospecific cues either to avoid or to seek competitors and that their reaction depends on their dominance rank in the local community.

Using plant-pollinator network models as an example, we contrast the predicted vulnerability of a community to secondary extinctions under the assumption of purely mutualistic interactions versus mutualistic and competitive interactions. We find that competition among plant species increases the risk of secondary extinctions and extinction cascades. Simulations over a number of different network structures indicate that this effect is stronger in larger networks, more strongly connected networks and networks with higher plant:pollinator ratios. We conclude that efforts to model plant-pollinator communities will systematically over-estimate community robustness to species loss if plant competition is ignored. However, because the effect of plant competition depends on network architecture, and because characterization of plant competition is work intensive, we suggest that efforts to account for plant competition in plant-pollinator network models should be focused on large, strongly connected networks with high plant:pollinator ratios.","[Bewick, Sharon; Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Brosi, Berry J.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Bewick, S (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",sharon_bewick@hotmail.com,,"Armsworth, Paul/0000-0003-0918-0573; Brosi, Berry/0000-0002-9233-1151",Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1120572] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,,,42,4,4,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2013,122,12,,,,,1710,1719,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00016.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,254OX,WOS:000327176100007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Exploitative competition is predicted to favor more virulent parasites, whereas interference competition may result in lower virulence. Here, we examine whether exploitative or interference competition determines the outcome of competition between two nematode species (Steinernema spp.), which in combination with their bacterial symbionts (Xenorhabdus spp.), infect and kill insect hosts. Multiple isolates of each nematode species, carrying their naturally associated bacteria, were characterized by (1) the rate at which they killed insect hosts, and by (2) the ability of their bacteria to interfere with each other's growth via bacteriocidal toxins called bacteriocins. We found that both exploitative and interference abilities were important in predicting which species had a selective advantage in pairwise competition experiments. When nematodes carried bacteria that did not interact via bacteriocins, the faster killing isolate had a competitive advantage. Alternatively, nematodes could gain a competitive advantage when they carried bacteria able to inhibit the bacteria of their competitor. Thus, the combination of nematode/bacterial traits that led to competitive success depended on which isolates were paired, suggesting that variation in competitive interactions may be important for maintaining species diversity in this community.","[Bashey, Farrah; Lively, Curtis M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Hawlena, Hadas] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Bashey, F (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",fbasheyv@indiana.edu,"Lively, Curtis M/A-8057-2011; Hawlena, Hadas/F-1669-2012","Hawlena, Hadas/0000-0002-0634-2920; Bashey-Visser, Farrah/0000-0002-7992-4577","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0515832, -0919015]","We thank R.

Closely related species often differ greatly in the quality and breadth of resources exploited, but the actual mechanisms causing these differences are poorly understood. Because in the laboratory specialized species often survive and perform as well or better on host species that are never utilized in nature, negative ecological interactions restricting host range must exist. Here, we focused on reproductive interference, which has been theoretically predicted to drive niche separation between closely related species with overlapping mating signals. 2. We examined the interspecific sexual interactions in relation to ecological specialization and generalization in two sibling ladybird species, Harmonia yedoensis and Harmonia axyridis. Harmonia yedoensis is a specialist predator that preys only on pine aphids, which are highly elusive prey for ladybird hatchlings, whereas H.similar to axyridis is a generalist predator with a broad prey and habitat range. 3. We experimentally showed that conspecific sperm fertilized the vast majority of eggs regardless of mating order (i.e. conspecific sperm precedence) when a female of H.similar to yedoensis or H.similar to axyridis mated with both a conspecific and a heterospecific male. Moreover, we demonstrated that mating opportunities of H.similar to yedoensis females strongly decreased as heterospecific density increased relative to conspecific density. In contrast, in H.similar to axyridis, female mating success was high regardless of conspecific or heterospecific density. 4. Our results suggest that the generalist H.similar to axyridis should be dominant to the specialist H.similar to yedoensis in terms of reproductive interference. Our results support the hypothesis that asymmetric reproductive interference from the dominant species may force the non-dominant species to become a specialist predator that exclusively utilizes less preferred prey in nature.","[Noriyuki, Suzuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Osawa, Naoya] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Forest Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Nishida, Takayoshi] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Ecosyst Studies, Hikone 5228533, Japan","Noriyuki, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",nsuzuki@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Osawa, Naoya/ABG-1684-2020; Suzuki, Noriyuki/I-4882-2015","Suzuki, Noriyuki/0000-0002-7483-0758; Osawa, Naoya/0000-0002-6355-1948","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20405047, 20657005]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [20405047] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Dr Peter Mayhew for valuable discussions and Sarah Seiter for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Most studies, however, emphasize chewing insects and secondary chemistry, thus ignoring the diverse group of vascular-parasites that may be more likely to compete through induced changes in phytonutrients. Using an aboveground phloem-feeding aphid (Myzus persicae) and a belowground gall-forming nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) on tobacco plants, we assessed the importance of competition via induced host-plant sinks. In a series of experimental trials, nematode root herbivory caused 55 and 72% declines in the growth and fecundity of aphids, respectively. Aphids, on the other hand, did not impact nematode performance. Therefore, we predicted that nematodes out-compete M. persicae by attenuating the magnitude of aphid-induced sinks. Through a combination of invertase enzyme measurements and stable isotope (C-13 and N-15) enrichment, we found evidence that both herbivores act as mobilizing sinks. Aphids attracted photoassimilates to feeding aggregations on leaves and nematode galls accumulated resources in the roots. Levels of invertase enzymes, for example, were more than fourfold higher in nematode galls than in surrounding root tissue. Yet we found no evidence supporting a sink competition model for aphid-nematode interactions. The strength of aphid-induced leaf sinks was entirely unaffected by nematode presence, and vice versa. Thus, induced host-plant sinks appear to be a common strategy employed by vascular parasites to manipulate the physiology of their host, but multi-sink competition may be limited to herbivores that co-occur on the same tissue type and/or plants under growth-limited abiotic conditions.","[Kaplan, Ian] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sardanelli, Sandra; Denno, Robert F.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Rehill, Brian J.] US Naval Acad, Dept Chem, Annapolis, MD USA","Kaplan, I (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ikaplan@purdue.edu,,,,,,58,42,43,0,80,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2011,166,3,,,,,627,636,,10.1007/s00442-010-1885-9,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,777HI,WOS:000291606100006,21181415,,,,2021-09-21,

We also determined the effects of these interactions on the survivorship of the prey species as mediated by the predator. In both fish and crab prey trials, interspecific interactions between multiple prey increased the overall consumption rate of O. beta, and in each case, one prey species was harmed (decreased survivorship) while the other prey species was not significantly affected by these interactions (all relative to single-prey treatments). In trials run with fish prey, behavioral observations revealed that L rhomboides aggressively chased O. chrysoptera out of a seagrass refuge and into a surrounding sand matrix where O. beta foraged, thus increasing O. chrysoptera vulnerability to predation. In trials run with crab prey, C. sapidus failed to reduce their activity in the presence of O. beta. In addition, P. herbstii displaced C. sapidus from the seagrass refuge in mixed prey treatments, and so these conspicuous behaviors primarily occurred in the unstructured sand habitat where C. sapidus were more vulnerable to predation. We conclude that multiple prey effects, including those involving risk-enhancing, agonistic interactions between prey, can be important determinants of predator-prey outcomes. This may be especially true when refuge space is limited. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Toscano, Benjamin J.; Fodrie, F.

In the warm, and grassland and shrubland habitats where kit foxes occur, coyotes are more cover dependent than kit foxes, creating the possibility of habitat segregation. Effects of habitat variation on coyote and kit fox competition are unknown. We assessed exploitation and interference competition between coyotes and kit foxes in grassland and shrubland habitats to determine if such competition varies among habitats. With respect to exploitation competition, we evaluated habitat and spatial partitioning, diet, prey abundance, and survival for kit foxes and coyotes at the Lokern Natural Area in central California, USA, from January 2003 through June 2004. Kit foxes partitioned habitat, space, and diet with coyotes. Coyotes primarily used shrubland habitats whereas kit foxes selectively used burned grasslands. Kit foxes and coyotes had high dietary overlap with regards to items used, but proportional use of items differed between the 2 species. Kit foxes selected for Heermann's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys heermanni), which were closely tied to shrub habitats. With respect to interference competition, predation was the primary source of mortality for kit foxes, and survival of individual kit foxes was inversely related to proportion of shrub habitat within their home ranges. Our results suggest that a heterogeneous landscape may benefit kit foxes by providing habitat patches where predation risk may be lower.","Calif State Univ Stanislaus, Endangered Species Recovery Program, Fresno, CA 93727 USA; Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Nelson, JL (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Stanislaus, Endangered Species Recovery Program, 1900 N Gateway Blvd 101, Fresno, CA 93727 USA.",juls_nelson@yahoo.com,,,,,,42,56,57,1,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-541X,1937-2817,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Wing melanization in Calopteryx damselflies has important functions in sexual selection and interspecific interactions and in species recognition. The genus Calopteryx and other damselfly genera have also been put forward as examples of radiations driven by sexual selection. We show that avian predation strongly affects natural selection on wing morphology and male wing melanization in two congeneric and sympatric species of this genus (Calopteryx splendens and Calopteryx virgo). Predation risk was almost three times higher for C. virgo, which has an exaggerated degree of wing melanization, than it was for the less exaggerated, sympatric congener C. splendens. Selective predation on the exaggerated species C. virgo favored a reduction and redistribution of the wing melanin patch. There was evidence for nonlinear selection involving wing patch size, wing patch darkness, and wing length and width in C. splendens but weaker nonlinear selection on the same trait combinations in C. virgo. Selective predation could interfere with species divergence by sexual selection and may thus indirectly affect male interspecific interactions, reproductive isolation, and species coexistence in this genus.","Lund Univ, Sect Anim Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Svensson, EI (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Sect Anim Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",erik.svensson@zooekol.lu.se,"Svensson, Erik/E-8324-2010","Svensson, Erik/0000-0001-9006-016X",,,,54,90,94,1,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

However, site-specific habitat factors can have over-arching importance for habitat value, especially where interactions with competitors or predators may play an important role. Current revegetation projects in Australia which aim to restore slow-growing buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii) woodland, a threatened habitat important for bird conservation, usually include faster-growing eucalypts in plantings. This research aimed to identify whether eucalypt presence in buloke woodland facilitates invasion by the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), an aggressive competitor that is absent from pure buloke woodland. Birds were surveyed in buloke woodland remnants that contained eucalypts as a sub-dominant species at densities of 0-16 per ha. The probability of noisy miner presence in buloke woodland increased markedly where eucalypts were present at a density of approximately five per hectare. The presence of noisy miners resulted in a substantial difference in bird assemblage structure and composition. Small-bodied insectivorous birds which are experiencing population declines in southern Australia were recorded on average six times more often in transects without noisy miners (low-eucalypt density transects). Avian behaviour and habitat use was also altered, with birds flying more frequently in transects where noisy miners were present. A minor difference in habitat composition results in substantial degradation of the conservation value of non-eucalypt woodland in eastern Australia due to invasion by aggressive avian competitors. Revegetation. and restoration practices should take into account the potential for such subtle floristic differences to result in substantial variation in conservation outcomes.

We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) on community interactions between two sympatric North American anurans: Fowler's toad. Bufo fowleri, and the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. Recent studies have identified chytridiomycosis as an emerging infections disease, whose widespread occurence poses a significant risk for amphibian populations. We manipulated the presence of B. dendrobatidis in replicated experimental tanks and examined if exposure to this fungus during development could influence recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Bufo and Hyla. Tanks were followed throughout larval development, and we recorded survival. time to metamorphosis. and body mass at metamorphosis. We also tested the effects of competitive and pathogen-mediated stress on developmental stability by measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of surviving metamorphs. B. dendrobatidis had no significant effect on larval survival, but the pathogen reduced metamorphic body mass and increased larval-period length. B. dendrobatidis had different effects oil larval growth depending on the community sructure; in the presence of the pathogen, both Bufo and Hyla metamorphosed at smaller body masses when reared together compared to when reared separately. Bit also had strong negative effects oil Hyla development, but Only in the presence of B. dendrobatidis. FA of hind-limb length was significantly higher for metamorphs front pathogen tanks, but was not associated with density or competitive environment. Our results suggest that chytridiomycosis may impact Bufo and Hyla directly by reducing life-history performance and increasing developmental instability, and indirectly by inducing interspecific competitive effects in mixed-species environments.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Parris, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",mparris@memphis.edu,,,,,,79,117,120,2,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2004,85,12,,,,,3385,3395,,10.1890/04-0383,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,887HV,WOS:000226297500019,,,,,2021-09-21,

Aims: To elucidate the cause of the population decline by investigating variations with habitat and testing the hypothesis that an increase in nest predators, or competitors (especially for nest-holes) could be responsible. Methods: I analysed with respect to survey plot habitat over 30 years of Willow Tit abundance data from a national survey. I examined the relationships with the local abundance of key potential nest predators (woodpeckers and Jay Garrulus glandarius) and key potential competitors (other tit species and Nuthatch Sitta europaea). Results: Willow Tits have declined in farmland and woodland in Britain, but not in their preferred, wet habitats. There was no evidence for any negative effect of competition and the only potentially important negative correlation with the abundance of a predator (Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopus major) was limited to farmland, a relatively minor habitat. A negative relationship with Green Woodpecker Picus viridis probably reflects opposite habitat preferences. Conclusions: Although correlative studies of competition and predation cannot be definitive, the evidence of this study suggests that the major cause of the Willow Tit's decline in Britain is habitat degradation, especially in woodland. Possible mechanisms for this degradation are discussed.","British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, England","Siriwardena, GM (corresponding author), British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, England.",gavin.siriwardena@bto.org,,,,,,35,14,20,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3657,1944-6705,,BIRD STUDY,Bird Stud.,NOV,2004,51,,3,,,,193,202,,10.1080/00063650409461354,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,869AU,WOS:000224955500001,,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

High complexity habitats may reduce predation and competition, thereby allowing more individuals to occupy a given area. Using 16 spatially isolated reefs in the Bahamas, I tested whether increased habitat complexity reduced the negative effects of resident predators and competitors on recruitment and survival of a common damselfish. Two levels of habitat complexity were cross-factored with the presence or absence of two guilds of resident fishes: predators (sea basses and moray eels) and interference competitors (large territorial damselfishes). I monitored subsequent recruitment and recruit mortality for 60 days. Residents had strong negative effects on recruitment regardless of habitat complexity. In the presence of residents, recruits suffered high mortality immediately after settlement that was similar on low and high complexity reefs, although high complexity reduced mortality of recruits that survived this early postsettlement period. Comparisons between shelter hole diameters and the sizes of residents suggest that territorial damselfishes and small resident predators could access most shelter holes, whereas large resident predators were excluded from many shelter holes. This study demonstrates that whether habitat complexity reduces predation and competition may depend on several key factors, such as the availability of appropriate shelter, behavioral attributes of interactors, and developmental stage of prey/inferior competitors.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Almany, GR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",glenn.almany@jcu.edu.au,,,,,,60,185,192,1,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2004,106,2,,,,,275,284,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13193.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,834QC,WOS:000222424600007,,,,,2021-09-21,

We found no support for the N-square law, which predicted that large numbers of smaller species could dominate larger species when more abundant. Further analysis of the most abundant species revealed that it was less likely to visit the locust trap when larger, more dominant heterospecifics were present.

The field experiment followed a two-factorial design, with Glossosoma densities (natural vs reduced) and sculpin presence (present vs absent) as treatments. Diet analysis revealed that all four prey species were eaten under the natural condition and the sculpin preferred mayfly grazers to Glossosoma. Our experiment showed that although mayfly densities in the presence of either sculpin or Glossosoma were lower than in the no-sculpin plus reduced-Glossosoma treatment, no difference in mayfly densities was found between the following three treatments: sculpin plus natural-Glossosoma, no-sculpin plus natural-Glossosoma, and sculpin plus reduced-Glossosoma. These results indicated that fish predator produced no effects additive to the competitive operation on the mayfly density, and also that competitive operation of Glossosoma on the mayfly densities produced no additional effects to fish predators. In addition, although the competitive effect of the mayflies on Glossosoma could not be manipulated in isolation, the density of Glossosoma in the presence of sculpin was greater than that in the absence of sculpin in the natural-Glossosoma treatment. Thus, the densities of these competing grazers either stayed the same or increased in the presence of the fish predator relative to predator-free treatments. A theoretical model, developed to explain the experimental results here, predicted that the densities of the two competing prey under predation pressure could be simultaneously greater than those under predator absent conditions when the behaviorally-mediated effects of the predator were strongly operative. Although we were unable to distinguish experimentally the two different effects of predator on the prey competition, the behaviorally- and density-mediated effects, the reality of the behaviorally-mediated effects in the experiment was discussed.","Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600019, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; Chitose Board Educ, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan","Miyasaka, H (corresponding author), Res Inst Human & Nat, Kamigyo Ku, 335 Takashima Cho, Kyoto 6020878, Japan.",,,,,,,44,15,15,0,23,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2003,101,3,,,,,511,520,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12001.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,680PH,WOS:000182986200008,,,,,2021-09-21,

If fighting behavior is heritable and under selection, theory suggests that large-dominant and small-subordinate species should evolve aggressive and passive fighting behaviors, respectively. To test this prediction, I manipulated the size and competitive asymmetry of juveniles from sympatric populations of large-dominant coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and small-subordinate steelhead trout (O. mykiss) and asked whether differences in fighting behavior persisted independently of competitive ability I observed fighting behavior during dyadic contests in two habitats, mutually preferred pools and energetically demanding riffles, under each of three size treatments: natural size asymmetry, asymmetry removed, and reversed size asymmetry. The results supported the prediction. Competitive ability depended primarily on size; large individuals of both species dominated smaller heterospecifics, and neither species dominated when size matched. Fighting behavior depended primarily on species identity; coho salmon used a higher proportion of aggressive chases, whereas steelhead trout used a higher proportion of passive displays. Large individuals were more likely to chase, and small individuals were more likely to display. As evidence that asymmetric competition is associated with behavioral divergence, these results complement previous work on morphological divergence under asymmetric competition and provide a richer context for other features of the coho-steelhead system.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Ctr Appl Conservat Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Young, KA (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",kayoung@sfu.ca,,,,,,61,22,22,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

This amplifies a fundamental dilemma that plants are thought to face: allocate limited resources to grow fast enough to compete, or invest these resources in secondary metabolites to maintain defense. We studied costs associated with genetic and environmental variation in secondary metabolite production of Brassica rapa in the presence and absence of the generalist competitor Lolium perenne. We used experimental quantitative genetics (artificial selection) to manipulate genetic variation, and herbivore-induction treatments to produce environmental variation in myrosinase and glucosinolate concentrations and resistance. Glucosinolates, and their byproducts after break-down by myrosinase, are known to affect herbivory on plants in the Brassicaceae family. Defense costs were significant in the absence of competitors, but in contrast to theoretical predictions, costs of constitutive defense (measured as growth rates) were not detectable and the cost of induced defense remained the same in the competitive environment. To understand what factors made constitutive defense costs not detectable under competition we conducted several experiments to assess the effects of limited resources and allelopathy on costs and benefits of the defense chemicals. None of the experiments involving nutrient supply and weak competition supported the hypothesis that the lack of defense costs in competitive environments was due to limited resources. Instead, the breakdown products of the glucosinolate-myrosinase reaction appeared to function as allelopathic agents, which may benefit B. rapa plants in competition, thereby reducing net costs of chemical defense. We found that: (1) the effects of exogenous glucosinolates on Lolium root length depended on the presence of myrosinase. (2) In the absence of nutrients, Lolium root lengths were shorter when seeds germinated with B. rapa. (3) Genetic increases in glucosinolate concentration negatively affected Lolium seedling growth only when there were simultaneous genetic increases in myrosinase concentration.

We investigated lethal intraspecific and interspecific interference competition in Eretmocerus eremicus and Encarsia sophia, parasitoids of the whitefly pest, Bemisia tabaci. Our first experiments evaluated whether one or both species could suppress the progeny production of the other species through two mechanisms of lethal interference competition: (1) usurpation of hosts in cases of multiparasitism, and (2) host feeding on and killing parasitised hosts. We found that both species could suppress the progeny production of the other. E. eremicus' effect on E. sophia appeared to reflect multiparasitism. E. sophia's effect on E. eremicus appeared to reflect a combination of multiparasitism and host feeding on parasitised hosts. Second, we investigated the effects of lethal intraspecific interference on conspecific progeny production in both species. E. sophia interfered intraspecifically by host feeding on parasitised hosts. E. eremicus also apparently host fed on parasitised hosts, however the effect of host feeding on conspecific progeny production was slight. Third, host dissections and behavioral observations confirmed the mechanisms inferred from the progeny production experiments. Our results suggest a need to consider mechanisms of lethal interference competition in theoretical and empirical research on parasitoid competition.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Insect Biol, ESPM, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Collier, TR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Insect Biol, ESPM, 201 Wellmann Hall 3112, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Hunter, Martha/AAF-5288-2020; Hunter, Martha/B-7307-2012","Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X; Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X",,,,34,44,50,1,17,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2001,129,1,,,,,147,154,,10.1007/s004420100706,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,478CN,WOS:000171325500016,28547062,,,,2021-09-21,

Examination of predator seats and kills were combined with radiotracking of four tigers, three leopards, and visual observations of a pack of dhole. The three predators selectively killed different prey types in terms of species, size and age-sex classes, facilitating their coexistence through ecological separation. There was no temporal separation of predatory activities between tigers and leopards. Hunting activities of dholes were temporally separated from those of the two felids to some extent. Rate of movement per unit time was higher for leopards compared to tigers during day and night. In general, the activity patterns of predators appeared to be largely related to the activities of their principal prey, rather than to mutual avoidance. The three predator species used the same areas and hunted in similar habitats, although tigers attacked their prey in slightly denser cover than leopards. Both cats attacked their prey close to habitat features that attracted ungulates. There was no evidence for interspecific spatial exclusion among predators, resulting either from habitat specificity or social dominance behaviours. Our results suggest that ecological factors, such as adequate availability of appropriate-sized prey, dense cover and high tree densities may be the primary factors in structuring the predator communities of tropical forests. Behavioural factors such as differential habitat selection or inter-specific social dominance, which are of crucial importance in savanna habitats, might play a relatively minor role in shaping the predator communities of tropical forests.","Wildlife Conservat Soc, Int Programs, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Karanth, KU (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, India Program, 26-2 Aga Abbas Ali Rd,Apt 403, Bangalore 560042, Karnataka, India.",ukaranth@vsnl.com,,,,,,49,224,249,3,124,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0952-8369,,,J ZOOL,J.

However. the approach has rarely been used with data from real communities. Using plant competition experiments, we use community matrix theory to predict the stability and competitive structuring of a lawn community. Seven species from the lawn, including the six most abundant. were grown in boxes, in conditions very similar to those on the lawn. They were grown alone (monocultures), and in all possible pairs. The species formed a transitive hierarchy of competitive ability, with most pairs of species showing asymmetric competition. Relative competitive ability (competitive effect) was positively correlated with published estimates of the maximum relative growth rate (RGR(max)) for the same species. A seven-species community matrix predicted the mixture of species to be unstable. Simulations revealed two topological features of this community matrix. First, the matrix was closer to the stability/instability boundary than predicted from a range of null (random) models, suggesting that the lawn may be close to stability. Second, the tendencies of the lawn species to compete asymmetrically, and to be arranged in competitive hierarchies, were found to be positively associated with stability, and hence may be contributing factors to the near-stability seen in the matrix. The limitations of using competition experiments For constructing community matrices are discussed.","Univ Otago, Dept Bot, Dunedin, New Zealand","Roxburgh, SH (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol Sci, Ecosyst Dynam Grp, Inst Adv Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",roxburgh@rsbs.anu.edu.au,"Roxburgh, Stephen H/A-2935-2011",,,,,66,38,40,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2000,88,2,,,,,395,408,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880218.x,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,287QV,WOS:000085518000018,,,,,2021-09-21,

More than half were unreplicated and so inadequate to test either the existence or relative strength of interspecific competition. Most replicated experiments used one of two designs appropriate to address questions of interest, such as whether nonnative species affect Atlantic salmon via competition or whether interspecific competition from coevolved salmonids is greater than intraspecific competition. Replicated experiments spanned a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, and one well-designed field experiment yielded the strongest inference at useful scales. Nonnative salmonids being introduced worldwide into Atlantic salmon waters have the potential to invade, so experiments testing their effects are most urgently needed. Overall, juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) are suspected to have the greatest effect, partly due to their inherent size advantage. The potential for complex interactions or indirect effects to modify effects of nonnative species is completely unknown but may be important and needs investigation.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Fishery & Wildlife Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Fausch, KD (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fishery & Wildlife Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,"Fausch, Kurt D/A-8849-2010; Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,98,117,123,3,34,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Five hypotheses were evaluated to explain why Z. mall had more impact on M. occidentalis in the field than on T. pyri. Given equal opportunity, Z. mall adult females did not consume more M. occidentalis eggs than T. pyri eggs nor did adult females of either phytoseiid inflict greater mortality on Z. mall eggs or larvae through attack or consumption. There was no difference in the within-tree association of Z. mall adult females with eggs of either phytoseiid species nor were there differences in the way prey mites (all life stages) were spatially partitioned between adult female Z. mall as compared with adults and deutonymphs (combined) of either phytoseiid. The foraging area of adult female Z. mali and the oviposition locations of the two phytoseiids from both field and laboratory data were compared using spatial statistics. Metaseiulus occidentalis laid significantly more eggs in the primary foraging area of adult female Z. mall than T. pyri.

The components of competitive ability examined were N-15 uptake rate, N-15 allocation, whole pliant biomass, root:shoot ratio, and tissue N concentrations. It was hypothesized that N-15 uptake rate would be the component most correlated with relative abundance. However, N-15 uptake rate was negatively correlated with percent cover in the community. In contrast, whole plant biomass and root:shoot ratio were positively correlated with relative abundance. Tissue N concentrations and N-15 allocation were not important predictors of relative abundance. These results suggest that in a harsh environment, high resource uptake rates are not indicative of competitive ability, but may instead be a mechanism by which rare species are able to coexist with competitive dominants.","UNIV COLORADO, DEPT ENVIRONM POPULAT & ORGANISM BIOL, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA",,,,,,,,47,43,43,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1996,75,1,,,,,59,66,,10.2307/3546321,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UK723,WOS:A1996UK72300007,,,,,2021-09-21,

We focussed on the mechanisms by which an increase of a mutant with a higher growth rate and/or lower mortality leads to decreases in original phenotypes, with a particular emphasis on ''predator-mediated (apparent) competition''. The bacterial population was cultured together with the protozoan population over a long period of time. These were contrasted with single-species control cultures of E. coli (i.e., without predator) experiencing high density-independent mortality from continual dilution of the population, and also a population with strong density-dependent regulation arising from intraspecific competition. The long-term cultures of predator and prey revealed the following changes: predator density increased for some time after inoculation; correspondingly, the specific growth rate of prey increased, and mutants with the long-cell form (which experience low predation rate) appeared and increased in frequency in the population. Comparison of these results with results from control cultures, suggests that predator-mediated competition existed between mutants and the original types in the predator-prey system, i.e., increases in densities of mutants with higher growth rate and/or lower predation rate in the prey population enhanced the predator equilibrium density, which in turn exerted higher predation pressure on the original prey which then decreased in abundance.","TOHOKU UNIV,INST BIOL,DEPT SCI,AOBA KU,SENDAI,MIYAGI 980,JAPAN",,,,,,,,44,12,12,2,9,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1994,71,1,,,,,24,34,,10.2307/3546168,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PQ835,WOS:A1994PQ83500003,,,,,2021-09-21,

We added hatchlings of two sympatric anuran species (Hyla [= Pseudacris] crucifer and Bufo woodhousii) to artificial ponds on three different dates to manipulate the order and temporal separation of their arrival. Measurement of the growth and survival of each species in ponds where the second species arrived simultaneously (day 0), or after a delay of 7 or 14 d, indicated whether differences in the history of introductions affected interspecific competition. Other ponds contained H. crucifer alone, introduced on the same three dates, or B. woodhousii alone, introduced on the first or second date. These provided controls for seasonal differences in performance in the absence of competition from the other anuran species. Introductions of tadpoles at different times produced small differences in growth rates and larval periods when each anuran species occurred alone. In ponds containing both species, differences in the order and temporal separation of introductions had complex effects on the intensity of interspecific competition. When Bufo preceded Hyla, Hyla had prolonged larval periods and reduced mass and growth. When Hyla preceded Bufo, it was unaffected by Bufo. Hyla had no effects on Bufo, whether its introduction preceded or followed the introduction of Bufo. Asymmetric priority effects were not easily explained as a simple size-dependent competitive advantage of earlier arrivals. Early arrival increased the competitive impact of Bufo on Hyla, but failed to generate a competitive effect of Hyla on Bufo. Bufo tadpoles are more active than Hyla, and so may consume resources at higher rates that cannot be offset by a temporal advantage. Competition from Bufo was strongest when Hyla arrived 7 d later, suggesting that Hyla arriving 14 d after Bufo benefited from a longer period of reduced competition after Bufo metamorphosed from the ponds. The natural pattern, where Hyla breeds before or simultaneously with Bufo, permits Hyla to minimize competition from Bufo, while Bufo suffers no measurable cost from the size advantage obtained by competitively weaker Hyla tadpoles. Bufo may be prevented from breeding any earlier in the season by physiological constraints acting on eggs or breeding adults.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,BUR BIOL RES,NELSON LABS,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855","LAWLER, SP (corresponding author), RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855, USA.",,,,,,,34,124,126,0,30,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,174,182,,10.2307/1939512,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500018,,,,,2021-09-21,

Additionally, sea urchins have lower respiration and food consumption rates, and at high biomass levels appear to reduce algal resources to levels lower than herbivorous fishes. A simple biomass-based energetic model was developed to help explain these patterns and to determine the energetic properties of organisms which affect their resource competitive ability and ability to sustain themselves under predation. Simulations of a hypothetical herbivore indicate that herbivore steady-state biomass increases with decreasing consumption rates, but a parabolic relationship was found between herbivore biomass and the level to which the herbivore reduces its food resource (i.e. R *). Simulations of competition between hypothetical herbivores indicate that only the level to which a herbivore reduces its resource (R *) was important in determining the superior resource competitor, although biomass dynamics differed depending on feeding, gross production rates, and initial conditions of competitors. High herbivore consumption and gross production increase rates of biomass recruitment. But, unless an herbivore can also keep resources below the level competitors can tolerate, a high rate of gross production does not insure the competitor superior resource competitive ability in the absence of predators. Yet the model also predicts that organisms with high gross production and consumption rates are able to persist better under high levels of harvesting by predators. The model suggests that sea urchins reach high biomass due to low algal consumption rates and out-compete herbivorous fishes, when their predators are reduced (i.e. often attributable to overfishing), by reducing algal biomass to low levels. Sea urchins appear to tolerate low algal biomass due to their low consumption and respiration rates which allows them to persist at low levels of net algal productivity. But, low sea urchin gross production makes them less likely to persist under high levels of harvesting or predation. The model suggests that organisms may frequently need to make energetic trade-offs between traits which will give them superior resource competitive ability and tolerance to predation or disturbance.","UNIV FLORIDA, CTR WETLANDS, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA; UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN SCI, SYST ECOL PROGRAM, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA",,,"McClanahan, Tim/K-4998-2019","McClanahan, Timothy/0000-0001-5821-3584",,,,69,68,72,1,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Semiochemicals can aid predator foraging and alert prey organisms to the presence of predators. Previous work suggests that predator traits differentially influence prey behavior, however, empirical data on how prey organisms respond to chemical cues from predator species with different hunting strategies, and how foraging predators react to cues from potential competitors, is lacking. Furthermore, most research in this area has focused on aquatic and aboveground terrestrial systems, while interactions among belowground, soiling-dwelling organisms have received relatively little attention. Here, we assessed how chemical cues from three species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), each with a different foraging strategy, influenced herbivore (cucumber beetle) and natural enemy (EPN) foraging behavior. We predicted these cues could serve as chemical indicators of increased predation risk, prey availability, or competition. Our findings revealed that foraging cucumber beetle larvae avoided chemical cues from Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (active-foraging cruiser EPNs), but not Steinernema carpocapsae (ambusher EPNs) or Steinernema riobrave (intermediate-foraging EPNs). In contrast, foraging H. bacteriophora EPNs were attracted to cues produced by the two Steinernema species but not conspecific cues. Notably, the three EPN species produced distinct blends of olfactory cues, with only a few semi-conserved compounds across species. These results indicate that a belowground insect herbivore responds differently to chemical cues from different EPN species, with some EPN species avoiding prey detection. Moreover, the active-hunting EPNs were attracted to heterospecific cues, suggesting these cues indicate a greater probability of available prey, rather than strong interspecific competition.","[Grunseich, John M.; Aguirre, Natalie M.; Thompson, Morgan N.; Helms, Anjel M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ali, Jared G.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Helms, AM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",amhelms@tamu.edu,,,Texas A M University; United States Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NIFA-2017-67012-31498],Research was supported by funding from Texas A& M University and the United States Department of Agriculture (NIFA-2017-67012-31498).,,72,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

Stable isotope data were used to assess niche overlap and diets of these predators in Elk Lake (Minnesota, U.S.A). delta C-13 indicated primary production sources (e.g. pelagic v. littoral) and delta N-15 indicated trophic position; the bivariate distribution of these isotopes defined the species' isotopic niche. Niche overlap probabilities were calculated and stable isotope mixing models were used to quantify diet proportions. Muskellunge and northern pike niches overlapped little (<10%), while walleye overlapped muskellunge (15%-60%) and northern pike (33%-53%) more extensively. Muskellunge diets focused (50%) on cisco (Coregonus artedi Lesueur), walleye primarily assimilated non-cisco prey fish (80%), and northern pike diets were dominated by non-cisco prey fish (45%) and invertebrates (40%). The presence of a cisco population and the flexibility of northern pike to use invertebrate resources may decrease potential competition among these predators. However, cisco are threatened by climate change and eutrophication, and our results suggest that extirpation of cisco may cause major changes in potential competitive interactions among these top predators. Moreover, cisco were unique among prey species in their ability to exploit pelagic energy, such that loss of cisco will likely alter energy flow in lake food webs where they currently exist.","[Herwig, Brian R.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Fisheries Res, 2114 Bemidji Ave North, Bemidji, MN 56601 USA; [Zimmer, Kyle D.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Biol, St Paul, MN USA; [Staples, David F.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Fisheries Res, St Paul, MN USA","Herwig, BR (corresponding author), Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Fisheries Res, 2114 Bemidji Ave North, Bemidji, MN 56601 USA.",brian.herwig@state.mn.us,,,Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund; University of St. Thomas,Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund; University of St. Thomas,,71,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Hypothesis tests often focus on trophic structures involved in food acquisition, because variations in the morphology of foraging apparatus and diet composition may be directly related. Empirical evidence of such associations among sympatric guild members is, however, uncommon. The predatory larvae of caddisflies in the family Hydrobiosidae are ideal for studies of CWCD because the morphology of the prehensile foreleg, used to capture prey, varies markedly among genera. Further, hydrobiosids typically occur as species-rich guilds, often with 10-20 species in a single community. Although the larvae are known to be predatory, detailed information on the diet of coexisting species is scarce. This study tested whether larval diet varied among multiple, sympatric species of hydrobiosid caddisflies that differed in foreleg morphology. Larval specimens were collected in summer and primarily from one river in central Victoria, Australia. Gut contents of late instar larvae were examined to describe diet composition, and diet was compared among taxa using measures of diet breadth and overlap. Seven sympatric species from six genera that differed in foreleg morphology were collected and late instar larvae were exclusively carnivorous. Diet composition and breadth varied markedly among some species, and diet was associated with morphology of the prehensile foreleg. Specialist predator species consumed predominantly chironomids and had high diet overlap. Generalists consumed primarily chironomids and mayflies, but overlap varied depending upon the preferred mayfly family and representation of other prey items, such as blackflies and insect eggs. All predator species consumed some caseless caddisflies and intraguild predation was strong in at least one species. The marked differences in diet and foreleg morphology among hydrobiosid species are consistent with the notion that CWCD influences guild membership and may facilitate species coexistence within guilds that are typically species-rich. Although rarely considered for freshwater communities, CWCD may help explain species membership within other guilds. The magnitude of diet variations among genera within this family are more usually found across multiple families or orders, demonstrating that assumptions about the diet of even closely related taxa may be erroneous.","[Lancaster, Jill] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Lancaster, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",JillL@unimelb.edu.au,,,Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,Australian Research Council,,46,2,2,4,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The system we considered in this paper necessarily has a globally asymptotically stable unique equilibrium state. We find the necessary and sufficient condition to determine which equilibrium states becomes asymptotically stable. Then we consider the effect of the deletion of a native prey species and that of the invasion of an alien prey species on the stability of the system. We prove that the deletion of a prey species could not cause the secondary extinction of any other prey species but could make the predator go extinct. In contrast, if an alien prey species is successfully introduced into the system at the coexistent equilibrium state, the extinction of some native prey species could occur by the apparent competition effect. Moreover, such a successful introduction of an alien prey species causes the reduction of the population size of every surviving native prey species while it always increases the predator's equilibrium population size even when some native prey species go extinct. We show that the strength of the apparent competition effect would be significantly affected by the number and the composition of coexisting prey species.","[Seno, Hiromi; Schneider, Victor P.] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Dept Comp & Math Sci, Res Ctr Pure & Appl Math, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan; [Schneider, Victor P.] Univ Strasbourg, Dept Math & Comp Sci, 7 Rue Rene Descartes, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Kimura, Toshihiko] Hiroshima Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398526, Japan","Seno, H (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Dept Comp & Math Sci, Res Ctr Pure & Appl Math, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan.",seno@math.is.tohoku.ac.jp,,"Seno, Hiromi/0000-0002-0831-2055","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18K03407]","The authors greatly appreciate anonymous referees for their valuable comments on the first version of the manuscript, and Emmanuel J Dansu for his help about the manuscript revision.

However, the indirect impacts of rising temperatures on herbivores, mediated through interactions with their biotic environment, could dampen these effects. Using a series of reciprocal density experiments with gravid females and developing nymphs, we examined interspecific competition between two coexisting phloem feedersNilaparvata lugens(BPH) andSogatella furcifera(WBPH), on rice at 25 and 30 degrees C. WBPH performed better (i.e. adults survived longer, nymphs developed faster and grew larger) at 25 degrees C and BPH (i.e. nymphs developed faster) at 30 degrees C. However, contrary to predictions, WBPH had a greater effect in reducing oviposition and nymph performance in BPH at 30 degrees C. A decoupling of resource use by WBPH and its antagonistic effects on BPH at the higher temperature suggests that WBPH feeding induces host defences that reduce BPH fitness (i.e. interference competition). Meanwhile, BPH facilitated WBPH oviposition at 30 degrees C and facilitated WBPH nymph performance at 25 and 30 degrees C. Greater facilitation of feeding in WBPH nymphs by BPH at high densities suggests that mechanical damage and host responses to damage increased the fitness of the heterospecific nymphs. Although BPH also facilitated egg-laying by WBPH, intra- and interspecific crowding countered this facilitation at both temperatures. Simulated life tables for planthoppers at 25 and 30 degrees C depicted significantly lower offspring numbers on rice infested by WBPH alone and from mixed BPH-WBPH infestations than from infestations by BPH alone. Our results indicate how interference competition-mediated through host plant defences-can increase ecosystem resilience to the warmer temperatures predicted under global climate change.

Similarly, prey avoid chemical cues from predators at feeding sites, presumably because risk of death outweighs the benefit of food. This study addressed the lack of information regarding mammals' avoidance of direct cues from competitors and also examined how indirect cues, i.e., vegetative cover, affect foraging behavior. To test if chemical cues and vegetative cover alter the number of visits by prey species and time spent at feeding plots, we observed snowshoe hares (Lepus americans) in plots containing coyote (Canis latrans; predator) and moose (Alces alces; competitor) urine across a spectrum of vegetation densities. Snowshoe hares significantly reduced number of visits to plots that contained coyote or moose urine. In plots treated with coyote urine, number of visits decreased significantly as plots became more densely vegetated. Neither chemical cues nor vegetation density affected time spent in plots. These results suggest that competition between snowshoe hares and moose has selected for an avoidance response. This study also reinforces the idea that an increase in vegetation density could prove disadvantageous to prey, perhaps because some predators use dense vegetation to their advantage.","[Lankist, Zachary K.; Maher, Christine R.] Univ Southern Maine, Dept Biol Sci, Portland, ME 04103 USA","Lankist, ZK (corresponding author), Univ Southern Maine, Dept Biol Sci, Portland, ME 04103 USA.",zachlankist@gmail.com,,,University of Southern Maine Department of Biology Graduate Research Fund,"We thank J.

The overall sign and strength of interspecies interactions have important consequences for emergent community-level properties such as productivity and stability. It is not well understood how interspecies interactions change over evolutionary timescales. Here, we review the empirical evidence that evolution is an important driver of microbial community properties and dynamics on timescales that have traditionally been regarded as purely ecological. Next, we briefly discuss different modelling approaches to study evolution of communities, emphasizing the similarities and differences between evolutionary and ecological perspectives. We then propose a simple conceptual model for the evolution of interspecies interactions in communities. Specifically, we propose that to understand the evolution of interspecies interactions, it is important to distinguish between direct and indirect fitness effects of a mutation. We predict that in well-mixed environments, traits will be selected exclusively for their direct fitness effects, while in spatially structured environments, traits may also be selected for their indirect fitness effects. Selection of indirectly beneficial traits should result in an increase in interaction strength over time, while selection of directly beneficial traits should not have such a systematic effect. We tested our intuitions using a simple quantitative model and found support for our hypotheses. The next step will be to test these hypotheses experimentally and provide input for a more refined version of the model in turn, thus closing the scientific cycle of models and experiments.

Results We conducted a greenhouse experiment with three soil water levels (30-40%, 50-60%, and 70-80% of field capacity) and two cultivation treatments (monoculture pots, one seedling of either species and mixture pots, one seedling of each species) to investigate soil water content effects on the relationship between invasive Rhus typhina and native Cotinus coggygria. Rhus typhina had lower height but bigger crown area than C. coggygria in the monoculture treatment. Rhus typhina had higher height, bigger crown area and total biomass than C. coggygria in the mixture treatment. Drought decreased the growth parameters, total chlorophyll concentration, and leaf biomass, but did not change gas exchange and other biomass parameters in R. typhina. The growth parameters, leaf area index, biomass parameters, total chlorophyll concentration, and net photosynthetic rate of C. coggygria decreased under drought conditions. The log response ratio (lnRR), calculated as ln (total biomass of a target plant grown in monoculture/total biomass of a target plant grown in mixed culture), of R. typhina was lower than that of C. coggygria. The lnRR of R. typhina and C. coggygria decreased and increased with increase in soil water content, respectively. Conclusions Rhus typhina has greater capacity to relatively stable growth to the drought condition than C. coggygria and has strong competition advantages in the mixture with C. coggygria, especially in the drought condition.

Franco), interior spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss x Picea engelmannii Engelm.), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex Loud. var. latifolia Englem.)) in multi-aged stands in central British Columbia, Canada. Background and Objectives: Understanding competitive interactions among tree species in mixed-species stands is fundamental to supporting silvicultural decision-making in such stands. Using the periodic annual basal area increment for single trees as our dependent variable, we investigated whether neighboring trees competed with subject trees independently of species identity. We also examined the differences in single-tree basal area growth among the three conifer species over time under different levels of competition. Materials and Methods: We developed several spatially explicit, single-tree basal area growth models for interior Douglas-fir, interior spruce, and lodgepole pine using data from 16 plots in two blocks of a long-term study (five measurements over a 21-year period) on the response to pre-commercial thinning. We compared these equations to assess whether intraspecific or interspecific competition predominated. We also examined the differences in basal area growth among the three conifer species over time under different levels of competition. Results: We found asymmetrical relationships between the conifer trees and their neighbors for all species, indicating that the main driver limiting growth in these stands is aboveground competition for light. There was evidence of higher intraspecific competition for small (<10.0 cm DBH) interior Douglas-fir in one block. However, there was no general pattern among larger subject trees with respect to the identity of neighborhood competitive effects and the equivalence of neighbors. We observed a higher level of basal area growth over time for interior Douglas-fir than for lodgepole pine and interior spruce, irrespective of the competition intensity and, not surprisingly, the growth rate declined with increasing competition levels for the three species.

In sibling bird species, exploitative competition is reduced mainly by spatial segregation of competing species. Spatial segregation can be achieved in two basic ways: by using different habitats or microhabitats that each species is predominately exploiting, or by interspecific territoriality. To our knowledge, either habitat segregation or interspecific territoriality or both have been found in all dyads and groups of sympartic sibling bird species studied so far. In this study, we investigated the coexistence of three cryptic sibling species of the golden-spectacled warblers Phylloscopus burkii complex in Hunan Province, China: Ph. tephrocephalus, Ph. omeiensis and Ph. valentini. We analyzed their habitat preferences, and spatial interrelations between the species. In order to analyze either presence or absence of interspecific territoriality, we additionally performed con- and heterospecific playback experiments. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidences for either habitat segregation or interspecific territoriality in these three species.","[Opaev, Alexey; Kolesnikova, Yulia] Russian Acad Sci, Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow, Russia","Opaev, A (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow, Russia.",aleksei.opaev@gmail.com,"Опаев, Алексей/T-6811-2017; Kolesnikova, Yulia/M-7897-2017","Kolesnikova, Yulia/0000-0003-3665-771X",Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [17-04-00903-a],study was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project no. 17-04-00903-a).,,46,1,1,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

This study assessed the predator-prey relationship between two non-native crayfish species (Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus) and three native (Anodonta anatina, Potomida littoralis and Unio delphinus) and one non-native (Corbicula fluminea) freshwater bivalve species through experiments in laboratory and validation under natural conditions (Sabor River basin, Portugal). All native bivalve species were preyed both in laboratory and in the field: however, both crayfish species were unable to prey C. fluminea. Predation was dependent on crayfish and bivalve species but was not affected neither by crayfish nor bivalve sizes. In the laboratory, the most preyed species by both crayfishes was A. anatina. On average, this species was preyed at least 12% more than other species, when crayfishes had a choice. Similar results were found in the field. We also found signs of competition between both crayfishes, being P. clarkii more dominant and aggressive as this species, on average, manipulated the bivalves 63.6% more times and 24:33 min longer than P. leniusculus, and initiated 55.8% more agnostic bouts. Our results support the idea that P. clarkii and P. leniusculus can affect native freshwater bivalves, but clear interspecific differences were detected. Both crayfishes may have direct and indirect impacts on bivalve populations by increasing mortality or by reducing their fitness. In addition, since both crayfishes do not prey C. fluminea, they offer this IAS another advantage over native bivalves. Given the widespread distribution of both P. clarkii and P. leniusculus and the threatened status of many freshwater bivalves, the dynamics and impacts of this relationship should be taken in account in the implementation of management measures devoted to the conservation of native freshwater bivalves.

These factors do no act independently on tree growth, but by means of interactions, resulting in mediated interactive effects. For example, the stress gradient hypothesis postulates alleviated interspecific competition under limiting spatial (site) or temporal (climate) resources. According to this, models predicting annual growth and yield for a given forest should consider these issues in their formulation. In this study, we present a modelling approach based on using data from permanent plots and dendrochronological analysis in order to describe annual tree growth in pure, even-aged stands of Pinus pines L. in the Spanish Northern Plateau, a highly limiting environment due to its Mediterranean continental climate. Our method is based on identifying the different sources of variability by means of a multilevel linear mixed model, and thereby identifying the potential covariates explaining observed variability at the different spatiotemporal scales. Our results indicate that site related factors such as site index or dominant height exert a greater influence on annual secondary growth than size-symmetric competition. In addition, we found that the controlling influence of water stress is greater than that of temperatures on tree growth. Furthermore, our results allow evidence to be identified for the stress gradient hypothesis in temporal intraspecific interactions, since trees exposed to a higher degree of competition tend to grow more than expected in dry periods. In contrast, the effect of competition on growth, on average, tends to be aggravated at very poor sites. Finally, our modelling approach allows us to conduct growth and yield simulations under different climate scenarios at different spatial scales, providing results which point to significant decreases in timber and cone production under the more severe scenarios, which can be alleviated through more intensive silviculture,","[Calama, Rafael; Conde, Mar; Madrigal, Guillermo; Pardos, Marta] INIA CIFOR, Forest Res Ctr, Ctra A Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain; [de-Dios-Garcia, Javier] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc Km 2, Solsona, Spain; [Vazquez-Pique, Javier] Univ Huelva, Dept Agroforestry Sci, Ctra Palos La Rabida S-N, Palos De La Frontera 21819, Spain; [Javier Gordo, Francisco] Junta Castilla & Leon, Forest Serv, C Duque Victoria 8, Valladolid 47001, Spain; [Calama, Rafael; Pardos, Marta] Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst UVa INIA, IuFOR, Valladolid, Spain","Calama, R (corresponding author), INIA CIFOR, Forest Res Ctr, Ctra A Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.",rcalama@inia.es,"PARDOS, MARTA/A-4797-2015; Calama, Rafael/G-6747-2012; Vazquez-Pique, Javier/K-8881-2014","PARDOS, MARTA/0000-0002-5567-5406; Calama, Rafael/0000-0002-2598-9594; Vazquez-Pique, Javier/0000-0002-7133-4142",INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA); ITACYL;  [RTA-2013-00011];  [PCIN-2014-138 INFORMED];  [AGL-2017-83828-C2.1],"This work has been carried out under the financial and functional framework of the National Projects RTA-2013-00011.C2.1, PCIN-2014-138 INFORMED, AGL-2017-83828-C2.1 and the PROPINEA agreement between INIA, ITACYL and Deputation of Valladolid.

These equations have been often criticized as being too simple to model real systems. This study has two main goals: First, to test the LGLVE as a quantitative tool for describing/explaining/predicting the equilibrium species abundances. That is, how accurately the LGLVE predict the yields of S interacting species? Second, to show analyze which quantitative predictions are possible with an incomplete knowledge of the LGLVE parameters. With this aim I compiled from the literature 33 experiments, most of them for plants, which measured species yields in monoculture, biculture and in mixtures of S > 2 species. I found that, by obtaining the LGLVE parameters from the yields in monoculture and biculture experiments, the LGLVE can accurately predict the majority of the equilibrium species yields in the mixtures of S > 2 species for most of the experiments. However, in many natural communities, e.g. tropical forests or plankton, S can be of the order of hundreds and estimating all the model parameters from empirical data is unfeasible. But, by estimating the mean interaction coefficient from the yields of an incomplete set of monoculture and biculture experiments, the LGLVE still can make accurate predictions. Firstly, it is possible to derive simple formulas which are able to predict the relative yield total and mean relative yield. Secondly, when we are interested in the fate or performance of a particular species, we can use a more refined approximation to predict the yield of this focal species with accuracy comparable to the one obtained when using the full set of LGLVE.","[Fort, Hugo] Univ Republica, Inst Phys, Fac Sci, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Fort, H (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Inst Phys, Fac Sci, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay.",hugo@fisica.edu.uy,,"Fort, Hugo/0000-0001-7899-7507",ANII-Uruguay (SNI); ANII-Uruguay [ERANET-LAC RI2016-1005422],I thank V.

We conducted an experiment to examine the extent to which the nonconsumptive and overall effect of predatory water bugs on snail and tadpole traits (performance and morphology) depended on whether tadpoles and snails cooccurred. Tadpoles and snails differed in their relative susceptibility to intraspecific and interspecific competition, and predators affected both prey species via consumptive and nonconsumptive mechanisms. Furthermore, the overall effect of predators often depended on whether another prey species was present. The reasoning for why the overall effect of predators depended on whether prey species cooccurred, however, differed for each of the response variables. Predators affected snail body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the change in the overall effect of predators on snail body growth was attributable to how snails responded to competition in the absence of predators, rather than a change in how snails responded to the threat of predation. Predators did not affect tadpole body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater vulnerability of competitively superior prey (snails) to predators increased the strength of consumptive mechanisms (and hence the overall effect) through which predators affected tadpole growth. Predators affected tadpole morphology via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater propensity for predators to kill competitively superior prey (snails) enhanced the ability of tadpoles to alter their morphology in response to the threat of predation by creating an environment where tadpoles had a higher per capita supply of food available to invest in the development of morphological defenses. Our work indicates that the mechanisms through which predators affect prey depends on the other members of the community.","[Ruehl, Clifton B.; Vance-Chalcraft, Heather; Chalcraft, David R.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC USA","Ruehl, CB (corresponding author), Columbus State Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC USA.",ruehl_clifton@columbusstate.edu,,,Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0716558],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/ Award Number: 0716558",,64,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Eastern United States has a long history of human impact, which resulted in an altered carnivore community. Specifically, Ohio presents an interesting case for evaluating the relative roles of interspecific relations and habitat characteristics for shaping the carnivore community, as its carnivore community has a unique dynamics and composition: invasive coyote and red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and native bobcat (Lynx rufus), currently recovering and expanding its range, gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) declining at a fast pace, and the generalist raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginian opossum (Diclelphis virginiana). We used 50 camera traps to collect presence/absence data in southeastern Ohio, USA. We hypothesized potential interactions between the six carnivores, and used land cover variables, as well as occupancy probabilities of interacting species, to parameterize to single-species occupancy models. We found that landscape composition at three different scales (500 and 1000 m buffer around camera locations, and 3 x 3 km grid cell) had little effect on species occurrence. We identified strong negative interspecific relations between carnivores, with bobcat occurrence being influenced by presence of coyotes, red fox occurrence by gray foxes, and raccoon occurrence by Virginia possums. While these findings cannot discriminate between habitat partitioning (spatial or temporal) and competition (direct or interference), they lend support to complex dynamics between invasive coyotes and red foxes and recovering (bobcat) and declining (gray fox) native carnivore species. In particular, the negative relation between the apex predator in our system, C. latrans, and L. rufus, raise further questions on whether direct competition from coyotes has the potential to slow bobcat population recovery. In the context of regulated trapping (ongoing for gray fox and potential season for bobcat), a better understanding of the carnivore intraguild relations can inform management and conservation actions targeted at minimizing the impact of competition on at-risk native species from non-native species.","[Rich, Mackenzie; Thompson, Cassandra; Prange, Suzanne; Popescu, Viorel D.] Ohio Univ, Biol Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Popescu, Viorel D.] Ohio Univ, Sustainabil Studies Theme, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Popescu, Viorel D.] Univ Bucharest, Ctr Environm Res CCMESI, Bucharest, Romania","Popescu, VD (corresponding author), Ohio Univ, Biol Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA.; Popescu, VD (corresponding author), Ohio Univ, Sustainabil Studies Theme, Athens, OH 45701 USA.; Popescu, VD (corresponding author), Univ Bucharest, Ctr Environm Res CCMESI, Bucharest, Romania.",popescu@ohio.edu,"Popescu, Viorel/AAP-4699-2021",,"Biological Sciences Department at Ohio University, Athens, Ohio USA; Honors Tutorial College, Ohio University","The fieldwork was supported by the Biological Sciences Department at Ohio University, Athens, Ohio USA.

We sought to determine which species is the most serious interference competitor of the endangered Pacific pocket mouse, Perognathus longimembris pacificus, and more generally, whether interspecific aggression in rodents is predicted by body size, residency status or phylogenetic relatedness. We carried out simulated territory intrusion experiments between P. longimembris and four sympatric species of rodents (Chaetodipus fallax, Dipodomys simulans, Peromyscus maniculatus, Reithrodontomys megalotis) in a field enclosure in southern California sage scrub habitat. We found that body size asymmetries strongly predicted dominance, regardless of phylogenetic relatedness or the residency status of the individuals. The largest species, D. simulans, was the most dominant while the smallest species, R. megalotis, was the least dominant to P. longimembris. Furthermore, P. longimembris actively avoided encounters with all species, except R. megalotis. One management recommendation that follows from these results is that P. longimembris should not be reintroduced to areas with high densities of D. simulans until further research is carried out to assess the fitness consequences of the interactions. Our finding that the species least similar in body size is the most serious interference competitor of P. longimembris highlights an important distinction between interference and exploitative competition in rodent communities.

Despite the importance of activity timing, our ability to understand the forces that constrain activity timing has been limited because this aspect of animal behavior is shaped by several factors (e.g., interspecific competitors, predators, physical conditions), and it is difficult to examine activity timing in a setting where only a single factor is operating. Using an island system that makes it possible to focus on the effect of predation risk in the absence of interspecific competition, we examine how the onset of activity of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) varies between habitats with unique predation risks (i.e., minimal-shrub cover versus abundant-shrub cover sites). Using capture time to assess the timing of mouse activity, we found that mice in habitats with minimal shrub cover were captured 1.7hr earlier than mice in habitats with abundant shrub cover. This difference in timing between habitats was likely a direct response to differences in predation risk between the two habitats: There were no differences in thermal conditions between the two habitats, and the difference in activity timing disappeared during a night when overcast skies reduced island-wide predation risk. Our results demonstrate that predation risk, independent of interspecific competition, can generate significant changes in animal activity timing. Our work suggests that habitat structure that provides safety (i.e., refuge habitats) plays a direct role in the timing of prey activity and that habitat modification that alters refuge availability (e.g., shrub dominance) may alter the timing of animal activity.","[Connolly, Brian M.; Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI USA; [Connolly, Brian M.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA","Connolly, BM (corresponding author), Dept Biol, Ypsilanti, MI USA.",bconnol3@emich.edu,"Connolly, Brian/H-9896-2019",,National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2014-02074]; Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1439550]; UW-Madison Vilas Fellowship; UW-Integrative Biology Department; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1439550] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 2014-02074; Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 1439550; UW-Madison Vilas Fellowship; UW-Integrative Biology Department",,51,8,8,3,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,2018,124,2,,,,,105,112,,10.1111/eth.12708,,,8,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FS7LD,WOS:000419978200004,,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

The hemipteran species Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) and Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae) are natural enemies of several pests in agroecosystems and coexist in tomato crops in Mediterranean countries. By using the multiplicative risk model (MRM) and the substitutive model, the multiple predator effects (MPEs) on prey suppression were calculated when two individuals of the predators foraged at the same densities on South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), eggs. RESULTS: Egg consumption increased with increasing egg density and the two predators exhibited a type III functional response. Predation rates were strongly affected by prey density. Using the MRM, we found risk reduction at intraspecific treatments at high prey density. Applying the substitutive model, we detect risk enhancement at interspecific treatments at high egg density. CONCLUSIONS: At low prey densities, most of the interactions were independent, whereas at high densities most interactions were not independent and resulted in prey risk reduction, indicating antagonism between the individuals involved. We also showed that N. tenuis is a more competitive predator species for T. absoluta eggs than M. pygmaeus; however, combination of the two predator species will lead to better pest suppression at high T. absoluta population densities.

The net interaction between two organisms simply the sum of these counteracting elements. Disentangling the positive and negative components of species interactions is a critical step in advancing our understanding of how the interaction.. between organisms shift along physical and. biotic gradients. We performed a manipulative field experiment to quantify the positive and negative components of the interactions between a perennial forb, Aster tenuifolius, and three dominant, matrix-forming grasses and rushes in a New England salt marsh. Specifically, we asked whether positive and negative interaction components: (1) are unique or redundant. across three matrix-forming species (two grasses; Distichhs spicata and Spartina patens, and one rush; Juncus gerardi), and (2) change across Aster life stages (seedling, juvenile, and adult). For adult Aster the strength of the facilitative component of the matrix-forb interaction was stronger than the competitive component for two of the three matrix species, leading to net positive interactions. There was no statistically significant variation among matrix species in their net or component effects. We found little difference in the effects of J. gerardi on Aster at later life-history stages; interaction component strengths did not differ between juveniles and adults. However, mortality of seedlings in neighbor removal plots was 100%, indicating a particularly strong and critical facilitative effect of matrix species on this forb during the earliest life stages. Overall, our results indicate that matrix forming grasses and rushes have important, yet largely redundant, positive net effects on Aster performance across its life cycle. Studies that untangle various components of interactions and their contingencies are critical to both expanding our basic understanding of community organization, and predicting how natural communities and their component parts will respond to environmental change.","[Bruno, John F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Rand, Tatyana A.] USDA ARS, Northern Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT USA; [Emery, Nancy C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bertness, Mark D.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Bruno, JF (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",jbruno@unc.edu,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource ManagementNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Science Foundation grantNational Science Foundation (NSF),"This research was funded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management graduate research fellowships to John F.

In particular, the combined effects of predator diversity and resource preference on prey removal are not known. To understand the effect of interspecies interactions, combinations ofmicro-predators-i. e., protists (generalists), predatory bacteria (semi-specialists), and phages (specialists)-and bacterial prey were tracked over a 72-h period in miniature membrane bioreactors. While specialist predators alone drove their preferred prey to extinction, the inclusion of a generalist resulted in uniform losses among prey species. Most importantly, presence of a generalist predator enabled coexistence of all predators and prey. As the generalist predator also negatively affected the other predators, we suggest that resource partitioning between predators and the constant availability of resources for bacterial growth due to protist predation stabilizes the system and keeps its diversity high. The appearance of resistant prey strains and subsequent evolution of specialist predators unable to infect the ancestral prey implies that multitrophic communities are able to persist and stabilize themselves. Interestingly, the appearance of BALOs and phages unable to infect their prey was only observed for the BALO or phage in the absence of additional predators or prey species indicating that competition between predators might influence coevolutionary dynamics.","[Johnke, Julia; Harms, Hauke; Chatzinotas, Antonis] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Microbiol, Leipzig, Germany; [Baron, Maayan; de Leeuw, Marina; Kushmaro, Ariel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Avram & Stella Goldstein Goren Dept Biotechnol En, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Jurkevitch, Edouard] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, Jerusalem, Israel; [Harms, Hauke; Chatzinotas, Antonis] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Johnke, Julia] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Dept Evolutionary Ecol & Genet, Kiel, Germany","Chatzinotas, A (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Microbiol, Leipzig, Germany.; Chatzinotas, A (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany.",antonis.chatzinotas@ufz.de,"Harms, Hauke/I-4406-2012; Baron, Maayan/AAB-2363-2020; Chatzinotas, Antonis/D-6232-2013; Kushmaro, Ariel/AAJ-8565-2021","Harms, Hauke/0000-0002-7316-7341; Baron, Maayan/0000-0003-2874-4426; Chatzinotas, Antonis/0000-0002-0387-9802; Kushmaro, Ariel/0000-0002-1970-9656; de Leeuw, Marina/0000-0003-1858-8685",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [CH 731/2-1],This work was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) grant CH 731/2-1.,,80,6,6,3,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Closely related species may experience greater interspecific competition for resources due to similar morphologies and ecological requirements. Although the mechanisms by which lions (Panthera leo) and leopards (Panthera pardus) partition diet and habitat have been investigated, the degree to which they avoid each other temporally with possible compromises for foraging success remains less clear. In a wildlife conservancy in Zimbabwe, we used camera-trap data to investigate the factors influencing the diel activity of lions and leopards. We modeled diel activity using circular statistics and calculated coefficients of overlap using kernel density functions and non-negative trigonometric sums models. Both leopards and lions were predominately nocturnal, with highly overlapping diel activity. The diel activity of leopards also coincided with that of some prey species, especially common duikers (Sylvicapra grimmia). Therefore, we suggest that leopards may prioritize hunting success and prey acquisition over diel avoidance of dominant competitors like lions.","[Mugerwa, Badru; du Preez, Byron; Tallents, Lucy A.; Loveridge, Andrew J.; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Oxford OX13 5QL, England; [Mugerwa, Badru] Mbarara Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Trop Forest Conservat, POB 44, Kabale, Uganda; [Mugerwa, Badru] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Mugerwa, B (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Oxford OX13 5QL, England.; Mugerwa, B (corresponding author), Mbarara Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Trop Forest Conservat, POB 44, Kabale, Uganda.; Mugerwa, B (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",bmugerwa@gmail.com,,,Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) of the University of Oxford; Beit Trust; Darwin Initiative for Biodiversity [17-031],We thank the BVC for allowing us to conduct this research.

Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the competitive ability of black bean cultivars (BRS Campeiro, IPR Uirapuru, SCS204 Predileto and BRS Supremo) in the presence of a biotype of hairy beggarticks. The experimental design is a completely randomized block with four replications. Treatments were arranged in a replacement series, consisting of a proportion of the crop and the hairy beggarticks: 100: 0; 75: 25; 50: 50: 24: 75, and 0: 100, which corresponds to 40: 0, 30: 10, 20: 20, 10: 30, and 0: 40 plant pots(1). We accomplished competitive analysis through diagrams applied to the replacement series, as well as using relative competitive indices. The leaf area and shoot dry mass were evaluated at 40 days after emergence of the species. There was competition between bean cultivars and hairy beggarticks for the same environmental resources, causing negative interference in the growth of the species, independent of the proportion of plants. Bean cultivars had a lower relative loss by reducing the morphological variables of the hairy beggarticks, thereby demonstrating superiority in its competitive ability in relation to the weed. Interspecific competition is less damaging than intraspecific competition for both species.","[Galon, Leandro; Trevisol, Ricardo; Forte, Cesar Tiago; Reichert Junior, Francisco Wilson] Univ Fed Fronteira Sul, Dept Agron, Campus Erechim, Erechim, RS, Brazil; [Tironi, Siumar Pedro; Radunz, Andre Luiz] Univ Fed Fronteira Sul, Dept Agron, Campus Chapeco, Chapeco, SC, Brazil","Galon, L (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fronteira Sul, Dept Agron, Campus Erechim, Erechim, RS, Brazil.",leandro.galon@uffs.edu.br; rii_trevisol@hotmail.com; cesartiagoforte@hotmail.com; siumar.tironi@gmail.com; chicowrj@gmail.com; andre.radunz@uffs.edu.br,"Galon, Leandro LG/I-5511-2018; Galon, Leandro/M-4099-2016; Reichert Junior, Francisco Wilson/N-7872-2016","Galon, Leandro LG/0000-0002-1819-462X; Galon, Leandro/0000-0002-1819-462X; Reichert Junior, Francisco Wilson/0000-0002-4501-898X","CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPERGSFundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS) [482144/2012-2/CNPq, 12/2265-3/FAPERGS]","To CNPq and FAPERGS, for the financial support for the research (processes No. 482144/2012-2/CNPq and 12/2265-3/FAPERGS) and for scholarships.",,33,2,2,0,17,UNIV FED RURAL SEMI-ARIDO-UFERSA,MOSSORO,"PRO-REITORIA PESQUISA POS-GRADUACAO, BR 110 - KM 47 S-N, MOSSORO, 59625-900, BRAZIL",0100-316X,1983-2125,,REV CAATINGA,Rev.

The use of clay model animals has provided us with insights into how differences in prey morphology, size, and colour influence the rate at which they are attacked by predators. This allows us insights into the ecological, behavioural and evolutionary selective pressures of different predators on small vertebrate prey, including analysis of what characteristics predators target and how predators approach their prey (e.g. which part of the body is attacked). Further available interpretations include how regional and habitat variation influences predation events on models.

Predator diversity alterations have been observed in most ecosystems as a result of the loss and/or addition of species. This has implications for predator-prey dynamics as non-trophic interactions among predators, so-called multiple predator effects (MPE), are known to influence predation success. In addition, there is often a density-dependent relationship between prey availability and prey consumption (functional response). While MPE investigations are common in the literature, functional responses have rarely been incorporated into this field of predation ecology. 2. Here, we outline an experimental procedure that incorporates functional responses into multiple predator effect studies. Using three fish species with different functional traits as model predators (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, southern mouthbrooder Pseudocrenilabrus philander and banded tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii), we assess intra-and interspecific predator interaction outcomes on predator-prey dynamics. This was done by contrasting observed functional responses of heterospecific and conspecific combinations of predators with expected responses based on those of individual predators. 3. Multipredator combinations produced variable results. Bluegill were the only species in which observed conspecific multipredator functional responses matched those of expected based on individual performance (prey risk neutral effects). In contrast, prey risk reduction was observed for both mouthbrooder and tilapia conspecific multipredator trials. Heterospecific combinations revealed strong prey risk reduction effects for mouthbrooder-tilapia and bluegill-tilapia trials, while mouthbrooder-bluegill multipredator functional responses combined additively. These results are discussed within the context of behavioural traits of the species and the development of a trait-based predictive framework. 4. Using a functional response approach allowed for the assessment of multiple predator effects across a range of prey densities. We propose that the incorporation of within-guild predator combinations into classic functional response investigations will enhance predictive capacity development in competition and predation ecology.","[Wasserman, Ryan J.; Ellender, Bruce R.; Weyl, Olaf L.

We carried out a mesocosm experiment manipulating the identity and richness of predators and habitat heterogeneity to test their influence on resource use effectiveness, competition among predators, and trophic cascades in a model estuarine system with 3 trophic levels (microalgae, mysids, and the predators blue crab Callinectes sapidus, sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa, and grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio). We hypothesized that increasing predator species richness would increase mysid suppression because of complementarity among predators, that complementarity would be better expressed in more heterogeneous habitats, and that higher mysid suppression would increase algae biomass through cascading effects. Assemblages with multiple predators were more effective at suppressing prey than the average single predator, but not in comparison to the most effective predator (i.e. no transgressive overyielding). Predator diversity effects increased with habitat heterogeneity, possibly because it allowed interspecific complementarity among predators to be expressed. Moreover, habitat heterogeneity dampened intraspecific predation and/or negative behavioral interactions between predators. A trophic cascade was not observed because of the low mysid grazing impact on microalgae, probably related to the omnivorous feeding of mysids. Our findings indicate that the loss of both biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity should alter the energy flux in marine food webs; therefore, both must be considered for the proper management of natural ecosystems.","[Miyashita, Leonardo K.; Richardson, J.

Although these factors vary simultaneously in most systems, their interactive effects are poorly understood. Using artificial pond mesocosms and multiple prey types, we manipulated plant density (SHC: low, high) and inter-patch distance (FHC: short, long) in a full factorial design to test for potential interactive effects of these factors on competition and predation by a dragonfly larva (Anax junius) and fish predator (Lepomis cyanallus). When inter-patch distances (FHC) were short, A. junius consumed more amphipods (36% +/- 4.6%) compared with long treatments (19% +/- 4.8%). We detected no significant effects of plant density (SHC) on prey consumption by A. junius. There were significant interactive effects of FHC and SHC on Lepomis cyanellus consumption of amphipods and damselflies. The most counterintuitive of these effects was that sunfish consumed more larval damselflies at high plant density (64% +/- 6.0%) than at low plant density (38% +/- 8.6%) but only in short connection treatments. This interactive effect of SHC and FHC on damselfly predation by L. cyanellus was likely because damselflies exhibited riskier behavior at higher SHC. Prey consumption with both predators present was additive, but no significant effect of either SHC or FHC on interspecific predation was detected, suggesting compensatory foraging responses. Structural habitat complexity and FHC interactively influence predator foraging behavior in complex, non-intuitive ways that are highly dependent on the predator/prey combination in question. Structural habitat complexity and FHC are currently being influenced by anthropogenic factors in multiple ways (e.g., habitat loss, global climate change), and being able to predict the responses of biotic communities to these changes should be an important consideration in restoration and conservation efforts.","[Pitcher, Kristopher A.; Soluk, Daniel A.] Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA","Pitcher, KA (corresponding author), Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",kristopher.pitcher@usd.edu,,,University of South Dakota Foundation: Raymond D.

The loss of a carnivore guild's dominant species can therefore provide considerable insights. We evaluated spotted hyaena density and demography from Zambia's Liuwa Plain National Park, a recovering ecosystem where the hyaena's main competitor, the African lion, was severely reduced to 3-5 animals. Using data from 233 individuals in five clans and mark-resight robust design models we estimated population size, density, age and sex-specific annual survival rates for the hyaena population from 2010 to 2013 and tested for the effect of human settlements, prey density, competition with lions and hyaena clan size on mean hyaena survival. We estimated a minimum density of 0.13 hyaenas/km(2) and maximum density of 0.52 hyaenas/km(2). Density fluctuated with seasonal migrations of the main prey species, the blue wildebeest. Mean annual survival across all age classes was 0.93 (95%CI: 0.79-0.99). With high survival rates across all sex and age classes, we found no detectable effects of ecological or anthropogenic factors on survival. These results suggest that the combination of abundant prey, weak human-carnivore conflict, and weak competition from lions provide very favourable conditions for hyaena survival. Additional investigations of hyaena demography concurrent with lion population recovery efforts can provide considerable insights into the dynamics of carnivore competition and predation in African savannahs and the human and ecological factors affecting them.

The spatial arrangement of nutrients and neighbours in soil influences plant growth and reproduction. Plants often respond to such stimuli through plasticity in root proliferation (root mass per soil volume), or the breadth of their root system. 2. Here, we asked how plants adjust nutrient foraging strategies when grown alone or with neighbours. We asked (i) Does root proliferation into nutrient-rich patches when plants are grown alone predict root proliferation when plants are grown with neighbours? (ii) What factors (nutrients or neighbours) best predict the probability of root placement at different soil locations? (iii) How does the spatial distribution of nutrients alter the degree to which neighbours suppress plant growth? 3. To answer these questions, we grew four grassland species either as individual plants or in competition, in patchy or patch-free soil, in a factorial design. We used genomic DNA to identify the spatial distribution of roots of each species when plants were grown in mixtures. 4. The root foraging behaviour of individuals grown alone did not consistently predict behaviour in mixture. Specifically, (i) the behaviour of individually grown plants predicted behaviour of competing plants inside patches, but not in background soil. We observed over-proliferation of roots in background soil relative to what was expected from plants grown alone. (ii) Neighbours were consistently the most important variable for predicting the placement of roots in soil and caused either an increase in root system breadth, or no change relative to alone. (iii) If a species experienced growth suppression when grown in competition, individuals experienced this more severely in patchy soil compared to patch-free soil. 5. Synthesis. Game theoretic models have predicted that under interspecific competition, over-proliferation of roots in the presence of neighbours might occur for some species but not others. Our data are consistent with these predictions but more work is needed. Nutrient foraging studies have primarily focused on plants grown alone or assumed that plants do not respond separately to neighbours and nutrients. Our data call these practices into question and contribute to a growing understanding that plants integrate information about both nutrients and neighbours when placing roots in soil.","[McNickle, Gordon G.; Cahill, James F., Jr.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Deyholos, Michael K.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Okanagan Campus,1177 Res Rd, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [McNickle, Gordon G.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada","McNickle, GG (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",gmcnickle@wlu.ca,"McNickle, Gordon G/F-3699-2017; McNickle, Gord/AAB-4871-2019; Cahill, James/B-6147-2015","McNickle, Gordon G/0000-0002-7188-7265; McNickle, Gord/0000-0002-7188-7265; Cahill, James/0000-0002-4110-1516",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Alberta Ingenuity; Alberta Conservation Association for a Biodiversity Grant,"G.G.M. thanks the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) for a Post Graduate Doctoral Scholarship and a Banting Fellowship, Alberta Ingenuity for a Graduate Student Scholarship and the Alberta Conservation Association for a Biodiversity Grant.

Theories based on the alternative of top-down regulation have fared better. Paine's discovery of keystone predation demonstrated that the regulation of diversity via top-down forcing could be simple, strong, and direct, yet ecologists have persistently failed to perceive generality in Paine's result. Removing top predators destabilizes many systems and drives transitions to radically distinct alternative states. These transitions typically involve community reorganization and loss of diversity, implying that top-down forcing is crucial to diversity maintenance. Contrary to the expectations of bottom-up theories, many terrestrial herbivores and mesopredators are capable of sustained order-of-magnitude population increases following release from predation, negating the assumption that populations of primary consumers are resource limited and at or near carrying capacity. Predation sensu lato (to include Janzen-Connell mortality agents) has been shown to promote diversity in a wide range of ecosystems, including rocky intertidal shelves, coral reefs, the nearshore ocean, streams, lakes, temperate and tropical forests, and arctic tundra. The compelling variety of these ecosystems suggests that top-down forcing plays a universal role in regulating diversity. This conclusion is further supported by studies showing that the reduction or absence of predation leads to diversity loss and, in the more dramatic cases, to catastrophic regime change. Here, I expand on the thesis that diversity is maintained by the interaction between predation and competition, such that strong top-down forcing reduces competition, allowing coexistence.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Ctr Trop Conservat, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Terborgh, JW (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Ctr Trop Conservat, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",manu@duke.edu,,,MacArthur Foundation; Andrew Mellon Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"I owe the ideas imparted here to 50 y of experience in the primary forests of South America and to my many students, collaborators, and assistants.

This study aimed to evaluate the competitive ability of wheat in coexistence with biotypes of R. raphanistrum that are resistant (R biotype) and susceptible (S biotypes) to ALS herbicides and to determine whether there are differences in the competitiveness of these biotypes. The experiments were conducted in a greenhouse using a completely randomized design with four replications. The treatments were placed in pots and arranged in replacement series for three experiments (1 - wheat with the R biotype; 2 - wheat with the S biotype; and 3 - the R biotype with the S biotype) at the following ratios: 100: 0, 75: 25, 50: 50, 25: 75, and 0: 100. The competitiveness was analyzed through diagrams applied to replacement experiments and competitiveness indices, including the evaluation of the shoot dry matter of the plants (experiments 1, 2, and 3) and the leaf area (experiment 3). The R and S biotypes significantly decreased the shoot dry matter of the wheat cultivar and demonstrated superior competitive ability compared with the culture. The interspecific competition was more important for the wheat and for the S biotype. The competitiveness of the R biotype compared to the S biotype was similar, with synergism in the leaf area production, which indicates the predominant intraspecific competition exhibited by the R biotype.","[da Costa, Leandro Oliveira; Rizzardi, Mauro Antonio] Univ Passo Fundo UPF, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil","da Costa, LO (corresponding author), Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Cx P 611, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil.",leandro.jari@gmail.com,,,,,,33,5,5,1,14,UNIV FEDERAL LAVRAS-UFLA,LAVRAS,"CAIXA POSTAL 3037, LAVRAS, MG 37200-000, BRAZIL",1413-7054,1981-1829,,CIENC AGROTEC,Cienc.

Because obligate mutualists are more reliant than facultative mutualists on the resources that their partners provide, they are expected to compete more strongly for those resources. Here, I examined interference competition in two goby fishes: Nes longus (an obligate mutualist) and Ctenogobius saepepallens (a facultative mutualist). Both gobies associate with the shrimp, Alpheus floridanus. Shrimp provide gobies with refuge from predators (a burrow in the sand), and gobies provide shrimp with a warning signal when predators are near. Using an aquarium experiment, I examined the behavior of a pair of gobies with access to a single shrimp burrow. I used four different goby pairings: large N. longus and small N. longus, large N. longus and small C. saepepallens, large C. saepepallens and small N. longus, and large C. saepepallens and small C. saepepallens. When paired with large N. longus individuals, small gobies of both species were less likely to occupy the single burrow than when paired with large C. saepepallens individuals. In addition, large N. longus individuals were less likely to co-occupy the single burrow with smaller gobies than were large C. saepepallens individuals. These results seem to indicate that large N. longus individuals exclude smaller gobies from burrows, while large C. saepepallens individuals do not. This study adds evidence to the supposition that obligate mutualists in general compete more strongly for mutualist partners than do facultative mutualists.","[Lyons, Patrick J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Lyons, PJ (corresponding author), CIEE Res Stn Bonaire, Kaya Gobernador N Debrot 26, Kralendijk, Bonaire, Netherlands.",patrick.lyons5@gmail.com,,,W.

The evolutionary plausibility of ISDM has been established previously by the Hairy-Downy game (Prum & Samuelson). Psychophysical models of avian visual acuity support the plausibility of visual ISDM at distances approximate to>2-3m for non-raptorial birds, and approximate to>20m for raptors. Fifty phylogenetically independent examples of avian ISDM involving 60 model and 93 mimic species, subspecies, and morphs from 30 families are proposed and reviewed. Patterns of size differences, phylogeny, and coevolutionary radiation generally support the predictions of ISDM. Mimics average 56-58% of the body mass of the proposed model species. Mimics may achieve a large potential deceptive social advantage with <20% reduction in linear body size, which is well within the range of plausible, visual size confusion. Several, multispecies mimicry complexes are proposed (e.g. kiskadee-type flycatchers) which may coevolve through hierarchical variation in the deceptive benefits, similar to Mullerian mimicry. ISDM in birds should be tested further with phylogenetic, ecological, and experimental investigations of convergent similarity in appearance, ecological competition, and aggressive social interactions between sympatric species. Evolutionary explanations of mimicry must consider the possibility that mimics evolve to deceive model species themselves.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London","[Prum, Richard Owen] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Prum, Richard Owen] Yale Univ, Peabody Nat Hist Museum, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Prum, RO (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",richard.prum@yale.edu,,"Prum, Richard/0000-0002-4741-7132","William Robertson Coe Fund of Yale University; Ikerbasque Science Fellowship; Donostia International Physics Center, Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain","The manuscript was improved by discussions with or comments from Suzanne Alonzo, Craig Bergstrom, Jake Berv, Marvin Chun, Christopher Clark, April Dinwiddie, Mario Cohn-Haft, Teresa Feo, Daniel Field, James Ingold, Miguel Marini, Jacob Musser, Jura Pintar, Larry Samuelson, Stephen Stearns, Jason Weckstein, Julie Zhu, and Kristof Zyskowski.

However, the pollinator shift model fails to account for the many examples of color variation within clades that share the same pollination system. An alternate explanation is the competition model, which suggests that color divergence evolves in response to interspecific competition for pollinators, as a means to decrease interspecific pollinator movements. This model predicts color overdispersion within communities relative to null assemblages. Here, we combine morphometric analyses, field surveys, and models of pollinator vision with a species-level phylogeny to test the competition model in the primarily hummingbird-pollinated clade Iochrominae (Solanaceae). Results show that flower color as perceived by pollinators is significantly overdispersed within sites. This pattern is not simply due to phylogenetic history: phylogenetic community structure does not deviate from random expectations, and flower color lacks phylogenetic signal.

We tested this relationship in two territorial Caribbean damselfish (dusky, Stegastes adustus, and longfin, S. diencaeous) with intruders being the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifascatus) and the slippery dick wrasse (Halichoeres bivittatus). Based on food habits, the slippery dick and the bluehead wrasse should have the same degree of competitive overlap to the two damselfish species. We also predicted that the larger slippery dick wrasse intruder would receive more aggression than the smaller bluehead wrasse intruder. Neither damselfish species distinguished between the two wrasses suggesting that they were ecologically equivalent. We also tested size differences within both species of wrasse and found that size had no influence on the aggression in the dusky damselfish. The longfin also did not show a size preference for the bluehead but did prefer to attack the larger slippery dick wrasse. In spite of the similarities between the dusky and the longfin damselfish and the similar food habits of the bluehead and the slippery dick wrasse, our results suggest that using intensity of interspecific territorial defense alone may not be an adequate measure of competitive overlap.","[Black, A.; Weimann, S.; Richter, M.; Itzkowitz, M.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Imhoff, V.; Gumm, J.] Stephan F Austin Univ, Dept Biol, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA; [Leese, J.] DeSales Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Center Valley, PA 18034 USA","Itzkowitz, M (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",mi00@lehigh.edu,,"Black, Andrew/0000-0002-6745-9460",,,,20,1,1,0,28,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0289-0771,1439-5444,,J ETHOL,J.

Nevertheless, most studies on interspecific interactions in ungulates involve case reports without testing any specific hypotheses. We tested two mutually exclusive hypotheses: that mortality rate in interspecific interactions of captive African ungulates would be higher if combatants are taxonomically (i) more closely related species or (ii) more distantly related species. In addition, we examined if mortality in these interactions was affected by the age, sex and weight difference of combatants. In total, we analyzed 101 interspecific aggressive interactions among 25 species of African ungulates kept in mixed species exhibits in Dvur Kralove Zoo over a period of 20 years. In 18 cases, one of the combatants died. We found that probability of death was higher when the target of aggression was a young animal. Since the majority of fatal attacks towards young were performed by equids, the only known explanation is that the strong defence instinct of equids may cause them to mistake young antelope for small predators. When analysing only fights between adults we found that more aggressive interactions were recorded between taxonomically more distantly related species, however the interactions between taxonomically more closely related species led to the death of combatants more frequently. A possible reason for these highly escalated conflicts among closely related species may be higher competition over resources as the resource needs of closely related species are likely to be similar. In conclusion, we recommend that closely related species should not be put together in mixed species exhibits to prevent serious injuries or fatal attacks. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mode of their interactions is not known to use these predators together in the field. Hence, we investigated on the possible interactions i.e., cannibalism, intraguild predation (IGP) and competition between the predators in the presence and absence of prey Planococcus citri. In the presence of prey, no cannibalism and predation were observed in both S. epius and C. montrouzieri larvae. A pair of S. epius larvae consumed significantly more number of mealybugs than one S. epius/C. montrouzieri larva or a pair of C. montrouzieri larvae. The predation of S. epius larva by C. montrouzieri larva was significantly more than the predation of C. montrouzieri by S. epius. Conspecific and interspecific egg predation was absent both in S. epius and C. montrouzieri. Cannibalism in C. montrouzieri was more than that in S. epius. The study indicated that C. montrouzieri larvae can be used as an additive along with voracious S. epius larvae under abundant prey population. IGP was asymmetric between the two predators in the absence of prey. Both S. epius and C. montrouzieri larvae can maintain a stable coexistence when prey is abundantly available, however, in the complete absence of prey C. montrouzieri may dominate the guild. This study provides an insight into the possible complex inter- and intraspecific predatory phenomena in the field to use these two predators in the biological control of mealybugs.","[Dinesh, A.

However, considerably more effort has been devoted into understanding the consequences of temporal rather than spatial variations in fruit crop for plant fitness. In order to simultaneously evaluate both components, we quantify fruit production and pre-dispersal damage by three arthropod species (mites, chalcid wasps and moths) in the Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) during 3 years in a spatially explicit context. Our aims were to assess (1) the interaction between fruit production and pre-dispersal fruit damage by arthropods, (2) the potential interference or competition between arthropods, and (3) the form of the phenotypic selection exerted by arthropods on fruit traits considering the spatial context. Arthropods damaged a substantial fraction of fruits produced by Spanish juniper with levels of damage showing sharp inter-annual variations. Fruit damage by mites was negatively related to yearly fruit crop and positively correlated at individual trees fruiting in consecutive years. Increased interspecific interference was an additional consequence of reduced fruit availability during small crop years. During a masting year, fruit damage by less mobile species such as mites was negatively affected by tree crop size, and no spatial structure was observed for mite damage. The incidence of chalcid wasps was low, so the spatial pattern of seed predation was unclear, and no preferences for fruit or seed traits were detected. Conversely, moths selected larger fruits and their incidence on trees was spatially aggregated up to 20 m, with predation levels being negatively affected by fruit abundance at the patch level, suggesting a positive density-dependent effect of neighbors on fruit output. These results highlight the importance of including the spatial component to understand complex species interactions at local scales.","[Mezquida, Eduardo T.] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Miguel Olano, Jose] Univ Valladolid, EU Ingn Agr, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Soria 42004, Spain","Mezquida, ET (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Darwin 2, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",eduardo.mezquida@uam.es,"Olano, Jose Miguel/K-7273-2014; Mendoza, Jose Miguel Olano/A-9250-2012","Olano, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-4526-5462; Mendoza, Jose Miguel Olano/0000-0002-4526-5462","Junta de Castilla y LeonJunta de Castilla y Leon [VA069A07, VA006A10-2]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of SpainSpanish Government [CGL2009-13190-C03-03]",We thank Cabrejas del Pinar Council for permission to work in its land and E.

Forest ecosystems, for example, are subject to a change in species composition due to the invasion of exotic species. Specifying the attributes that cause the strong competitiveness of several exotic species may improve the ability to understand and effectively manage plant invasions in the future. In this study the following hypotheses were tested: (1) biomass production of below- and aboveground plant components of the exotic tree species is higher than that of the natives, resulting in a higher competitiveness of the exotics; (2) the exclusion of root competition has a positive effect on the biomass production of the inferior native species; and (3) mixtures of native and exotic species yield a higher biomass production than the respective monocultures. A pot experiment, containing about 2000 tree seedlings, was established. We investigated the biomass productivity and growth reactions of two native (Quercus robur L., Carpinus betulus L.) and two exotic tree species (Prunus serotina Ehrh., Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in different intra- and interspecific, competitive situations with and without the influence of root competition. The biomass production of both exotic species was significantly higher and led to a strong competitive advantage, resulting in a biomass decrease of the less competitive native species. The high belowground biomass of both exotic species had a negative effect on the biomass production. The competitive pressure of exotic tree seedlings on the native ones was largely driven by root competition. Furthermore, mixtures of native and exotic tree species had a higher productivity than their growth in monocultures would have predicted. Competition was lower for exotic species in mixtures with the less productive native species compared to the competition in monocultures or in mixture with the other highly productive exotic species. Accordingly, both highly competitive exotic species produced less biomass in mixture with each other compared to monocultures. Despite the significantly higher biomass of P. serotina in all mixtures and in monoculture, R. pseudoacacia seemed to be the dominating species. Due to its strong root competition, R. pseudoacacia significantly reduced the biomass production of P. serotina.","[Kawaletz, Heike; Annighoefer, Peter; Ammer, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Moelder, Inga] Energieagentur Reg Gottingen eV, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Zerbe, Stefan; Terwei, Andre] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy","Kawaletz, H (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",hkawale@gwdg.de,"Ammer, Christian/ABG-7360-2020; Ammer, Christian/ABG-4629-2020; Annighofer, Peter/AAS-8418-2021","Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135; Annighofer, Peter/0000-0001-8126-5307",Marianne and Dr. Fritz-Walter Fischer Foundation within the Stifterverband fur die Deutsche Wissenschaft; DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) VIGONI programDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We would like to thank the Marianne and Dr. Fritz-Walter Fischer Foundation within the Stifterverband fur die Deutsche Wissenschaft for funding our research and the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) VIGONI program for supporting project-based exchange.

Species may exhibit aggressive responses that are similar, or symmetrical, to each other, or one species may respond more aggressively than the other, exhibiting asymmetrical aggression. We examined aggressive symmetry in two territorial Caribbean damselfish species, the longfin damselfish (Stegastes diencaeous) and the dusky damselfish (S. adustus) because they exhibit qualities that make such relationships hard to predict. These two species show considerable habitat overlap, are closely related and are nearly identical in gross morphology, suggesting they would show the same intensity of aggressiveness to heterospecifics and conspecifics. However, longfins reach a larger adult size, which may cause these two species to instead aggress asymmetrically toward one another. We also tested residents' responses toward bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a common egg predator, to see if highly similar species respond similarly to a presumably equal threat not likely to be misidentified as a conspecific. We presented residents with either a single intruder or two simultaneous intruders to determine if context affected aggressive behavior. When presented with a single intruder, both resident species attacked conspecifics and congenerics with somewhat similar aggression, suggesting either a broad competitive overlap or misidentification. When residents were forced to divide their time between two simultaneous damselfish intruders, they clearly aggressed more intensely toward conspecifics. Additionally, longfins were more aggressive to bluehead wrasse than were dusky damselfish in single and paired presentations. We propose that the higher aggression toward wrasse by longfins is related to longfins having territories on which their eggs are naturally more exposed compared to a typical dusky territory in which eggs are more hidden.","[Little, K.; Itzkowitz, M.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Draud, M.] Long Isl Univ, Dept Biol, Brookville, NY 11548 USA","Little, K (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",kpl208@lehigh.edu,,,,,,48,6,6,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

As a result, changes in the relative abundance of several marine species have been documented over the last decades. This suggests that warming may drive novel interspecific interactions to occur (i.e. invasive vs. native species) or may intensify the strength of pre-existing ones (i.e. warm vs. cold adapted). For mobile species, habitat relocation is a viable solution to track tolerable conditions and reduce competitive costs, resulting in winner' species dominating the best quality habitat at the expense of loser' species. Here, we focus on the importance of warming in exacerbating interspecific interactions between two sympatric fishes. We assessed the relocation response of the cool-water fish Coris julis (a potential loser' species in warming scenarios) at increasing relative dominance of the warm-water fish Thalassoma pavo (a winner' species). These wrasses are widespread in the Mediterranean nearshore waters. C.julis tolerates cooler waters and is found throughout the basin. T.pavo is common along southern coasts, although the species range is expanding northwards as the Mediterranean warms. We surveyed habitat patterns along a thermo-latitudinal gradient in the Western Mediterranean Sea and manipulated seawater temperature under two scenarios (present day vs. projected) in outdoor arenas. Our results show that the cool-water species relocates to a less-preferred seagrass habitat and undergoes lower behavioural performance in warmer environments, provided the relative dominance of its warm-water antagonist is high. The results suggest that expected warming will act synergistically with increased relative dominance of a warm-water species to cause a cool-water fish to relocate in a less-preferred habitat within the same thermal environment. Our study highlights the complexity of climate change effects and has broad implications for predictive models of responses to warming. To achieve more accurate predictions, further consideration is needed of the pervasive importance of species interactions. We believe these fundamental issues to be addressed to understand the biotic consequences of climate change.","[Milazzo, Marco] Univ Palermo, Dept Earth & Marine Sci DiSTeM, Palermo, Italy; [Mirto, Simone] IAMC CNR, Messina, Italy; [Domenici, Paolo] IAMC CNR, Torregrande, OR, Italy; [Gristina, Michele] IAMC CNR, Mazara Del Vallo, TP, Italy","Milazzo, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Earth & Marine Sci DiSTeM, Palermo, Italy.",marmilazzo@iol.it,"Domenici, Paolo/F-6958-2010; Milazzo, Marco/F-8596-2012; Mirto, Simone/B-7474-2016","Milazzo, Marco/0000-0002-2202-0542; Mirto, Simone/0000-0003-4707-7307; Gristina, Michele/0000-0003-3639-7655; Domenici, Paolo/0000-0003-3182-2579",EU Cost Action 'Conservation Physiology of Marine Fishes' [FA1004]; EU 'Mediterranean Sea Acidification under a changing climate' project (MedSeA) [265103],"We thank E.

We consider how ACD can be distinguished empirically from ecological and reproductive character displacement and the additional challenges posed by developmental plasticity.

Den site selection is often based on fitness related criteria like escape from predators, food availability and shelter from extreme weather conditions. African wild dogs are cooperative breeders that use a den to give birth to their offspring. They often co-exist with lions and spotted hyenas, both of which are known to kill African wild dog pups. Little is known about den site selection by African wild dogs. In this study, we compared vegetation characteristics and distribution of roads and waterholes around den sites and random sites, in areas with high and low lion and spotted hyena densities. In both areas, African wild dogs selected den sites in closed woodland with little visibility, which is likely to reduce detection by predators, increase the likelihood of escape when detected, and might provide shelter from extreme weather conditions. In the high predator density area, African wild dogs seemed to spatially avoid predators by selecting den sites in this type of habitat relatively further away from waterholes and roads. African wild dogs have high energetic costs of gestation. Therefore, even when predation risk is relatively low, they are likely to try to maximise their fitness by choosing a den site in habitat that will provide optimal protection for their offspring, leaving little additional options to respond to a higher predation pressure.

In this study, the intra- and interspecific competition between two congeneric sandy beach amphipods Bathyporeia pilosa and B. sarsi was examined by means of a two-way factorial mesocosm experiment. The amount of natural food resources as well as population densities of B. pilosa and B. sarsi were manipulated in order to investigate whether firstly, the species compete for food, and secondly, whether crowding effects, such as damaging encounter competition, are present within and between both Bathyporeia species. The absence of food negatively influenced survival and recruitment and enhanced aggressive behavior in the B. sarsi population, while there was no influence of the absence of food in the B. pilosa population. In the field, B. pilosa is occurring high in the intertidal where food supply is low, while B. sarsi is occurring in the mid-intertidal where food supply is higher. Hence, B. pilosa is more adapted to low food conditions than B. sarsi. Although an increased intraspecific density stimulated encounter competition within the B. sarsi population, no evidence of interspecific competition was found in this study. This first report on encounter competition for the deposit-feeding amphipod Bathyporeia sarsi suggests that zonation patterns of the two amphipods may be the result of the combined influence of species-specific physiological restrictions and biotic interactions within the B. sarsi population, indicating that on dissipative beaches, biotic interactions may be more common than generally considered.

Null models that systematically exclude and include habitat effects can give information on the contribution of these factors to community assembly. In the boreal forest, saproxylic beetles are known to be attracted to recently burned forests where they breed in dead and dying trees. We examined whether species co-occurrences of saproxylic beetles that develop in, and emerge from, boles of recently burned trees show non-random patterns. We also estimated the extent to which both the post-fire habitat attributes and interspecific interactions among beetles contribute to such patterns. We sampled tree boles encompassing key attributes (tree species, tree size/dbh and burn severity) that are thought to characterize species-habitat associations of saproxylic beetles, a proposition that we tested using indicator species analysis. Two null models with no habitat constraints (unconstrained) indicated that a total of 29.4% of the species pairs tested had significant co-occurrence patterns. Habitat-constrained null models indicated that most of the detected species aggregations (72%) and segregations (59%) can be explained by shared and distinct species-habitat relationships, respectively. The assembly pattern was also driven by interspecific interactions, of which some were modulated by habitat; for example, predator and prey species tended to co-occur in large-sized trees (a proxy of available bark/wood food resource primarily for the prey). In addition, some species segregation suggesting antagonistic, competitive, or prey-predator interactions were evident after accounting for the species' affinities for the same tree species. Overall, our results suggest that an intimate link between habitat and interspecific interactions can have important roles for community assembly of saproxylic assemblages even following disturbance by fire. We also show that a systematic application of null models can offer insight into the mechanisms behind the assembly of ecological communities.","[Azeria, Ermias T.; Hebert, Christian] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Stn St Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada; [Ibarzabal, Jacques] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondamentales, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada","Azeria, ET (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Stn St Foy, POB 10380,1055 PEPS, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",Ermias.Azeria@NRCan-RNCan.gc.ca,,,Fonds de recherche sur la nature et les technologies; Ministere des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune; iFor consortium (Universite Laval); Environment CanadaCGIAR; Canadian Forest ServiceNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; la Fondation de l'Universite du Quebec a Chicoutimi,"We thank Chantiers Chibougamau and Barrette Chapais Ltee for logistical support, and F.

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that perch play a controlling role in small, oligotrophic, acidic, and poorly vegetated boreal lakes, affecting both invertebrate numbers and community structure. In addition, we predicted that perch impact lake usage by goldeneye. In the observational part of our study, we first explored the association between perch, invertebrates and goldeneye (pairs and broods per shore km) in 18 boreal, poorly vegetated lakes. Perch densities were associated negatively with invertebrate abundance and lake usage by goldeneye broods. In the experimental part in three fish-free lakes, we found that upon successful perch introductions, the number and biomass of invertebrates, the proportion of large dytiscids, and lake usage by goldeneye broods significantly decreased. We conclude that perch apparently plays a key role as a predator of invertebrates in boreal lakes with few aquatic macrophytes. It is evident that perch can strongly affect their prey populations and communities, and this predation may have an indirect effect on species, e.g. goldeneye, that consume the same prey.","[Nummi, Petri; Vaananen, Veli-Matti; Taskinen, Keijo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Rask, Martti] Evo Game & Fisheries Res, Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Evo 16970, Finland; [Nyberg, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Nummi, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petri.nummi@helsinki.fi,"Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021","Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633",,,,62,19,21,0,28,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1015-1621,,,AQUAT SCI,Aquat.

Although these species exhibited microhabitat separation, with P. criniticornis dominating (100%) in sandy substrates and P. brevidactylus (80%) on rocky shores, they overlapped in the rocky shore/sand interface (P. criniticornis, 53%; P. brevidactylus, 43%). Pagurus criniticornis occupied shells of Cerithium atratum in higher frequencies (84%) than P. brevidactylus (37%), which was hypothesized to be a consequence of competitive interactions combined with their ability to acquire and/or retain this resource. The species P. criniticornis was attracted in larger numbers to simulated gastropod predation events than was P. brevidactylus, which, on the few occasions that it moved before P. criniticornis, tended to be attracted more rapidly. Interspecific shell exchanges between these species were few, suggesting the absence of dominance relationships. The shell-use pattern in this species pair is thus defined by exploitation competition, which is presumed to be intensified in areas of microsympatry. These results differ from other studies, which found that interference competition through interspecific exchanges shapes shell use, indicating that shell partitioning in hermit crabs is dependent on the behaviour of the species involved in the contests.","[Sant'Anna, Bruno Sampaio; Buozi, Sabrina Fernandes; Turra, Alexander] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanog, Dept Oceanog Biol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Da Cruz Dominciano, Laura Cristina] UNIP Univ Paulista, Sao Jose Do Rio Preto, Brazil","Sant'Anna, BS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amazonas UFAM, Inst Ciencias Exatas & Tecnol, BR-69103128 Itacoatiara, Brazil.",brunusant@hotmail.com,"Sant'Anna, Bruno Sampaio/I-2534-2018; Turra, Alexander/G-1352-2012","Sant'Anna, Bruno Sampaio/0000-0001-9689-4894; Turra, Alexander/0000-0003-2225-8371",,,,42,12,13,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",1745-1000,1745-1019,,MAR BIOL RES,Mar.

The zone is about 10-km wide, with phenotypic hybrids comprising 6.5% of the adult population. We compared species with respect to diet, territory size, intra- and interspecific group encounters, and territory quality. The two gibbon species exploited the same types of resources within their territories despite variation in the relative abundance of food-plant species between territories. The gibbons were interspecifically territorial, and males of both species displayed aggressive behaviors at both intraspecific and interspecific territorial boundaries. There was no marked difference in the amount of overlap between territories of conspecific and heterospecific pairs of groups. Although the habitat was not homogeneous, territory quality did not vary significantly between species. The species have not diverged in habitat preference or in diet. Neither species dominated in interspecific encounters, and both were reproducing well in the contact zone. We analyzed the potential consequences of several types of interspecific interactions on individual dispersal options and on the structure of the contact zone. Interference competition through interspecific territoriality affects the dispersal of individuals into the range of the other species. In general, territorial competition coupled with limited hybridization leads to predictions of a narrow contact zone or parapatry between species; thus, behavioral and ecological interactions between species need to be considered as potential factors in explaining range borders of primate species.","[Suwanvecho, Udomlux; Brockelman, Warren Y.] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy, Biotec Cent Res Unit, Ecol Lab, Klongluang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Suwanvecho, Udomlux; Brockelman, Warren Y.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Brockelman, Warren Y.] Mahidol Univ, Inst Mol Biosci, Conservat Genet & Ecol Grp, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand","Suwanvecho, U (corresponding author), Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy, Biotec Cent Res Unit, Ecol Lab, Klongluang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand.",udomlux.suw@biotec.or.th,,,Royal Golden Jubilee Ph.D. ProgramThailand Research Fund (TRF) [PHD/0018/2542],"The Thailand Research Fund provided financial support for the study through Royal Golden Jubilee Ph.D. Program Grant PHD/0018/2542.

In addition, such research would guide the selection of appropriate conservation and agricultural utilization of plants in semiarid environments that have not been very well characterized. Biomass production and allocation, relative competitive ability and water use efficiency of one C-4 herbaceous grass (Bothriochloa ischaemum) and one C-3 leguminous subshrub (Lespedeza davurica), both important species from the semiarid Loess Plateau of China, were investigated in a pot-cultivation experiment. The experiment was conducted using a replacement series design in which B. ischaemum and L davurica were grown with twelve plants per pot, in seven combinations of the two species (12:0, 10:2, 8:4, 6:6, 4:8, 2:10, and 0:12). Three levels of water treatments included sufficient water supply (HW), moderate water stress (MW) and severe water stress (LW). These treatments were applied after seedling establishment and remained until the end of the experiment. Biomass production and its partitioning, and transpiration water use efficiency (TWUE) were determined at the end of the experiment. Interspecific competitive indices (competitive ratio (CR), aggressiveness (A) and relative yield total (RYT)) were calculated from the dry weight for shoots, roots and total biomass. Water stress decreased biomass production of both species in monoculture and mixture. The growth of L davurica was restrained in their mixtures for each water treatment. L davurica had significantly (P<0.05) greater root:shoot allocation than B. ischaemum for each water treatment and proportion within the replacement series. Aggressiveness (A) values for B. ischaemum with respect to L davurica were negative only at the proportions of B. ischaemum to L davurica being 8:4 and 10:2 in LW treatment. B. ischaemum had a significantly (P<0.05) higher CR value under each water treatment, and water stress considerably reduced its relative CR while increased that of L davurica. RYT values of the two species indicated some degree of resource complimentarity under both water sufficient and deficit conditions. The results suggest that it is advantageous for growing the two species together to maximize biomass production, and the suggested ratio was 10:2 of B. ischaemum to L davurica because of significantly higher (P<0.05) RYT and TWUE under low water availability condition.

The use of nestboxes by roosting birds during the non-breeding season: a review of the costs and benefits. Ardea 99: 167-176. The advantages and disadvantages of breeding in nestboxes are well known, whilst the merits of roosting in nestboxes during the non-breeding season remain poorly understood. Here I review the advantages and disadvantages of using nestboxes as roosting sites during the non-breeding season. The main advantage of nestboxes is that they increase the number of cavities available for roosting and birds gain considerable thermal benefits and energy savings, when compared to congeners roosting outside of cavities. However, the main disadvantage is that roosting birds are widely targeted by detrimental ectoparasites, and birds actively avoid nestboxes where ectoparasites are abundant. Meanwhile, there is insufficient evidence to make any firm conclusions as to whether roosting in nestboxes increases or decreases predation risk and this is an area, which warrants further research. Consequently, there is a great deal of variation in the quality of individual nestboxes as roosting sites, and interspecific competition results in larger and more dominant species roosting in preferred nestboxes. In summary, this review emphasises the importance of nestboxes to roosting birds during the non-breeding season.","Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","Mainwaring, MC (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",m.mainwaring@lancaster.ac.uk,,,Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,,,60,29,31,1,51,NEDERLANDSE ORNITHOLOGISCHE UNIE,ZEIST,"C/O PAUL STARMANS, OUDE ARNHEMSEWEG 261, 3705 BD ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0373-2266,2213-1175,,ARDEA,Ardea,FAL,2011,99,2,,,,,167,176,,10.5253/078.099.0206,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,852SJ,WOS:000297377500006,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

However, predators often interact with one another in different ways (e.g. interspecific competition, intra guild predation and kleptoparasitism) that may influence the total predation on a common prey. We estimated the total number of semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus killed by Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and wolverine Gulo gulo at different relative abundances of the two species using a model based on diet, food requirements of lynx and wolverine and amount of food available on a reindeer. Our model suggests that total predation decreases by approximately 7.9% (+/- 4.8 SD) if wolverines scavenge on lynx-killed reindeer, compared to a model without scavenging. If the management goal is a constant number of predators, the model suggests that the total kill rate will be lowest in areas with only wolverines, as the estimated wolverine kill rate is much lower than the lynx kill rate. Our model showed that it is unlikely that the lowest number of reindeer killed per predator individual will be at a certain lynx-wolverine ratio, which would appear if lynx consumption of killed reindeer is low and wolverines are very efficient finding lynx-killed reindeer. However, if the management goal is a constant number of lynx and wolverines, the model suggests that the total predation is lower, if lynx and wolverines coexist in the same area compared to existing separately in different areas. The total predation by wolverine and lynx on reindeer is very important for the management of lynx and wolverine in the reindeer husbandry area in Sweden, as the current compensation scheme for predator-killed semi-domestic reindeer is based on the number of predators present within a reindeer herding district, and the compensation for wolverine and lynx is added independently of one another.","[Andren, Henrik; Persson, Jens; Mattisson, Jenny; Danell, Anna C.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Dept Ecol, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden","Andren, H (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Dept Ecol, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",henrik.andren@slu.se; jens.persson@slu.se; jenny.mattisson@slu.se; anna.danell@slu.se,"Andren, Henrik/C-8995-2015; Mattisson, Jenny/X-4750-2019","Mattisson, Jenny/0000-0001-6032-5307; Persson, Jens/0000-0003-1405-7561; Andren, Henrik/0000-0002-5616-2426","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management; World Wide Fund for Nature (Sweden); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas; private foundations 'Olle och Signhild Engkvists Stiftelser; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse","Our study was funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management, the World Wide Fund for Nature (Sweden), the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) and the private foundations 'Olle och Signhild Engkvists Stiftelser and 'Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse'.",,40,14,14,1,89,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,MAR,2011,17,1,,,,,33,43,,10.2981/10-065,,,11,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,766XL,WOS:000290819800005,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Rabbit decline has been recurrently associated with several epizootics and habitat changes. The role of interspecific competition has been usually neglected. This study analyzes the effects of habitat suitability and wild boar (Sus scrofa) occurrence, a hypothetical predator and competitor species, on a small and isolated population of rabbits. To test this effect we used a GLM with the abundance of rabbits as response variable and wild boar occurrence as predictor. To avoid habitat confounding effects we included vegetation structure variables and elevation summarized in PCA factors. Rabbits showed a very restricted and aggregated distribution and a very low abundance across the study area. In contrast, wild boar was present in all sampled plots but one and showed moderate-high abundance. The three best models included both wild boar occurrence and principal component factor 2. Rabbits were located in opened Mediterranean areas where trees were small and scarce, rock cover was low and wild boar occurrence was also low. Nowadays wild boar populations are not directly controlled in private lands and its hunting is forbidden in National Parks in Spain. Waiting for further research to evaluate the threshold of rabbit densities below which competitors and/or predators may prevent the recovery of rabbit populations, control of wild boars may be useful as a short-term strategy to recover small rabbit populations whenever it is linked to habitat improvements.

Despite this, both types of root response to neighbours have been documented. We used two co-occurring clonal species (Glechoma hederacea and Fragaria vesca) with contrasting root responses to neighbours (avoidance of competition and contesting of resources, respectively) to examine whether functional variation in other traits affected the success of each rooting strategy, leading to a different outcome from that predicted on the basis of root behaviour alone. Vegetative propagation rates, morphology and biomass allocation patterns were examined when each species was challenged with competition from physically separate ramets with either the same rooting strategy (intraclonal competition) or the contrasting rooting strategy (interspecific competition). Contrary to the predictions of game-theoretic models, the species that exhibits avoidance of root competition (Glechoma) was not competitively inferior to the species that does not (Fragaria). Glechoma achieved greater total mass in the interspecific treatment than in the intraclonal treatment. However, Fragaria did not experience more intense competition from Glechoma than it did in the intraclonal treatment. Strong interference between the two species appeared to be avoided because Glechoma invested preferentially in rapid exploitation of unoccupied space, whereas Fragaria invested in increasing the competitive ability and local persistence of established ramets. Our results suggest that interspecific trade-offs between traits related to competitive ability and resource exploitation can allow coexistence of species with contrasting rooting behaviours. Full assessment of the adaptive value of different root responses to neighbours therefore requires concurrent consideration of the combined effects of a wide array of functional traits.","[Semchenko, Marina; Zobel, Kristjan] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Semchenko, Marina; Hutchings, Michael J.] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, Sussex, England","Semchenko, M (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, 40 Lai St, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",marina.semchenko@ut.ee,"Zobel, Kristjan/F-2003-2011",,University of Sussex; University of Tartu [0119]; Estonian Science Foundation [7576],"We gratefully acknowledge technical assistance from John Davison.

The leaf beetle, Chrysomela lapponica, originally uses the salicyl glucosides (SGs) of its host plants to sequester salicylaldehyde, which serves as a defence against generalist enemies but attracts specialist enemies. However, some populations of C. lapponica have shifted to SG-poor hosts, and their secretions do not contain salicylaldehyde. 2. In was suggested that beetles shift to SG-poor hosts to escape from specialist enemies. To test this hypothesis, we compared field mortality between two populations of C. lapponica that were associated with SG-rich willow, Salix myrsinifolia (Kola Peninsula and Finland) and two populations that fed on SG-poor willows, S. glauca (Ural) and S. caprea (Belarus). 3. Mortality from generalist enemies was significantly higher in Belarus than in three other populations, whereas mortality from specialists did not differ among populations. A specialist predator (syrphid fly larvae, Parasyrphus nigritarsis) and specialist parasitoids (phorid flies, Megaselia spp.) were attracted to the secretions of larvae reared on both SG-rich and SG-poor hosts. 4. Feeding on leaves of S. caprea and S. myrsinifolia both previously damaged by leaf puncturing and by the larvae of potentially competing species Chrysomela vigintipunctata, decreased the weight and prolonged the development of C. lapponica. 5. Thus, populations of C. lapponica that have shifted to SG-poor willow species did not obtain enemy-free space because specialist enemies have developed adaptations to herbivores that switched to a novel host plant. We suggest that in some populations host plant shift was favoured by interspecific competition with the early season SG-using specialist, C. vigintipunctata.","[Zvereva, Elena L.; Kozlov, Mikhail V.] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Kruglova, Oksana Yu] Univ Belarus, Fac Biol, Minsk, BELARUS","Zvereva, EL (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",elezve@utu.fi,"Zvereva, Elena L./M-8490-2016; Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013","Zvereva, Elena L./0000-0003-2934-3421; Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244",Maj and Tor Nessling foundation; ECEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [EVK2-2002-00169]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [122133],"We thank V.

The effects of trahira density (treatment groups: addition, removal, and reference) in two habitat categories (open and macrophyte-covered areas) on attributes of the fish assemblage structure were evaluated (using rm-ANOVA) over 120 days. Reductions in species richness were recorded in all assemblages and were more pronounced at the end of the experiment within macrophyte-covered areas of the lakes where H. aff. malabaricus was removed. In these lakes, the number of fish was also significantly smaller and evenness was significantly higher than in those in which trahira were added or maintained at natural densities. The increase of the relative abundance of all size classes over the first 60 days on the assemblages where trahira was present, and the decrease of the small-sized fish where trahira was absent contributed to the lack of pronounced alterations in total biomass. The absence of the predator from its preferred habitat was found to negatively affect the less abundant species, which seemed to be highly sensitive to the effects of interspecific competition among prey species. In addition to the well-known effects of hydrological seasonality, the role played by native predators might be important in determining the persistence of local species in the fish assemblages of Neotropical floodplains.","[Petry, Ana Cristina] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-27910970 Macae, RJ, Brazil; [Gomes, Luiz Carlos; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio] Univ Estadual Maringa, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Piana, Pitagoras Augusto] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, R Fac, BR-85903000 Toledo, PR, Brazil","Petry, AC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, R Rotary Club Sn,CP 119331, BR-27910970 Macae, RJ, Brazil.",ac_petry@yahoo.com.br; lcgomes@nupelia.uem.br; pitapiana@yahoo.com.br; agostinhoaa@nupelia.uem.br,"Agostini, Angelo/D-5888-2013; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Petry, Ana/J-6851-2012; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/S-1538-2019; Inau, Inct/J-9853-2013","Agostini, Angelo/0000-0002-4707-9444; Petry, Ana/0000-0001-9039-2738; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444; gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; Piana, Pitagoras Augusto/0000-0002-4666-6663",National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [142220/2001-9],"This study is part of the PhD dissertation of ACP, in the Program of Environmental Sciences, of the Maringa State University, in the long-term program PELD Site-6.

Recent perspectives on mechanisms maintaining these restricted distributions have emphasized abiotic processes, but biotic processes may also play a role in their establishment or maintenance. One historically popular hypothesis, especially for birds, is that interspecific competition constrains ranges of closely related species that replace each other along elevational gradients. Supporting evidence, however, is based on patterns of occurrence and does not reveal potential mechanisms. We experimentally tested a prediction of this hypothesis in two genera of tropical songbirds, Catharus (Turdidae) and Henicorhina (Troglodytidae), in which species have nonoverlapping elevational distributions. Using heterospeci. c playback trials, we found that individuals at replacement zones showed aggressive territorial behavior in response to songs of congeners. As distance from replacement zones increased, aggression toward congener song decreased, suggesting a learned component to interspecific aggression. Additionally, aggressive responses in Catharus were asymmetric, indicating interspecific dominance. These results provide experimental evidence consistent with the hypothesis that interspecific competitive interactions restrict ranges of Neotropical birds. Our results also underscore the need to consider biotic processes, such as competition, when predicting how species' ranges will shift with climate change. Asymmetric aggression could be particularly important. For example, if warming in montane landscapes allows upslope range expansion by dominant competitors, then high-elevation subordinate species could be forced into progressively smaller mountaintop habitats, jeopardizing viability of their populations.","[Jankowski, Jill E.; Levey, Douglas J.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jankowski, Jill E.; Robinson, Scott K.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Jankowski, JE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jjankow2@ufl.edu,"Jankowski, Jill/D-4754-2012",,U.S. National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Animal Behavior Society,"We thank the Campbell, Cruz, Guindon, Leiton, Lowther, Morrison, Rockwell, and Stuckey families of Monteverde for allowing us to work on their properties, as well as the Monteverde and Santa Elena cloudforest preserves, the Monteverde Conservation League, Bosque Eterno, and Monteverde Biological Station.

Results for P. gramineus showed that its mean weight per plant was reduced more by the presence of other P. gramineus plants than by changes in the density of P. pectinatus. However, the difference was statistically significant only at the higher light levels examined. In the case of P. pectinatus, P. gramineus exerted a stronger impact on P. pectinatus plants than did other P. pectinatus plants. Coefficients representing interspecific competition were significantly greater than those representing intraspecific competition at higher light levels. These results indicate that P. gramineus was a stronger competitor when light levels were high. They further indicate that at low light levels, there was little evidence that competition was a strong force in determining either species performance. These results support a theory offered by Grime. However, it was possible to predict that P. gramineus would be a stronger competitor based on its light compensation point which was lower than the one for P. pectinatus. This demonstrates the utility of the R* approach proposed by Tilman. Aspects of both approaches may aid ecologists in understanding community structure.

These predictions are contradicted by the observed abundance of intermediate predators in productive environments. But the predictions are derived by modelling interactions in food chains where the top predator is primarily adapted to exploit intermediate predators but also has some capacity to exploit the resources of the intermediate predators. We call this 'food chain omnivory'. In contrast, 'genuine intraguild predation' is the case where the two predators have shared tactics of resource acquisition, resulting in broadly overlapping prey preferences that is, the interacting predators belong to the same guild as defined by Root (1967). Questions: What are the effects of productivity on genuine intraguild predation? Do the predictions for food chain omnivory apply also to genuine intraguild predation'? Methods: We modelled genuine intraguild predation by using parameter values such that the intermediate predator and the basal prey were equally valuable to the top predator. We assumed that the basal prey was a herbivore, with a carrying capacity directly proportional to primary productivity and a habitat-specific intrinsic rate of population growth that increases asymptotically in response to increasing primary productivity. Results: With the above premises, intermediate predators can prevail even in highly productive habitat. Also, a priority effect is possible. Predictable replacement of intermediate predators by top predators requires that intermediate predators are much easier to find than basal prey. Stable co-existence requires biologically implausible parameter values. Conclusions: Genuine intraguild predation is a destabilizing force in food webs. The dynamics of genuine intraguild predation systems differ from those in food chain omnivory systems where the intermediate and top predators have different feeding tactics and, therefore, different prey preferences.","[Oksanen, Lauri; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Aunapuu, Maano; Oksanen, Tarja] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Aunapuu, Maano] Jamtland Cty Adm Board, Ostersund, Sweden; [Oksanen, Lauri] Finnmark Univ Coll, Dept Nat Sci, Alta, Norway","Oksanen, L (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",lauoks@utu.fi,,,"Swedish Council of Natural Sciences; EU Council [EVK-2-CT_2002-00150]; Academy or Finland [8206140, 812337910]","This research was supported financially by the Swedish Council of Natural Sciences, the EU Council (grant #EVK-2-CT_2002-00150 to T. and L.

Competition between siphonarian and patellid limpets is unstudied on artificial structures, although the limpets are common and are known to compete in natural habitats. We tested hypotheses that the substratum (concrete or sandstone), intra-and/or interspecific competition, or a combination of factors, influence recruitment, survival, rates of grazing, or the quantity and types of algal food to explain the observed patterns. Such analyses enable better understanding of the processes influencing diversity. Both species recruited more to concrete than to sandstone plates. S. denticulata recruited more in the presence of conspecifics and slightly less in the presence of P. latistrigata. Results varied between locations and experiments, but each species survived better on concrete, which had more macro-and micro-algal food. Increased densities of P. latistrigata reduced survival of conspecifics and of S. denticulata. S. denticulata had no effect on survival of P. latistrigata, but reduced amounts of macro-algae. P. latistrigata did not affect macro-algae. Initially, there were more micro-algae on concrete and a minor effect of large densities of S. denticulata. After 95 d, differences between habitats decreased and P. latistrigata were more strongly associated with reduced amounts of micro-algae. Neither substratum, density, nor mix of limpets affected rates of grazing. Thus, interspecific interactions were similar to predictions from knowledge of natural habitats, despite the different characteristics of artificial habitats and the reduced intertidal area available for grazing. Recruitment and competition were important in explaining different densities of these limpets on sandstone and concrete walls. Increasing urbanization requires more experimental tests to identify how well current theories of intertidal ecology and of the processes maintaining local biodiversity can apply to artificial shorelines.","[Ivesa, L.] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Ctr Marine Res, Rovinj 52210, Croatia; [Chapman, M.

On rocky shores, grazing limpets strongly affect ecosystem structure and their distribution in NW Europe is changing in response to climate change. Three limpet species co-occur in SW Britain (Patella vulgata, Patella ulyssiponensis and Patella depressa) on open rock and in pools. Shores in Ireland are similar, but currently lack P. depressa. It is anticipated that P. depressa will expand its range into Ireland as the climate warms, but we currently lack an empirical basis to predict the consequences of this change. Recent studies show that increasing abundance of P. depressa on British shores has been accompanied by a decline of P. vulgata suggesting interspecific competition. In this study, a new experimental framework was used to examine the potential for P. depressa to affect P. vulgata on Irish shores. P. vulgata was experimentally transplanted into enclosures on open rock and in pools in both Ireland and Britain. In pools, treatments also included transplanted P. ulyssiponensis to mimic natural assemblages. Growth and mortality of P. vulgata were measured over 6 months with no differences between Ireland and Britain. In Britain, P. vulgata caged in pools with transplanted P. depressa and P. ulyssiponensis showed reduced growth, compared with when caged in pools with P. ulyssiponensis alone. There was no effect of P. depressa on the growth rate of P. vulgata on open rock. Results indicate that if the range of P. depressa extends into Ireland, it would reduce the growth of P. vulgata where it co-occurs with P. ulyssiponensis in pools. The framework used here provides a field-based approach that could be used to examine the impacts of climate-induced range expansions on the structure and functioning of other ecosystems.","[Firth, Louise B.; Crowe, Tasman P.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Moore, Pippa; Hawkins, Stephen J.] Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Moore, Pippa; Thompson, Richard C.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Hawkins, Stephen J.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales","Firth, LB (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.",louise.firth@ucd.ie,"Moore, Pippa/H-8079-2013; Thompson, Richard C/J-8879-2014","Moore, Pippa/0000-0002-9889-2216; Thompson, Richard/0000-0003-2262-6621","Irish Research Council for Science and Engineering TechnologyIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [RS/2003/115]; The Marine Institute in Ireland [NTT/05/10]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/B504649/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [mba010003, NE/B504649/1] Funding Source: researchfish","We are grateful to D.

Larvae of the latter can prey on other maggots, including that of their own species as facultative food. This facultative characteristic of C. rufifacies may enhance its competitive advantage over other maggots and could also change the situation of other coexisting colonies. In this study, these two species were colonized in the laboratory, and the main objective was to try to understand the effect of competition on larval development. According to our results, intraspecific competition mostly occurred as competition for food; when the rearing density was increased, larvae pupated earlier, resulting in a lighter adult dry weight. The tendencies were similar in both species, but C megacephala developed smaller viable adults and had higher survivorship at high densities. Although C. rufifacies could use the food resource of cannibalism, its survivorship was still low. Our results also showed there were significant interactions between intraspecific competition and the density factor. However, with interspecific competition, the first-instar larvae of C. rufifacies invaded maggot masses of C. megacephala to feed together. The third instars of C. rufifacies were able to expel C. megacephala larvae from food by using a fleshy protrusion on their body surface; C. megacephala was usually forced to pupate earlier by shortening its larval stages. The results indicated that a temporary competitive advantage could only be obtained by C. rufifacies under a proper larval density. In addition, the effects on different larval stages, the responses to different competition intensities, and the temperature-dependent effects on interspecific competition are also discussed. In general, under mixed-species rearing at different temperatures and densities, larval duration, adult dry weight, and survivorship, of both species decreased. However, our results did not completely agree with previous studies, and we suspect that the difference was partially caused by different experimental designs and different biological characters of different blow fly colonies. Our results also suggest that both the predation ability and defense or escape activity should be taken into account when evaluating larval competitive advantages. The durations of larval stages of these two species could be decreased by approximate to 54 h when a single species was reared alone and food was limited; the largest reduction in larval duration, approximate to 25 h in C. megacephala and 34 h in C. rufifacies, caused by interspecific competition was under a high larval density. In conclusion, competition decreased the larval duration of these two species by up to 2 d; this also draws attention to justifying the postmortem interval estimation of using larval developmental data when larval competition exists.","[Shiao, Shiuh-Feng; Yeh, Ta-Chuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Shiao, SF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",sfshiao@ntu.edu.tw,,"SHIAO, SHIUH-FENG/0000-0002-4213-0423",,,,33,36,37,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2585,1938-2928,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Faster growing, larger and/or more aggressive crayfish species are predicted to dominate permanent waterbodies. We tested this prediction using a 9 year dataset for two species of crayfish (Procambarus alleni and Procambarus fallax) co-existing in a sub-tropical flowing slough in southern Florida. Using a series of laboratory and mesocosm experiments we also compared life history traits and performance of the respective species to test mechanisms that could explain dominance shifts in the local crayfish assemblages. 2. Over the 9-year period, P. alleni densities were the greatest in shallower, shorter-hydroperiod areas bordering the slough, while P. fallax densities were higher in deeper, longer-hydroperiod central areas. These areas were separated by 0.8-2 km of continuous wetland with no apparent barriers to movement between them. 3. Density of P. fallax was not strongly affected by any measures of hydrological variation, while P. alleni density increased with more severe drought conditions. Following the strongest droughts, P. alleni colonized areas in the centre of the slough where they had been absent or scarce in wetter years. 4. We conducted experiments to compare growth rates, drought tolerance, and competitive dominance of these species. P. alleni survived drought conditions better, had higher growth rates, and was the dominant competitor for space and food. While drought probably limits P. fallax in the drier slough habitats, neither drought sensitivity nor interspecific competition with P. fallax can explain decreases of P. alleni with wetter conditions. 5. Our results indicate that a competition-colonization tradeoff cannot explain the crayfish compositional dynamics in this wetland because P. alleni is both the best competitor and the best at surviving in and colonizing areas with the strongest droughts. Future attention should focus on the potential for selective effects of predators that co-vary with hydrology. 6. The traits (large size, fast growth, competitive dominance) exhibited by P. alleni, which is absent in long-hydroperiod wetlands, are those exhibited by dominant crayfish in permanent lakes and streams containing fish. Although these traits make crayfish less vulnerable to fish in some lakes and streams, life-history models of community structure across permanence gradients suggest the opposite traits should be favoured for co-existence with fish.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Dorn, NJ (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA.",ndorn1@fau.edu,"Trexler, Joel C/I-5265-2012",,,,,37,40,42,0,43,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

However, interspecific interactions such as intraguild predation and interference competition can also play a significant role in the stability of communities. The role of antagonistic/synergistic interactions among predators has been largely ignored in food web theory. These mechanisms influence predation rates, which is one of the key factors regulating food web structure and dynamics, thus ignoring them can potentially limit understanding of food webs. Using nonlinear models, it is shown that critical aspects of multiple predator food web dynamics are antagonistic/synergistic interactions among predators. The influence of antagonistic/synergistic interactions on coexistence of predators depended largely upon the parameter set used and the degree of feeding niche differentiation. In all cases when there was no effect of antagonism or synergism (a(ij) =1.00), the predators coexisted. Using the stable parameter set, coexistence occurred across the range of antagonism/synergism used. However, using the chaotic parameter strong antagonism resulted in the extinction of one or both species, while strong synergism tended to coexistence. Whereas using the limit cycle parameter set, coexistence was strongly dependent on the degree of feeding niche overlap. Additionally increasing the degree of feeding specialization of the predators on the two prey species increased the amount of parameter space in which coexistence of the two predators occurred. Bifurcation analyses supported the general pattern of increased stability when the predator interaction was synergistic and decreased stability when it was antagonistic. Thus, synergistic interactions should be more common than antagonistic interactions in ecological systems.","Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Huxel, GR (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",ghuxel@uark.edu,,,,,,22,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0092-8240,,,B MATH BIOL,Bull.

Within a single co-infection, competition can occur between conspecific and heterospecific parasite individuals, either directly or via the host's physiological and immune responses. We studied a natural single-host, multi-parasite model infection system (polystomes in the anuran Xenopus laevis victorianus) in which the parasite species show total interspecific competitive exclusion as adults in host individuals. Multi-species infection experiments indicated that competitive outcomes were dependent on infection species composition and strongly influenced by the intraspecific genetic identity of the interacting organisms. Our results also demonstrate the special importance of temporal heterogeneity (the sequence of infection by different species) in competition and co-existence between parasite species and predict that developmental plasticity in inferior competitors, and the induction of species-specific host resistance, will partition the within-host-individual habitat over time. We emphasise that such local (within-host) context-dependent processes are likely to be a fundamental determinant of population dynamics in multi-species parasite assemblages.

In this study, we investigated the dynamics of intraguild predation by C. albiceps on other fly species in order to analyse interspecific and intraspecific survival in C. albiceps, C. megacephala and C macellaria Fabricius. The experimental design of the study allowed us to evaluate how factors such as species, density and abundance of food influenced the survival of the calliphorid species. When C albiceps was confined with C megacephala or C macellaria, only adults of C albiceps survived at different larval densities and abundance of food. In addition, the survival of C albiceps was higher in two-species experiments when compared to single species experiments. The implications of these results for the dynamics of C albiceps were discussed.","Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Parasitol, Inst Biociencias, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Bioestatist, Inst Biociencias, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; Univ Estadual Campinas, Univ Zeferino Vaz, Inst Biol, Dept Parasitol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Rosa, GS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Parasitol, Inst Biociencias, Rubiao Jr, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",,"Carvalho, L.R./C-2973-2013; Godoy, Wesley AC/B-9787-2012","Carvalho, L.R./0000-0003-0575-2263; ",,,,32,18,20,0,8,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY BRASIL,"LONDRINA,","C POSTAL 481, 86001-970 LONDRINA,, PR, BRAZIL",1519-566X,,,NEOTROP ENTOMOL,Neotrop.

Prediction: Consumer distributions across habitats will match the distribution of resource supply rates. Organisms: A mixture of white cloud mountain minnow Tanichthys albonubes and giant danio Danio aequipinnatus. The choice of allopatric species avoids confounding the factors of common evolutionary history and can reveal competition patterns that follow biological invasions. Methods: Record habitat preferences of the two competing fish species in an aquarium with two feeding sites. Develop the two-species IFD model and compare the data to its predictions. Results: In the presence of conspecifics alone, individuals of each species conform to Parker's matching rule, distributing themselves according to the ratio of the food supply rates. When both species are present, the minnow distribution still follows the matching rule but the danio selects the feeding site with the lower food supply rate disproportionately more often than when it is alone. Hence, while intraspecific competition does not affect feeding site preferences in either of the species, interspecific competition between minnows and danios is asymmetric; the minnow is the dominant competitor. We trace the asymmetry to species-specific foraging tactics. Minnows stay much closer to a feeding site and reach food items twice as quickly as danios. Our model, based solely on exploitative competition, does not fit these observations. Instead, interference between species appears to drive the asymmetric competition and make Parker's matching rule generalized to a two-species environment inadequate.","Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; ASCR, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Biol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic","Berec, M (corresponding author), Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",michal.berec@bf.jcu.cz,"Krivan, Vlastimil/F-1709-2010; Berec, Ludek/G-7253-2014; Berec, Michal/X-6508-2019; Krivan, Vlastimil/J-7015-2019; Berec, Michal/D-8411-2016","Krivan, Vlastimil/0000-0003-0971-1231; Berec, Ludek/0000-0002-2419-3324; Berec, Michal/0000-0002-1065-7343; Berec, Michal/0000-0002-1065-7343",,,,33,20,20,0,18,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

Since that time, studies on the life history and geographical distribution of A. bipunctata have been ongoing, and its establishment in the Osaka Nanko area has been confirmed. A. bipunctata is a predacious ladybird beetle and a member of a guild that overlaps in habitat and prey with that of native ladybird beetles such as Harmonia axyridis and Menochilas sexmaculatus. We investigated the distribution of A. bipunctata and its interspecific relationships with native predacious ladybird beetles. In some areas, A. bipunctata was dominant in interspecific relationships with native ladybird beetles. For the first 10 years after A. bipunctata was discovered, it occurred only in the Osaka Nanko area, but the present geographical distribution indicates that it has expanded its range. Though the population density of this species was highest at the area recorded first, and tended to decrease in inverse proportion to the distance from Osaka Nanko Central Park, a satellite occurrence was observed in a remote area. The numbers of aphid and tree species (leaf shelter for aestivation and over-wintering) utilized by A. bipunctata have recently increased. Such increases will cause the rate of distribution of A. bipunctata to accelerate. Interspecific competition between H. axyridis and A. bipunctata, which occurs earlier than H. axyridis, may be avoided by desynchronization of the occurrence seasons, and another common predacious ladybird beetle, Coccinella septempunctata, may escape interspecific competition by habitat segregation.","Kinki Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Environm Ecol, Nara 6318505, Japan","Sakuratani, Y (corresponding author), Kinki Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Environm Ecol, 3327-204 Nakamachi, Nara 6318505, Japan.",sakura@nara.kindai.ac.jp,,,,,,59,19,19,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Since saltmarsh plant communities are controlled by physical stress tolerance and competition, we conducted a field experiment that measured effects of saltwater flooding and competitive interactions on plants as a guide for predicting habitat response to tidal restoration. Six plant species of New England salt marshes were studied: halophytes Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, and Juncus gerardii and brackish invasive species Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, and Lythrum salicaria. Plant shoots were transplanted across a gradient of three flooding and three salinity regimes and arranged into pair-wise competitive combinations. After one growing season, saltwater flooding was found to decrease transplant survival, biomass production, and/or relative growth for all species. Reduction in halophyte growth was largely due to increased flood duration; brackish species were most reduced by increased salinity. Interspecific competition also influenced species growth, although the short duration of the study may have weakened these effects. Transplants paired with S. alterniflora had reduced growth, but combinations with Juncus produced increased growth. Standardized factors of stress tolerance and relative competitive strength were derived for the six study species as a framework for understanding community-level changes in marshes. As an aid to resource managers, experimental results can be used to predict plant community response to existing and potential alterations in saltmarsh tidal hydrology.","Wells Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Wells, ME 04090 USA; Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources, Jackson Estuarine Lab, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Konisky, RA (corresponding author), Wells Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, 342 Laudholm Farm Rd, Wells, ME 04090 USA.",rkonisky@bwellsnerr.org,,,,,,51,34,35,0,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,JUN,2004,24,2,,,,,434,447,,10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0434:EOSOIA]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,835LO,WOS:000222485000017,,,,,2021-09-21,

These principles have not yet, however, been adequately integrated and synthesized into an operational approach. This paper reviews the ecological and ecophysiological bases for interspecific interactions based on data from site-specific research and demonstration trials from temperate agroforestry systems, primarily from temperate North America. The review shows that information on ecological interactions in several temperate agroforestry systems is inadequate. It is recommended that the future research should focus on exploring new species and systems that have received little attention in the past. Priority research areas should include cultural practices and system designs to minimize interspecific competition and maximize environmental benefits such as improved water quality. Potential for genetic modification of components to increase productivity and reduce competition also needs to be explored. Process-oriented models may be used increasingly to predict resource-allocation patterns and possible benefits for a suite of site and species combinations.","Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Milton, FL 32583 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Univ Missouri, Dept Forestry, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Jose, S (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, 5988 Hwy 90,Bldg 4900, Milton, FL 32583 USA.",sjose@ufl.edu,,,,,,117,212,246,7,134,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Previous studies have suggested that the occurrence of larval Chaoborus in lakes may be affected by fish predation, pH, elevation, temperature, nutrient level, water transparency and interspecific competition, but so far, a detailed statistical evaluation of these findings has not been performed. 2. The aim of this study was to apply regression and ordination techniques to a large data set of 56 lakes in order to test which variables related to lake morphology, water chemistry, and fish predation determine (1) the abundance of individual Chaoborus species and (2) their species composition. 3. Individual Chaoborus species were influenced by very different sets of environmental factors. Nutrient levels positively affected the largest species, Chaoborus americanus, which was restricted to fishless lakes. Abundance of the smallest and most transparent species, C. punctipennis, seemed to be controlled more by the larger Chaoborus species than by fish. Larger chaoborids required low water clarity in order to co-exist with fish, probably to increase refuge availability. Generally, small lakes (for C. flavicans/C. trivittatus) and shallow lakes (for C. punctipennis) supported higher abundances of Chaoborus .","Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Ecol Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; York Univ, Dept Biol, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; Dorset Environm Sci Ctr, Dorset, ON, Canada; Laurentian Univ, Dept Biol, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada","Wissel, B (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Ecol Inst, Dept Biol Sci, 1243 ECE Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",bwissel@LSU.edu,"Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013","Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865",,,,52,40,40,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Another mirid predator, Dicyphus tamaninii Wagner, spontaneously colonizes Mediterranean greenhouses. The impact of the presence of D. tamaninii on predation of the greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood) by M. caliginosus was investigated in the laboratory on tomato plants during four days. No significant interspecific competition was recorded between mirid nymphs and no significant intraguild predation was observed. Higher level of predation of the whitefly populations was achieved by D. tamaninii alone, than by M. caliginosus alone. Predation by the heterospecific combination (M. caliginosus + D. tamaninii) was similar to the results obtained by conspecific treatments. No intraspecific competition was recorded with D. tamaninii, nor with M. caliginosus. Finally, the distribution of whitefly predation on the plant by the mirids changed according to the predator treatment. The heterospecific combination of both mirids had a higher predation rate on lower leaves of the plant than monospecific combinations. Overall, the presence of D. tamaninii did not disrupt whitefly predation by M. caliginosus and could even increase the level of predation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crops in close association, is attracting increasing interest in developed countries, primarily due to claims that it can provide increased yields in an environmentally sustainable manner. 2. The land equivalent ratio (LER) is frequently used to attest the claim that intercropping produces a greater total biological productivity per unit area of land than monocropping. However, similar to other indices, the value of the LER is dependent on the relative densities of the two crops and fails to provide an indication of the optimal crop density combination required to produce maximum biological productivity. We used an alternative methodology to predict the optimum density for planting two crops in a mixed stand. 3. Maize and beans were grown both in monoculture and in intercropped stands at a range of densities. Monocrop stands of both maize and bean displayed an asymptotic yield-density relationship. When a second crop was introduced into the stand there was no effect on the yield of maize, but there was a large reduction in the yield of bean. 4. The LER did not demonstrate an unequivocal advantage to intercropping. Less than a third of the LER values, over the range of densities considered, were greater than one, although none was significantly different to unity. The highest values were obtained from those plots sown with a high density of maize. 5. An alternative method of analysing the biological productivity of an intercrop System is proposed. This approach requires a combination of (i) an additive experimental design, (ii) the use of a regression model to measure the competitive effect of two species, and (iii) the presentation of the net competitive effect on individual and total yields using a response surface. The reciprocal model was used to dissociate and quantify intra- and interspecific competition, estimate a competitive equivalence coefficient and predict the individual yields of the full complement of density combinations included in the maize and bean experiment. 6. The model explained up to 90% of the variation in the observed yields of maize and bean in an intercrop. An inspection of the response surface for the LER indicated that the minimum density combination required to produce the maximum yield advantage within the density range considered comprised maize being planted at a density of 11 plants m(-2) and bean being planted at a density of 39 plants m(-2). Although this combination would provide the maximum biological productivity, it is considered unlikely to provide the maximum gross economic margin. 7. The above methodology may provide a useful tool for managing competition, either between two or more crops in an intercrop, or within a crop-weed interaction.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Hort Res Int, Warwick CV35 9EF, Warks, England","Park, SE (corresponding author), CSIRO, Long Pocket Labs, 120 Meiers Rd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia.",sarah.park@csiro.au,"Park, Sarah/D-3774-2011; Watkinson, Andrew R/N-1649-2013; Benjamin, Laurence R/B-5093-2008","Benjamin, Laurence R/0000-0003-3756-7855",,,,54,34,36,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

One might expect such a trade-off, for instance, if parasitoids with larger (and fewer) eggs are more likely to prevail in intrinsic competition than species with smaller (and more numerous) eggs. We tested the idea that relative egg size could be used to predict the outcome of intrinsic competition in two closely related endoparasitoids, Encarsia pergandiella Howard and Encarsia formosa Gahan. Contrary to expectation, the parasitoid species with smaller eggs, E. pergandiella prevailed in intrinsic competition, regardless of the order that hosts were exposed to the two species. In a literature survey, we found four studies of competing pairs of endoparasitoid species for which: (a) egg size estimates were available and (b) one species was consistently superior in intrinsic competition. In three of the four studies, the small-egged species prevailed in intrinsic competition, as we also found. Although E. formosa lost in intrinsic competition, this species negatively affected E. pergandiella's progeny production by host feeding on and killing hosts containing E. pergandiella eggs. E. formosa females also host fed on conspecific-parasitized hosts. As a mechanism of both intra- and interspecific interference competition, host feeding on parasitized hosts contradicts assumptions about the nature of interference competition in existing population dynamics models.

The aim was to determine the possible effects of interspecific competition, predation and nutrient limitation on the production of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxin by A. minutum. The growth rate of A. minutum was higher in the cultures of A. minutum and copepods than in the mixed cultures of A. minutum and P. micans, which indicates that A. minutum was more negatively affected by interspecific competition than by predation, Toxin content per cell in A. minutum increased in all cultures, but toxin production rate was higher in cultures with P. micans and/or A. clausi. Toxin concentration in A. minutum increased as PO43- concentration diminished. In the mixed cultures with copepods, analyses of toxin content in the copepods showed that at cell toxin contents lower than approximately 20 fmol cell(-1), mainly cells of A. minutum were ingested by copepods, whereas at higher toxins content per cell, copepods fed mainly on P. micans. We conclude that one of the possible advantages of toxin production by A. minutum under P limitation is to enhance interspecific competition, by redirecting grazing pressure to non-toxic phytoplankton species. It would allow a possibly low competitive ability of A. minutum to be offset under low nutrient concentrations.","Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Mar, Vigo 36200, Spain","Guisande, C (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Mar, Lagoas Marconsende, Vigo 36200, Spain.",castor@uvigo.es,"Frangopulos, Maximo/ABC-8933-2020","Riveiro, I.

The purpose of this note is to develop such a framework, and to demonstrate how conventional bioeconomic models of interspecific competition, such as the predator-prey model, are essentially special cases. A model of the economic consequences of the biological invasion must therefore be based on two principles. First, the economic impacts imposed by the invader will depend on the exact nature of the interspecific interaction, and secondly, the correct measure of these impacts should be based on a comparison of the ex post and ex ante invasion scenarios. An important consideration is determining whether the spread, or dispersal, of the invading species in turn affects the location and movement of the resident species in the pre-existing habitat, or whether the interspecific competition occurs solely in the same habitat area without diffusive movement of either species, or finally, whether both species dispersal and some form of interspecific competition might occur as a result of an invasion.

During their foraging activity they frequently encounter heterospecific aphid predators. These situations can lead to intraguild predation and may disrupt biological control efforts against aphids where more than one predator species is present. We investigated the behavior of larvae of the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus de Geer and its interaction with three other aphid predators: the ladybird Coccinella septempunctata L., the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea Stephens, and the gall midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani). Interspecific interactions: between predators were examined in arenas of different sizes and in the presence of extra-guild-prey. The outcome of interactions between E. balteatus larvae and the other predators depended predominantly on the relative body size of the competitors. Relatively large individuals acted as intraguild predators, while relatively smaller individuals became intraguild prey. Eggs and first- as well as second-instar larvae of E. balteatus were highly susceptible to predation by all other predators, whereas pupae of E. balteatus were preyed upon only by the larvae of C. carnea. Interactions between A. aphidimyza and E. balteatus were asymmetric and always favored the latter. Eggs and first- as well as second-instar larvae of E. balteatus sustained intraguild predation irrespective of the size of the arena or the presence of extraguild prey. However, the frequency of predation on third-instar larvae of E. balteatus was significantly reduced. This study indicated that the same species can be both intraguild predator and intraguild prey. It is suggested that combinations of predators must be carefully chosen for success in biological control of aphids.

Population fluctuations should often bring the species into competition in jointly occupied habitats where their competition can be measured by habitat isodars (lines or planes of density where the expected fitness of individuals is the same in all occupied habitats). We tested the theory by calculating isodars for two species of lemmings with distinct habitat preferences When population densities are high, both habitats are occupied by both species But as densities decline, habitat isodars suggest that the joint dynamics of each species pass through a region where each occupies a separate habitat (the ghost of competition). the competition was asymmetrical. The density of collared lemmings in their preferred habitat was reduced as the density of brown lemmings increased in the same habitat. But collared lemmings had no direct competitive effect on brown lemmings. The interspecific effect from brown lemmings was comparable to - possibly even in excess of - intraspecific competition for habitat. The asymmetric competition for habitat yields spectacular new kinds of isolegs categorizing habitat competition between co-existing species. Although current evidence implicates competition, the patterns are also consistent with apparent competition driven by specialized predators. Regardless of whether lemming habitat use reflects true or apparent competition, the associated density dependent differences in habitat preference are likely to have major consequences for the nonstable dynamics of lemmings and non-linear lemming isoclines.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Lakehead Univ, Fac Forestry & Forest Environm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,,,,,56,73,74,0,36,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

Two species of freshwater invertebrate predator, Notonecta maculata and N. obliqua, showed a negative association in a series of small, man-made ponds in the Peak National Park, Derbyshire, U.K. The present study examines the potential role of interspecific interactions among nymphs on this regional distribution pattern. 2. The survival, development and feeding efficiency of nymphs were examined in laboratory and field mesocosm experiments with intra- and interspecific competition and contrasting environmental complexity. 3. Survival to adulthood and mean lifespan varied significantly in interspecific competition treatments in both laboratory and field experiments, with N. maculata showing higher survival in the simple environment and N. obliqua higher survival in the complex environment. 4. Variations in feeding efficiency were consistent with the survival trends: N. maculata had a higher efficiency in the simple environment, whereas N. obliqua had greater efficiency in the complex environment. There was evidence of a developmental response in feeding efficiency, with differences between species increasing with age. 5. These results suggest that the relative competitive abilities of the two species are affected by habitat complexity, and that competition between species may modify the species distribution where they co-occur.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Briers, RA (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,"Briers, Robert/B-5810-2014","Briers, Robert/0000-0003-0341-1203",,,,29,8,9,1,9,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Inducible defenses are flexible responses in which predator (or competitor)-released substances stimulate potential prey organisms to transform into predator-resistant phenotypes. Induced defenses may be highly protective. Benefits however are often balanced by fitness costs such as decreased growth rates or reduced reproductive potential. Here I discuss inducible defenses in ciliates with particular attention to the hypotrich genera: Aspidisca, Euplotes, Onychodromus, Sterkiella, and an undescribed hypotrich genus. I isolated Sterkiella sp. and the undescribed genus from vernal woodland pools on Saint Anselm College campus. Experimental evidence shows that a signal-induced defensive transformation occurs in these ciliates within hours after exposure to a predator cue and results in a significant decrease in susceptibility to predation. Deployment of ciliate antipredator structures such as spines, keels, ridges and other protuberances requires a large investment of cytoskeletal elements, primarily microtubules, and incurs an evolutionary cost in the form of significantly reduced growth rates. Onychodromus quadricornutus exhibits an extraordinary degree of phenotypic plasticity. In response to different environmental conditions individuals within a clone may express one of three general phenotypes: basic, lanceolate, or giant cells. The predacious giant phenotype releases a morphogenetically active signal substance, Onychodromus-factor, that triggers defensive phenotypic transformation in both intraspecific and interspecific prey. Enzyme degradation and ultrafiltration experiments indicate that Onychodromus-factor is a peptide with a molecular weight below 10,000 Da. Conspecifics develop hypertrophied dorsal spines when exposed to Onychodromus-factor. Sterkiella cells develop two defensive dorsal keels and transform to an enlarged ovoid cell in response to Onychodromus-factor as well as inducing signals released by Stylonychia, Urostyla, and Lembadion. Field studies of two vernal pools show that defensive phenotypic transformation in Sterkiella cells coincides with the appearance of Lembadion magnum during vernal pool succession. An undescribed hypotrich genus also expresses its defended phenotype when Lembadion is present in these pools. Aspidisca turrita (Ehrenberg, 1838) Claparede and Lachmann 1858, closely resembles Aspidisca lynceus (Muller, 1773) except for the possession of a dorsal thorn-like structure. Experimental evidence shows that the dorsal thorn is a defensive structure induced by signals released by the predacious ciliates Urostyla grandis and Lembadion magnum. Thus, A. turrita and A. lynceus are alternate phenotypes of the same species. I speculate that inducing signals function in predacious ciliates as lectin-like, carbohydrate-binding adhesion proteins during prey recognition and that prey species have evolved specialized cell surface receptors that allow detection of different predator proteins. I consider consequences for both predator and prey.",,"Wicklow, BJ (corresponding author), ST ANSELM COLL,DEPT BIOL,100 ST ANSELMS DR,MANCHESTER,NH 03102, USA.",,,,,,,65,33,34,0,20,SOC PROTOZOOLOGISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",1066-5234,,,J EUKARYOT MICROBIOL,J.

Predatory larvae of a mosquito Topomyia tipuliformis concentrated in young axils, while 9 other taxa utilized both young and old axils or concentrated more in older axils. The total prey density was lower in axils with the predator but the density of each prey taxon (except for a few cases) and the number of prey taxa did not differ between axils with and without predators. This indicates that T. tipuliformis is a general predator and does not influence prey community organization through selective removal of particular prey taxa. Inter-axil distribution of T. tipuliformis was aggregated in the first instar but uniform in the third and fourth instars due to intraspecific cannibalism, which assures the survival of a single individual under short food supply. Distributions of prey taxa were mostly aggregated, fitting the negative binomial distribution. Thirty seven out of 45 associations of 10 taxa were independent with 3 negative (between the predator and some late-colonizing prey) and 5 positive (between some prey taxa) associations. Probabilistic refuges (produced by independent aggregated distributions) reduced interspecific encounters which may result in competition and predation, and thus probably facilitated prey coexistence. There was no evidence for the importance of predation in structuring the prey community. This system may be prey-dominated in that predator persistence depends on prey community existence but prey community structure depends less on predation.","UNIV SAM RATULANGI,FAC AGR,DEPT CROP PESTS & DIS,MANADO 95115,INDONESIA","Mogi, M (corresponding author), SAGA MED SCH,DEPT MICROBIOL,DIV PARASITOL,NABESHIMA 5-1-1,SAGA 849,JAPAN.",,,,,,,38,6,6,2,10,SOC POPULATION ECOLOGY,KYOTO,"SHIMOTACHIURI OGAWA-HIGASHI KAMIKYO-KU, KYOTO 602, JAPAN",0034-5466,,,RES POPUL ECOL,Res.

Sage sparrows [Amphispiza belli (Cassin)], black-throated sparrows [A. bilineata (Cassin)] and dark-eyed juncos [Junco hyemalis (L.)] winter in different habitats along an elevational gradient in the Sonoran Desert of southern California, USA. Such species replacements along environmental gradients are commonly attributed to interspecific competition. We tested the alternative hypotheses that food, predation and microhabitat structure might shape species distributions. 2. Species abundances were unrelated to food availability. Species were missing from habitats in which food standing crop was no less abundant than in the habitats they occupied. A second measure of food availability, predicted food intake rate, also failed to explain the distributions. The profitabilities of seed species ranked similarly among the three species of sparrows suggesting that the sparrows should prefer the same foods and should have similar habitat distributions if habitat distributions were shaped by food. 3. All three species escape predators by fleeing to woody cover and all prefer to feed near cover. Hence, if predation risk determined sparrow distributions, all species should be most abundant in the habitat with the most escape cover; this was not observed. 4. Foraging microhabitats used by individual species were more widely distributed than the species themselves, suggesting that species' distributions are not limited by microhabitat structure. Also, although species occupy different habitats, they overlap extensively in the types of microhabitats that they occupy 5. Although predictions of the competition hypothesis were not tested, species distributions and the results above are consistent with the hypothesis that interspecific competition is responsible for habitat partitioning by the species. Direct tests of this hypothesis are warranted.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,DEPT ZOOL,ECOL GRP,VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4,BC,CANADA",,,,,,,,47,23,23,0,20,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The model accounted for 93% and 85% of the variation in phytomass and in seed yield, respectively. In both species intraspecific competition was more severe than interspecific competition. Oats was relatively the stronger of the two competitors, e.g. substitution rates were 0.33 plants of oats for a plant of bean with respect to oat seed yield, and 0.72 plants of bean for a plant of oats with respect to bean seed yield. Oats bad a greater yield potential than bean. The mixture sown in densities of 400 oats/m2 and 40 beans/m2 out-yielded the most productive monoculture with respect to seed yield.

I manipulated levels of simulated folivory on branches within eight trees of Quercus emoryi in a complete randomized block design. Survival and causes of mortality, including attack by natural enemies, of a dominant leafminer, Cameraria sp. nov., were monitored over two growing seasons. Survival varied significantly among trees but not among treatments. Causes of mortality also varied significantly among trees. Death from premature leaf abscission increased significantly with increasing levels of branch damage, while mortality from other causes, including death from bacterial and fungal attack, declined significantly with increasing levels of damage. However, neither of these changes in mortality was sufficient to cause changes in overall survival. Leaf damage did not influence attack by macroscopic natural enemies (hymenopteran parasitoids or vertebrate and invertebrate predators). By far, the most important factor affecting survival and causes of mortality within trees was the presence of co-occurring larvae on leaves (i.e., intraspecific competition). Simulated folivory in the first growing season did not affect folivory by Cameraria or other folivorous arthropods in the next season. Colonization, survival, rate of attack by natural enemies, and amount of herbivory by other arthropods in the second growing season were not affected by levels of leaf damage in the first one. Neither survival nor causes of mortality of Cameraria in the second growing season were associated with folivory by endemic leafchewing arthropods. Simulated folivory in the first growing season did, however, reduce leaf production in the second season. These results do not support the hypothesis that insect species compete interspecifically via induced plant responses and their effects on the third trophic level (natural enemies of the herbivores). The effects of simulated (first growing season) and insect (second growing season) folivory via induced plant responses on the Cameraria population was negligible relative to intraspecific interactions. Further, my results do not support the notion that folivore-induced responses are defensive and that plants have evolved these responses to manipulate the third trophic level. In natural settings, other factors that influence population dynamics of phytophagous insects, such as intraspecific competition and interactions with microparasites, may obscure any negative effects of herbivore-induced plant responses on interactions among herbivore species and their macroscopic natural enemies.",,"FAETH, SH (corresponding author), ARIZONA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA.",,,,,,,62,46,47,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1992,73,5,,,,,1802,1813,,10.2307/1940031,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP740,WOS:A1992JP74000028,,,,,2021-09-21,

We investigated prospects for these species under climate change in northern England uplands. We created ensemble models predicting niche realisation for these species, influenced by abiotic and biotic factors, estimating niche overlap in geo-environmental space. The two species occupy distinctly different niches, influenced more by vegetation preferences than climatic differences. The current climate niche for L. timidus featured higher elevations with cooler temperatures and 168 km(2) range extent. Its current habitat niche scale was larger at 269 km(2) , comprised entirely of upland dwarf shrubs: heather, cotton grass, moorland grasses. By contrast, the current climate niche predicted L. europaeus occupying lowland areas with a milder climate and range extent of 252 km(2). Its current habitat niche was also greater, 401 km(2) , being mostly improved grassland. Competition was presently limited. The current niche predictions showed very little geographic overlap between the species. Niche overlap measured by Schoener Index was low: current climate niche 0.16; current habitat niche 0.07. The future climate niches for 2050 (IPCC RCP2.6), predicted L. timidus range contracting to 19 km(2), on hilltops and L. europaeus range expanding to 765 km(2). Consequently L. timidus range would be wholly within the L. europaeus range. In many contact zones throughout Europe, L. europaeus outcompetes L. timidus; however, in the Peak District their distributions are largely distinct. Future replacement of L. timidus by L. europaeus may be engendered by dietary convergence, should a warmer climate cause a transition of upland dwarf shrub vegetation to grasses.","[Bedson, Carlos P.

Forest succession in these patches is not well understood. There is concern that competition with rapidly reestablishing shrubs, combined with dispersal limitation, may delay or impede conifer recovery and/or shift tree composition toward shade-tolerant species. However, tree-shrub interactions and shrub neighborhood dynamics have not been closely examined. To investigate the patterns and processes determining forest recovery after severe wildfire, we developed a data-driven simulation model that we use to predict conifer emergence above the shrub canopy. Our model results showed that ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) emerged at a faster rate than white fir (Abies concolor) under whitethorn ceanothus (Ceanothus cordulatus) and deerbrush (Ceanothus integerrimus), and at a similar rate under greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula). Across all shrub species, ponderosa pine had a relative advantage over fir in the period between conifer establishment and peak shrub competition, requiring a mean of 16 years for 50% of individuals to emerge compared to 22 years for fir. Fir emergence rates then surpassed those of pine, leading to similar overall emergence by simulation end: 83% +/- 7% for pine and 82% +/- 7% for fir. These results show that, on balance, shrub neighborhood dynamics do not produce an ecological filter favoring firs for the initial cohort of established seedlings, but emergence patterns are sensitive to shrub species. Further applications of this data-driven simulation framework could improve understanding of other important components of post-fire succession.","[Tubbesing, Carmen L.; York, Robert A.; Stephens, Scott L.; Battles, John J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Young, Derek J.

Our field sites in the north-central Sierra Nevada are located within the ancestral homelands of the Nisenan people (https://www.nisenan.org/), who have used fire in their land stewardship (Stephens and Collins 2004). Members of the Nisenan community have been killed and persecuted under settler colonialism, particularly during the California Gold Rush. In 1913, the Nevada City Rancheria was created as a federally recognized reservation of the Nisenan Tribe, but in the 1950s and 1960s it was illegally terminated along with 47 other Rancherias as part of the California Rancheria Termination Acts (http://www.nevadacityra ncheria.org/). Nisenan are working to restore federal recognition in creative ways, including through film, language revitalization, school curriculum development, collaborations with local artists, and other initiatives (https://chirpca.org/vi sibility-through-art). We recognize that we benefit from the use of Nisenan homelands and that we, along with much of the forest and fire research community, are part of a legacy of Western scientists who have at times undermined indigenous sovereignty and traditional ecological knowledge.

In African ecosystems, reduced prey populations and the loss of competing guild members, most notably lion (Panthera leo), are expected to increase the levels of competition between remaining carnivores. Consequently, intraguild relationships can be altered, potentially increasing the risk of further population decline. Kasungu National Park (KNP), Malawi, is an example of a conservation area that has experienced large-scale reductions in both carnivore and prey populations, leaving a resident large carnivore guild consisting of only leopard (Panthera pardus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). Here, we quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of these two species and their degree of association, using a combination of co-detection modeling, time-to-event analyses, and temporal activity patterns from camera trap data. The detection of leopard and spotted hyena was significantly associated with the detection of preferred prey and competing carnivores, increasing the likelihood of species interaction. Temporal analyses revealed sex-specific differences in temporal activity, with female leopard activity patterns significantly different to those of spotted hyena and male conspecifics. Heightened risk of interaction with interspecific competitors and male conspecifics may have resulted in female leopards adopting temporal avoidance strategies to facilitate coexistence. Female leopard behavioral adaptations increased overall activity levels and diurnal activity rates, with potential consequences for overall fitness and exposure to sources of mortality. As both species are currently found at low densities in KNP, increased risk of competitive interactions, which infer a reduction in fitness, could have significant implications for large carnivore demographics. The protection of remaining prey populations is necessary to mitigate interspecific competition and avoid further alterations to the large carnivore guild.","[Davis, Robert S.; Yarnell, Richard W.; Gentle, Louise K.; Uzal, Antonio] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Brackenhurst Campus, Southwell NG25 0QF, Notts, England; [Davis, Robert S.; Stone, Emma L.] Conservat Res Africa & Carnivore Res Malawi, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Mgoola, William O.] Dept Natl Pk & Wildlife Malawi, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Stone, Emma L.] Univ West England, Dept Appl Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Davis, RS (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Brackenhurst Campus, Southwell NG25 0QF, Notts, England.",robert.davis@ntu.ac.uk,"Davis, Robert/ABE-3886-2020; Uzal, Antonio/N-3403-2013","Davis, Robert/0000-0002-9953-1340; Uzal, Antonio/0000-0001-6478-1895",Oklahoma Zoo; Idea Wild; Nottingham Trent University; Carnivore Research Malawi,Oklahoma Zoo; Idea Wild; Carnivore Research Malawi; Nottingham Trent University,,94,0,0,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In Little Chucky Creek, a tributary to the Nolichucky River in Tennessee, the severe population decline of Chucky Madtoms Noturus crypticus has been partially attributed to an increase in the abundance of cavity-dwelling crayfish after the establishment of two nonnative species. Although it has been suggested that the crayfish exclude the cavity-dwelling fish from shelter, we are not aware of studies that have been conducted to demonstrate that crayfish directly outcompete madtoms in this regard. Our objective was to experimentally test the hypothesis that shelter competition between crayfish and Mountain Madtoms Noturus eleutherus, a surrogate species for Chucky Madtoms, is a function of relative size. We conducted behavioral trials in which shelter was the limited resource for the two potential competitors. We recorded the madtoms' success at occupying the provided cover object for 5 d as well as health condition at the end of the competition phase. Both madtom occupancy and health condition were positively correlated with increasing relative size. As the size differential increased between madtoms and crayfish, madtoms were more successful at occupying the cover object, and overall condition was greater at the end of the trial. Conversely, when madtoms were smaller than crayfish, individuals were more commonly excluded from the cover object or even killed. Juvenile madtoms experienced 100% mortality. We concluded that crayfish exhibit a size-specific competitive advantage over Mountain Madtoms when shelter is limited, and that crayfishes may catalyze fish population declines at least partially through shelter exclusion and predation on juveniles.","[Harris, Meredith H.] Tennessee Aquarium Conservat Inst, 175 Baylor Sch Rd, Chattanooga, TN 37405 USA; [Womble, Kristin, I] Tennessee Technol Univ, Tennessee Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Box 5114, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Alford, J.

The relative body sizes of predators and prey may be an important determinant of interaction strengths. However, studies quantifying the combined influence of intra- and interspecific variation in predator-prey body size ratios are lacking. We use a comparative functional response approach to examine interaction strengths between three size classes of invasive bluegill and largemouth bass toward three scaled size classes of their tilapia prey. We then quantify the influence of intra- and interspecific predator-prey body mass ratios on the scaling of attack rates and handling times. Type II functional responses were displayed by both predators across all predator and prey size classes. Largemouth bass consumed more than bluegill at small and intermediate predator size classes, while large predators of both species were more similar. Small prey were most vulnerable overall; however, differential attack rates among prey were emergent across predator sizes. For both bluegill and largemouth bass, small predators exhibited higher attack rates toward small and intermediate prey sizes, while larger predators exhibited greater attack rates toward large prey. Conversely, handling times increased with prey size, with small bluegill exhibiting particularly low feeding rates toward medium-large prey types. Attack rates for both predators peaked unimodally at intermediate predator-prey body mass ratios, while handling times generally shortened across increasing body mass ratios. We thus demonstrate effects of body size ratios on predator-prey interaction strengths between key fish species, with attack rates and handling times dependent on the relative sizes of predator-prey participants. Considerations for intra- and interspecific body size ratio effects are critical for predicting the strengths of interactions within ecosystems and may drive differential ecological impacts among invasive species as size ratios shift.","[Cuthbert, Ross N.] Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, GEOMAR, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Cuthbert, Ross N.; Dick, Jaimie T.

Many studies have suggested that crop and grassland competition can be used for cost-effective sustainable weed control. However, effective weed management requires a precise knowledge of the effects of agronomic practices and there is a lack of quantitative indicators to compare and predict the success of weed control by competition. Here, we studied weed abundance dynamics over a 12-year period in crop-grassland rotations (rotation treatments consisted of maize, wheat and barley crops, alternating with temporary grassland maintained for three or six years in the rotation and fertilised with similar to 30 or similar to 230 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of nitrogen). In addition to classical statistical analysis of the different rotation treatments, we modelled weed abundance as a function of the crop and grassland competition, expressed here by biomasses harvested in the preceding years. We show that weed abundance decreases over the years in grassland and subsequent crops only if the grassland receives sufficient nitrogen fertiliser. Our model had a greater explanatory power than the rotation treatments. This model estimates a critical biomass level above which weeds are suppressed in subsequent years, and below which they tend to thrive. This critical biomass level was 24.3 and 4.7 tonnes ha(-1) of dry matter for crops and grassland, respectively, highlighting the greater competitiveness of grasslands than of crops. Several clear differences between weed functional groups emerged. This new modelling approach directly links the interannual dynamics of weed populations to current and previous biomass production levels. This approach facilitates the development of environment-friendly weed management strategies and paves the way for comparisons of the competitiveness against weeds of crops and grassland under various pedoclimatic conditions and agronomic practices.","[Schuster, Mauricio Z.; de Moraes, Anibal] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Crop Prod & Protect, 1540 Rua Funcionarios Rd, BR-80035060 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Gastal, Francois; Charrier, Xavier] INRA, UE1373, FERLUS, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Doisy, Diana; Mediene, Safia; Barbu, Corentin M.] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Agron, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France","Mediene, S (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Agron, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",safia.mediene@agroparistech.fr,"Schuster, Mauricio Z Zanovello/C-1410-2016; de Moraes, Anibal/G-7772-2014","Schuster, Mauricio Z Zanovello/0000-0001-7243-7648; Gastal, Francois/0000-0001-9191-5916; de Moraes, Anibal/0000-0001-7981-3941","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001]; National Research Infrastructure Agro-ecosystemes, Cycles Biogeochimique et Biodiversite (SOEREACBB)","This study was partly funded by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.

Within the carnivore guild, coexistence can be achieved through either spatial, temporal or dietary partitioning. The most effective method of avoiding competition may be spatial partitioning, as it removes the potential for negative interactions. The ways in which large carnivore species utilize and partition space in small, enclosed reserves in South Africa is currently poorly understood. This knowledge gap weakens our understanding of which mechanisms structure large carnivore communities in these systems. Thus, our aim was to use Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to investigate the spatial dynamics of large carnivores [four lions ( Panthera leo), three leopards (Panthera pardus) and three spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta)] on a small, enclosed reserve (Selati Game Reserve). Regarding home ranges, lions had considerable overlap among themselves (especially the females), leopards had minimal overlap, while spotted hyaenas had no home range overlap. Although we found no evidence for spatial partitioning amongst the collared large carnivores, differences in the habitat use patterns of the three large carnivore species is evident. The high prey abundance of Selati, carnivore predation strategies, behavioural adaptations and ecological separation could be facilitating the coexistence of lions, spotted hyaenas and leopards in Selati. We encourage future research to be aimed at investigating the interactions ofmultiple sympatric carnivores in an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap on which mechanisms structure carnivore communities.","[Comley, Jessica; Mgqatsa, Nokubonga; Parker, Dan M.] Rhodes Univ, Wildlife & Reserve Management Res Grp, Dept Zool & Entomol, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Joubert, Christoffel J.] Selati Game Reserve, ZA-0895 Gravelotte, South Africa; [Parker, Dan M.] Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Private Bag X11283, ZA-1200 Nelspruit, South Africa","Comley, J (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Wildlife & Reserve Management Res Grp, Dept Zool & Entomol, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",jessiecomley44@gmail.com,,,Rhodes University; Rufford Foundation; National Research Foundation (NRF); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We thank Selati Game Reserve for allowing us to conduct research on their reserve and for providing logistical support.

In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the taxonomic differentiation between taxa coincides with ecophysiological differentiation. With this aim, we tested for differences between both morphotypes in functional traits related to competitive ability and resource-use efficiency. Assuming that the complex hybrid C. aff. acinaciformis is more vigorous, depends more strongly on vegetative reproduction, and invests less in sexual reproduction than C. edulis, we predicted that the hybrid would show higher competitive ability and better physiological performance compared with the species. Methods We used a comparative ecophysiological approach to assess the extent to which two Carpobrotus morphotypes coexisting in northwestern Spain differ in physiological, reproductive, and growth traits when competing under different soil nutrients in controlled greenhouse conditions. Results C. aff. acinaciformis had a greater relative growth rate and water-use and photochemical efficiencies compared to C. edulis. However, C. edulis appeared to be more responsive to incremental change in soil nutrients than C. aff. acinaciformis. They also differed in the amount of resources invested in reproduction.

Here, we used a simulation model to assess whether the isolation-related predictions of the GDM may arise from low-level process at the level of individuals and populations. Location Hypothetical volcanic oceanic islands. Methods Our model considers (a) an idealized island ontogeny, (b) metabolic constraints and (c) stochastic, spatially explicit and niche-based processes at the level of individuals and populations (plant demography, dispersal, competition, mutation and speciation). Isolation scenarios involved varying the distance to mainland and the dispersal ability of the species pool. Results For all isolation scenarios, we obtained humped temporal trends for species richness, endemic richness, proportion of endemic species derived from within-island radiation, number of radiating lineages, number of species per radiating lineage and biogeographical rates. The proportion of endemics derived from mainland-island differentiation and of all endemics steadily increased over time. Extinction rates of endemic species peaked later than for non-endemic species. Species richness and the number of endemics derived from mainland-island differentiation decreased with isolation as did rates of colonization, mainland-island differentiation and extinction. The proportion of all endemics and of radiated endemics, the number of radiated endemics, of radiating lineages, and of species per radiating lineage and the within-island radiation rate all increased with isolation. Main conclusions Our results lend strong support to most of the isolation-related GDM predictions. New insights include an increasing proportion of endemics, particularly those arising from mainland-island differentiation, across isolation scenarios, as well as extinction trends of endemics differing from the overall extinction rates, with a much later peak. These results demonstrate how simulation models focusing on low ecological levels provide tools to assess biogeographical-scale predictions and to develop more detailed predictions for further empirical tests.","[Cabral, Juliano Sarmento] Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Computat & Theoret Biol, Ecosyst Modeling, Hubland Nord 32, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Cabral, Juliano Sarmento; Kreft, Holger] Univ Gottingen, Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany; [Cabral, Juliano Sarmento] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Synth Ctr, Leipzig, Germany; [Whittaker, Robert J.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Conservat Biogeog & Macroecol Grp, Oxford, England; [Whittaker, Robert J.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Wiegand, Kerstin] Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, Ecosyst Modelling, Gottingen, Germany","Cabral, JS (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Computat & Theoret Biol, Ecosyst Modeling, Hubland Nord 32, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",juliano.sarmento_cabral@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Kreft, Holger/A-4736-2008; Kreft, Holger/AAY-7573-2020; Whittaker, Robert/H-1548-2015; Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/K-3973-2012","Kreft, Holger/0000-0003-4471-8236; Kreft, Holger/0000-0003-4471-8236; Whittaker, Robert/0000-0001-7775-3383; Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/0000-0002-0116-220X; Wiegand, Kerstin/0000-0003-4854-0607","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FZT 118, SA 2133/11]; Ministry of Science and Culture of the State of Lower Saxony; Synthesis Centre of iDiv [DFG FZT 118]; State of Lower SaxonyEuropean Commission","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: FZT 118 and SA 2133/11; Ministry of Science and Culture of the State of Lower Saxony, Grant/Award Number: Cluster of Excellence Functional Biodiversity Research; Synthesis Centre of iDiv, Grant/Award Number: DFG FZT 118; State of Lower Saxony",,66,14,15,4,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Beyond killing, predators have nonlethal effects on their potential prey. Because aphids are highly aggregated, their predators aggregate as well, creating conditions optimal for nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) among competing larvae. Although intraguild predator (IGP) density can alter the balance between conflicting forces, little is known about its effect on competing prey. 2. A partitioned Petri-dish that permitted the passage of signals was used to examine the NCEs between competing stages of similar- or different-sized, conspecific or heterospecific, individuals, on development, survival and reproduction of competing prey. 3. Coccinella undecimpunctata L. larvae suffered developmental and reproductive costs resulting from the presence of conspecific and heterospecific larvae, but showed no impact on their survival. In contrast, larvae of Chrysoperla carnea Stephens and Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) gained developmental benefits, without reproductive costs. Faster development can be construed as adaptive, as it reduces immature mortality. 4. Interestingly, threat-sensitive prey responses appear to be species-specific, regardless of predator density. In a C. carnea larva-H. variegata adult competing system, larvae responded to the threat posed by heterospecific adults, with accelerated development, but suffered reproductive costs. In a C. carnea larva-C. undecimpunctata adult system, no overall development costs in response to heterospecific adults were evident. The only cost was on survival at higher IGP density. Thus, the phenotype induced under H. variegata stress was adaptive for development in aphid colonies, whereas that under C. undecimpunctata stress was not. 5. NCEs are not simple vertical forces affecting prey, but can affect guilds on the same trophic level. Co-release of more than one species and density of these species may adversely increase the aphid populations.","[Bayoumy, Mohamed H.; Fathy, Dina M.] Mansoura Univ, Econ Entomol Dept, Fac Agr, Mansoura, Egypt; [Awadalla, Hagar S.] Damitta Univ, Econ Entomol Dept, Fac Agr, Damitta, Egypt; [Majerus, Tamsin M.

The effectiveness of behavioral thermoregulation in maintaining ectotherm body temperatures within the target range is influenced not only by environmental (operative) temperatures but also by the presence of other con- and heterospecific individuals. How species' interactions affect behavioral thermoregulation is largely unknown. Theory predicts that species' interactions could affect the plasticity of behavioral thermoregulation in two ways, i.e., by developmental plasticity of a preferred temperature range or by an acute shift in body temperatures. Empirical tests of these predictions are scarce. We examined the developmental and acute effects of heterospecific social interactions on the accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation in the larvae of two competing species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. The presence of heterospecifics during larval development had no effect on preferred body temperatures but it modified later acute thermoregulatory responses to heterospecifics. Ichthyosaura alpestris larvae from heterospecific tanks increased their thermoregulatory accuracy and effectiveness, while L. vulgaris larvae from conspecific tanks relaxed their thermoregulatory efforts. The thermal dependence of somatic growth suggests that modified behavioral thermoregulation has the potential to accelerate growth in competitively dominant I. alpestris. Acute thermoregulatory responses are affected by heterospecific social interactions in newt larvae, but not conspecific. A developmental plastic response modified body temperatures not the target thermoregulatory range, which shows that the influence of heterospecific social interactions is more complex than predicted by theory. Species interactions complicate estimating an ectotherm's vulnerability to ongoing climate change. Significance statement Many ectothermic animals control their body temperature through behavioral thermoregulation. Their thermoregulatory decisions are influenced not only by environmental temperatures, but also by the presence of other species. We show that the current thermoregulatory effort in interacting newt larvae is affected by previous experience with competing species. The influence of heterospecific social interactions is more complex than predicted by theory, which complicates estimating an ectotherm's vulnerability to ongoing climate change.","[Winterova, Barbora] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 267-2, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Gvozdik, Lumir] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, Brno 60365, Czech Republic","Gvozdik, L (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, Brno 60365, Czech Republic.",gvozdik@brno.cas.cz,"Gvozdik, Lumir/G-1178-2014","Gvozdik, Lumir/0000-0002-6495-2233","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-07140S, 17-15480S]; Institute of Vertebrate Biology AS CRCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO: 68081766]",This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (grant numbers 15-07140S and 17-15480S to LG) and the Institute of Vertebrate Biology AS CR (RVO: 68081766 to LG).,,62,2,2,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

In the sciences of population biology, however, the laboratory is often seen as a poor approximation of what occurs in nature. Results obtained in the field are usually more convincing. This raises special problems: it is much more difficult to obtain stable, repeatable results in the field, where environmental conditions vary out of the experimenter's control, than in the laboratory. We examine here how this problem affected an influential experimental research tradition in community ecology, the study of the ecology of the rocky seashores. In the 1960s, a handful of North-American ecologists, most notably Joseph Connell, Robert Paine and Paul Dayton, made the rocky seashores a model study system for experimenting in the field. Their experiments were deceptively simple: they removed species living on the seashore and described the resulting effects on the local ecology. These experiments exerted a deep influence on community ecology. They provided evidence for speculative developments concerning the theory of interspecific competition, the factors responsible for species richness and the ecology of food webs. They also stimulated novel conceptual developments. In particular, Paine developed the predation hypothesis, which states that the presence of predators can favour species richness, before introducing the keystone species concept, according to which some species exert disproportionate effects on ecological systems. More broadly, these experiments gave support to a methodological trend in favour of field experimentation. Only controlled perturbations in the field, it seemed, provided a reliable method to get insights into the structure of ecological communities. However, as experiments were continued in time and repeated in different sites, divergent results appeared. We analyse here how intertidal researchers coped with the variability of environmental conditions and tried to stabilize their results. In the process, they reconsidered not only their early conclusions, but also the exclusive status given to field experiments. Expanding on this case study, we discuss some significant differences between laboratory and field experiments.","[Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste; Porto, Franco; El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFHBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cambridge, England; [Porto, Franco; El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Natl Inst Sci & Technol Interdisciplinary & Trans, Salvador, BA, Brazil","Grodwohl, JB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFHBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil.; Grodwohl, JB (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cambridge, England.",jb.grodwohl@gmail.com,"El-Hani, Charbel/Q-1364-2019","grodwohl, jean-baptiste/0000-0003-1445-8277",,,,61,2,2,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0391-9714,1742-6316,,HIST PHIL LIFE SCI,Hist.

In most systems, several parasitoid species can parasitize the same pest. The coexistence of parasitoids in agroecosystems and their efficacy as biological control agents may be disrupted by global warming. An increase of approximately 3 degrees C is predicted by the end of the twenty-first century in the Mediterranean basin (IPCC, 2014). In this context, we compared the present and future performance of two sympatric parasitoids of the genus Aphytis (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), which control the armoured scale Aonidiella aurantii (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) in Mediterranean citrus, either alone or in combination. The net reproductive rate (R0) of the introduced Aphytis melinus DeBach was higher than that of its competitor, the native Aphytis chrysomphali (Mercer), under current conditions. The two parasitoids responded differently to higher temperature and competition. The R0 of A. chrysomphali decreased by 50% when both parasitoids competed in the same patch, but was not affected by the temperature increase. The R0 of A. melinus decreased approximately 46% with the increase in temperature because the proportion of females was reduced. However, the presence of A. chrysomphali competing in the same patch mitigated the negative effect of the increase in temperature on A. melinus (R0 decreased by only 16%). Overall, our results suggest that global warming will have a negative effect on the biological control of A. aurantii and that this effect will be higher in areas, such as southern Spain, where A. melinus has displaced A. chrysomphali.","[Cebolla, Ruth; Urbaneja, Alberto; Tena, Alejandro] IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal, Unidad Asociada Entomol, UJI, Carretera CV 315,Km 10 7, Valencia 46113, Spain; [van Baaren, Joan] Univ Rennes, UNIR, UMR CNRS ECOBIO 6553, Av Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France","Tena, A (corresponding author), IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Carretera Moncada Naquera Km 4-5, Valencia 46113, Spain.",atena@ivia.es,"Cebolla, Ruth/AAB-2243-2019; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/AAW-6198-2020; Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011","Cebolla, Ruth/0000-0003-0610-8672; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/0000-0001-5986-3685; Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685; van baaren, joan/0000-0002-8552-9645",Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [AGL2011-30538-C03-02]; INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA); IVIA,The authors would like to thank P.

Many coastal marine ecosystems, including estuaries and coral reefs, have experienced increased nutrient subsidies while concurrently shifting to macroalgal dominance; however, the role of subsidy regime in transitions remains unknown. We created concentration-frequency distributions of nutrients in Cook's Bay, Moorea, French Polynesia, and Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve, CA, USA. Both showed relatively high pulses interspersed by press concentrations. We grew dominant macroalgae alone and together in microcosms approximating these subsidy regimes to quantify individual performance and competitive outcomes. Subsidy regime changed growth and competitive abilities of macroalgae from both ecosystems but with divergent effects. In nutrient-limited reefs, different species were favoured under each enrichment regime, suggesting a fluctuating nutrient environment enhances diversity. In contrast, in eutrophic estuaries, enrichment of both regimes facilitated a single competitive dominant, suppressing diversity. Functional form groups did not predict responses to subsidy regime, likely because classifications ignore temporal variability in resource supplies. Because climate change will alter rainfall patterns globally, further accelerating nutrient subsidies from land to sea, understanding species' responses to nutrient subsidy regimes is key to predicting the fate of coastal communities.","[Fong, Caitlin R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, 552 Univ Rd, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Fong, Peggy] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Fong, CR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, 552 Univ Rd, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",cat.fong@lifesci.ucsb.edu; pfong@biology.ucla.edu,,,,,,51,11,11,1,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,MAR,2018,41,2,,,,,421,429,,10.1007/s12237-017-0291-5,,,9,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,FU1AJ,WOS:000423581200007,,,,,2021-09-21,

For birds, in which maternal effects are best studied, it has been claimed that exposure to increased competition causes greater deposition of testosterone into egg yolks, which creates faster growing, more aggressive offspring; such traits are thought to be beneficial for high-competition environments. Nevertheless, not all species show a positive relationship between competitive interactions and yolk testosterone, and an explanation for this interspecific variation is lacking. We here test if the magnitude and direction of maternal testosterone allocated to eggs in response to competition can be explained by life-history traits while accounting for phylogenetic relationships. We performed a meta-analysis relating effect size of yolk testosterone response to competition with species coloniality, nest type, parental effort and mating type. We found that effect size was moderated by coloniality and nest type; colonial species and those with open nests allocate less testosterone to eggs when in more competitive environments. Applying a life-history perspective helps contextualize studies showing little or negative responses of yolk testosterone to competition and improves our understanding of how variation in this maternal effect may have evolved.","[Bentz, Alexandra B.; Navara, Kristen J.] Univ Georgia, Dept Poultry Sci, 203 Poultry Sci Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Becker, Daniel J.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Bentz, AB (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Poultry Sci, 203 Poultry Sci Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",abbentz@uga.edu,"Becker, Daniel/A-6466-2014","Becker, Daniel/0000-0003-4315-8628; Bentz, Alexandra/0000-0003-2445-4886",National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipsNational Science Foundation (NSF),A.B.B. and D.J.B. were supported by National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships.,,126,20,20,0,17,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

Throughout Caribbean reefs, fairy basslets Gramma loreto and blackcap basslets G. melacara are segregated by depth with a narrow zone of overlap. Local populations of these planktivores are found under isolated reef ledges, where fairy basslets compete with conspecifics for access to prime feeding positions at the outer edges. I investigated the existence, mechanisms, and effects of interspecific competition on the local distribution and demography of basslets. I documented aggression and feeding rates of both species and conducted a reciprocal removal experiment comparing the re sponse of each basslet in competitor-removal versus unmanipulated populations of both species. Positioning of both basslets under ledges was consistent with an overall size hierarchy, with larger fish progressively closer to the outer edges of ledges. Fairy basslets were more aggressive, yet competition had symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species. Interference between species drove juveniles further back under ledges, where feeding and growth rates of individuals were reduced. Competition had no effect on the density of basslets during this 8 wk experiment. Aggression occurred between larger basslets, but with no consequential effects on any parameters measured. This study demonstrates sym metrical effects of interspecific competition on juvenile coral-reef fishes, a phenomenon that has rarely been documented previously.","[Kindinger, Tye L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",kindingt@science.oregonstate.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This study was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants to M.

However, some predator-prey relationships may still remain undetected, due to the difficulty of observing rare predation events. We report the first observation of predation of arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) pups by common ravens (Corvus corax). The predation event was witnessed on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, through an automatic camera placed on a den. On June 8, 2013, the day following pup emergence from the den, the complete litter of four was killed and taken away by a pair of ravens despite the intermittent presence of the mother. This event lasted 2.5 h, occurred during a low lemming year, and resulted in the fox pair failing their reproduction. Only two other fox litters were present that summer in our 600 km(2) study area, so this litter predated by ravens accounted for 25 % (4/16) of the pups produced. Our report shows how continuous monitoring of dens using automatic cameras can allow documentation of rare events. In addition to food competition and cache raiding, pup predation contributes to the antagonistic interactions between arctic foxes and ravens in the High Arctic, which may intensify during low lemming years. This observation allows a better understanding of species interactions within the Arctic predator guild.","[Chevallier, Clement; Lai, Sandra; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Ctr Northern Studies, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Chevallier, Clement; Lai, Sandra; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada","Chevallier, C; Berteaux, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Ctr Northern Studies, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.; Chevallier, C; Berteaux, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Northern Biodivers, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",chevallier.clement@gmail.com; dominique_berteaux@uqar.ca,"Lai, Sandra/AAL-5346-2021","Lai, Sandra/0000-0003-0128-3738; Chevallier, Clement/0000-0002-0956-5978",Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies (FRQNT); Kenneth M Molson Foundation; Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada ArcticNet; Northern Ecosystem Initiative (Environment Canada); Northern Scientific Training Program (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada); NSERC CREATE training program in northern environmental sciences EnviroNorth; Nunavut Wildlife Management Board; Parks Canada Agency; Polar Continental Shelf Program (Natural Resources Canada)Natural Resources Canada,"We thank the many field workers who collected data on Bylot Island.

Bicknell's Thrush populations are predicted to shift upslope in response to global warming, leading to local extinctions on mountains that lack the elevational extent to accommodate such shifts. However, biotic interactions may influence how montane species respond to changing abiotic conditions. In territorial songbirds, for example, aggression from dominant low-elevation species has been hypothesized to combine with warming temperatures to push'' populations of subordinate montane species upslope at a faster rate than in the absence of interspecific aggression. This push'' hypothesis could apply to Bicknell's Thrushes: the related Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) inhabits lower elevations, Bicknell's Thrushes are largely confined to mountaintops, and interspecific aggression by Swainson's Thrushes toward Bicknell's Thrushes has been anecdotally reported. We used reciprocal playback experiments to test whether patterns of interspecific aggression in Swainson's and Bicknell's thrushes along an elevational gradient in the Adirondack Mountains were consistent with the push'' hypothesis. We found weak asymmetrical interspecific aggression: Some Swainson's Thrush individuals at high elevations where the 2 species co-occurred responded aggressively to Bicknell's Thrush playback, and Bicknell's Thrushes did not respond aggressively to Swainson's Thrush playback. While Swainson's and Bicknell's thrushes appeared to regularly occupy overlapping home ranges, asymmetrical interspecific aggression from a lower-elevation species is consistent with the push'' hypothesis and suggests that interspecific aggression from Swainson's Thrushes may be a factor limiting Bicknell's Thrush populations in the Adirondack Mountains. More broadly, this case example supports the recent call to incorporate biotic interactions in models that predict montane species' responses to climate change.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.; Montgomery, Graham] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA","Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA.; Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA.",bgf27@cornell.edu,"Montgomery, Graham/X-6293-2019","Montgomery, Graham/0000-0002-8217-8800",Kieckhefer Adirondack Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [2011083591],"A Kieckhefer Adirondack Fellowship to B.G.F. supported this research.

Yet, the determinants of parasite composition in natural communities are still obscure. In particular, three fundamental questions remain open: (1) what are the relative roles of host and environmental characteristics compared with direct interactions between parasites in determining the community composition of parasites? (2) do these determinants affect parasites belonging to the same guild and those belonging to different guilds in similar manners? and (3) can cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses work interchangeably in detecting community determinants? Our study was designed to answer these three questions in a natural community of rodents and their fleas, ticks, and two vector-borne bacteria. Methods: We sampled a natural population of Gerbillus andersoni rodents and their blood-associated parasites on two occasions. By combining path analysis and model selection approaches, we then explored multiple direct and indirect paths that connect (i) the environmental and host-related characteristics to the infection probability of a host by each of the four parasite species, and (ii) the infection probabilities of the four species by each other. Results: Our results suggest that the majority of paths shaping the blood-associated communities are indirect, mostly determined by host characteristics and not by interspecific interactions or environmental conditions. The exact effects of host characteristics on infection probability by a given parasite depend on its life history and on the method of sampling, in which the cross-sectional and longitudinal methods are complementary. Conclusions: Despite the awareness of the need of ecological investigations into natural host-vector-parasite communities in light of the emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne diseases, we lack sampling methods that are both practical and reliable. Here we illustrated how comprehensive patterns can be revealed from observational data by applying path analysis and model selection approaches and combining cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. By employing this combined approach on blood-associated parasites, we were able to distinguish between direct and indirect effects and to predict the causal relationships between host-related characteristics and the parasite composition over time and space. We concluded that direct interactions within the community play only a minor role in determining community composition relative to host characteristics and the life history of the community members.","[Cohen, Carmit; Einav, Monica; Hawlena, Hadas] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Hawlena, Hadas] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Hawlena, H (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",hadashaw@bgu.ac.il,"Hawlena, Hadas/F-1669-2012","Hawlena, Hadas/0000-0002-0634-2920",Marie Curie Career Integration Grant (CIG) [FP7-293713],"We thank D.

We test existing hypotheses regarding the evolutionary significance of cavity nesting in the Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae). We used a multi-locus phylogeny of 252 species to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cavity nesting and to quantify correlations between nest types and life history traits. Within a phylogenetic generalized linear model framework, we found that cavity-nesting species are larger than open-nesting species and that maximum clutch sizes are larger in cavity-nesting lineages. In addition to differences in life history traits between nest types, species that breed at higher latitudes have larger average and maximum clutch sizes and begin to breed later in the year. Gains and losses of migratory behaviour have occurred far more often in cavity-nesting lineages than in open-nesting taxa, suggesting that cavity nesting may have played a crucial role in the evolution of migratory behaviour. These findings identify important macro-evolutionary links between the evolution of cavity nesting, clutch size, interspecific competition and migratory behaviour in a large clade of Old World songbirds.","[Barve, Sahas; Mason, Nicholas A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Barve, Sahas; Mason, Nicholas A.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Fuller Evolutionary Biol Program, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Barve, S (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ssb235@cornell.edu,,,,,,71,7,7,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,APR,2015,157,2,,,,,299,311,,10.1111/ibi.12233,,,13,Ornithology,Zoology,CE1XB,WOS:000351605100008,,,,,2021-09-21,

It has been suggested that C. septempunctata negatively impacted C. novemnotata through a combination of mechanisms. We investigated the effects of scramble competition and intraguild predation between groups of C. septempunctata and C. novemnotata. A novel aspect of these experiments for this species combination was that we provided beetles the option to cannibalize conspecifics or predate on heterospecifics (i.e. intraguild predation); thus, we were able to compare interspecific versus intraspecific competition. Increasing prey density resulted in significantly lower rates of intraguild predation on C. novemnotata by C. septempunctata. Percentage survival of C. novemnotata grouped with C. septempunctata at low and high aphid densities was 6 and 61%, respectively. For our second study, we increased the spatial complexity and volume of the assay system, and provided prey ad libitum. C. novemnotata survival from first-instar to adult was significantly lower than C. septempunctata survival when grouped heterospecifically (43 vs 61% survival, respectively). Finally, we conducted a study to determine if hungry larvae discriminate conspecific versus heterospecific larvae by testing whether they predated selectively on the basis of species, which they did not appear to do. We conclude that C. novemnotata larvae suffer greater rates of intraguild predation from C. septempunctata compared with cannibalism, that this difference appears to be due to size asymmetry between the two species, and that local conditions impact the severity of intraguild predation by C. septempunctata.","[Tumminello, Giuseppe; Ugine, Todd A.; Losey, John E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Tumminello, G (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",gt95@cornell.edu,,,Informal Science Education Program of the National Science Foundation [DRL-0741738],"We would like to thank the Lost Ladybug Project for helping us to collect lady beetles to start our colonies.

Furthermore, the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping diel activity patterns of animals is poorly understood. We conducted controlled experiments in a little-studied area (Hulunbuir meadow steppe, China) to explore the effects of presence of a larger species, Spermophilus dauricus, and ambient temperature in shaping diel activity patterns of Microtus gregalis. Our results suggest that although interference competition existed between S. dauricus and M. gregalis, the presence of S. dauricus did not significantly affect the diel activity patterns of M. gregalis (P > 0.05). Timing of activity of M. gregalis, however, was always significantly correlated with ambient temperature (P < 0.001). As winter approached, ambient temperature appeared to be a major factor in shaping activity patterns of M. gregalis.

Real-time PCR assay was successfully applied to model the growth of the L.monocytogenes and Lactobacillus respectively on VPCP. The Jameson effect was occurred between Lmonocytogenes and Lactobacillus when they co-existed in the same culture, and Lactobacillus clearly induced an early stationary phase of L. monocytogenes. The Jameson-effect model could be used to fit the growth curves of L monocytogenes and Lactobacillus on VPCP. Thus the modified Lotka-Volterra competition model could be used to evaluate the interaction of two bacterial populations during the growth process, and found that the influence from Lactobacillus on L. monocytogenes was much higher than L monocytogenes on Lactobacillus through the interaction coefficients. In conclusion, bacterial interactions need to be considered in microbial predictive models, which will provide a more practical assessment in predictive microbiology, and the model for the prediction based on the Real-time PCR assay can be used in future studies, especially for research of interaction models.

In this study, differences in morphological plasticity were investigated using young-of-year pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) from native North American and non-native European populations. Two Canadian populations, isolated from bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus) since the last glaciation, and two Spanish populations, isolated from bluegill since their introduction in Europe, were reared in a common environment using artificial enclosures. Fish were subjected to allopatric (without bluegill) or sympatric (with bluegill) conditions, and differences in plasticity were tested through a MANOVA of discriminant function scores. All pumpkinseed populations exhibited dietary shifts towards more benthivorous prey when held with bluegill. Differences between North American and European populations were observed in body dimensions, gill raker length and pelvic fin position. Sympatric treatments induced an increase in body width and a decrease in caudal peduncle length in native fish; non-native fish exhibited longer caudal peduncle lengths when held in sympatry with bluegill. Overall, phenotypic plasticity influenced morphological divergence less than genetic factors, regardless of population. Contrary to predictions, pumpkinseeds from Europe exhibited lower levels of phenotypic plasticity than Canadian populations, suggesting that European pumpkinseeds are more canalized than their North American counterparts.","[Yavno, Stan; Rooke, Anna C.] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Fox, Michael G.] Trent Univ, Environm & Resources Studies Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Fox, Michael G.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada","Yavno, S (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.",stanyavno@trentu.ca,"Yavno, Stan/C-4051-2008; Rooke, Anna/AAN-8486-2020","Yavno, Stan/0000-0002-4079-0647; Rooke, Anna/0000-0001-7258-9094","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities in the form of Ontario Graduate Scholarships","We thank C.

Location Mediterranean palaeo-islands. Methods We assembled data on temporal variation in body size of palaeo-insular mammals and associated variation in ecological characteristics (colonization or extirpation of mammalian competitors and predators) for 19 species of fossil, non-volant mammals across four large (>3640km(2)) islands ranging between the late Miocene and Holocene. These are the only fossil species for which fine-detailed time series are available at present. Results Our results are consistent with predictions based on an ecological interactions hypothesis of body size evolution. Following colonization (or first appearance in the insular fossil record) small mammals (such as mice, shrews and pikas) tended to increase in body size. These trends, however, ceased or were reversed following colonization of the focal islands by mammalian predators or competitors. Main conclusions While body size evolution is likely to be influenced by a variety of characteristics of the focal islands (e.g. climate, area, isolation and habitat diversity) and species (e.g. diet, resource requirements and dispersal abilities), temporal trends for palaeo-insular mammals indicated that the observed trends for any particular species, island and climatic regime may be strongly influenced by interactions among species. Ultimately, invasion of a competitor often leads to the extinction of the native, insular species.","[van der Geer, Alexandra A.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Geol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Lyras, Georgios A.] Univ Athens, Dept Geol & Geoenvironm, Zografos 15784, Greece; [Lomolino, Mark V.] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Palombo, Maria Rita] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Palombo, Maria Rita] CNR, Ist Geol Ambientale & Geoingn, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Sax, Dov F.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","van der Geer, AA (corresponding author), Nat Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",alexandra.vandergeer@naturalis.nl,"van der Geer, Alexandra/K-9851-2013; Lyras, George/AAA-3908-2020","van der Geer, Alexandra/0000-0002-9588-4739; Palombo, Maria Rita/0000-0002-2104-2176; Lyras, George/0000-0002-4337-6708","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1028470, 1028145]","We are grateful to Chiara Angelone, Tassos Kotsakis, Lorenzo Rook, John de Vos, Lars van den Hoek Ostende, Bas van der Geer and the late David Mayhew for their valuable comments and advice, and to Serge Legendre and Philip Gingerich for their help with the literature.

Arctic foxes have been fully protected in Fennoscandia following their drastic decline in the early 19th century, and their lack of recovery has been hypothesized to result from increased interspecific competition with red foxes that have colonized the arctic fox's range and/or changes in prey dynamics due to increased variation in climatic conditions. We used a large-scale spatiotemporal study combined with an extensive red fox removal intervention to test these two hypotheses by evaluating the relative importance of diverse environmental factors affecting the recolonization of arctic foxes in Northern Norway. Arctic foxes were never observed at sites where just a few daily observations of red foxes were recorded, and the probability of recolonization was zero at sites where no red fox was removed. The probability of recolonization increased when lemming abundance was very high, but the relative importance of this variable was half that of red foxes. Thus, our results lend support to both hypotheses, but they clearly highlight the presence of red foxes as the factor most limiting arctic fox recolonization in this part of its distribution. As the abundance of arctic foxes has remained extremely low even after more than 70 years of full protection, direct conservation actions seem to be needed to promote the recovery of arctic fox populations. Our research therefore highlights that conservation actions targeting a major reduction in red fox numbers are needed because the competitive interaction with red foxes is the most important factor limiting recolonization of this species.

We have studied the seasonal expression of these two interaction types within a two-species, boreal small mammal system. Seasons differ by resource availability, individual breeding state and intraspecific social system. Live-trapping methods were used to monitor space use and reproduction in 14 experimental populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in large outdoor enclosures with and without a dominant competitor, the field vole Microtus agrestis. We further compared vole behaviour using staged dyadic encounters in neutral arenas in both seasons. Survival of the non-breeding overwintering bank voles was not affected by competition. In the spring, the numbers of male bank voles, but not of females, were reduced significantly in the competition populations. Bank vole home ranges expanded with vole density in the presence of competitors, indicating food limitation. A comparison of behaviour between seasons based on an analysis of similarity revealed an avoidance of costly aggression against opponents, independent of species. Interactions were more aggressive during the summer than during the winter, and heterospecific encounters were more aggressive than conspecific encounters. Based on these results, we suggest that interaction types and their respective mechanisms are not either-or categories and may change over the seasons. During the winter, energy constraints and thermoregulatory needs decrease direct aggression, but food constraints increase indirect resource competition. Direct interference appears in the summer, probably triggered by each individual's reproductive and hormonal state and the defence of offspring against conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Both interaction forms overlap in the spring, possibly contributing to spring declines in the numbers of subordinate species.","[Eccard, Jana A.] Univ Potsdam, Unit Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Fey, Karen] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Caspers, Barbara A.] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Behav Biol, Res Grp Mol Ecol & Behav, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Unit Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",eccard@uni-potsdam.de,"Caspers, Barbara/C-5573-2011","Caspers, Barbara/0000-0002-4380-0476",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank the staff of the Konnevesi Research Station for maintaining the facilities and caring for animals, as well as researchers and field helpers.

Here we provided a formal experimental test of the hypothesis using pairs of bacterivorous protist species in a multigenerational experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis, both the frequency and tempo of competitive exclusion, and the reduction in the abundance of inferior competitors, increased with increasing phylogenetic relatedness of the competing species. These results were linked to protist mouth size, a trait potentially related to resource use, exhibiting a significant phylogenetic signal. The likelihood of coexistence, however, was better predicted by phylogenetic relatedness than trait similarity of the competing species.

As predatory effectiveness is influenced by the presence of other dominant ant species, understanding the ecological factors at work in agroecosystems lies at the basis of conservation biological control. Over three and a half years, the effect of ground vegetation management on the beneficial tree-nesting ant Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille) and its competitor, the ground-nesting ant, Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius), was studied in a citrus orchard in Tanzania. When ground vegetation was present, P megacephala tolerated O. longinoda and to some extent cohabited with this ant in citrus trees. However, after clean cultivation, P. megacephala displaced O. longinoda from tree crowns and became the sole occupant of the majority of trees. Displacement could be reversed by reversing the weed management regime, but this took time. Two years after the establishment of ground vegetation about half of the trees were colonized by Oecophylla only. Maintaining ground vegetation in tree crop plantations benefits the establishment and abundance of Oecophylla over Pheidole and is recommended in order to improve the efficiency of biological control of tree pests. The use of Amdro ant bait (hydramethylnon) to control P. megacephala is discussed. Boosting agroecological innovations, such as the one described in this paper, could benefit smallholder producers.

The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a damaging pest and tospovirus vector that has invaded most of the world, and competitive superiority is considered one of the main reasons for this species' success. 3. However, a recent study demonstrated that competition between larval F. occidentalis and a native thrips species may be limiting F. occidentalis abundance in much of the eastern United States. Frankliniella occidentalis also has a limited abundance in central and southern Florida, which is dominated by the endemic F. bispinosa (Morgan). The potential for interspecific competition to limit F. occidentalis abundance in Florida was assessed. 4. The effects of competition between F. occidentalis and F. bispinosa on adult reproduction on a common host (Capsicum annuum L.) were quantified, using a response surface experimental design and a combination of linear and non-linear competition models. 5. Evidence of symmetric competition between these thrips species was found, but contrary to expectations, F. occidentalis reproduced more in dense interspecific populations than F. bispinosa. These results suggest that, unlike most of the eastern US, interspecific competition is not important in limiting F. occidentalis abundance in central and southern Florida.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Funderburk, Joe E.] Univ Florida, N Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Quincy, FL USA; [Paini, Dean R.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Acton Act, Australia; [Reitz, Stuart R.] USDA ARS CMAVE, Tallahassee, FL USA","Northfield, TD (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99163 USA.",tnorthfield@wsu.edu,"Paini, Dean R/C-2341-2009; Reitz, Stuart/B-7667-2008; Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019; Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X",University of FloridaUniversity of Florida; USDA-ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service,"Brian Inouye and Ben Bolker assisted greatly with R code.

The larval stages of both species encyst within the tissue of the bivalve's muscular foot, with a preference for the tip of the foot. As more individuals accumulate at that site, they impair the burrowing behaviour of cockles and increase the probability of the parasites' transmission to a bird definitive host. However, individuals at the foot tip are also vulnerable to non-host predators in the form of foot-cropping fish which selectively bite off the foot tip of exposed cockles. Parasites encysted at the foot base are safe from such predators although they do not contribute to altering host behaviour, but nevertheless benefit from host manipulation as all parasites within the cockle are transmitted if it is ingested by a bird. Experimental infection revealed that Acanthoparyphium sp. and C. australis have different encystment patterns within the host, with proportionally fewer Acanthoparyphium metacercariae encysting at the foot tip than C attstralis. This indicates that Acanthoparyphium may benefit indirectly from C. australis and incur a lower risk of non-host predation. However, in co-infections, not only did C australis have higher infectivity than Acanthoparyphium, it also severely affected the latter's infection success. The asymmetrical strategies and interactions between the two species suggest that the advantages obtained from exploiting the host manipulation efforts of another parasite might be offset by traits such as reduced competitiveness in co-infections.

Until now, the existence of competition (including predation) between these groups has not been tested. To assess the coexistence and potential role of interspecific interactions between surface Gammarus fossarum and subterranean Niphargus timavi, and to determine their micro distributions, we conducted a series of field and laboratory observations. We aimed to determine: (1) species substrate preference, (2) whether the presence of G. fossarum influences the habitat choice of N. timavi, and (3) possible predation effects on micro habitat choice of small juveniles. Throughout a small river in SW Slovenia, N. timavi was predominantly found in leaf litter and gravel, but rarely in sand. In the sand however, we exclusively found juveniles. In contrast, surface G. fossarum sheltered mainly in leaf litter. A similar, body size dependent, micro distribution was observed in G. fossarum, where small individuals were generally found in gravel and sand. The presence of G. fossarum affected the micro distribution of juvenile, but not adult, N. timavi. In the laboratory we observed predation and cannibalism in both species. Niphargus timavi, however, appeared to be a more efficient predator than G. fossarum. In particular, juvenile N. timavi were most vulnerable to preying by adults of both species. This probably affected the distribution of juvenile N. timavi that chose finer substrates when placed with adult individuals in an aquarium with granules of different size. To understand the distribution of subterranean species, the summed effect of intraspecific interactions, as well as surface - subterranean species interactions, in particular between individuals of different size, should be taken into account.","[Lustrik, Roman; Turjak, Martin; Fiser, Cene] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Biol, SI-1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kralj-Fiser, Simona] Slovenian Acad Sci & Arts, Jovan Hadzi Inst Biol, Ctr Sci Res, SI-1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia","Lustrik, R (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Biol, POB 2995, SI-1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",roman.lustrik@gmail.com,,"Kralj-Fiser, Simona/0000-0001-6604-2332",Slovenian Ministry of Education and Sport,"The paper is dedicated to the memory of Miha Valic, who accompanied Cene Fiser in the very first field observations in 2004.

How these non-natives affect the local native fish populations, however, is largely unknown. Native sunfish of the genus Lepomis are important as predators in structuring fish and invertebrate assemblages in the swamps and seasonal wet prairies of the Big Cypress Swamp and Florida Everglades. The spotted tilapia, Tilapia mariae, is a successful West African invader that exhibits territorial and spawning behavior that closely matches that of native Lepomis sunfishes. We tested the hypothesis that Lepomis sunfishes and T. mariae would compete when space was limiting. Additionally, we predicted that T. mariae, because of their aggressiveness, would be more successful in acquiring space. We collected juveniles of both groups from Big Cypress National Preserve, Everglades National Park, and the South Florida Water Management District canal system for laboratory trials in which likely competitive interactions were staged and observed. T. mariae were bolder and more aggressive than Lepomis sunfishes. T. mariae residents resisted all intruders whereas 30% of Lepomis sunfish residents were ejected. We surmise that these enhanced behaviors of T. mariae are an important component of their success in South Florida. The continued spread of T. mariae populations throughout South Florida into natural habitats suggests an increasing potential to affect the quality of spawning habitat available for Lepomis sunfishes and warrants a renewed focus on T. mariae as a non-native species of special concern.","[Brooks, Wesley R.; Jordan, Rebecca C.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Brooks, WR (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, 14 Coll Farm Rd,ENR Bldg, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",wrbrooks@rci.rutgers.edu,,"Brooks, Wesley/0000-0002-2927-0464",Rutgers University Faculty Research Council,"We are deeply grateful to D.

In studies on the effect of competition in plant communities two terms are used to describe its effects: the absolute reduction in growth of an individual as a consequence of the presence of another one is called intensity, while the relative impact of competition on an individual as a proportion of the impact of the whole environment is called importance. One school of thought is that the role of competition remains constant across productivity gradients, while the other is that it decreases with increasing severity. J.B. Grace (1991. A clarification of the debate between grime and tilman. Functional Ecology, 5, 583-587.) suggested that the apparent contradiction might be solved if we acknowledge that the two schools are discussing different aspects of competition: the intensity of competition might remain constant while its importance declines with increasing severity. 2. There are no studies that compare intensity and importance of competition in bird populations between areas that differ in quality or productivity and hence it is not possible to make predictions how intensity or importance of competition would vary between them. 3. I compared variation in intensity and importance of competition of three demographic variables between five plots that differ strongly in quality for great Parus major L. and blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus (L.). 4. Both intensity and importance of competition are larger in great than in blue tit populations meaning that the effect of competition on demographic variables is stronger in great than in blue tits and that the contribution of competition to variation in these variables is relatively higher in great than in blue tits. 5. Intensity of competition is higher in low quality than in high quality plots for both species, a result not expected from studies in plant communities. 6. Importance of competition varies strongly between plots. It is larger in oak-dominated plots than in mixed deciduous plots. 7. In birds breeding density increases with habitat quality but is limited by territorial behaviour. As a result competition for food is reduced in high quality habitats resulting in a reduction of competition intensity in high quality sites in which birds breed at high densities. 8. It can be predicted that in studies of territorial species density dependent effects on reproduction are more likely to be detected in low quality sites explaining in part differences in results between studies.","[Dhondt, Andre A.] Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Dhondt, Andre A.] CNRS, CEFE 1919, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Dhondt, Andre A.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium","Dhondt, AA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",aad4@cornell.edu,"Dhondt, Andre/A-8292-2008","Dhondt, Andre/0000-0002-4946-1401",Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)FWO,"The long-term research on tits in Ghent (started by Jan Huble) and in Antwerp was made possible by multiple grants of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) and is highly indebted to Raymond De Waele, Jenny De Laet and Frans Fierens (field work, data entry) and Frank Adriaensen (database management).

We found that logistic models fit both data sets quite well; Dipodomys merriami showed lower maximum per capita growth rates than Dipodomys ordii, and in both cases logistic models were nonlinear. Summer rainfall appears to be the most important exogenous effect for both rodent populations; models including this variable were able to predict independent data better than models including winter rainfall. D. merriami was also negatively affected by another kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis), consistent with previous experimental evidence.

Recent studies, however, have suggested that facilitation is also possible if competitor density provides information about resources. Optimal solution to trade-off between competition and facilitation is predicted to occur at intermediate competitor densities. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally creating a density range of resident tit species (Parus spp.), and measured the response of a competitively subordinate migratory bird, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) in terms of habitat preference (settlement order and density), offspring investment (clutch size and primary sex ratio of offspring), and reproductive success (number and condition of nestlings). We show that most habitat choice and investment decisions of flycatchers were unimodally related to tit density, whereas reproductive success decreased linearly with increasing density. Flycatchers thus made mismatched investment decisions at the artificial tit densities because manipulation disassociated the natural correlation between habitat quality and population density. Apparently low and high tit densities were perceived as indication of poor quality habitat in terms of low amount or quality of resources/high mortality risk and high costs of competition, respectively. This demonstrates that competitor density can be used in assessing overall habitat quality in habitat selection and offspring investment decisions, integrating information on resources and competition.","[Forsman, Jukka T.; Hjernquist, Marten B.; Taipale, Jenni; Gustafsson, Lars] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Anim Ecol Evolut Biol Ctr, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Forsman, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",jukka.forsman@baanamail.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Gustafsson, Lars/O-8056-2019; Gustafsson, Lars/A-7634-2012","Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863; Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863",,,,56,79,80,2,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Social learning is usually studied as an intraspecific phenomenon (but see [5-7]). However, other species with some overlap in ecology can be more than merely potential competitors: prior settlement and longer residence can render them preferable sources of information [8]. Socially induced acquisition of choices or preferences capitalizes upon the knowledge of presumably better-informed individuals [9] and should be adaptive under many natural circumstances [10, 11]. Here we show with a field experiment that females of two migrant flycatcher species can acquire a novel, arbitrary preference of competing resident tits for a symbol attached to the nest sites. The experiment demonstrates that such blind acquisition of heterospecific traits can occur in the wild. Even though genetic variation for habitat preferences exists in many taxa [12] and overlap between bird species likely induces costs [13], this result shows that interspecific social learning can cause increased overlap in nest-site preferences. Conventional, negative species interactions push ecological niches of species apart, but the use of competing species as a source of information counters that force and may lead to convergence.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Anim Ecol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Seppanen, JT (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",janseppa@jyu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-5132-6268",,,,39,81,81,1,59,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0960-9822,1879-0445,,CURR BIOL,Curr.

Yet, despite the large number of studies that investigate how induced resistance affects herbivore preference and performance, very few have simultaneously explored the cascading effects of induction on higher trophic levels and consequences for prey suppression. In our study system, early-season herbivory by leafhoppers elevated plant resistance to subsequent attack by chrysomelid beetles sharing the same host plant. Notably, beetles feeding on leafhopper-damaged plants incurred developmental penalties (e.g., prolonged time in early larval instars) that rendered them more susceptible to predation by natural enemies. As a result, the combined bottom-up effect of leafhopper-induced resistance and the top-down effect of enhanced predation resulted in the synergistic suppression of beetle populations. These results emphasize that higher trophic level dynamics should be considered in conjunction with induced resistance to better understand how plants mediate interspecific interactions in phytophagous insect communities.","Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Kaplan, I (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, 4112 Plant Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",ikaplan@umd.edu,,,,,,63,35,36,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2007,152,4,,,,,665,675,,10.1007/s00442-007-0692-4,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,192TO,WOS:000248226100008,17375333,,,,2021-09-21,

Very little is known though about the shape of the cost function for species with direct interference competition. Here we report the results of an experiment with two vole species in artificial coexistence in large enclosures, where density of the dominant competitor species (Microtus agrestis) was manipulated. Experimental populations of the subordinate vole species (Clethrionomys glareolus) were composed of same aged individuals to study distribution of costs of coexistence with a dominant species within an age-cohort. Survival and space use decreased gradually with increasing field vole numbers. Thus, responses to interference competition in our system appeared to be similar as expected from resource competition. The total number of breeders was stable. Reproductive characteristics such as the timing of breeding, and the litter size were not affected. In the single species enclosures a proportion of surviving individuals were not able to establish a breeding territory against stronger conspecifics. Under competition with heterospecifics such nonbreeders suffered high mortality, whereas the breeders survived. Combined interference of dominant conspecifics and heterospecifics probably increased the frequency of aggressive interactions, social stress and mortality for the weaker individuals within a homogeneous age cohort of the subordinate competitor population. Our results suggest, that in open systems where bank voles are outcompeted over the breeding season by faster reproducing field voles, animals able to establish a territory may be able to withstand competitor pressure, while nonbreeding bank vole individuals are forced to emigrate to suboptimal forest habitats.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",jana.eccard@uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,42,14,16,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is a globally distributed invasive ant that is largely restricted to disturbed habitats in its introduced range. For more than half a century, biologists have believed its success results from superior competitive abilities relative to native ant species, as well as an escape from their natural enemies. 2. We used large volumes of hot water to kill fire ant colonies, and only fire ant colonies, on experimental plots in pastures, and found that populations and diversity of co-occurring ants did not subsequently increase. 3. These results are contrary to classical predictions and indicate that S. invicta is not a superior competitor that suppresses native ants, and that the low diversity and abundance of native ants in degraded ecosystems does not result from interaction with fire ants. Instead, other factors such as prior disturbance and recruitment limitation may be the primary limiting factors for native species in these habitats.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Unit 1, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","King, JR (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Unit 1, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",jking@bio.fsu.edu,,,,,,47,95,99,4,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Here, we describe a methodology for estimating interspecific interactions by combining stable isotopes with bioenergetics. We illustrate this approach by modeling the population dynamics and species interactions of a suite of vertebrates on Santa Cruz Island, California, USA: two endemic carnivores (the island fox and island spotted skunk), an exotic herbivore (the feral pig), and their shared-predator, the Golden Eagle. Sensitivity, analyses suggest that our parameter estimates are robust, and natural history observations suggest that our overall approach captures the species interactions in this vertebrate community. Nonetheless, several factors provide challenges to using isotopes to infer species interactions. Knowledge regarding species-specific isotopic fractionation and diet breadth is often lacking, necessitating detailed laboratory studies and natural history information. However, when coupled with other approaches, including bioenergetics, mechanistic models, and natural history, stable isotopes can be powerful tools in illuminating interspecific interactions and community dynamics.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fishery & Wildlife Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France; Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Roemer, GW (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fishery & Wildlife Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",groemer@nmsu.edu,"Courchamp, Franck/ABE-7204-2020","Courchamp, Franck/0000-0001-7605-4548",,,,51,22,22,0,31,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We verified whether interspecific competition occurred between CW and LW mites via habitat arrangement under laboratory conditions. The complicated webs produced by CW mites clearly inhibited juvenile development in LW mites, whereas there was no effect of LW mites on CW mites. In oviposition site choice tests, both CW and LW females preferred the lower surface of leaves to the upper surface. The preference of LW mites for the lower leaf surface, even in the presence of CW mite webs, suggests that the costs of amensalism are outweighed by the possible benefits, such as avoiding rain. These findings show that the shift in mite species composition from LW to CW mites can occur as a consequence of the interspecific association between spider mites via their webs, without pesticide applications or the presence of natural enemies.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Morimoto, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",,"Osakabe, Masahiro/H-8587-2019","Osakabe, Masahiro/0000-0002-2246-3431",,,,47,19,19,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-0493,1938-291X,,J ECON ENTOMOL,J.

Frankliniella occidentalis is significantly larger than F. bispinosa. Frankliniella bispinosa has greater mobility compared with F. occidentalis. When O. insidiosus was offered either F. bispinosa or F. occidentalis as prey in single species trials, there were no significant differences in the number of prey captured. However, O. insidiosus had significantly more encounters with F. bispinosa than with F. occidentalis. In arenas with equal numbers of both species, O. insidiosus encountered and captured F. occidentalis more than F. bispinosa. In large arenas with two pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.), O. insidiosus preyed on more F. occidentalis than on F. bispinosa. These results indicate that O. insidiosus can prey on both thrips species, but that it preferentially captures F. occidentalis. The greater locomotion and movement of F. bispinosa, perhaps combined with its smaller size, allow it to evade predation by O. insidiosus better than F. occidentalis. Consequently, the observed preference of O. insidiosus for F. occidentalis is not exclusively a function of active selection by the predator but also could arise from inherent differences among prey. We propose this differential predation as a mechanism contributing to observed differences in the temporal dynamics of these species in pepper fields.","USDA ARS, CMAVE, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA; Univ Florida, N Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Quincy, FL 32351 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Reitz, SR (corresponding author), USDA ARS, CMAVE, 6383 Mahan Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA.",sreitz@saa.ars.usda.gov,"Reitz, Stuart/B-7667-2008; Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019",,,,,57,35,44,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

We tested the hypothesis that Gerbillus henleyi (de Winton 1903), the smallest species (10 g) of a pssamophilic guild in Israel, is scarce on relatively productive dunes of the Israeli desert, due to negative interactions from the common G. allenbyi (Thomas 1918) and G. pyramidum (Geoffroy 1825). 2. The alternative hypothesis was that scarcity on sand resulted from the size of its naked hind feet, that do not allow efficient locomotion on sand. 3. Despite their naked soles the weight-bearing surface of G. henleyi feet carry less mass/area than those of any other species. 4. We measured interaction coefficients with the two common species using field-manipulation experiments in two enclosures. 5. Habitat usage of G. henleyi changed from significantly preferring the stabilized sand, when alone, to significantly using the semistabilized dune, when G. allenbyi was also present. 6. We also estimated the interaction coefficients and calculated the G. henleyi's isoclines competing with the two common gerbil species using a technique we developed elsewhere. 7. The stability analysis of the isoclines of G. henleyi competing with either G. allenbyi or with G. pyramidum suggests that stable coexistence occurs when G. henleyi is relatively scarce while the competitors are common. 8. Interspecific competition from either G. allenbyi or G. pyramidum accounts for 90.3% reduction in G. henleyi density, relative to when it is alone. 9. We concluded that the negative interactions from congeners was the major cause for the scarcity of G. henleyi on the relatively rich sand dunes of the Israeli desert.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zvika@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012","Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,31,7,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We analyzed time series of the abundance of ten species of spring foliage feeding Lepidoptera sampled over a 25-year period at 20 sites in the Slovak Republic. Six species were free-feeders and four were leaf-rollers as larvae. Twenty-nine percent of interspecific pairs were significantly synchronous and correlations were highest among species exhibiting similar feeding strategies. Similar patterns of interspecific synchrony have been previously demonstrated in several other taxa, and the synchronizing effects of weather and/or specialist predators have been proposed as mechanisms. As an alternative explanation, we explored a model in which two species within the same feeding guild were synchronized by the functional response of generalist predators. In this model, species remained unsynchronized in the complete absence of predation or when predatory pressures were applied to only one species. Pairs of prey species projecting relatively similar search images to predators were more highly synchronized than species with relatively different search images. Prey handling time only influenced synchrony when it was very high relative to the total time prey was exposed to predators. Our model's prediction of greater synchrony among species that project similar search images to predators was in agreement with our field study that showed greater synchrony among species sharing similar larval feeding strategies and morphologies.","US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA; Fores Res Inst, Res Stn Banska Stiavnica, SK-96923 Banska, Stiavnica, Slovakia; Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; US Forest Serv, USDA, NE Res Stn, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA","Raimondo, S (corresponding author), US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, 1 Sabine Isl Dr, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA.",raimondo.sandy@epa.gov,"Liebhold, Andrew M/C-1423-2008",,,,,55,32,33,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2004,107,3,,,,,462,470,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13449.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,873FZ,WOS:000225266600002,,,,,2021-09-21,

We report on 40 years of data on the lion population in Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, which showed strong evidence of density-dependent regulation at 100-120 individuals but has remained below 60 individuals for the past decade despite consistently high prey abundance. The lions enjoy a higher per capita food-intake rate and higher cub recruitment at low population density, and interspecific competition has not increased in recent years. These animals have suffered from a number of severe disease outbreaks over the past 40 years, but, whereas the population recovered exponentially from a severe epizootic in 1963, three outbreaks between 1994 and 2001 have occurred in such rapid succession that the population has been unable to return to the carrying capacity. The Crater population may have become unusually vulnerable to infectious disease in recent years owing to its close proximity to a growing human population and a history of close inbreeding. The Crater lions may therefore provide important insights into the future of many endangered populations.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Packer, C (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",packer@cbs.umn.edu,,,,,,45,71,74,1,78,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

We used neighbourhood analysis for 748 target conifer trees to examine interspecific competition within 11-, 25-, and 50-year-old mixed, even-aged stands of paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco), western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don), and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) in southern interior British Columbia. Critical neighbourhood height and distance were identified where competition accounted for the greatest variation in target conifer diameter. Competition processes were emperically examined using relative height indices. We found that critical neighbourhood distance increased with stand age and was greater for larch than for cedar. Critical neighbourhood height was higher for cedar than for Douglas-fir or larch in the 11-year-old stands but lower in the older stands. The most important competitors in the 11-year-old stands were tall neighbours, whereas those in the older stands were short neighbours. We found asymmetrical relationships between target conifers and neighbours for all species and age-classes, indicating a resource preemption mode of competition. To be useful in developing prescriptions for competition management in mixed species stands, competition indices should consider neighbour identity and critical height for each target species. Assessment radius must also be sufficiently large to adequately characterize competition.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Forest Res Consultant, Vancouver, BC V6S 1Y5, Canada","Simard, SW (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",suzanne.simard@ubc.ca,,,,,,49,32,34,0,20,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The competition hypothesis proposes that this pattern of habitat segregation reflects the effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection. To test this hypothesis we conducted field experiments that allowed the two species to select from among several habitats when alone and when together. We expected to find a lower proportion of each species in the habitat most associated with the other species, and a negative correlation between the demography and density of each species and the density of the competing species, but this was not the case. Interspecific competition did affect movement patterns of prairie voles. In the presence of meadow voles, net movement (immigration minus emigration) of prairie voles in high-cover habitats decreased and net dispersal of individuals from high- to low-cover habitats increased. Thus, our results indicated only a weak effect of competition on habitat selection. We suggest that other mechanisms, such as differences in habitat preference (or tolerance), differences in dispersal ability, and the advantage of first residency, need to be considered in conjunction with interspecific competition to explain the habitat segregation observed in these species.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Batzli, GO (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",,,,,,,28,13,15,0,4,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Solenopsis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) fire ants are host to Pseudacteon (Diptera: Phoridae) parasitoids. The activity of S. geminata (F.) hosts and relative abundance of Pseudacteon phorids, along with five environmental variables, were measured at weekly intervals over an 8-month period at two sites. 2. Pseudacteon relative abundances often varied greatly from week to week, and were only weakly positively correlated with S. geminata activity. 3. A quadratic function of soil temperature was the single best predictor of ant activity at both sites, explaining 32 and 73% of the variation in ant activity. A linear function of soil moisture was the single best predictor of phorid relative abundance at one site (r(2) = 0.23) whereas no measured variables were significant predictors of phorid relative abundance at the other site. 4. Interspecific interactions at 600 baits were monitored at a third site to document dominance hierarchies and determine whether the presence of Pseudacteon phorids mediated interspecific interactions in their host, S. geminata. 5. Solenopsis geminata was near the top of dominance hierarchies, which did not diverge greatly from a linear pattern. Three species (S. geminata, S. invicta Buren, and Crematogaster laeviuscula Mayr) won the majority of their interspecific interactions and appear to be co-dominants at this microhabitat-rich site. 6. Overall, the presence of phorids had no significant effect on the outcome of interspecific contests involving S. geminata and all other ant species grouped together. Phorids may have contributed to some of the S. geminata losses against other co-dominant species.","Univ Texas, Sch Biol Sci, Div Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Brackenridge Field Lab, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Morrison, LW (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Ctr Med Agr & Vet Entomol, POB 14565, Gainesville, FL 32604 USA.",lmorrison@gainesville.usda.ufl.edu,"Morrison, Lloyd W/A-8949-2013","Morrison, Lloyd W/0000-0002-9375-843X",,,,55,53,53,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The relative importance of each type of interaction is usually a function of the relative size of the organisms involved. This study used field experiments to assess potential size-dependent interactions among small juvenile killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and larger adult killifish. Density, species combinations, and predation risk were manipulated within field enclosures on an intertidal salt marsh on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects between small juveniles (larval killifish and postlarval grass shrimp) were examined in the absence and presence of predators (larger adult killifish) to determine interactions and modifications of interactions due to predators. In the absence of predators both negative intraspecific and interspecific effects occurred in the form of reduced growth of juvenile grass shrimp. Survival of juvenile shrimp was the same in the presence or absence of juvenile killifish. However, when larger adult killifish were present, the interspecific competitive effect of reduced growth in juvenile grass shrimp was not significantly different from controls. Growth and survival of juvenile fish were unaffected by increased density of conspecific juveniles and the presence of juvenile grass shrimp and adult fish predators. These results provide field evidence for interspecific competitive interactions between juveniles of two of the most abundant species of nekton utilizing salt marsh habitat along the eastern coast of North America. However, when larger adult killifish predators were present these interspecific competitive effects among similar sized juvenile killifish and grass shrimp disappeared. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Dietary and spatial relationships between the 2 carnivores were studied by seat analysis and capture-and-recapture rates from March 1995 to August 1998. Diets of allopatric populations reported by others are referenced for comparison. As expected, by switching to arthropod prey and shrews, weasels in Guandaushi Forest consumed food items different from weasels in alpine grasslands. Ferret badgers in Guandaushi and Fushan forests consumed similar diets. The dietary overlap between the sympatric weasels and ferret badgers was substantial; however, the occurrence frequencies of vertebrates, arthropods, and earthworms in their diets differed significantly. The major groups of arthropod prey of the 2 species differed; this might be related to their foraging behaviors. Results from preliminary trapping (March to November 1995) suggested that habitat segregation exists between weasels and ferret badgers in the 3 regions (A-C) which differ in habitat types. This pattern was confirmed in the main study period. More weasels were captured in region A than in the other regions, while a reversed pattern was observed for ferret badgers. Intensive human hunting in the spring of 1996 removed most of the marked animals. This provided an opportunity to examine the significance of current competition on the observed patterns of habitat segregation. Ferret badgers were almost eliminated after the period of hunting. The occurrence of weasels was not influenced by hunting, or by the disappearance of ferret badgers. This suggests that there is no evidence for current competition between weasels and ferret badgers, and coexistence is achieved by the differences in habitat preference, diet, and foraging behaviors of the 2 species..","Acad Sinica, Inst Zool, Taipei 115, Taiwan","Wu, HY (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Inst Nat Resource Management, Hualien 974, Taiwan.",,,,,,,57,19,24,0,11,ACAD SINICA INST ZOOLOGY,TAIPEI,"EDITORIAL OFFICE, TAIPEI 115, TAIWAN",1021-5506,,,ZOOL STUD,Zool.

Both juveniles and adults of these two species are closely associated in low elevation headwater streams in western Virginia. I explored the effects of competition between juveniles of the two species, and the effects of heterospecific adults on juvenile performance, in a controlled, replicated experiment in artificial streams. Effects of competition were determined for three measures of juvenile performance that can be potentially related to reproductive output, and hence, to population dynamics: survival, growth and relative condition. Juveniles of C. bairdi and E. flabellare competed at densities well within the range observed in their natal streams. Adult E. flabellare had a positive effect on the survival of juvenile C. bairdi, the origin of which is unknown. Adult C. bairdi had no effect on juvenile E. flabellare. The most interesting result was that competition between juveniles of the two species was characterized by a qualitative asymmetry; C. bairdi responded with a reduction in growth, both in total length and mass, while E. flabellare responded with a decrease in relative condition, but no decrease in growth. These differences in response were clearly reflected in mass/length regressions. Unless responding variables can be precisely translated into quantitative effects on population dynamics, such qualitative asymmetries in competitive interactions greatly complicate the determination of competitive symmetry and the possible prediction of competitive outcomes, especially in species where r is difficult to determine directly.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27708",,,,,,,,72,18,19,0,14,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,1997,78,3,,,,,429,439,,10.2307/3545605,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WU941,WOS:A1997WU94100003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Marginally significant predator exclusion effects were detected on O. degus, and highly significant year x predation interactions in both wet and dry seasons; degu survival (= persistence) was also significantly longer on exclusion grids. Predation had significant effects on numbers of Phyllotis darwini, and a significant month X predator interaction existed in the wet season; survival was also significantly higher on predator exclusion grids. There was a marginally significant year x competitor interaction in the dry season for this species. Akodon olivaceus had significant month x predator and month x competitor interactions in the wet season only; survival was significantly longer on degu exclusion grids. An irruptive species, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, showed no significant predator or competitor effects in 1991-1992; however, survival was significantly longer on predator + competitor exclusion (vs. control) grids. An uncommon species, Abrothrix longipilis, had marginally nonsignificant time x competitor interactions but no treatment differences in survival. Finally, a second uncommon rodent, Abrocoma bennetti (not analyzed numerically) had significantly longer survival on predator exclusion grids with degus. Degus and P. darwini were significantly overrepresented (relative to availability) in diets of culpeo foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and three nocturnal owls, respectively, whereas A. bennetti was significantly overrepresented in predator diets generally, Vertebrate predation has pervasive effects on some species that, however, may be related to their intrinsic demographic characteristics. Competition may be mediated by subtle behavioral interactions among assemblage members.

A simple food-web model with two herbivores competing for a food resource but having different R* values was explored to determine the impact of the species' different R* on harvesting dynamics. When a superior competitor is harvested and the inferior competitor left unharvested, the superior competitor is driven to extinction by the inferior competitor once harvesting raises the shared resource to a level that the inferior competitor can survive. Yields to the predator then drop to zero for a very small change in harvesting effort. It was shown that these dramatic drops in yield will, in most cases, occur before the maximum sustained yield (MSY) inflexion point predicted without the inferior resource competitor. The maximum yield achieved by the superior competitor in the presence of the inferior competitor increased with the difference between the two species R* values (i.e. MSY is-proportional-to R(s)* - R(i)*). Therefore, high yields to a predator require either polyphagy (i.e. eating all competitors) or large differences in the R* of competitors. The second case is most likely to occur between species with different energetic requirements and, therefore, with different evolutionary lineages (i.e. bony fish versus invertebrates). However, even in this circumstance drops in yield are likely to occur before a MSY predicted without the inferior competitor.

The model simulates shading of the peanut canopy by reducing the total daily PAR received by the peanuts in a manner that realistically represents timing and quantity of light capture by the weeds. Data were collected in nursery plots of Florida beggarweed, sicklepod, and wild poinsettia in 1989, 1990, and 1991. These data provided the values for the critical parameters: maximum attenuation of PAR by the weed, time when the weed overtops the peanut canopy, time when maximum attenuation is reached, and the distance of influence of the weed. Florida beggarweed overtopped the peanut canopy 52 DAP, and reduced PAR reaching the peanuts 45% by 73 DAP. Sicklepod overtopped the peanut canopy 42 DAP and reached an attenuation of 41% 79 DAP. Wild poinsettia overtopped the peanut canopy 44 DAP, and had an attenuation value of 39% 85 DAP. The distances of influence were 162, 150, and 192 cm for Florida beggarweed, sicklepod, and wild poinsettia, respectively. Observed yield losses in the distance of influence were 26, 27, and 22%, respectively. The model predictions accounted for at least 90% of the yield losses observed in field studies. The model also proved capable of simulating competitive differences between morphologically and phenologically different populations of Florida beggarweed. Simulation models will play an important role in reducing the expenditure of time and resources required to document yield losses due to weeds in peanuts.","UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT CROP & SOIL SCI,GRIFFIN,GA 30223",,,,,,,,30,6,8,0,1,WEED SCI SOC AMER,CHAMPAIGN,"309 W CLARK ST, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820",0043-1745,,,WEED SCI,Weed Sci.,APR-JUN,1995,43,2,,,,,247,257,,10.1017/S0043174500081145,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,RB702,WOS:A1995RB70200015,,,,,2021-09-21,

Under two specific conditions, which are that available resources (nutrients or foods) are in extremely short supply or are readily available, the new interspecific model reduces to classical Lotka-Volterra competition equations and Malthus equations without intraspecific interspecific competitions, respectively. Although the new model has the same qualitative behaviors with Lotka-Volterra competition equations, by the index of competition capacity of population proposed in this paper, to some extent the new model gives the outcomes of interspecific competition a better explanation of nutrition kinetics which conforms to the basic principles of biology or ecology.

One invasive plant species increasing in abundance in temperate regions of the United States is Vincetoxicum rossicum (pale swallowwort), which has been observed to displace native confamilial Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed) in habitats where both species overlap. We sought to examine the effects of trait characteristics, trait variation, and density-dependent interactions on the competition between these species. We examined field-grown trait variability across an environmental gradient in western New York and applied a density-based competitive factorial design in a greenhouse setting. Both species grew in a wide range of environmental conditions in the field, but pale swallowwort exhibited more trait variation and greater specific leaf area than common milkweed, potentially reflective of increased efficiency in resource capture. Swallowwort density was a significant predictor of plant traits in the field. In the greenhouse, interspecific competition was more intense than intraspecific competition, with negative impacts of milkweed density on swallowwort growth. Although its trait variability allows it to survive in many environments, on an individual basis at low densities, swallowwort is not a strong competitor. However, this invader gains competitive advantages over native species due to Allee effects, which increase its ecological impact and success as density increases. Swallowwort is likely to remain a successful invader in disturbed temperate ecosystems and continue to have negative impacts on communities where it achieves high densities.","[Jackson, H.

Spodoptera frugiperda is in the same feeding guild as the indigenous species Ostrinia furnacalis, with both pests attacking maize plant tissues such as whorls and tassels. In this study, the interaction of these species was assessed under laboratory and field conditions by examining the survival and predation rate of larvae in maize whorls and tassels. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions of larvae were assessed to characterize movements in arenas in the presence and absence of food. When S. frugiperda and O. furnacalis were present at an equal ratio, S. frugiperda prevailed over O. furnacalis with a high survival rate (over 90%) and predation rate of O. furnacalis (over 40%) under most scenarios in both laboratory and field conditions. When both species occurred at different ratios in the field, S. frugiperda had on average almost 16 times the number of survivors as O. furnacalis on whorls, and 8.3 times the number on tassels, highlighting a substantial advantage in these environments. Spodoptera frugiperda larvae undertook a low frequency of lethal attacks (strikes) and showed a higher incidence of defensive movements compared to O. furnacalis. A field survey showed that S. frugiperda larvae can colonize vegetative plant stages in maize, but it remains to be seen if competitive interactions can be linked to population dynamics of both species though they are expected to favor S. frugiperda.","[Zhao, Jing; Jiang, Yiping; Xiao, Liubin; Tan, Yongan; Bai, Lixin] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jing] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Food Qual & Safety Jiangsu Prov, State Key Lab Breeding Base, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Hoffmann, Ary] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Bio21 Inst, Pest & Environm Adaptat Res Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zhou, Changyong] Huai Yin Inst Agr Sci Xuhuai Regionin Jiangsu, Huaian, Peoples R China","Xiao, LB (corresponding author), Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",xlb@jaas.ac.cn,,,Chinese Agricultural Research System of MOF and MARA [CARS-15-18]; Foundation project of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences [CX19 (2004)]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31901889]; Integration research and demonstration of the technology of cotton fertilizer and pesticide reduction of China [2017YFD0201900],"This work was supported by Chinese Agricultural Research System of MOF and MARA (CARS-15-18), the Foundation project of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CX19 (2004)), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31901889), the Integration research and demonstration of the technology of cotton fertilizer and pesticide reduction of China (2017YFD0201900).",,33,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

We analysed 10 years of population survey data to investigate resource competition between bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) and eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) at two sites to assess whether resource competition is occurring. At one site, wombat abundance was reduced by increased mortality from mange disease, whereas at the other site, kangaroo abundance was reduced primarily by culling. We used the modified Lotka-Volterra competition (LVC) models to describe the mechanism of resource competition and fitted those models to the empirical data by maximum likelihood estimation. We found strong negative relationships between the abundance of wombats and kangaroos at each site, and resource competition was also mechanistically supported by the modified LVC models. The estimated competition coefficients indicate that bare-nosed wombats are a slightly superior competitor of eastern grey kangaroos than vice versa, and that intraspecific competition is almost twice as strong as interspecific competition. In addition, this study facilitated the calculation of the transmission rate associated with mange disease at one site (0.011), and the removal rate owing to culling, the introduction of a predator species, and drought at the other site (0.0006).

This study was conducted in a part of Wild Pistachio Natural Reserve covered by Pistacia-Amygdalus stands in Zagros Mountains, western Iran. We used univariate and bivariate forms of pair- and mark correlation functions and Analytical Global Envelopes under inhomogeneous Poisson process which allow detection of the interactions of the species within the 45-ha study area. Our results indicated that the UAV-derived photogrammetric data proved to be efficient in identification of the plant individuals (F-score approximate to 0.92 for both species). Additionally, strong coefficients of determination (R-2 = 0.98 and 0.94 for Pistacia and Amygdalus, respectively) supported prediction of crown area. We observed the aggregation of the species individuals in clusters of conspecifics and heterospecifics at small spatial scales, most likely as a result of aggregation in favourable parts of the study area. The aggregation of the species within patches had a marked effect on their size (i.e., crown area, height) inferred as growth inhibition, probably due to intra- and interspecific competition.

We propose a framework to predict such changes. We test our method, which uses the linear Lotka-Volterra equations (LLVE) as well as other empirical predictors (linear least squares regression, quadratic extrapolation, simple exponential smoothing), against the measured abundances of trees from the long-term 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), along eight censuses. To obtain the parameters of the LLVE-the intrinsic growth rate r and the carrying capacity K of each species and the interspecific interaction matrix A- we first estimate A through the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. Next, using A as input, we fit r and K. Then, feeding the LLVE with these parameters, we obtain predicted species trajectories along censuses. Since for this particular community the interspecific interaction coefficients are much smaller than the intraspecific ones, keeping only intraspecific competition is enough to predict the evolution of the abundances of several tree species, i.e. the LLVE reduce to a set of uncoupled logistic equations. However, this simplification is not a requirement of the method. We define P-values to establish when the predicted trajectory for a species is statistically significant; this is crucial in determining the set of species over which a particular predictor can be meaningfully applied. To illustrate a possible application of the method, we present our predictions for the abundances of tree species for the currently underway BCI 2020 census, which provide warnings regarding species that are likely to experience important population loss.","[Fort, Hugo] Univ Republica, Inst Phys, Fac Sci, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Grigera, Tomas S.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Fis Liquidos & Sistemas Biol, La Plata, Argentina; [Grigera, Tomas S.] Univ Nacl La Plata, La Plata, Argentina; [Grigera, Tomas S.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CCT CONICET La Plata, La Plata, Argentina; [Grigera, Tomas S.] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Exactas, Dept Fis, La Plata, Argentina","Fort, H (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Inst Phys, Fac Sci, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay.",hugo@fisica.edu.uy,,,ANII [ERANET-LAC RI2016-1005422],"The authors thank support from ANII through project ERANET-LAC R&I2016-1005422.

PSF and its temporal development can also be modified by external biotic and abiotic factors such as competition and resource availability, yet most PSF research is conducted in simple experimental settings without considering temporal changes. Here I have studied the effect of different competitive settings (intraspecific, interspecific, and no competition) and nutrient addition on the magnitude and direction of biomass-based PSF (performance in conspecific relative to heterospecific inoculum) across 46 grassland species, estimated at the 4th, 10th, and 13th month of the response phase. I also examined whether conspecific inoculum had a long-term effect on plant survival at the 36th month, and whether biomass-based PSF may predict survival-based PSF effects. PSF pooled across all treatments and time points was negative, but a significant overall temporal trend or differences among competitive settings were missing. PSF developed unimodally for interspecific competition across the three time points, whereas it declined gradually in case of intraspecific and no competition. Nutrient addition attenuated negative biomass-based PSF and eliminated negative effects of conspecific inoculum on survival. Interspecific differences in biomass-based PSF were related to survival-based PSF, but only after nutrient addition. This study demonstrates that PSF is dynamic and modulated by external abiotic and biotic factors. PSF research should consider the temporal dynamics of focal communities to properly estimate how PSF contributes to community changes, preferably directly in the field.","[Dostal, Petr] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic","Dostal, P (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.",petr.dostal@ibot.cas.cz,,"Dostal, Petr/0000-0002-2342-6632",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-09119S]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939],"This study was supported by grant No. 15-09119S awarded by the Czech Science Foundation, and by the long-term research development project RVO 67985939 of the Czech Academy of Sciences.",,55,0,0,21,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2021,196,1,,,,,185,194,,10.1007/s00442-021-04919-6,,APR 2021,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SF9EK,WOS:000639715700001,33847804,,,,2021-09-21,

Individual risk tolerance, or boldness, was measured as the time to resume movement after a simulated predation strike. Fish that resumed movement faster were categorized as bold, fish that took more time to resume movement were categorized as shy and those that fell in between these two categories were determined to have intermediate boldness. Competitive impacts of boldness in N. melanostomus were determined in a laboratory foraging experiment in which interspecific (juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua Linnaeus 1758) and intraspecific (intermediate N. melanostomus) individuals were exposed to either bold or shy N. melanostomus competitors. G. morhua consumed fewer prey when competing with bold N. melanostomus than when competing with shy N. melanostomus, whereas intermediately bold N. melanostomus foraging was not affected by competitor boldness. Bold and shy N. melanostomus consumed similar amounts of prey, and the number of interactions between paired fish did not vary depending on the personality of N. melanostomus individuals. Therefore, intraspecific foraging competition was not found to be personality dependent. This study provides evidence that individual differences in boldness can mediate competitive interactions in N. melanostomus; nonetheless, results also show that competition is also governed by other mechanisms that require further study.","[Ericsson, Philip; Persson, Anders; von Friesen, Lisa W.; Nilsson, P.

Here we use national-scale local occupancy data to show that three endemism-linked life-history traits account for greater vulnerability of deep-endemic species in the extant forest avifauna, but also that other, more subtle traits and mechanisms favour rather than hinder endemic persistence. We suggest that these traits togetherprovide a basis for predicting changes in local occupancy following suppression of introduced mammalian predators in different landscapes. Our analyses disentangle the limiting effects of forest area, predation, and food availability for different species. They support understanding that predation by introduced mammals is the primary cause of forest bird declines and limitation today. but suggest that large tracts of native forest are essential for future restoration of endemic forest avifauna. even following suppression of introduced mammalian predators. We predict that with fewer predators (1) deep-endemic species would most successfully and rapidly recover in large tracts of warm forest, (2) scarcity of forest or food would limit recovery in larger-bodied, less mobile species and in mobile cavitynesters, and (3) interspecific competition would become influential and produce community reassortment.","[Walker, Susan; Monks, Adrian] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Innes, John G.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand","Walker, S (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",walkers@landcareresearch.co.nz,,,"Ministry of Business, Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)","We thank the Ornithological Society of New Zealand and the many individuals who collected the data for the two national atlases on which this study is based.

In an effort to stem the progression of desertification, shrubs such as Salix cupularis have been planted in some localities in this region. However, the mechanisms whereby the interspecific relationships between these shrubs and the undergrowth vegetation change in response to an increase in shrub canopy area remain unclear. In this study, we examined the traits of plant communities and analysed soil samples under S. cupularis in a degraded alpine meadow along a gradient of four different canopy areas (1.3-1.8, 3.8-5.5, 12.6-14.5, and 27.3-28.3 m(2)). Our results revealed that plant community characteristics shifted from facilitation to competition at a canopy area of 3.8-5.5 m(2). However, changes in soil nutrients and the activities of sucrase and catalase were not detected until the canopy area of S. cupularis had reached 2.6-14.5 m(2). Furthermore, we found that microbial communities, particularly bacteria, showed trends similar to those shown by soil properties. In line with expectations, we found that the soil fungal community showed trends opposite to those shown by the bacterial community. Our findings highlight that competition rather than facilitation tends to be the predominant interspecific relationship that develops in response to the continued growth of nurse plants. Consequently, these results provide evidence in support of the stress-gradient hypothesis, which states that interspecific competition is particularly prevalent in fertile environments, particularly when there are changes in facilitation during periods of increasing environmental stress. Importantly, with respect to the shift in interspecific relationships from facilitative to competitive, we demonstrate that the response of the belowground interactions was slower than that of interactions above ground. Collectively, our observations indicate that the nurse effect of S. cupularis on ecosystems could have significant implications for the restoration of desertified grasslands.","[Liu, Miao; Wang, Yi; Sun, Jian; Zhang, Zhenchao; Xu, Xingliang; Xu, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Synth Res Ctr Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Miao; Tsunekawa, Atsushi; Tsubo, Mitsuru] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan; [Zhou, Huakun] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Restorat Ecol Cold Reg Qinghai, Xining 810008, Peoples R China; [Wu, Gao-lin] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Haregeweyn, Nigussie] Tottori Univ, Int Platform Dryland Res & Educ, Tottori 6800001, Japan","Sun, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Synth Res Ctr Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",liumiao@igsnrr.ac.cn; mrwy201314@163.com; sunjian@igsnrr.ac.cn; zhenchaozhang0626@163.com; hkzhou@nwipb.cas.cn; mingxu@igsnrr.ac.cn; tsunekawa@tottori-u.ac.jp; tsubo@tottori-u.ac.jp,"Sun, Jian/I-9740-2016; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/J-5616-2015; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; Tsubo, Mitsuru/C-4027-2016; Xu, Xingliang/P-9916-2015","Sun, Jian/0000-0001-8765-5015; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/0000-0003-2920-8094; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; Tsubo, Mitsuru/0000-0002-8729-2215; Xu, Xingliang/0000-0003-2869-4932; Wu, Gao-Lin/0000-0002-5449-7134","State Key Research Development Program of ChinaState Key Development Program for Basic Research of China [2016YFC0501802, 2016YFC0501803]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0405]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41871040]","This research was supported by The State Key Research Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0501802 and 2016YFC0501803), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (Grant No.2019QZKK0405), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41871040).",,76,2,3,10,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,DEC,2020,195,,,,,,,,104757,10.1016/j.catena.2020.104757,,,11,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources",Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources,OE2KP,WOS:000580366300019,,,,,2021-09-21,

To predict the forest dynamics here, it is crucial to document the interspecific associations among existing trees and their potential physiological drivers.MaterialsandMethods:Forest-steppe ecotone is composed of forest and grassland patches in a mosaic pattern. We executed two years of complete quadrat surveys in a permanent forest plot in the ecotone in northern China, calculated the interspecific association among five main tree species and analyzed their hydraulic strategies, which are presented by combining leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (K-l) and important thresholds on the stem-vulnerability curves.Results:No intensive competition was suggested among the co-occurring species, which can be explained by their divergent hydraulic strategies. The negative associations amongPopulus davidianaDode andBetula platyphyllaSuk., andP. davidianaandBetula dahuricaPall. can be explained as the result of their similar hydraulic strategies.Tilia mongolicaMaxim. got a strong population development with its effective and safe hydraulic strategy. Generally, hydraulic-strategy differences can explain about 40% variations in interspecific association of species pairs. Oppositely, species sensitivity to early stages of drought is convergent in the forest.Conclusions:The divergent hydraulic strategies can partly explain the interspecific associations among tree species in forest-steppe ecotone and may be an important key for semiarid forests to keep stable. The convergent sensitivity to early stages of drought and the suckering regeneration strategy are also important for trees to survival. Our work revealing the physiological mechanism of forest compositions is a timely supplement to forest-steppe ecotone vegetation prediction.","[Dai, Jingyu; Liu, Hongyan; Xu, Chongyang; Qi, Yang; Zhu, Xinrong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Dai, Jingyu; Liu, Hongyan; Xu, Chongyang; Qi, Yang; Zhu, Xinrong] Peking Univ, MOE Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Mei; Liu, Bingbing; Wu, Yiheng] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Hohhot 010000, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bingbing] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Liu, HY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Liu, HY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, MOE Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",daijingyu@pku.edu.cn; lhy@urban.pku.edu.cn; xchongyang1008@126.com; qi_yang@pku.edu.cn; zhuxinrong@pku.edu.cn; dxal528@aliyun.com; bingbing-l@caf.ac.cn; uykhan@163.com,,"Dai, Jingyu/0000-0001-5714-6690; Liu, Hongyan/0000-0002-6721-4439","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41530747, 41790422]","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Number 41530747, 41790422.",,33,2,2,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,SEP,2020,11,9,,,,,,,942,10.3390/f11090942,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,OD8PG,WOS:000580108000001,,gold,,,2021-09-21,

Predicting the dynamics of fungal communities can hence improve our forecasts of ecological processes which depend on fungal community structure. In this work, we aimed to develop simple theoretical models of fungal interactions with ordinary and partial differential equations, and to validate model predictions against community dynamics of a three species empirical system. We found that space is an important factor for the prediction of community dynamics, since the performance was poor for models of ordinary differential equations assuming well-mixed nutrient substrate. The models of partial differential equations could satisfactorily predict the dynamics of a single species, but exhibited limitations which prevented the prediction of empirical community dynamics. One such limitation is the arbitrary choice of a threshold local density above which a fungal mycelium is considered present in the model. In conclusion, spatially explicit simulation models, able to incorporate different factors influencing interaction outcomes and hence dynamics, appear as a more promising direction towards prediction of fungal community dynamics.","[Kiziridis, Diogenis A.; Yuan, Chenggui] Swansea Univ, Dept Math, Bay Campus, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales; [Fowler, Mike S.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Singleton Pk Campus, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales","Yuan, CG (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept Math, Bay Campus, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales.",danis.k@zoho.com; m.s.fowler@swansea.ac.uk; c.yuan@swansea.ac.uk,,"Kiziridis, Diogenis/0000-0003-4452-7106",Swansea University,DAK was supported by a student scholarship from Swansea University.,,29,1,1,0,5,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",1531-3492,1553-524X,,DISCRETE CONT DYN-B,Discrete Contin.

Sympatric species can have a profound influence on the population recovery of endangered species through a number of ecological processes, but particularly feeding competition. We investigated ranging (spatial pattern) and feeding (trophic overlap) behavior of sympatric critically endangered western black crested gibbons (Nomascus concolor) and endangered Indochinese gray langurs (Trachypithecus crepusculus). Our 1-year study of one group of each species found potential for asymmetric feeding competition between langurs and gibbons on Mt. Wuliang, China, in that: (1) the home range (2 km(2)) of the gibbon group was nearly entirely within the home range of the langur group (4.2 km(2)); (2) langurs had a greater niche breadth than gibbons, and their trophic overlap was 0.23; (3) 14 out of 26 primary food items comprising 56.7% of gibbon annual diet were consumed by langurs; and (4) langurs routinely consumed unripe fruits before they ripened sufficiently for gibbons to eat. Differences in group size, feeding habits, and reproductive rate could increase the effects of asymmetric dietary in potential competition, which appears to limit population recovery of gibbons. Rapid recovery of one species may cause unintended conservation consequences through complex interspecific interaction. Thus, it is important that conservation strategies take species interactions into account when designing conservation interventions. To ensure the ongoing survival of gibbons it may be necessary to manage langur populations.","[Chen, Yuan; Ma, Chi; Yang, Li; Fan, Pengfei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Guan, Zhenhua] Southwest Forestry Univ, Yunnan Acad Biodivers, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xuelong] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Fan, PF (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.; Jiang, XL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",jiangxl@mail.kiz.ac.cn; fanpf@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Yang, Li/0000-0003-1654-4806","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31822049, 31372216, 31570386]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [19lgpy186]","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31822049, 31372216, 31570386), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (19lgpy186).

Competitors that have a coevolved system of communication can resolve the outcome of a fight without paying the cost of engaging in potentially injurious fighting. Invasive species complicate the dynamics of competition, because such species may not have a coevolved system of communication. For example, many species of crayfish have invaded freshwater ecosystems, where they compete with species never encountered before. We studied the traits used to escalate aggression within and between two species of invasive crayfish in Arizona, Procambarus clarkii and Faxonius virilis. Through staged encounters, we found that individuals of both species escalated aggression according to their relative claw size. Furthermore, claw size (instead of claw strength) determined the outcome of interactions that escalated to physical combat. Despite P. clarkii and F. virilis presumably not having a coevolved system of communication, claw size predicted the outcome of interspecific aggression. In crayfish and other species that have invasive potential, future investigations into intraspecific versus interspecific communication dynamics are warranted as they may shed light on the successes and failures of past and present species introductions.

We studied long-term dynamics (over approximately 200 asexual generations) in two phytoplankton species, a coccolithophore (Emiliania huxleyi), and a diatom (Chaetoceros affinis), to increased CO2 growing alone, or competing with one another in co-occurrence. To allow for rapid evolutionary responses, the experiment started with a standing genetic variation of nine genotypes in each of the species. Under co-occurrence of both species, we observed a dominance shift from C. affinis to E. huxleyi after about 120 generations in both CO2 treatments, but more pronounced under high CO2. Associated with this shift, we only found weak adaptation to high CO2 in the diatom and none in the coccolithophore in terms of species' growth rates. In addition, no adaptation to interspecific competition could be observed by comparing the single to the two-species treatments in reciprocal assays, regardless of the CO2 treatment. Nevertheless, highly reproducible genotype sorting left only one genotype remaining for each of the species among all treatments. This strong evolutionary selection coincided with the dominance shift from C. affinis to E. huxleyi. Since all other conditions were kept constant over time, the most parsimonious explanation for the dominance shift is that the strong evolutionary selection was driven by the experimental nutrient conditions, and in turn potentially altered competitive ability of the two species. Thus, observed changes in the simplest possible two-species phytoplankton community demonstrated that eco-evolutionary interactions can be critical for predicting community responses to climate change in rapidly dividing organisms such as phytoplankton.","[Listmann, Luisa; Reusch, Thorsten B.

Understanding how species modify their dietary breadth according to variation in resource richness would support predictions of their responses to environmental changes that alter prey communities. We evaluated relationships between the dietary breadth of large terrestrial carnivores and the local richness of large prey (defined as the number of species). We tested alternative predictions suggested by ecological and evolutionary theories: with increasing prey richness, species would (1) show a more diverse diet, thus broadening their dietary breadth, or (2) narrow their dietary breadth, indicating specialisation on a smaller number of prey. We collated data from 505 studies of the diets of 12 species of large terrestrial mammalian carnivores to model relationships between two indices of dietary breadth and local prey richness. For the majority of species, we found no evidence for narrowing dietary breadth (i.e. increased specialisation) with increasing prey richness. Although the snow leopard and the dhole appeared to use a lower number of large prey species with increasing prey richness, larger sample sizes are needed to support this result. With increasing prey richness, the five largest carnivores (puma Puma concolor, spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta, jaguar Panthera onca, lion Panthera leo, and tiger Panthera tigris), plus the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and the grey wolf Canis lupus (which are usually top predators in the areas from which data were obtained), showed greater dietary breadth and/or used a greater number of large prey species (i.e. increased generalism). We suggest that dominant large carnivores encounter little competition in expanding their dietary breadth with increasing prey richness; conversely, the dietary niche of subordinate large carnivores is limited by competition with larger, dominant predators. We suggest that, over evolutionary time, resource partitioning is more important in shaping the dietary niche of smaller, inferior competitors than the niche of dominant ones.","[Ferretti, Francesco; Lovari, Sandro] Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Res Unit Behav Ecol Ethol & Wildlife Management, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Lovari, Sandro] Maremma Nat Hist Museum, Str Corsini 5, I-58100 Grosseto, Italy; [Lucherini, Mauro] Univ Nacl Sur, CONICET, Grp Ecol Comportamental Mamiferos, Lab Fisiol Anim,INBIOSUR Inst Invest BiolOg & Bio, San Juan 671, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Hayward, Matt] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Conservat Biol Res Grp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Hayward, Matt] Univ Pretoria, Australia Ctr Invas Biol, X0001, Pretoria, South Africa; [Stephens, Philip A.] Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, Conservat Ecol Grp, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England","Ferretti, F (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Res Unit Behav Ecol Ethol & Wildlife Management, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",francesco.ferretti@unisi.it; sandro.lovari@gmail.com; lucherinima@yahoo.com; Matthew.Hayward@newcastle.edu.au; philip.stephens@durham.ac.uk,"Hayward, Matt W./F-3569-2010; Stephens, Philip/B-8397-2008","Hayward, Matt W./0000-0002-5574-1653; Stephens, Philip/0000-0001-5849-788X; Lucherini, Mauro/0000-0002-9695-3943; LOVARI, Sandro/0000-0002-9945-0268",EU-COFUND Marie Curie Senior Research Fellowship by Durham University's Institute of Advanced Studies,"We are grateful to M.

Although a few specific bacterial taxa are capable of removing 1,4-dioxane and individual CVOCs, many microorganisms are inhibited when these contaminants are present in mixtures. Chemical catalysis by tungstated zirconia (WOx/ZrO2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a non-selective treatment was designed to achieve nearly 20% 1,4-dioxane and over 60% trichloroethene and 50% dichloroethene removals. Post-catalysis, bioaugmentation with 1,4-dioxane metabolizing bacterial strain,Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190, removed the remaining 1,4-dioxane. The evolution of the microbial community under different conditions was time-dependent but relatively independent of the concentrations of contaminants. The compositions of microbiomes tended to be similar regardless of complex contaminant mixtures during the biodegradation phase, indicating a r-K strategy transition attributed to the shock experienced during catalysis and the subsequent incubation. The originally dominant genera Pseudomonas and Ralstonia were sensitive to catalytic oxidation, and were overwhelmed by Sphingomonas, Rhodococcus, and other catalyst-tolerant microbes, but microbes capable of biodegradation of organics thrived during the incubation. Methane metabolism, chloroalkane-, and chloroalkene degradation pathways appeared to be responsible for CVOC degradation, based on the identifications of haloacetate dehalogenases, 2-haloacid dehalogenases, and cytochrome P450 family. Network analysis highlighted the potential interspecies competition or commensalism, and dynamics of microbiomes during the biodegradation phase that were in line with shifting predominant genera, confirming the deterministic processes guiding the microbial assembly. Collectively, this study demonstrated that catalysis followed by bioaugmentation is an effective treatment for 1,4-dioxane in the presence of high CVOC concentrations, and it enhanced our understanding of microbial ecological impacts resulting from abiotic-biological treatment trains. These results will be valuable for predicting treatment synergies that lead to cost savings and improve remedial outcomes in short-term active remediation as well as long-term changes to the environmental microbial communities.

Species mixing is considered an effective measure to gain benefits beyond purely additive effects. However, the complex structural processes behind interspecific competition and temporal and spatial facilitative effects through mixing are still far from being understood and predictable. In particular the mixture of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea [Matt.] Liebl.) is gaining even more importance due to the fact that forests from these species are considered more tolerant to climatic effects and are expected to expand their natural range to the north due to global warming. The 30 long-term experimental plots analysed in this study reveal the structural processes in mixed beech-oak stands based on data at the tree and stand level. Using spatial and non-spatial structural indices, we can show an increasing dominance of beech over oak in unmanaged stands and the effectiveness of thinning operations to support oak. Those processes are representative for other light-demanding tree species in mixtures with shade-tolerant species. Improving the knowledge on the structural processes in mixed-species stands is particularly relevant when trying to modify forest structure in order to adapt forest management to shifting environmental conditions and the increasing demand for ecosystem services.","[Maleki, Kobra] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Forest Res, 445 Boul Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada; [Zeller, Laura; Pretzsch, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Maleki, K (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Forest Res, 445 Boul Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada.",kobra.maleki@uqat.ca,"Maleki, Kobra/AAX-9745-2021",,"Bavarian State Ministry for Nutrition, Agriculture, and Forestry [7831-22209-2013]; European UnionEuropean Commission [2816ERA02S]","KM and LZ are the two main authors and contributed equally to this manuscript.

Industrial landscape change creates a novel playing field on which these interactions take place, and a key question for wildlife managers is whether and how species are able to coexist in such working landscapes. Using camera traps deployed in northern Alberta, we surveyed boreal predators to determine whether interspecific interactions affected occurrences of black bears (Ursus americanus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and lynx (Lynx canadensis) within a landscape disturbed by networks of seismic lines (corridors cut for seismic exploration of oil and gas reserves). We tested hypotheses of species interactions across one spatial-only and two spatiotemporal (daily and weekly) scales. Specifically, we hypothesized that (1) predators avoid competition with the apex predator, gray wolf (Canis lupus), (2) they avoid competition with each other as intraguild competitors, and (3) they overlap with their prey. All three predators overlapped with wolves on at least one scale, although models at the daily and weekly scale had substantial unexplained variance. None of the predators showed avoidance of intraguild competitors or overlap with prey. These results show patterns in predator space use that are consistent with both facilitative interactions or shared responses to unmeasured ecological cues. Our study provides insight into how predator species use the working boreal landscape in relation to each other, and highlights that predator management may indirectly influence multiple species through their interactions.","[Tattersall, Erin R.; Burgar, Joanna M.; Burton, A.

Where competition interacts with anthropogenic habitat modification, this natural ecosystem process can become a threatening process. Understanding the mechanisms behind competition in such cases is essential for the formulation of cost-effective management responses for biodiversity conservation. According to the resource availability hypothesis of competition, interference competition limits access to resources by species vulnerable to such aggression and wastes energy in evasive responses. Studying competition is notoriously difficult, however, empirical evidence of the resource availability theory is limited, and there are few published experimental studies showing such an effect at larger scales. We present the results of a controlled and replicated empirical study of interference competition at a landscape scale. We removed an aggressive, overabundant native bird, Manorina melanocephala (noisy miner), whose interference competition is a threatening process for small woodland birds in the highly modified agricultural landscapes of eastern Australia. We monitored foraging and harassment rates of small woodland birds before and after removal to indicate if levels of interference competition changed. Due to unexpected immediate recolonisation, abundance of M. melanocephala in treatment sites declined by only 34% relative to control sites. Twenty-four bird species displayed aggressive behaviour towards other birds and 41 bird species were victims of aggression. Manorina melanocephala was responsible for 66% of all aggressive interactions. After removal, we recorded a doubling in foraging rate of small woodland birds in treatment compared to control sites. This appears to confirm the resource availability hypothesis of competition. Paradoxically, however, increased foraging was not accompanied by a decline in harassment. Low detection rates of harassment of small woodland birds, combined with the modest reduction in abundance of M. melanocephala, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between rates of harassment and rates of foraging.","[Beggs, Richard; Pierson, Jennifer; Tulloch, Ayesha I.

Coupled with effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition this could result in an overall decrease in survival and growth. In order to improve our understanding of the key limiting factors affecting trembling aspen we investigated survival probability and tree growth using data from an extensive network of permanent sample plots in Alberta (Canada). We developed mixed-effect non-linear models which included: tree size, competition, climate, pest incidence and time elapsed between consecutive measurements as predictor variables. Tree data from 1144 Permanent Sample Plots representing 39,394 trees for a total of 52,522 growth interval observations were used to develop these models. Annual data on aspen defoliation were available for the period 1990-2010, and the average Climate Moisture Index (CMI) was calculated for each measured interval by location. Intraspecific competition and competition from conifer species (i.e. spruce/fir and pine), had a strong negative effect on survival and growth. Aspen defoliators such as the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hbn.), the large aspen tortrix (Choristoneura conflictana) and the Bruce spanworm (Operophtera bruceata) had a negative impact on survival, but a strong positive effect on growth of surviving trembling aspen (i.e. compensatory growth). Increasing levels of CMI, which are associated with relatively cooler and wetter conditions, had a positive effect on survival and growth. Model validation results indicated good performance for survival and tree growth predictions. This study indicates that trembling aspen is very sensitive to competition, insect damage, and climate (i.e. drought); respectively, and this behavior will likely intensify as climate warms. The models developed in this study enhance our understanding of trembling aspen survival and growth in boreal North America and could be used to improve the predictive ability of existing growth and yield models.","[Cortini, Francesco; Comeau, Philip G.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Cortini, F (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",FCortini@gmail.com; Phil.Comeau@ualberta.ca,"Comeau, Phil/AAB-6481-2020","Comeau, Phil/0000-0003-2578-4289",Forest Resource Improvement Association of Alberta; Forest Growth Organization of Western Canada (FGrOW); Western Boreal Growth and Yield project group,"We are grateful to the Forest Resource Improvement Association of Alberta for funding to support this work.

We hypothesised that we could overcome this obstacle by quantifying and comparing nutritional niches. We reviewed dietary studies that assessed the relative bulk of each food item, as either per cent biomass or per cent mean volume, in the diet of two closely related species, pine marten Martes martes and stone marten Martes foina, and calculated the nutrient profiles (intakes of protein, lipids and carbohydrates) of each diet. Both martens' diets were tightly clustered (mean values: 47% of energy from protein, 39% from lipid, and 14% from carbohydrate). In allopatry, the nutritional niches of the two species did not differ, but in sympatry, the stone marten ate more carbohydrates and less protein than the pine marten. In allopatry, the protein intake of the stone marten remained high (45-52%) in very different habitats, from cultivated lowland to Alpine forests. Our data suggest that stone marten frugivory may, at least partially, be the result of interspecific competition. By analysing dietary data in the framework of nutritional ecology, we could compare the feeding requirements of pine martens and stone martens more effectively than by using classical estimates of trophic niche overlap at the food item level. This approach may help to shed light on the trophic relationships of other competing species.","[Gazzola, Andrea; Balestrieri, Alessandro] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 9, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Balestrieri, A (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 9, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",andreagazzolalor@gmail.com; alebls@libero.it,,,,,,77,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,JAN,2020,50,1,,,,,82,90,,10.1111/mam.12177,,DEC 2019,9,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,JZ6QP,WOS:000502401500001,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

An observed community structure is often shaped by a combination of bottom-top and top-bottom processes, affected by biotic and abiotic factors. These factors affect community structure either directly (each species separately) or indirectly, via other species. Few studies have observed the combined effects of biotic and abiotic factors on primary producers and consumer communities composed of numerous species. 2. This study investigated the combined effects of a predatory hemipteran and water salinity on abundance and species richness of the periphyton and arthropod communities in an artificial pool experiment. 3. The abundance and species richness of both periphyton and arthropod communities were affected by the combination of salinity and predator. 4. It is suggested that the observed consumer community is composed of arthropod species that vary in salinity tolerance and response to the predator. In addition, the abundance of euryhaline species or species that are not consumed by this particular predator increases indirectly in specific treatment combinations that eventually result in reduced interspecific competition. Periphyton variables were strongly correlated to densities of larval Ochlerotatus caspius (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting that this species may be largely responsible for structuring the producer community. 5. It is suggested that O. caspius distribution is the result of female oviposition habitat selection that is manipulated by chemical signals. Therefore, chemical signals that inform about habitat suitability also play an important role in shaping both consumer and primary producer communities.","[Silberbush, Alon] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, IL-36006 Tivon, Israel; [Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Haifa, Israel; [Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Haifa, Israel","Silberbush, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, IL-36006 Tivon, Israel.",alonsil@gmail.com,"Silberbush, Alon/AAD-3650-2021","Silberbush, Alon/0000-0002-8762-6836",,,,37,0,0,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Biomass per square meter of A. palmeri was 272% and 115% greater when grown without soybean than with soybean for 1 and 8 plants m(-2), respectively. Biomass per plant for D. sanguinalis and A. palmeri grown without soybean was greatest at the 1 plant m(-2) density. Biomass per plant of D. sanguinalis plants across measured densities was 33% to 83% greater when grown without soybean compared with biomass per plant when soybean was present for 1 and 16 plants m-2, respectively. Similarly, biomass per plant for A. palmeri was 56% to 74% greater when grown without soybean for 1 and 8 plants m(-2), respectively. Biomass per plant of either weed species was not affected by weed density when grown with soybean due to interspecific competition with soybean. Yield loss for soybean grown with A. palmeri ranged from 14% to 37% for densities of 1 to 8 plants m(-2), respectively, with a maximum yield loss estimate of 49%. Similarly, predicted loss for soybean grown with D. sanguinalis was 0 % to 37% for densities of 1 to 16 m(-2) with a maximum yield loss estimate of 50%. Soybean biomass was not affected by weed species or density. Results from these studies indicate that A. palmeri is more competitive than D. sanguinalis at lower densities, but that similar yield loss can occur when densities greater than 4 plants m(-2) of either weed are present.","[Basinger, Nicholas T.; Jennings, Katherine M.; Monks, David W.; Bertucci, Matthew B.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Raleigh, NC USA; [Jordan, David L.; Everman, Wesley J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Raleigh, NC USA; [Hestir, Erin L.] Univ Calif Merced, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Merced, CA USA; [Brownie, Cavell] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC USA","Basinger, NT (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, 3111 Miller Plant Sci,120 Carlton St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",nicholas.basinger@uga.edu,"Basinger, Nicholas/ABI-3128-2020; Basinger, Nicholas/AAW-1872-2021; Everman, Wesley/AAW-6650-2021; Hestir, Erin/B-1288-2012","Basinger, Nicholas/0000-0002-7317-5835; Hestir, Erin/0000-0002-4673-5745; Jennings, Katherine/0000-0003-3708-3973; Bertucci, Matthew/0000-0002-0661-8990; Everman, Wesley/0000-0002-5681-8536",North Carolina Agricultural Research Service; North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service; Department of Horticultural Science; North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services,"The authors would like to thank and acknowledge the North Carolina Agricultural Research Service, North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service, the Department of Horticultural Science, and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for funding this research.

Fluctuating densities and dietary overlap may account for massive ecological and evolutionary changes in fish communities. We sampled a mixed juvenile (0+ stages, being younger than 1 year of age) fish community at the Lower Rhine over three consecutive years, including native and newly established species (similar to 64,000 captured individuals and similar to 4200 dissected fish). Our aim was to develop a new approach in which data on density, individual consumption rates, and diet overlaps (both intra- and interspecific) solely originating from the natural environment, were used and combined to estimate species-specific competitive strengths within and between seasons and species. The juvenile fish community at the food-limited Rhine was dominated by invasive gobies. Species-specific consumption rates decreased depending on the dietary overlap with other juveniles. Two invasive gobies (Neogobius melanostomus and N. fluviatilis) showed the greatest competitive abilities, followed by a third invasive Gobiid species (Ponticola kessleri) and the native Aspius aspius, a species utilizing an exclusive food source. Both other native species (Perca fluviatilis and Sander lucioperca) had the lowest estimates of food-related competitive strength, indicating that these species are forced into a juvenile competitive bottleneck by the invasive gobies, before they finally can develop into successful predators on gobies later in life. Our new analytical approach to measure dietary competitive strength among individuals provides a powerful tool to empirically study eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics in the field.","[Borcherding, Jost; Heubel, Katja; Storm, Svenja] Univ Cologne, Dept Gen Ecol, Inst Zool, Ecol Field Stn Rees, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Borcherding, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Dept Gen Ecol, Inst Zool, Ecol Field Stn Rees, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",Jost.Borcherding@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011; Heubel, Katja/J-4060-2012","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861; Heubel, Katja/0000-0002-7946-5542","Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia; Volkswagen foundationVolkswagen [92 002]","We thank Pavel Jurajda (Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno) and the members of his team for their help during several fishing campaigns, as well as numerous students from the University of Cologne who helped with field assistance.

Both intra- and interspecific differences in traits may modulate interactions between plants. Two mechanisms are hypothesized to regulate these effects: competitive hierarchies and trait dissimilarities, but it is unclear how the prevalence of each might depend on environmental conditions and on intra and interspecific differences. 2. We sowed six replicates of all possible pairwise combinations across eight annual species (including conspecific competition and individuals without competitors), in pots under two levels of fertilization. We measured above- and below-ground traits and total biomass of the focal individuals. We expressed competition as the decrease in biomass of focal individuals relative to biomass without competition, and modelled competition using directional (hierarchy) or non-directional (dissimilarity) trait differences, with or without intraspecific variability (ITV). 3. We found evidence of different trait hierarchies operating under different fertilization conditions but little support for trait dissimilarities. The negative effect of competition on focal plants increased with the height of the competitors in both of fertilization levels. Further, in unfertilized conditions, plants with lower specific leaf area (SLA) and larger root systems experienced less competition. Including ITV in trait hierarchies substantially improved our ability to predict the intensity of competition. This was partly due to ITV reducing competitive hierarchies. 4. Synthesis. Our results underscore the importance of traits in driving interactions among plants. Competitive relationships between species depend on complex interactions between trait intra and interspecific differences and resource availability. ITV appears to be a mechanism capable of reducing trait hierarchies, and hence the intensity of competition between coexisting plants.","[Carmona, Carlos P.] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Carmona, Carlos P.; Azcarate, Francisco M.; Peco, Begona] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Grp, Madrid, Spain; [de Bello, Francesco] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Trebon, Czech Republic; [de Bello, Francesco] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Mason, Norman W.

These were detritus (range from 88 to 92% of the gut content, by volume), matter of plant (2-7%) and animal origin (0.2-0.5%), and mineral particles (3-7%). Plant matter comprised pine pollen, conidia of fungi, cyanobacteria, green algae and diatoms. Matter of animal origin consisted of remnants of oligochaetes and rotifers. Food content was more diverse in the larvae inhabiting the Curonian Lagoon. The size of mineral particles in gut contents was significantly higher in C. balatonicus, although the distance between the bases of the maxillas, as a predictor of the size of the particles being eaten, was larger in C. plumosus. The gut content analysis suggested lack of clear food selectivity which potentially may lead to interspecific competition for food. However, the strength of interaction can be substantially weakened by several factors: (1) exceptionally favourable food conditions for benthic chironomids in both highly eutrophic lagoons, (2) the ability to occupy areas differing in salinity, (3) different feeding behaviour and (4) the ability to swallow particles of different size spectra.","[Kornijow, Ryszard] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Oceanog & Marine Ecol, Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland; [Markiyanova, Marina; Lange, Evgenia] Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Nahimovskiy Prospect 36, Moscow 117997, Russia","Kornijow, R (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Oceanog & Marine Ecol, Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland.",rkornijow@mir.gdynia.pl,"Lange, Evgenia/AAD-3326-2019","Kornijow, Ryszard/0000-0001-8110-1310",,,,57,3,4,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,1573-5125,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

Use of this social information by surrounding conspecifics or heterospecifics is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can drive strong correlations in fitness-associated behaviors, such as predator avoidance, enhancing survival within and among competing species. By eliciting indirect positive interactions between competing individuals or species, social information might alter overall competitive outcomes. To test this potential, we present new theory that quantifies the effect of social information, modeled as predator avoidance signals/cues, on the outcomes from intraspecific and interspecific competition. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that social information can rescue populations from extinction and can shift the long-term outcome of competitive interactions from mutual exclusion to coexistence, or vice versa, depending on the relative strengths of intraspecific and interspecific social information and competition.

Many studies have related trait differences among natives and invaders to competitive outcomes. Few studies, however, have tested whether functionally similar invaders have similar competitive impacts on natives. We investigated interactions in communities of a native annual forb Waitzia acuminata (Asteraceae) and two invasive annual grasses that are ecologically similar and co-occur in southwestern Australia. Using a combination of field and laboratory experiments and several performance measures, we assessed impacts of these grasses on W. acuminata. We also examined differences among species in their responses to intraspecific versus interspecific competition, including their frequency dependence. The two similar exotic grasses differed in interaction impacts, with one facilitating and the other suppressing the native. In general, intraspecific competition was stronger than interspecific competition for the native, while evidence of competition was weak for the exotics. These patterns may reflect that W. acuminata does well in these communities due to the combined impacts of stabilization and facilitation, whereas the exotics benefit from limited stabilization (mediated by their weak intraspecific competition) or weak interspecific competition with W. acuminata. We found divergent impacts of the exotic species despite their similar functional traits. We demonstrate that a native species may benefit from interactions with an exotic benefactor species, highlighting the potential importance of positive interactions in invaded communities. Our findings underscore the necessity of considering neutral and positive interactions in addition to competition in understanding invasion dynamics in real plant communities.","[Wainwright, Claire E.; Mayfield, Margaret M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Wainwright, Claire E.] Exponent Inc, Bellevue, WA 98007 USA; [Holt, Robert D.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA","Wainwright, CE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.; Wainwright, CE (corresponding author), Exponent Inc, Bellevue, WA 98007 USA.",cewain@uw.edu,"Mayfield, Margaret M/B-7386-2012","Mayfield, Margaret M/0000-0002-5101-6542; Wainwright, Claire/0000-0002-3248-5482",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP1094413],"Richard J.

In this review, we synthesize current knowledge pertinent to the view that most animals live in a rich vibratory world, where vibrational information is available to unintended receivers. In recent years, we realized that vibrational signaling is one of the oldest and taxonomically most widespread forms of communication by mechanical waves and that receptors detecting substrate vibrations are ubiquitous. In nature, substrate vibrations are reliable source of information readily available to all members of the animal community able to detect them. Viewing vibrational communication in more relevant ecological context reveals that animals relying on substrate vibrations live in complex communication networks. Long evolutionary history of this communication channel is reflected in varied and sophisticated predator-prey interactions guided by substrate-borne vibrations. Eavesdropping and exploitation of vibrational signals used in sexual communication have been so far largely neglected; however, existing studies show that generalist arthropod predators can intercept such signals emitted by insects to obtain information about prey availability and use that information when making foraging decisions. Moreover, males which advertise themselves for longer periods than females and with vibrational signals of higher amplitude face higher predation risk. It is likely that eavesdropping and exploitation of vibrational signals are major drivers in the evolution taking place in the vibratory world and we believe that studies of interspecific interactions guided by substrate vibrations will, in the future, offer numerous opportunities to unravel mechanisms that are central to understanding behavior in general.","[Virant-Doberlet, Meta; Kuhelj, Anka; Polajnar, Jernej; Sturm, Rok] Natl Inst Biol, Dept Organisms & Ecosyst Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia","Virant-Doberlet, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Biol, Dept Organisms & Ecosyst Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",meta.virant@nib.si,"Polajnar, Jernej/F-2121-2019; Virant Doberlet, Meta/G-9251-2019","Polajnar, Jernej/0000-0002-4212-0567; Virant Doberlet, Meta/0000-0001-7510-2392","Slovenian Research Agency (Javna Agencija za raziskovalno dejavnost RS)Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P1-0255, J1-8142, Z1-8144]","We received financial support from the Slovenian Research Agency (Javna Agencija za raziskovalno dejavnost RS) (research core funding no.

However, natural environments are often fragmented and variable in time and space. In such contexts, regional coexistence depends on complex interactions between competition, niche differentiation and stochastic colonization-extinction dynamics. Quantifying all these processes at landscape scale has always been a challenge for ecologists. We propose a new statistical framework to evaluate metapopulation parameters (colonization and extinction) in a two-species system and how they respond to environmental variables and interspecific competition. It requires spatial surveys repeated in time, but does not assume demographic equilibrium. We apply this model to a long-term survey of two snails inhabiting a network of freshwater habitats in the West Indies. We find evidence of reciprocal competition affecting colonization or extinction rates, modulated by species-specific sensitivity to environmental variables. Simulations using model estimates allow us to predict species dynamics and explore the role of various coexistence mechanisms described by metacommunity theory in our system. The two species are predicted to stably coexist, because niche partitioning, source-sink dynamics and interspecific differences in extinction-colonization parameters all contribute to reduce the negative impacts of competition. However, none of these mechanisms is individually essential. Regional coexistence is primarily facilitated by transient co-occurrence of the two species within habitat patches, a possibility generally not considered in theoretical metacommunity models. Our framework is general and could be extended to guilds of several competing species.","[Dubart, Maxime; Pantel, Jelena H.; Jarne, Philippe; David, Patrice] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, IRD,CNRS,CEFE UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Pantel, Jelena H.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Pointier, Jean-Pierre] Univ Perpignan, CRIOBE, EPHE, CNRS,USR 3278, F-66880 Perpignan, France","Dubart, M (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, IRD,CNRS,CEFE UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.",maxime.dubart@cefe.cnrs.fr,,,University of Montpellier; Agence National de la Recherche (AFFAIRS)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12SV005]; CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission; Agence National de la Recherche (NGB)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-17CE32-0011-05],"We thank two reviewers for insightful comments and the numerous people who participated to metacommunity sampling in Guadeloupe over the last two decades: N.

CDI is a phenomenon in which Gram-negative bacteria use the toxic C terminus of a polymorphic surface-exposed exoprotein, BcpA, to inhibit the growth of susceptible bacteria upon direct cell-cell contact. Production of a small immunity protein, Bcpl, prevents autoinhibition. Although CDI systems appear widespread in Gram-negative bacteria, their function has been primarily examined in several model species. Here we demonstrate that genes encoding predicted CDI systems in Bcc species exhibit considerable diversity. We also show that Burkholderia multivorans, which causes pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, expresses genes that encode two CDI systems, both of which appear distinct from the typical Burkholderia-type CDI system. Each system can mediate intrastrain interbacterial competition and contributes to bacterial adherence. Surprisingly, the immunityprotein-encoding bcpl gene of CDI system 1 could be mutated without obvious deleterious effects. We also show that nonpathogenic Burkholderia thailandensis uses CDI to control B. multivorans growth during coculture, providing one of the first examples of interspecies CDI and suggesting that CDI systems could be manipulated to develop therapeutic strategies targeting Bcc pathogens. IMPORTANCE Competition among bacteria affects microbial colonization of environmental niches and host organisms, particularly during polymicrobial infections. The Bcc is a group of environmental bacteria that can cause life-threatening opportunistic infections in patients who have cystic fibrosis or are immunocompromised. Understanding the mechanisms used by these bacterial pathogens to compete with one another may lead to the development of more effective therapies. Findings presented here demonstrate that a Bcc species, Burkholderia multivorans, produces functional CDI system proteins and that growth of this pathogen can be controlled by CDI system proteins produced by neighboring Burkholderia cells.","[Myers-Morales, Tanya; Oates, A.

In this research, inter-predator and predator-prey interactions in the tropical savanna and deciduous forests in Baluran National Park, East Java, Indonesia, were investigated. The pattern of interactions was assessed with respect to intraguild predation theory for inter-predator interactions and landscape of fear theory for predator-prey interactions. Data from camera traps were used to examine spatiotemporal activities of animals. The results indicated no evidence of spatial avoidance of solitary predator leopards (Panthera pardus ssp. melas) caused by the presence of social predator dholes (Cuon alpinus), and the data showed that the probability of the occupancy of leopards increases when dholes are present. Within the predator-prey interaction, only dhole and banteng (Bos javanicus) showed a significantly negative spatial interaction. The probability of occupancy of Javan deer increased when dholes and leopards were present; that of the muntjac and the buffalo increased when dholes were present and decreased when leopards were present. By contrast, the segregation of temporal activity was confirmed for all pairs of species, both for inter-predator and predator-prey species. The findings of this research affirmed that temporal interaction was stronger than spatial interaction in determining the inter-predator and predator-prey co-occurrence in the tropical savannah and deciduous forests.","[Pudyatmoko, Satyawan] Gadjah Mada Univ, Lab Wildlife, Fac Forestry, Bulaksumur 55281, Yogyakarta, Indonesia","Pudyatmoko, S (corresponding author), Gadjah Mada Univ, Lab Wildlife, Fac Forestry, Bulaksumur 55281, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",spudyatmoko@ugm.ac.id,"Pudyatmoko, Satyawan/T-9428-2018","Pudyatmoko, Satyawan/0000-0002-0402-7679",Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its embassy in Jakarta,The study received financial support from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its embassy in Jakarta.,,73,4,4,3,34,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2199-2401,2199-241X,,MAMMAL RES,Mammal Res.,APR,2019,64,2,,,,,191,202,,10.1007/s13364-018-0391-z,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,HP0YC,WOS:000461391500005,,,,,2021-09-21,

In many cases, these caribou are declining because of human-mediated predation in the form of apparent competition. Provincial and federal agencies have employed a number of conservation actions to arrest the decline, but insufficient time and limited replication make it difficult to test the efficacy of those activities. We built a three-species population model that served as a tool to integrate current knowledge, explore uncertainties, and assess activities focused on the recovery of caribou. We applied the model to interconnected populations of caribou, moose, and wolves at two locations in Canada (Chinchaga [British Columbia], Charlevoix [Quebec]) and explored the efficacy of conservation actions unique to each population: predator control, restoration of linear features, reduction of habitat for moose, supplementation, maternal pens, and predator exdosures. Results confirmed that caribou at these two locations faced different recovery challenges, dictated by specific population dynamics and threats. Wolf predation, enhanced by seismic lines and resource roads, was responsible for the decline of the simulated Chinchaga population. The most cost-effective recovery actions for that population were long-term lethal wolf control (lambda(1) (50) = 1.014, $25,665/caribou), a large-scale predator exclosure (lambda(1 50) = 1.015, $170,767/caribou), and the aggressive restoration of linear features (lambda(1 50) = 1.002, $531,675/caribou). In contrast, simulations suggested that calf predation by black bears, a fixed source of mortality in the model, limited the growth of the Charlevoix population. Assuming high survival of adult caribou and poor recruitment of juveniles, a maternal pen was the most effective action for the recovery of those caribou (lambda(1 50) = 1.004, $148,473/caribou). Short-term population supplementation provided only a temporary increase in abundance (lambda(1 50) = 0.994, $62,143/caribou). The model was limited by ecological and data uncertainties, but served as an effective platform for representing and testing our understanding of the complex interspecific interactions that underlie the recovery of woodland caribou.","[Johnson, Chris J.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Mumma, Matthew A.; St-Laurent, Martin-Hugues] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Ctr Northern Studies, Ctr Forest Res, 300 Allie Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada","Johnson, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",johnsoch@unbc.ca,,"Mumma, Matthew/0000-0003-1954-6524",,,,102,15,15,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,MAR,2019,10,3,,,,,,,e02622,10.1002/ecs2.2622,,,28,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HS6JQ,WOS:000463977000011,,gold,,,2021-09-21,

Interspecific diversity among Pacific salmon species (Oncorhynchus spp.) creates staggered spawning events across space and time, thereby prolonging availability to terrestrial wildlife. We sought to understand how such variation might influence consumption by terrestrial predators compared with resource abundance and intra- and interspecific competition. Using stable isotope analysis, we investigated how the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of male black bears (Ursus americanus; n = 405) varies with species diversity and density of spawning salmon biomass, while also accounting for competition with sympatric black and grizzly bears (U. arctos horribilis), in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We found that the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of black bears was approximate to 40% higher in the absence of grizzly bears, but detected little effect of relative black bear density and salmon biomass density. Rather, salmon diversity had the largest positive effect on consumption. On average, increasing diversity from one salmon species to similar to four (with equal biomass contributions) approximately triples the proportion of salmon in diet. Given the importance of salmon to bear life histories, this work provides early empirical support for how resource waves may increase the productivity of consumers at population and landscape scales. Accordingly, terrestrial wildlife management might consider maintaining not only salmon abundance but also diversity.","[Service, Christina N.; Bateman, Andrew W.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Paquet, Paul C.; Darimont, Chris T.] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Darimont, Chris T.] Hakai Inst, Heriot Bay, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.; Adams, Megan S.; Artelle, Kyle A.; Paquet, Paul C.; Darimont, Chris T.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada; [Service, Christina N.] Spirit Bear Res Fdn, Klemtu, BC, Canada; [Bateman, Andrew W.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Bateman, Andrew W.] Salmon Coast Field Stn, Echo Bay, BC, Canada; [Artelle, Kyle A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Reimchen, Thomas E.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada","Service, CN (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Hakai Inst, Heriot Bay, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada.; Service, CN (corresponding author), Spirit Bear Res Fdn, Klemtu, BC, Canada.",christina.service@gmail.com,"Adams, Megan S/AAV-8907-2020","Adams, Megan S/0000-0003-3586-774X; Service, Christina/0000-0001-7448-7251; Artelle, Kyle/0000-0002-8399-5693",Raincoast Conservation Foundation; Spirit Bear Research Foundation; Willow Grove Foundation; Tides Canada; Nature Conservancy; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Vanier FellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Mitacs Accelerate Fellowship; NSERC Industrial Postgraduate ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC postdoctoral fellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Killam postdoctoral fellowship; NSERC Vanier Fellowship; Tula Foundation; NSERC Operating GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [NRC 2354]; Wilburforce Foundation; Raincoast Research Chair; NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [435683],"We are thankful for collaborations with the Haitzaqv, Kitasoo/Xai'xais, Nuxalk, and Wuikinuxv First Nations.

This begs two related questions. First, how do secondary metabolites influence fungal ecology and interspecific interactions? Second, can these interspecific interactions provide a way to see how fungi respond, chemically, within a competitive environment? To evaluate these, and to gain insight into the secondary metabolic arsenal fungi possess, we co-cultured Aspergillus fischeri, a genetically tractable fungus that produces a suite of mycotoxins, with Xylaria cubensis, a fungus that produces the fungistatic compound and FDA-approved drug, griseofulvin. To monitor and characterize fungal chemistry in situ, we used the droplet-liquid microjunction-surface sampling probe (droplet probe). The droplet probe makes a microextraction at defined locations on the surface of the co-culture, followed by analysis of the secondary metabolite profile via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using this, we mapped and compared the spatial profiles of secondary metabolites from both fungi in monoculture versus co-culture. X. cubensis predominantly biosynthesized griseofulvin and dechlorogriseofulvin in monoculture. In contrast, under co-culture conditions a deadlock was formed between the two fungi, and X cubensis biosynthesized the same two secondary metabolites, along with dechloro-5'-hydroxygriseofulvin and 5'-hydroxygriseofulvin, all of which have fungistatic properties, as well as mycotoxins like cytochalasin D and cytochalasin C. In contrast, in co-culture, A. fischeri increased the production of the mycotoxins fumitremorgin B and verruculogen, but otherwise remained unchanged relative to its monoculture. To evaluate that secondary metabolites play an important role in defense and territory establishment, we co-cultured A. fischeri lacking the master regulator of secondary metabolism laeA with X. cubensis. We found that the reduced secondary metabolite biosynthesis of the Delta laeA strain of A. fischeri eliminated the organism's ability to compete in co-culture and led to its displacement by X. cubensis. These results demonstrate the potential of in situ chemical analysis and deletion mutant approaches for shedding light on the ecological roles of secondary metabolites and how they influence fungal ecological strategies; co-culturing may also stimulate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites that are not produced in monoculture in the laboratory.","[Knowles, Sonja L.; Raja, Huzefa A.; Wright, Allison J.; Lee, Ann Marie L.; Caesar, Lindsay K.; Cech, Nadja B.; Oberlies, Nicholas H.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Chem & Biochem, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Meade, Matthew E.; Steenwyk, Jacob L.; Rokas, Antonis] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Ries, Laure N.

Overall, the diet of most of the predators was mainly composed of krill and fish. The percentage of re-occurrence of prey among predators ranged from 25.3 to 36.7, and fish, krill and squid re-occurred most frequently. The re-occurrence of fish among predator pairs ranged from 8.1 to 28.1. The species that re-occurred most frequently were the nototheniid fishes Gobionotothen gibberifrons, Nototheniops nudifrons and Nototheniops nybelini, and the myctophid Electrona antarctica. Prey overlap was greatest between Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) Penguins. Most predator pairs had high overlap of fish prey species. Predators that could forage on demersal and water column prey had yearly variable diets. This variability may be explained by fluctuations in krill availability. In years when krill is scarce (e.g. 2000), these predators diversify their diet by increasing the consumption of fish, which increases the re-occurrence of these preys in the diets. Our samples suggest the recovery of G. gibberifrons stocks around the South Orkney Islands and draw attention to the potential increase of interspecific food competition between predators under scenarios of decreasing krill availability. This information can be used to identify the ecological consequences of fluctuations in krill availability and aid in the management of krill fisheries.","[Bertolin, M.

Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the structural complexity of habitats, leading to homogenization. High abundances of common, generalist species in disturbed habitats may be driven by reduced competition from specialists in similar habitats. We quantified habitat availability for and utilization of three co-occurring arboreal geckos (Australian native house geckos [Gehyra dubia], northern velvet geckos [Oedura castelnaui] and eastern spiny-tailed geckos [Strophurus williamsi]) in four replicated grazing regimes in an experimental grazing trial in north-east Queensland, Australia. Native house geckos were most abundant in heavily grazed habitats, whereas the two other species rarely co-occurred (either with each other or with native house geckos). Geckos displayed resource partitioning of habitat features, such as tree species and structural characteristics. We found evidence of interspecific competition among gecko species, in which native house geckos shifted their habitat selection in the presence of velvet geckos. In the absence of other geckos, native house geckos preferred rough, peeling bark and dead trees, yet in the presence of velvet geckos, native house geckos shifted away from dead trees, and used more structurally complex trees, probably due to high niche overlap with velvet geckos. Native house geckos were more resistant to the negative effects of livestock grazing than either velvet or spiny-tailed geckos. In the absence of other species, native house geckos used a wider range of microhabitats. Synthesis and applications. Species assemblages are often the results of multiple or complex factors, including predation pressure, habitat availability or competitive interactions. The homogenizing effects on habitat structure caused by livestock grazing reduce diversity and suitability for microhabitat specialists. Reduced competition can therefore promote the abundance of microhabitat generalist species, such as Australian native house geckos, suggesting that livestock grazing leads to homogenization and simplification of habitat structure, which ultimately leads to changes in species composition through reduced competition. Understanding species' responses to disturbance, and more broadly, habitat complexity, is crucial for maintaining or increasing biological diversity in anthropogenically modified landscapes.","[Nordberg, Eric J.; Schwarzkopf, Lin] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Nordberg, EJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",ericjnordberg@gmail.com,"Schwarzkopf, Lin/C-1242-2012","Schwarzkopf, Lin/0000-0002-1009-670X; Nordberg, Eric/0000-0002-1333-622X",Meat and Livestock AustraliaMeat and Livestock Australia [B.ERM.0088],"Meat and Livestock Australia, Grant/Award Number: B.ERM.0088",,74,11,11,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Moreover, plant temperature-sensing pathways are known to interact with competition-sensing pathways, yet there remains little experimental evidence for how genotypes varying in temperature responsiveness react to warming in realistic competitive settings. We compared flowering time and fitness responses to warming and competition for two near-isogenic lines (NILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana transgressively segregating temperature-sensitive and temperature-insensitive alleles for major-effect flowering time genes. We grew focal plants of each genotype in intraspecific and interspecific competition in four treatments contrasting daily temperature profiles in summer and fall under contemporary and warmed conditions. We measured phenology and fitness of focal plants to quantify plastic responses to season, temperature and competition and the dependence of these responses on flowering time genotype. The temperature-insensitive NIL was constitutively early flowering and less fit, except in a future-summer climate in which its fitness was higher than the later flowering, temperature-sensitive NIL in low competition. The late-flowering NIL showed accelerated flowering in response to intragenotypic competition and to increased temperature in the summer but delayed flowering in the fall. However, its fitness fell with rising temperatures in both seasons, and in the fall its marginal fitness gain from decreasing competition was diminished in the future. Functional alleles at temperature-responsive genes were necessary for plastic responses to season, warming and competition. However, the plastic genotype was not the most fit in every experimental condition, becoming less fit than the temperature-canalized genotype in the warm summer treatment. Climate change is often predicted to have deleterious effects on plant populations, and our results show how increased temperatures can act through genotype-dependent phenology to decrease fitness. Furthermore, plasticity is not necessarily adaptive in rapidly changing environments since a nonplastic genotype proved fitter than a plastic genotype in a warming climate treatment.","[Taylor, Mark A.; Schmitt, Johanna] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Cooper, Martha D.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Taylor, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",maktaylor@ucdavis.edu,,"TAYLOR, MARK/0000-0003-2266-7917","National Science Foundation Integrative Organismal Systems [093835589]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [2014157993]; National Science Foundation Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1020111]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GRFP 2014157993, IOS 093835589, DEB 1020111]; University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System","National Science Foundation Integrative Organismal Systems, Grant/Award Number: 093835589; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, Grant/Award Number: 2014157993; National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 1020111; NSF, Grant/Award Number: GRFP 2014157993, IOS 093835589 and DEB 1020111; University of California",,136,1,1,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population-dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of nonhierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence. In contrast to previous work on pairwise outcomes in largely native-dominated communities, our work supports a role for nearly neutral dynamics and priority effects as drivers of species composition in invaded communities.","[Uricchio, Lawrence H.; Daws, S.

However, in the case of large predators inhabiting protected areas within a hostile human-dominated landscape, predators may remain at low densities if they face high mortality upon leaving the reserve. In turn, this may compromise the potential for density-dependent effects such as top-down regulation of prey species abundance. We simulate the hypothetical reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) to reserves in their former range (Scottish Highlands), with the objectives of identifying parameters that allow a viable wolf population and the potential for direct top-down forcing of red deer (Cervus elaphus) densities. We examine the extent to which the number of dispersing wolves leaving the protected area influences whether these objectives are achieved. Our simulations confirm that source-sink population dynamics can result in a self-perpetuating wolf population, but one that never achieves densities needed for strong top-down forcing. When wolf density is weakly controlled by intraspecific competition, strong top-down forcing occurs when 20% of dispersing wolves or less leave the population. When 20-35% of dispersing wolves leave, the strength of top-down forcing is highly variable. The wolf population remained viable when 35-60% of dispersing wolves left, but then did not exert strong top-down forcing. Wolves were vulnerable to extinction at greater than 60% disperser loss. Despite their negative connotations, fences (including semi-permeable ones) could increase the potential for interspecific density-dependent processes in some cases, thereby facilitating trophic rewilding.","[Bull, Joseph W.] Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Bull, Joseph W.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bull, Joseph W.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ejrnaes, Rasmus] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci Biodivers & Conservat, Grenavej 14, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark; [Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Dept Zool, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Sandom, Christopher J.] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Sandom, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",c.sandom@sussex.ac.uk,"Svenning, Jens-Christian/Y-3318-2019; Bull, Joseph/O-7578-2015","Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Bull, Joseph/0000-0001-7337-8977; Ejrnaes, Rasmus/0000-0003-2538-8606; Sandom, Christopher/0000-0003-2294-1648","15.

Forbs contribute more to species richness than grasses in South African grasslands. However, little is known about the impact of grazing and grass competition on the population dynamics of forbs. The aim of this study was to determine the response of three mesic grassland perennial forb species to simulated intensive defoliation and interspecific competition from a neighbouring dominant grass, Themeda triandra, in a field experiment. Two of the selected forb species are sensitive to defoliation (Afroaster hispida and Gerbera ambigua) and one is potentially resistant to defoliation (Hypoxis hemerocallidea). Defoliation resulted in smaller plants of all three species following regrowth. Only A. hispida showed an interaction response to defoliation and competition. Thus, a competitive release was observed for A. hispida in that the height of defoliated plants was reduced by 45% compared with undefoliated plants under full competition, but there was no difference under partial or no competition. Gerbera ambigua was unaffected by competition. Hypoxis hemerocallidea was sensitive to competition irrespective of being defoliated or undefoliated.

We present here an experiment that tests the way the same indirect cues of predation risk are interpreted by bank voles, Myodes glareolus, as the game changes through exposure to a caged weasel. Using optimal patch use, we asked wild-caught voles to rank the risk they perceived. We measured their response to olfactory cues in the form of weasel bedding, a sham control in the form of rabbit bedding, and an odor-free control. We repeated the interviews in a chronological order to test the change in response, i.e., the changes in the value of the information. We found that the voles did not differentiate strongly between treatments pre-exposure to the weasel. During the exposure, vole foraging activity was reduced in all treatments, but proportionally increased in the vicinity to the rabbit odor. Post-exposure, the voles focused their foraging in the control, while the value of exposure to the predator explained the majority of variation in response. Our data also suggested a sex bias in interpretation of the cues. Given how the foragers changed their interpretation of the same cues based on external information, we suggest that applying predator olfactory cues as a simulation of predation risk needs further testing. For instance, what are the possible effective compounds and how they change fear response over time. The major conclusion is that however effective olfactory cues may be, the presence of live predators overwhelmingly affects the information voles gained from these cues.Significance statementIn ecology, fear is the strategic response to cues of risk an animal senses in its environment. The cues suggesting the existence of a predator in the vicinity are weighed by an individual against the probability of encounter with the predator and the perceived lethality of an encounter with the predator. The best documented such response is variation in foraging tenacity as measured by a giving-up density. In this paper, we show that an olfactory predator cue and the smell of an interspecific competitor result in different responses based on experience with a live-caged predator. This work provides a cautionary example of the risk in making assumptions regarding olfactory cues devoid of environmental context.","[Bleicher, Sonny S.] George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.; Yloenen, Hannu; Kaepylae, Teemu; Haapakoski, Marko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",bleicherss@gmail.com,"Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo/AAE-6272-2020","Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901",Finnish Academy research grant [288990],"The experiment was financially supported by the Finnish Academy research grant 2015-2019 for HY, No. 288990, 11.5.2015.",,78,9,9,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Sharing a common habitat may lead to interspecific competition for resources, but field assessment of these biological events is not always easily accomplished. By using a non-invasive method, we evaluated the physiological stress responses of Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) to the presence of cattle, sheep and goat, red deer (Cervus elaphus), people (hikers), and predators to identify which factors may affect this endangered species. During September 2012, November 2012, and July 2013, a total of 318 faecal samples were collected in representative sites and analysed for faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM). FCM concentration was analysed through linear mixed-effect models. A significant increase in FCM values in Apennine chamois sharing their habitat with domestic animals was recorded during all study periods. On the contrary, stress responses to red deer and people were limited in time and emerged only during summer months, when hikers are more frequent and red deer extend their altitudinal range reaching chamois' habitat. The observed effects of domestic animals, red deer, and hikers should be considered in future Apennine chamois management plans, which should include the regulation of pastured domestic livestock, anthropogenic disturbances, and possible interferences with other wild species within parks.","[Formenti, Nicoletta; Trogu, Tiziana; Bonfanti, Marta; Lanfranchi, Paolo; Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Dept Vet Med, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Formenti, Nicoletta] Ist Zooprofilatt Sperimentale Lombardia & Emilia, Via Bianchi 7-9, I-25124 Brescia, Italy; [Vigano, Roberto; Fraquelli, Cristina] Studio Associato AlpVet, Piazza Venzaghi 2, I-21052 Busto Arsizio, VA, Italy; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Veterinarpl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Ctr Ric Coordinata Epidemiol & Sorveglianza Mol I, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Ferrari, N (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Vet Med, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy.; Ferrari, N (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Ctr Ric Coordinata Epidemiol & Sorveglianza Mol I, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",nicola.ferrari@unimi.it,"Ferrari, Nicola/E-6331-2013; Vigano, Roberto/ABE-8075-2020; Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008","Ferrari, Nicola/0000-0001-8959-3495; Vigano, Roberto/0000-0001-8594-1296; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Formenti, Nicoletta/0000-0003-1516-1256","Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN project)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) [2010P7LFW4];  [LIFE09 NAT/IT/000183]",This research was supported by the 'Project LIFE09 NAT/IT/000183 Coornata' and partly by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN project no. 2010P7LFW4).,,60,4,4,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

The simplest linear Lotka-Volterra competition equations (LLVCE) for S species require S-2 parameters to solve for equilibrium abundances. The same order of experiments are required to estimate these parameters, namely the carrying capacities (from monoculture experiments) and the competition coefficients (from biculture or pairwise experiments in addition to monoculture ones). For communities with large species richness S it is practically impossible to perform all these experiments. Therefore, with an incomplete knowledge of model parameters it seems more reasonable to attempt to predict aggregated or mean quantities, defined for the whole community of competing species, rather than making more detailed predictions, like the abundance of each species. Here we test a recently derived analytical approximation for predicting the Relative Yield Total (RYT) and the Mean Relative Yield (MRY) as functions of the mean value of the interspecific competition matrix a and the species richness S. These formulae with only a fraction of the model parameters, are able to predict accurately empirical measurements covering a wide variety of taxa such as algae, vascular plants, protozoa. We discuss the dependence of these global community quantities on the species richness and the intensity of competition and possible applications are pointed out.","[Fort, H.] Univ Republica, Fac Sci, Inst Phys, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Fort, H (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Fac Sci, Inst Phys, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay.",hugo@fisica.edu.uy,,,ANII-Uruguay [ERANET-LACRI2016-1005422],Work supported in part by ANII-Uruguay (SNI and project ERANET-LACR&I2016-1005422).,,15,0,0,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",1585-8553,1588-2756,,COMMUNITY ECOL,Community Ecol.,DEC,2018,19,2,,,,,199,202,,10.1556/168.2018.19.2.12,,,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV5ZA,WOS:000446184200012,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

The gut bacterial communities of abalone species characterized so far reveal considerable interspecific variability, likely resulting from bacterial interactions and constrained by the ecology of their abalone host species; however, they remain poorly investigated. Additionally, the extent to which structural changes in the microbiota entail functional shifts in metabolic pathways of bacterial communities remains unexplored. In order to address these questions, we characterized the gut microbiota of the northeast Pacific blue (Haliotis fulgens or HF) and yellow (Haliotis corrugata or HC) abalone by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to shed light on: (i) their gut microbiota structure; (ii) how bacteria may interact among them; and (iii) predicted shifts in bacterial metabolic functions associated with the observed structural changes. Our findings revealed that Mycoplasma dominated the GI microbiome in both species. However, the structure of the bacterial communities differed significantly in spite of considerable intraspecific variation. This resulted from changes in predominant species composition in each GI microbiota, suggesting host-specific adaptation of bacterial lineages to these sympatric abalone. We hypothesize that the presence of exclusive OTUs in each microbiota may relate to host-specific differences in competitive pressure. Significant differences in bacterial diversity were found between species for the explored metabolic pathways despite their functional overlap. A more diverse array of bacteria contributed to each function in HC, whereas a single or much fewer OTUs were generally observed in HF. The structural and functional analyses allowed us to describe a significant taxonomic split and functional overlap between the microbiota of HF and HC abalone.","[Cicala, Francesco; Alejandro Cisterna-Celiz, Jose; Rocha-Olivares, Axayacatl] CICESE, Mol Ecol Lab, Dept Biol Oceanog, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Moore, James D.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA USA","Rocha-Olivares, A (corresponding author), CICESE, Mol Ecol Lab, Dept Biol Oceanog, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.",arocha@cicese.mx,"Rocha-Olivares, Axayacatl/A-9832-2008; Cisterna-Celiz, J.

However, it is unclear how important is the change in competition-facilitation balance (i.e., the netoutcome of plant-plant interactions) along the stress gradient in the regulation of community temporal stability (i.e., the inverse of temporal variability in total biomass). Increasing environmental stress may enhance community temporal stability by reduced competition or eventually by leading to facilitative interactions between the dominant and subordinate species. Here, we present the results of a 5-yr mesocosm experiment that demonstrates the effects of interspecific interactions on the temporal stability of a riparian community across different drought-stress scenarios. We constructed artificial communities of dominant species (Carex elata) and three subordinate species to simulate the independent effects of environmental stress and interspecific interactions. Using removal of the dominant species, we evaluated the interplay of various mechanisms regulating the temporal stability of the subordinate species (competition-facilitation balance, species asynchrony, and dominant species stability). By simultaneous testing of these stabilizing mechanisms, we show their importance differs depending on environmental variability and harshness. The predominant role is taken by species asynchrony in a seasonally dry environment, whereas in a permanently dry environment, the importance of reduced competition increases. Reduced competition was stabilizing, in particular through increased total community biomass, whereas species asynchrony increased total community biomass and decreased biomass variation. These results suggest experiments and simulations that exclude interspecific interactions may not offer realistic predictions of the effects of changing hydrological regimes on ecosystem functioning.","[Douda, Jan; Doudova, Jana; Hulik, Josef; Havrdova, Alena; Boublik, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic","Douda, J (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic.",douda@fzp.czu.cz,"Havrdova, Alena/ABH-7634-2020","Havrdova, Alena/0000-0002-7577-4815; Douda, Jan/0000-0002-1205-364X; Doudova, Jana/0000-0002-3186-4528; Boublik, Karel/0000-0002-8587-4238","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LTC18045]","We would like to thank Jan Douda, Sr., Karel Douda, Radka Munichova, Katerina Siftova, and Katerina Ruzickova for their support in carrying out the experiment and in assisting with the data collection.

Using a meta-analysis of 38 published studies and 150 plant species, we show that effects of interspecific competition (either growing plants with a competitor or singly, or comparing inter- vs. intraspecific competition) and PSF (comparing home vs. away soil, live vs. sterile soil, or control vs. fungicide-treated soil) depended on treatments but were predominantly negative, broadly comparable in magnitude, and additive or synergistic. Stronger competitors experienced more negative PSF than weaker competitors when controlling for density (inter- to intraspecific competition), suggesting that PSF could prevent competitive dominance and promote coexistence. When competition was measured against plants growing singly, the strength of competition overwhelmed PSF, indicating that the relative importance of PSF may depend not only on neighbour identity but also density. We evaluate how competition and PSFs might interact across resource gradients; PSF will likely strengthen competitive interactions in high resource environments and enhance facilitative interactions in low-resource environments. Finally, we provide a framework for filling key knowledge gaps and advancing our understanding of how these biotic interactions influence community structure.","[Lekberg, Ylva; Larkin, Beau G.] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Bunn, Rebecca A.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hart, Miranda M.; Klironomos, John] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Kivlin, Stephanie N.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Reinhart, Kurt O.] USDA ARS, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, Miles City, MT 59301 USA; [Remke, Michael] No Arizona Univ, Coll Engn Forestry & Nat Sci, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol NIOO KNAW, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ WUR, Dept Plant Sci, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands","Lekberg, Y (corresponding author), MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA.; Lekberg, Y (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",ylekberg@mpgranch.com,"Remke, Michael/ABE-2034-2020; Hart, Miranda m/D-1562-2011; van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Remke, Michael/0000-0002-9972-8848; van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",MPG Ranch; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518]; NSF EPSCoR Track-1 [EPS-1101342],"This manuscript is the product of a workshop sponsored by MPG Ranch.

Species composition and metabolic activities of such LAB spoilage communities are determined by the nature of the meat product, storage conditions, and interspecies interactions. Our knowledge of system level responses of LAB during such interactions is very limited. To expand it, we studied interactions between three common psychrotrophic spoilage LAB (Leuconostoc gelidum, Lactococcus piscium, and Lactobacillus oligofermentans) by comparing their time course transcriptome profiles obtained during their growth in individual, pairwise, and triple cultures. The study revealed how these LAB employed different strategies to cope with the consequences of interspecies competition. The fastest-growing bacterium, Le. gelidum, attempted to enhance its nutrient-scavenging and growth capabilities in the presence of other LAB through upregulation of carbohydrate catabolic pathways, pyruvate fermentation enzymes, and ribosomal proteins, whereas the slower-growing Lc. piscium and Lb. oligofermentans downregulated these functions. These findings may explain the competitive success and predominance of Le. gelidum in a variety of spoiled foods. Peculiarly, interspecies interactions induced overexpression of prophage genes and restriction modification systems (mechanisms of DNA exchange and protection against it) in Lc. piscium and Lb. oligofermentans but not in Le. gelidum. Cocultivation induced also overexpression of the numerous putative adhesins in Lb. oligofermentans. These adhesins might contribute to the survival of this slowly growing bacterium in actively growing meat spoilage communities. IMPORTANCE Despite the apparent relevance of LAB for biotechnology and human health, interactions between members of LAB communities are not well known. Knowledge of such interactions is crucial for understanding how these communities function and, consequently, whether there is any possibility to develop new strategies to interfere with their growth and to postpone spoilage of packaged and refrigerated foods. With the help of controlled experiments, detailed regulation events can be observed. This study gives an insight into the system level interactions and the different competition-induced survival strategies related to enhanced uptake and catabolism of carbon sources, overexpression of adhesins and putative bacteriocins, and the induction of exchange of genetic material. Even though this experiment dealt with only three LAB strains in vitro, these findings agreed well with the relative abundance patterns typically reported for these species in natural food microbial communities.","[Andreevskaya, Margarita; Ylinen, Anne; Paulin, Lars; Auvinen, Petri] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Helsinki, Finland; [Jaaskelainen, Elina; Johansson, Per; Bjorkroth, Johanna] Univ Helsinki, Dept Food Hyg & Environm Hlth, Helsinki, Finland","Auvinen, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Helsinki, Finland.",petri.auvinen@helsinki.fr,"Auvinen, Petri/AAP-8117-2021; Auvinen, Petri/D-5044-2009; Bjorkroth, Katri Johanna/B-1660-2009","Auvinen, Petri/0000-0002-3947-4778; Bjorkroth, Katri Johanna/0000-0002-7172-9945; Ylinen, Anne Helena/0000-0001-7423-7789; Jaaskelainen, Elina/0000-0002-2880-3206; Andreevskaya, Margarita/0000-0003-4052-3861","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [267755, 311717, 307856, 307855, 267623]; Integrative Life Science Doctoral Program (ILS); Institute of Biotechnology","This project was funded by the Academy of Finland (grant numbers 267755, 311717, 307856, 307855, and 267623), Integrative Life Science Doctoral Program (ILS), and Institute of Biotechnology.

Here, we asked whether interference by the larger House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) could reduce breeding success and parental behavior in the smaller Great Tit (Parus major) following clutch completion, by experimentally allowing House Sparrows to access half of the Great Tit nest boxes. Significantly more tit pairs failed to raise young in nest boxes that House Sparrows were able to enter during their breeding period compared to those that were not able to do so, because House Sparrows usurped 77.8% of the Great Tit nests. Great Tits also increased the duration of nest defense in the presence of House Sparrows. As the outcome of interference competition may lead to breeding failure, birds should necessarily evolve ways to avoid nest competitors either by selecting nests that restrict access to their larger competitors and/or by initiating breeding earlier. Conservation efforts should be directed toward attaching a metal restrictor plate around the entrance of nest boxes to prevent woodpeckers from enlarging the entrance and larger species from entering nests.","[Goldshtein, Aya; Leshem, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Markman, Shai; Puchinsky, Maya] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, Fac Nat Sci, Oranim, Tivon, Israel; [Charter, Motti] Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, Katzrin, Israel","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, Katzrin, Israel.",chartermotti@gmail.com,"Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021","Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356",Tel Aviv University; Jewish National Fund; Smollar-Winnikov Scholarship Fund,"Special thanks to Jonathan Chazan who took an active part throughout the entire study; to Shaul Aviel, Kobi Meyrom, and Shai Halevi for their advice and technical assistance; to Ori Peleg, Avi Koplovich, Mary Weber, Shir Asher, and Nati Wein for field assistance; to Israel Goldshtein and Sergio Chazan for help in building the nest boxes; and to Naomi Paz for editorial assistance.

Recent theory suggests that competitive interactions will lead to groups, or clusters, of species with similar traits. However, theoretical predictions typically assume complete knowledge of the map between competition and measured traits. These assumptions limit the plausible application of these patterns for inferring competitive interactions in nature. Here, we relax these restrictions and find that the clustering pattern is robust to contributions of unknown or unobserved niche axes. However, it may not be visible unless measured traits are close proxies for niche strategies.

Intraguild predation (IGP) is a distinctive form of interference competition, where a dominant predator selectively kills subordinate rivals to gain increased access to resources. However, before IGP can be identified, organisms must be confirmed as members of the same guild and occur together in space and time. The lesser hairy-footed dunnart (Sminthopsis youngsoni, Dasyuridae) is a generalist marsupial insectivore in arid Australia, but consumes wolf spiders (Lycosa spp., Lycosidae) disproportionately often relative to their availability. Here, we test the hypothesis that this disproportionate predation is a product of frequent encounter rates between the interactants due to high overlap in their diets and use of space and time. Diet and prey availability were determined using direct observations and invertebrate pitfall trapping, microhabitat use by tracking individuals of both species-groups, and temporal activity using spotlighting and camera traps. Major overlap (greater than 75% similarity) was found in diet and temporal activity, and weaker overlap in microhabitat use. Taken together, these findings suggest reasonable potential, for the first time, for competition and intraguild predation to occur between taxa as disparate as marsupials and spiders.","[Potter, Tamara I.; Greenville, Aaron C.; Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Greenville, Aaron C.; Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Natl Environm Sci Programme Threatened Species Re, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Greenville, Aaron C.; Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Long Term Ecol Res Network, Terr Ecosyst Res Network, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Potter, TI (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",tpot3577@uni.sydney.edu.au,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019; Greenville, Aaron/G-9718-2013","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; Greenville, Aaron/0000-0002-0113-4778; Potter, Tamara/0000-0001-8443-0582","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Australian Government's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research NetworkAustralian Government; Australian research infrastructure facility established under the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and Education Infrastructure Fund-Super Science Initiative through the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Terti; Australian Research Council FellowshipAustralian Research Council; Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program through the Threatened Species Recovery HubAustralian Government","This work was funded by the Australian Research Council and the Australian Government's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (www.tern.gov.au), an Australian research infrastructure facility established under the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and Education Infrastructure Fund-Super Science Initiative through the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education.

There is a shortage of studies investigating how different size classes of a single species interact with one another to generate multiple predator effects. Here, we used a comprehensive experimental design, consisting of calculation of per capita consumption rates, to examine multiple predator effects on prey when swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) of multiple sizes foraged on manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) using a video recording analysis system in the laboratory. We identified multiple predator effects on prey by comparing observed predation rate to that predicted from the multiple risk model. The observed predation rate of crab was significantly lower than predicted value when a conspecific competitor appeared. Swimming crab significantly decreased foraging time budgets when a conspecific competitor appeared. The proportion of time medium-sized crabs spent searching for and handling clam decreased in the presence of competitors. The encounter rate between crabs and clam decreased while the probability of capture upon encounter and the probability of consumption upon capture increased when a conspecific competitor appeared. The handling time per clam significantly decreased when a conspecific competitor appeared. Most encounters between crabs were fighting (2.31-4.14 times/h), secondly chasing (1.02-3.07 times/h), and threatening (1.24-2.09 times/h), and the fewest encounters were non-aggression (0.13-0.49 times/h). The results indicated that swimming crab foraging behavior was affected by the chasing, threatening and fighting behavior of a conspecific competitor and this affected the predation rate on prey, which led to non-independent multiple predator effects in the swimming crab-Manila clam system.","[Sun, Yunfei; Wang, Fang; Liu, Dapeng; Wang, Xin; Su, Xianpeng] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yunfei; Wang, Fang; Liu, Dapeng; Wang, Xin; Su, Xianpeng] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Prod Proc, Funct Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food, 1 Wenhai Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Chao] Ocean Univ China, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, F (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wangfang249@ouc.edu.cn,,,Project of National Basic Research Priorities Program of China [2015FY110600]; Project of Shandong Key Research & Development Plan [2016ZDJS11A06],"We thank Heinrich Dircksen and Nick West for providing language help and writing assistance.

Time-lagged interspecific competition is known to negatively affect fitness, yet time-lagged intraspecific competition is rarely studied outside of outbreak conditions. We tested the impact of competition between larval cohorts of the western tent caterpillar (Malacosoma californicum) feeding on chokecherry (Prunus virginiana). We reared larvae on host plants that either had or did not have feeding damage from tent caterpillars the previous season to test the bottom-up fitness effects of intraspecific competition. We measured host-plant quality to test potential mechanisms for bottom-up effects and conducted field oviposition surveys to determine if female adult tent caterpillars avoided host plants with evidence of prior tent caterpillar presence. We found that time-lagged intraspecific competition impacted tent caterpillar fitness by reducing female pupal mass, which is a predictor of lifetime fitness. We found that plants that had been fed upon by tent caterpillars the previous season had leaves that were significantly tougher than plants that had not been fed upon by tent caterpillars, which may explain why female tent caterpillars suffered reduced fitness on these plants. Finally, we found that there were fewer tent caterpillar egg masses on plants that had tent caterpillars earlier in the season than plants without tent caterpillars, which suggests that adult females avoid these plants for oviposition. Our results confirm that intraspecific competition occurs among tent caterpillars and suggests that time-lagged intraspecific competition has been overlooked as an important component of insect fitness.","[Barnes, Elizabeth E.; Murphy, Shannon M.] Univ Denver, Dept Biol Sci, FW Olin Hall,Room 102,2190 E Iliff Ave, Denver, CO 80208 USA","Barnes, EE (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Dept Biol Sci, FW Olin Hall,Room 102,2190 E Iliff Ave, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",barnes.elizabeth20@gmail.com,"Murphy, Shannon M./Q-2139-2017","Murphy, Shannon M./0000-0002-5746-6536",Boulder County; Jefferson County,"We thank Boulder and Jefferson Counties for funding and for their assistance on this project by issuing research permits.

These continuum models seem to overcome some limitations intrinsically associated to other alternative approaches based on mass balances in multiphase systems, because the crucial role played by residual stresses accompanying growth and nutrients walkway is preserved. Nevertheless, when these strategies are applied to analyze solid tumors, mass growth is usually assigned in a prescribed form that essentially copies the in vitro measured intrinsic growth rates of the cell species. As a consequence, some important cell-cell dynamics governing mass evolution and invasion rates of cancer cells, as well as their coupling with feedback mechanisms associated to in situ stresses, are inevitably lost and thus the spatial distribution and the evolution with time of the growth inside the tumor-which would be results rather than inputs- are forced to enter in the model simply as data. In order to solve this paradox, it is here proposed an enhanced multi-scale poroelastic model undergoing large deformations and embodying inelastic growth, where the net growth terms directly result from the interspecific predator-prey (Volterra/Lotka-like) competition occurring at the micro-scale level between healthy and abnormal cell species. In this way, a system of fully-coupled non-linear PDEs is derived to describe how the fight among cell species to grab the available common resources, stress field, pressure gradients, interstitial fluid flows driving nutrients and inhomogeneous growth all simultaneously interact to decide the tumor fate.

Reintroduced predators, for example, may create unanticipated competition scenarios that influence local carnivore guilds. Here, we tested whether newly released Mexican gray wolves in Chihuahua, Mexico interacted with resident pumas, as a first step in exploring potential competition between the two species. We employed GPS data and novel methods offered by MoveMine 2.0 to quantify attraction-repulsion between individual wolves and pumas during two time periods: the first when wolves were free roaming, and the second when they restricted their movements to an area around their den and rendezvous site to protect and provide for pups. In summary, attraction-repulsion analyses conducted with MoveMine provided meaningful outputs, but we would highlight the importance of fieldwork to interpret interactions and significance values calculated between pairs. We found that high attraction values resulted from mutual attraction between wolves in the same pack, between wolves and one puma they repeatedly harassed, as well as between two pumas that repeatedly exhibited social tolerance for each other. Thus, the analyses offered by MoveMine provided a powerful means of identifying interactions and assessing attraction-repulsion relevant to questions of intra- and interspecific competition, but required intimate knowledge of the species studied and the interactions between them to interpret outputs correctly.

During daylight hours they remain in an akinetic state inside their shelters, whereas at dusk they become active and move outside. When they are outside their shelters during the photophase, triatomines are vulnerable to diurnal predators and the period just before dawn is critical to their survival. This work analyses the existence of competitive interactions involved in the occupancy of shelters by triatomines. Behavioural assays were performed in which nymphs of different stages, nutritional status or species were released in an experimental arena containing a space-limited artificial shelter. The proportions of individuals occupying the shelter during the photophase were quantified to estimate the competitive abilities of each stage and species. Intraspecific comparisons showed higher levels of shelter occupancy for fourth over fifth instars and fed over unfed nymphs of Triatoma infestans. Interspecific comparisons showed higher rates of shelter occupancy for Triatoma sordida in comparison with T. infestans, and for T. infestans over Rhodnius prolixus. Arrival order was also relevant to determining shelter occupancy levels: early arrival was advantageous in comparison with later arrival. The study of intra-and interspecific competitive interactions for shelter occupancy provides relevant information about colonization and recolonization processes in the natural environments of triatomines.","[Zacharias, C.

The canid guild in Hamadan province, west of Iran, comprises three species: the gray wolf Canis lupus pallipes, the golden jackal Canis aureus, and the red fox Vulpes vulpes. In this area, habitat transformation and agricultural land uses have significantly reduced wild prey populations. In search of food, members of the canid guild are often driven to human settlements. Due to inefficient waste management, the major source of food for canids here is anthropogenic food resources, such as livestock and pet carcasses, and domestic waste illegally dumped near poultry farms and rural areas. Here, we described one of the first reports in the literature of a case of interspecific killing between a wolf and a golden jackal. On June 13, 2016, a collared wolf (adult male) killed an adult jackal (adult male). Further studies are required to understand intraguild competition among red fox, golden jackals, and wolves in this area.","[Mohammadi, Alireza; Kaboli, Mohammad] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm Sci, Karaj, Iran; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Oviedo Univ, Res Unit Biodivers, UO, CSIC,PA, Mieres 33600, Spain","Kaboli, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm Sci, Karaj, Iran.",mkaboli@ut.ac.ir,,,"National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [GEFNE128-14]; Iranian National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF); Ramon & Cajal research contract from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [RYC-2015-18932]","We would like to thank the National Geographic Society which funded this research under the grant GEFNE128-14.

During CM periods, many plant species from various families synchronously flower and subsequently undergo community-level fruiting. Seed predation is a key factor in understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors affecting CM. Masting is proposed to decrease seed mortality due to predation in two ways: by depressing predator abundance through extended and unpredictable absences of seeds; and by satiating predators via mass seed production (predator satiation hypothesis). If the hypothesis is valid in these rainforests, the incidence of seed predation will be higher in a fruiting event that occurs soon after a previous fruiting event, because the intervening period of seed absence would be inadequate to starve the predators. In this study, we examined seed predation by insects, focusing on five dipterocarp species that exceptionally reproduced twice during an extended CM period. All of the five species suffered more intense seed predation in the second fruiting event, consistent with the prediction expected from the predator satiation hypothesis. Weevils, bark beetles and mammals were the main cause of increased seed predation in three, one and one plant species, respectively. However, seed predation intensity did not increase during the second fruiting event in a few combinations of predator and plant species. We discuss the possibility that competition for seeds among predators and/or the interspecific differences in life history traits among predators might affect the varying intensities of seed predation among dipterocarp species by different seed predators.","[Iku, Asano; Itioka, Takao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068316, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Coll Arts & Sci, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Shimizu-kaya, Usun; Sakai, Shoko] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Mohammad, Fatimah Bte; Hossman, Mohamad Yazid; Bunyok, Azimah; Abd Rahman, Mohd Yusuf; Meleng, Paulus] Forest Dept Sarawak, Res Dev & Innovat Div, KM 10 Jalan Datuk Amar Kalong Ningkan, Kuching 93250, Sarawak, Malaysia","Iku, A (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068316, Japan.",asano_iku@yahoo.co.jp,,"Sakai, Shoko/0000-0002-4267-8405","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [21255004]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16J08043] Funding Source: KAKEN","This study was conducted in accordance with memorandums of understanding signed in November 2005 by the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC, Kuching, Malaysia) and the Japan Research Consortium for Tropical Forests in Sarawak (JRCTS, Sendai, Japan), and in December 2012 by the Sarawak Forest Department (SFD, Kuching, Malaysia) and JRCTS.

Of the two hummingbird species inhabiting Robinson Crusoe Island, Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile, one (Green-backed Firecrown, Sephanoides sephaniodes) has a wide mainland distribution while the other (Juan Fernandez Firecrown, Sephanoides fernandensis) is endemic and critically endangered. Even though habitat degradation and predation by exotic mammal species are known to pose major threats, little attention has been given to the influence of interspecific competition for floral nectar resources. In this study, we investigated the existence of interspecific competition by testing for spatial segregation of the two species using point counts dispersed within their suitable habitats. We additionally considered the influence of habitat type and flower abundance, which could also cause spatial segregation between the species. We found a negative association between the point count abundance of the two hummingbirds species, which remained consistent when accounting for the role of habitat type and flower abundance. Together, this could be an indication of interspecific competition in which individuals of S. fernandensis may benefit from aggregation by sharing the individual costs of chasing the vastly more abundant S. sephaniodes.","[Vizentin-Bugoni, Jeferson] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Sonne, Jesper] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Hodum, Peter] Oikonos Ecosyst Knowledge, Kailua, HI USA; [Hodum, Peter] Univ Puget Sound, Biol Dept, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA; [Hagen, Erin] Isl Conservat, Santiago, Chile; [Cordeiro, Juliana] Univ Fed Pelotas, Inst Biol, Dept Ecol Zool & Genet, Capao Do Leao, RS, Brazil","Vizentin-Bugoni, J (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",jbugoni@yahoo.com.br,"Vizentin-Bugoni, Jeferson/J-9342-2016; Cordeiro, Juliana/F-7760-2012","Vizentin-Bugoni, Jeferson/0000-0002-6343-3650; Cordeiro, Juliana/0000-0003-0902-9638",,,,26,2,2,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0021-8375,1439-0361,,J ORNITHOL,J.

In the Florida Keys (USA), anecdotal observations have long pointed to an inverse relationship in abundance of two large decapod crustaceans found co-occurring in hard-bottom habitat, the stone crab Menippe mercenaria and the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. We used them to explicitly test whether competition for a renewable resource (shelter) can drive the abundance and distribution of the inferior competitor. We first explored this relationship in shelter competition mesocosm experiments to determine the competitively dominant species. Results showed that stone crabs are clearly the dominant competitors regardless of the number of lobsters present, the presence of co-sheltering species such as the spider crab, Damithrax spinosissimus, or the order of introduction of competitors into the mesocosm. We also found that lobsters use chemical cues from stone crabs to detect and avoid them. We then tested the ramifications of this competitive dominance in the field by manipulating stone crab abundance and then tracking the abundance and distribution of spiny lobsters through time. Increased stone crab abundance immediately resulted in decreased lobster abundance and increased aggregation. The opposite occurred on sites where stone crabs were removed. When we stopped removing stone crabs from these sites, they soon returned and lobster abundance decreased. This study explicitly demonstrated that interspecific competition can drive population dynamics between these species, and ultimately, community composition in these shallow water habitats.","[Behringer, Donald C.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Behringer, Donald C.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Behringer, Donald C.; Hart, John E.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",behringer@ufl.edu,,,University of Florida School of Natural Resources and EnvironmentUniversity of Florida; NOAA Florida Sea Grant College Program [R/LR-B-65]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0928398],"We thank D.

The system studied in this paper corresponds to the type of models with exponential fading memory where the logistic per capita rate growth of the prey is given by an arbitrary function of class C-k, k >= 3. We prove that the model has a Hopf bifurcation and that there exist open sets in the parameter space such that the system exhibits singular attractors and asymptotically stable limit cycles. A numerical simulation is conducted in order to show the existence of critical attractor elements. As pointed out by Ayala et al. in [14], the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition, which is based on the logistic theory of population growth and assumes that the intra and interspecific competitive interactions between species are linear, does not explain satisfactorily the population dynamics of some species. This is due to fact that the model does not take into account some important features of the population, which affect its dynamics. The model introduced in this paper provides independent conditions of these facts, for the existence of a Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotically stable limit cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These community-wide general flowering events are thought to facilitate seed survival through satiation of generalist seed predators. During a general flowering event, closely related Shorea species (Dipterocarpaceae) stagger their flowering times by several weeks, which may minimize cross pollination and interspecific competition for pollinators. Generalist, pre-dispersal seed predators might also track flowering hosts and influence predator satiation. We addressed the question of whether pre-dispersal seed predation differed between early and late flowering Shorea species by monitoring flowering, fruiting and seed predation intensity over two general flowering events at the Pasoh Research Forest, Malaysia. Pre-dispersal insect seed predators killed up to 63 percent of developing seeds, with Nanophyes shoreae, a weevil that feeds on immature seeds being the most important predator for all Shorea species. This weevil caused significantly greater pre-dispersal seed predation in earlier flowering species. Long larval development time precluded oviposition by adults that emerged from the earliest flowering Shorea on the final flowering Shorea. In contrast, larvae of weevils that feed on mature seeds before seed dispersal (Alcidodes spp.), appeared in seeds of all Shorea species almost simultaneously. We conclude that general flowering events have the potential to satiate post-dispersal seed predators and pre-dispersal seed predators of mature fruit, but are less effective at satiating pre-dispersal predators of immature fruit attacking early flowering species. Abstrak Pelbagai spesies Dipterocarpaceae serta keluarga tumbuhan lain berbunga serentak di hutan Asia Tenggara dalam jangka masa yang tidak dapat dijangka. Pembungaan umum ini dianggap memudahkan kemandirian biji benih melalui lambakan biji benih yang memenuhi keperluan pemangsa biji benih. Semasa pembungaan besar-besaran ini spesies-spesies Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) yang bertalian rapat mengeluarkan bunga secara berperingkat dalam beberapa minggu. Hal ini dapat mengurangkan pendebungaan serentak serta persaingan interspesifik untuk pendebunga. Pemangsa umum bagi biji benih yang belum gugur (prapenyebaran) mungkin juga mengesan pokok-pokok yang berbunga dan mempengaruhi keperluan pemangsa. Persoalan kami adalah sama ada pemangsa biji benih berbeza semasa awal atau akhir waktu pembungaan spesies Shorea berdasarkan hasil pemeriksaan intensiti pembungaan, pembuahan serta pemangsa biji benih semasa dua musim pembungaan besar-besaran di hutan penyelidikan Pasoh. Serangga pemangsa biji benih merosakkan sehingga 63% daripada biji benih yang sedang membesar dengan Nanophyes shoreae sebagai kumbang yang paling banyak memakan biji benih yang belum matang bagi semua spesies Shorea. Kumbang ini memberi kesan paling signifikan terhadap biji benih yang belum matang bagi spesies yang berbunga awal. Masa perkembangan larva yang panjang menghalang oviposisi kumbang dewasa yang muncul dari awal pembungaan Shorea hingga akhir pembungaan Shorea. Sebaliknya, larva kumbang yang memakan biji benih matang sebelum penyebaran biji benih (Alcidodes spp.) terdapat dalam setiap biji benih spesies Shorea hampir serentak. Kami simpulkan bahawa kejadian pembungaan besar-besaran berpotensi dalam memenuhi keperluan pemangsa biji benih selepas penyebaran serta prapenyebaran untuk buah-buahan matang, tetapi kurang efektif dalam memenuhi keperluan pemangsa prapenyebaran buah-buahan tidak matang yang menyerang spesies berbunga awal.","[Hosaka, Tetsuro; Numata, Shinya] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Tourism Sci, Sch Urban Environm Sci, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan; [Yumoto, Takakazu] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Chen, Yu-Yun; Sun, I-Fang] Natl Donghwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien 97401, Taiwan; [Wright, S.

Anthropogenic landscape change, particularly resulting from urbanization, can alter interspecific interactions; however, different forms of urbanization are predicted to have contrasting effects on competitive interactions. We developed contact networks between bobcats and pumas to evaluate (1) the potential for interspecific interactions between wild felids and (2) how space-use metrics might change along the urban gradient, including low-density exurban development, wild-land-urban interface, and wildland habitat, at both the population and individual level. We used an extensive telemetry data set for bobcats and pumas across multiple study areas to evaluate four space-use metrics: space-use overlap (used to define potential interactions among animals) and three additional contact network metrics, including degree (the number of potentially interacting animals), in-strength (sum of space-use overlap for animals), and equivalent social connectivity (ESC; considering both space-use extent and the amount of space-use overlap). Space-use extent was an important predictor of potential social interactions as measured by space-use metrics. Bobcats appeared to have a greater opportunity to interact with female pumas based on space-use overlap, degree, and in-strength, which demonstrates that relative scale of space-use extent among animals could be important for understanding interactions; ESC, however, was greater between bobcats and male pumas, likely due to the larger space-use extent by male compared to female pumas and the positive relationship between space-use extent and ESC. In addition, pumas and male bobcats exhibited a greater opportunity to interact, based on space-use overlap, degree, and in-strength, and demonstrated higher ESC compared to female bobcats. Counter to our predictions, felids associated with urbanized grids or with greater amounts of urbanization in their extent of space use did not appear to exhibit greater values of space-use metrics compared to animals with less exposure to urbanization; these results appear consistent with previous research evaluating population characteristics of felids across broad scales in our study areas. Greater ESC for male pumas and male bobcats suggests that males could be particularly important for facilitating connectivity of some ecological processes, such as the transmission of disease, through interspecific contact networks.","[Lewis, Jesse S.; Crooks, Kevin R.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Logan, Kenneth A.] Colorado Pk & Wildlife, Montrose, CO 81401 USA; [Alldredge, Mat W.] Colorado Pk & Wildlife, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Lewis, Jesse S.; Theobald, David M.] Conservat Sci Partners, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA; [Vandewoude, Sue] Colorado State Univ, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Lewis, JS (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.; Lewis, JS (corresponding author), Conservat Sci Partners, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA.",jslewis.research@gmail.com,,,"Colorado State University; Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW); Boulder County Parks and Open Space; Boulder City Open Space and Mountain Parks; Bureau of Land Management; U.S. Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; National Science Foundation-Ecology of Infectious Diseases ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0723676, EF-1413925]","Funding and support were provided by Colorado State University, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW), Boulder County Parks and Open Space, Boulder City Open Space and Mountain Parks, the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, and a grant from the National Science Foundation-Ecology of Infectious Diseases Program (NSF EF-0723676; EF-1413925).

Marine fouling communities are excellent study systems for competition because of space limitation and the abundance of invasive species. While many studies have examined individual or site-specific responses to changes in temperature or presence of invasive species, it is difficult to predict ecological impacts without assessing interspecific interactions over a wide geographic range. This study compared interactions between several globally distributed invasive fouling species over a broad geographic range. Weekly examination of photographs of settlement panels in marinas at 18 sites around the world allowed for the quantification of competitive outcomes. In the north Atlantic, experimental panels became covered with fouling organisms exponentially faster at warmer temperatures, while northeast and south Pacific sites did not. An invasive ascidian (Diplosoma listerianum) and bryozoan (Bugula neritina) were strong competitors, but most species displayed a negative response in high competition settings where there was little available space. Two species (Botryllus schlosseri and Botrylloides violaceus) had better competitive outcomes at cooler temperatures, possibly due to fewer strong competitors at these sites. Thus, warmer sites with little open space and multiple strong competitors are likely most resistant to future invasions, while colder sites with more open space and weaker competitors would be more susceptible to invasive species. These results suggest that the establishment and spread of invasive fouling species is likely to be influence by seawater temperature, available space, and the competitive abilities of community members.","[Lord, Joshua P.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA","Lord, JP (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",joshua.p.lord@gmail.com,,"Lord, Joshua/0000-0003-3020-5704",Bates College Faculty Development Fund,"Thanks to Brielle Dalvano, who assembled and shipped research equipment and coordinated collaborations with high school students and teachers.

Past studies have focused on a limited number of communities at local or regional scales, thus precluding a comprehensive examination of assembly rules. We addressed this challenge by examining stream fish community assembly within numerous independent watersheds spanning a broad environmental gradient. We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) are fish communities structured non-randomly, and (2) what is the relative importance of environmental filtering, predator-prey interactions and interspecific competition in driving species associations? LocationThe conterminous USA. MethodsWe used null models to analyse species associations in streams. Non-random communities were defined as those where the summed number of segregated and aggregated species pairs exceeded the number expected by chance. We used species traits to characterize species dissimilarity in environmental requirements (ENV), identify potential predator-prey interactions (PRED) and estimate likely degree of competition based on species similarity in body size, feeding strategies and phylogeny (COMP). To evaluate the effect of environmental filtering, predation and competition on species associations, we related ENV, PRED and COMP to the degree of species segregation. ResultsThe majority (75-85%) of watersheds had non-random fish communities. Species segregation increased with species dissimilarity in environmental requirements (ENV). An increase in competition strength (COMP) did not appear to increase segregation. Species pairs engaging in predator-prey interactions (PRED) were more segregated than non-predator-prey pairs. ENV was more predictive of the degree of species segregation than PRED. Main conclusionsWe provide compelling evidence for widespread non-random structure in US stream fish communities. Community assembly is governed largely by environmental filtering, followed by predator-prey interactions, whereas the influence of interspecific competition appears minimal. Applying a traits-based approach to continent-wide datasets provides a powerful approach for examining the existence of assembly rules in nature.","[Giam, Xingli; Olden, Julian D.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Giam, XL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",giamxingli@gmail.com,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187; Giam, Xingli/0000-0002-5239-9477","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington","We extend our sincere gratitude to all the individuals and agencies that shared their fish datasets, and applaud their collective hard work, collaborative generosity and foresight.

Embryo aggregation has been successfully applied to improve cloning efficiency in mammals, but it remains unclear whether it could also be beneficial for iSCNT. In this study, we first compared the effect of embryo aggregation over in vitro development and blastocyst quality of porcine, bovine, and feline zona-free (ZF) parthenogenetic (PA) embryos to test the effects of embryo aggregation on species that were later used as enucleated oocytes donors in our iSCNT study. We then assessed whether embryo aggregation could improve the in vitro development of ZF equine iSCNT embryos after reconstruction with porcine, bovine, and feline ooplasm. Bovine- and porcine-aggregated PA blastocysts had significantly larger diameters compared with nonaggregated embryos. On the other hand, feline- and bovine-aggregated PA embryos had higher blastocyst cell number. Embryo aggregation of equine-equine SCNT was found to be beneficial for embryo development as we have previously reported, but the aggregation of three ZF reconstructed embryos did not improve embryo developmental rates on iSCNT. In vitro embryo development of nonaggregated iSCNT was predominantly arrested around the stage when transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome is reported to start on the embryo of the donor species. Nevertheless, independent of embryo aggregation, equine blastocyst-like structures could be obtained in our study using domestic feline-enucleated oocytes. Taken together, these results reported that embryo aggregation enhance in vitro PA embryo development and embryo quality but effects vary depending on the species. Embryo aggregation also improves, as expected, the in vitro embryo development of equine-equine SCNT embryos; however, we did not observe positive effects on equine iSCNT embryo development. Among oocytes from domestic animals tested in our study, the feline ooplasm might be the most appropriate recipient to partially allow preimplantation embryo development of iSCNT equine embryos.

Therefore, the effects of predation can be both consumptive and nonconsumptive and prey need to assess and respond appropriately to predation risk which in turn varies with environmental and social contexts. We tested the effects of predator density and diel cycle on the consumption, interspecific interactions and behavioural responses of a prey species, the native Australian glass shrimp, Paratya australiensis, exposed to a predator, the invasive eastern mosquito fish, Gambusia holbrooki. In the laboratory, P. australiensis were exposed to low or high densities of conspecifics or predators and observed during the day and at night. While P. australiensis experienced more interspecific approaches and nips when exposed to a high density of G. holbrooki and during the day, neither predator density nor diel cycle influenced the actual number of P. australiensis consumed. Similarly, while P. australiensis engaged in significantly more shelter use and swam less, there was no difference in these behaviours in relation to predator density and diel cycle. Foraging by P. australiensis was not related to species composition, but instead depended on the overall number of animals present with more P. australiensis foraging when exposed to a high density of conspecifics and G. holbrooki. These results indicate that the mechanisms by which G. holbrooki exerts negative effects on P. australiensis can be multiple and wide ranging, from direct predation to a reduction in activity and competition for resources. However, as neither predator density nor diurnal variation altered predation rate, P. australiensis did behave in an adaptive manner, by only adjusting its behavioural responses in proportion to the direct risk of predation.

Short-term to decadal-scale weather patterns can impact grasshopper population dynamics, but drought impacts on grasshoppers have rarely been studied in manipulative experiments. A cage experiment was conducted in eastern Montana to examine the impact of intra- and interspecific competition and precipitation manipulation treatments on performance of a common melanopline grasshopper Phoetaliotes nebrascensis (Thomas). High-density and drought treatments had similarly strong negative impacts on food availability. Proportional grasshopper survival did not differ significantly by treatment, but density dependence was evident in both body size and reproductive traits. The impact of precipitation and density treatments on grasshopper body size and reproduction were typically similar in magnitude and much larger than interspecific competition, with the exception of male femur length. Even with high late summer precipitation, drought had strong effects on individual body size and future reproduction. This study provides valuable information on population dynamics of an abundant grasshopper, with moderate precipitation reductions negatively affecting reproduction and body size. No positive impacts of drought as predicted by the plant stress hypothesis were observed. The study reinforces the need to examine drought manipulations to better predict grasshopper population changes due to changing climate conditions.","[Branson, David H.] ARS, USDA, Northern Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Branson, DH (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, Northern Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",dave.branson@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,40,4,5,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Here, we investigate the phenotypic, ecological and phylogenetic correlates of interspecific territoriality in wood warblers (Parulidae). Interspecifically territorial species have more recent common ancestors and are more similar phenotypically, and are more likely to hybridise, than sympatric, non-interspecifically territorial species. After phylogenetic corrections, however, similarity in plumage and territorial song are the only significant predictors of interspecific territoriality besides syntopy (fine-scale geographic overlap). Our results do not support the long-standing hypothesis that interspecific territoriality occurs only under circumstances in which niche divergence is restricted, which combined with the high incidence of interspecific territoriality in wood warblers (39% of species), suggests that this interspecific interaction is more stable, ecologically and evolutionarily, than commonly assumed.","[Losin, Neil; Drury, Jonathan P.; Peiman, Kathryn S.; Storch, Chaya; Grether, Gregory F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Drury, Jonathan P.] Inst Biol ENS, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France; [Peiman, Kathryn S.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Grether, GF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",ggrether@ucla.edu,"Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011",,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1020586, DEB-1457844]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1457844] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank I.J.

I conducted two playback experiments to measure interspecific aggression between two sympatric Australo-Papuan robin species that inhabit the understorey of montane New Guinean forests: Slaty Robin Peneothello cyanus and Ashy Robin Heteromyias albispecularis. The first experiment, at a location where both species were present, demonstrated strong asymmetric interspecific aggression; the larger Ashy Robin responded as aggressively to Slaty Robin playback as to conspecific playback, but Slaty Robins did not respond to Ashy Robin playback. In contrast, in the second experiment, which took place at a nearby site where Slaty Robins were absent, Ashy Robins did not respond aggressively to Slaty Robin playback. Thus, Ashy Robin interspecific aggression appears to be a learned response to the presence of Slaty Robins, and may reflect resource competition between these two sympatric species.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Freeman, Benjamin G.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY USA","Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA.; Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY USA.",bgf27@cornell.edu,,,Athena Fund of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology; Atkinson Sustainable Biodiversity Fund; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [2011083591],"I thank many YUS residents, A.

Furthermore, female Ae. aegypti from populations in sympatry with Ae. albopictus have evolved reproductive character displacement and changes in mating behavior to reduce interspecific mating. In this article, we examine evolutionary responses of males to interspecific mating and show that satyrization has also evoked reproductive character displacement in males. We demonstrate that the presence of heterospecific females negatively influences conspecific mating success in male Ae. aegypti, most likely due to misdirected courting or mating efforts, and that males of this species from populations in sympatry with Ae. albopictus have evolved to be less influenced by the presence of heterospecific females than their allopatric counterparts. Conversely, we suggest that the presence of conspecifics may, in some circumstances, increase interspecific mating. This study demonstrates that co-occurrences of these two invasive species may lead to evolution and adaptation of reproductive behaviors to changing circumstances. Understanding the processes driving development of mate choice preferences or avoidance mechanisms may help predict future changes in the distribution and abundance of insect vectors or pests.","[Bargielowski, Irka; Blosser, Erik; Lounibos, L.

Nonetheless, when prey availability declines, interspecific competition among consumers should increase and could lead to increased intraguild predation. We examined these potential effects in a generalist predator of the tundra, the Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus), over a 7-yr period characterized by large fluctuations in lemming abundance, a potential prey item for gulls. We studied diet by analyzing regurgitated pellets collected at nests and blood nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, and we monitored annual nesting density and reproductive success on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. Stable isotopes revealed a relatively similar contribution of terrestrial and marine food sources to the gull diet, although the terrestrial contribution increased in the year of high lemming abundance. According to analysis of pellets, diet during incubation was dominated by geese and lemmings, whereas geese were the main prey during chick-rearing. As expected for a generalist predator, annual variation in diet during incubation reflected overall lemming abundance, and the increased consumption of geese during chick-rearing was associated with an influx of goose families into the study area at that time. Gull nest density, laying date, clutch size, and mass gain of chicks did not vary with lemming population fluctuations. Hatching success, on the other hand, was positively related to lemming abundance and was greater for nests located on islets than for those along the shores of ponds and lakes. Intraguild predation on gull eggs by predators such as Arctic foxes, which primarily feed on lemmings during the summer, was probably the main cause of nest failure. Although a generalist predator like the Glaucous Gull has a diversified diet and may feed only opportunistically on lemmings, our results suggest that large cyclical fluctuations in lemming abundance may still affect gull reproductive success through intraguild predation.","[Gauthier, Gilles; Valiquette, Marc-Andre; Cadieux, Marie-Christine; Therrien, Jean-Francois] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles; Valiquette, Marc-Andre; Cadieux, Marie-Christine; Therrien, Jean-Francois] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Legagneux, Pierre] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Legagneux, Pierre] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Therrien, Jean-Francois] Hawk Mt Sanctuary, Orwigsburg, PA USA","Gauthier, G (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",gilles.gauthier@bio.ulaval.ca,,"Legagneux, Pierre/0000-0002-6366-0554",International Polar Year program of the Government of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Network of Centre of Excellence ArcticNet; Polar Continental Shelf program of Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources Canada; Fond Quebecois de Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies; Garfield-Weston Foundation; Parks Canada,"This study was funded by the International Polar Year program of the Government of Canada, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Network of Centre of Excellence ArcticNet, the Polar Continental Shelf program of Natural Resources Canada, the Fond Quebecois de Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies, the Garfield-Weston Foundation, and Parks Canada.

They threaten a native species of similar biology, the European bullhead, by displacing them from shelters. These shelters are necessary for reproduction as well as for protection against predators and hydrodynamic forces. However, abiotic conditions may strongly modify the outcome of an interspecific competition in the wild. Nevertheless, little is known of the effect of flow velocity on the competition between these rheophilic species, although this factor is crucial for their distribution in the field. We video-recorded fish behaviour for 2h in single-species and mixed-species pairs in the presence of single shelters at three flow velocities: 0, 10 (a velocity preferred by the racer goby) and 30cms(-1) (a velocity greater than preferred by the racer goby) to determine whether the invader can deprive the native species of its shelter. At the flow of 0 and 10cms(-1), the racer goby exhibited aggressive behaviour towards bullhead, and this restricted the time spent by the bullhead in the shelter.

Because of the postulated global increase in CO2 levels, co-existence of maricultured algae and native species seems like an inevitable challenge. In this study, comparative and interactive growth and photosynthetic responses of the maricultured macroalga Gracilaria lemaneiformis (Rhodophyta) and a common native epiphyte Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta) to elevated CO2 levels were investigated, in order to estimate the interspecific competition between these two algae. The results showed that U. lactuca exhibited a relatively higher growth rate and maximum net photosynthetic rate than G. lemaneiformis. Growth and photosynthesis of G. lemaneiformis were inhibited in the presence of U. lactuca. This inhibition of G. lemaneiformis was more severe when grown under elevated CO2 levels. When U. lactuca was bicultured, elevated CO2 levels caused a significant increase in light harvesting efficiency and maximum quantumyield. Moreover, U. lactuca showed relatively higher pigment contents and a higher correlation between chlorophyll a and maximum relative electron transport rates, indicating a relatively higher efficiency in light utilization. The interspecific competition between G. lemaneiformis and U. lactuca was most probably due to the rapid growth of U. lactuca. We believe that, on the basis of the predicted scenario of elevated CO2 levels, the epiphyte U. lactuca would presumably have greater negative impacts on G. lemaneiformis maricultivation; therefore, more labor would be required to reduce the epiphytization of this species during G. lemaneiformis mariculture.

The net birthrate is cubic, so that the model allows simulation of the Allee effect, whereby extinction is stable and intermediate populations promote growth, while saturation occurs via cubic competition terms. The model includes both interspecies and intraspecies nonlocal competition which enters via convolution integrals with a specified asymmetric competition kernel function. We introduce two parameters, delta, describing the extent of the coupling, with delta = 0 corresponding to local coupling, and alpha, describing the extent of the asymmetry, with alpha = 0 corresponding to symmetric nonlocal interactions. We consider the case where the local model admits a stable coexistence (populations of both species positive) equilibrium solution. We perform a linear stability analysis and show that this solution can be destabilized by sufficient nonlocality, i.e., when delta increases beyond a critical value. We then consider nonlinear patterns, far from the stability boundary. We show that nonlinear patterns consist of arrays of islands, regions of nonzero population, separated by deadzones, where the populations are essentially extinct, (with the array propagating in the case alpha not equal 0). The predominant effect of the cubic model is that the islands for the two species are disjoint, so that each species lives in the deadzone of the other species. In addition, some patterns involve both hospitable and inhospitable deadzones, so that islands form in only some of the deadzones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Tanzy, M.

Crimson fountaingrass, Pennisetum setaceum, an exotic perennial C-4 species and a relatively new invader to California, is expanding to areas currently occupied by purple needlegrass, Stipa pulchra, a C-3 native. We predicted that fountaingrass seedlings might withstand cool season competition in California's Mediterranean-type climate and establish in Stipa pulchra grasslands due to less competition during the warm, dry summer season, and that interactions might be influenced by density. A field experiment was conducted to examine competitive interactions of the two species from the cool winter season to the warm summer season. As predicted, Stipa produced greater abovegroundbiomass in the cool season and showed strong intraspecific competition, as well as interspecific suppression of Pennisetum growth, whereas Pennisetum showed no suppression of Stipa. In the warm season, Stipa showed relatively less suppression of Pennisetum, erasing significant differences, and Pennisetum showed increased growth. Results of this study show that C-3 Stipa can suppress initial growth of C-4 Pennisetum in the cool season, but in warmer months, Pennisetum can overcome this initial suppression at both low and high densities, even within a Mediterranean-type climate with little to no summer rainfall. Thus, in southern California, temporal niche partitioning due to photosynthetic pathway in these two species can allow Pennisetum invasion. Given the similarity in life history and growth form of Stipa and Pennisetum, few options exist for controlling Pennisetum in habitats where Stipa occurs. In these cases, restoration plantings of desirable species are essential in order to reestablish competitive vegetation that will be more resistant to invasion.","[Sweet, Lynn C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Agr & Nat Resources, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Sweet, LC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",lsweet@bren.ucsb.edu,"Sweet, Lynn/P-4924-2019","Sweet, Lynn/0000-0003-0886-4973","University of California, Riverside Graduate DivisionUniversity of California System; National Science Foundation NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-1065864]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1065753] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Emerging FrontiersNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1065824, 1065864, 1065826] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","The authors gratefully acknowledge assistance from R.

In this study, we use mathematical models to explore the ecological and evolutionary factors that modulate the explanatory power of phylogenetic information for communities of species that interact within a single trophic level. We find that phylogenetic relationships among species can influence trait evolution and rates of interaction among species, but only under particular models of species interaction. For example, when interactions within communities are mediated by a mechanism of phenotype matching, phylogenetic trees make specific predictions about trait evolution and rates of interaction. In contrast, if interactions within a community depend on a mechanism of phenotype differences, phylogenetic information has little, if any, predictive power for trait evolution and interaction rate. Together, these results make clear and testable predictions for when and how evolutionary history is expected to influence contemporary rates of species interaction.","[Nuismer, Scott L.; Harmon, Luke J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Inst Bioinformat & Evolutionary Studies IBEST, Moscow, ID 83843 USA","Nuismer, SL (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Inst Bioinformat & Evolutionary Studies IBEST, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",snuismer@uidaho.edu,,"Harmon, Luke/0000-0002-4985-5750","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS 0540392, DEB 1118947, DEB 0919499, DEB 1208912]","We thank Matt Pennell, Blake Matthews, Catherine Wagner and Mike Alfaro for helpful comments and NSF grants DMS 0540392 and DEB 1118947 (SLN) and DEB 0919499 and DEB 1208912 (LJH) for funding.",,44,65,65,0,98,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Together with large carnivorous flightless birds, they comprised the terrestrial predator guild. The Santacrucian sparassodonts were diverse in body size, had different locomotory habits, and were primarily hypercarnivores. The objective of this work is to analyze the guild structure of the sparassodonts of the Santa Cruz Formation, using the variables of body mass, diet, and locomotion as proxies. Furthermore, we analyze the interaction with other predators and potential prey. The univariated test V of Poole and Rathcke and the multivariated test of Clark-Evans were used to construct the models. In the multivariate test, we made a Principal Component Analysis to resume and standardize the variables. With body mass and locomotion we obtained an evenly spaced pattern of segregation for the sparassodont species, being non-significant and significant, respectively. The pattern was aggregated and significant only with diet. The analysis of all variables together resulted in an evenly spaced and significant pattern, which is consistent with character displacements (segregation of species throughout the morphospace) that would help to diminish interspecific competition during the Santacrucian age and would allow selection of prey species of different sizes and substrate specializations. When the body size pattern of predator birds and sparassodonts were plotted together, the pattern is evenly spaced and non-significant. Other factors, including locomotion, would differentiate these species and their ecological niches.","[Ercoli, Marcos D.; Prevosti, Francisco J.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Div Mastozool, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Forasiepi, Analia M.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CCT Mendoza, Ianigla, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Prevosti, Francisco J.] Univ Nacl Lujan, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Lujan Buenos Aires, Argentina","Ercoli, MD (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Div Mastozool, Av Angel Gallardo 470,C1405DJR, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",marcosdarioercoli@hotmail.com; protocyon@hotmail.com; borhyaena@hotmail.com,,,"CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 112-201101-00164]; ANPCyTANPCyT [PICT 2011-309]; FCNyM-UNLPNational University of La Plata [N474]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0851272, 0824546]","We express our gratitude to Sergio Vizcaino and Susana Bargo who provided information about the SCF and allowed access to the new specimens collected from the unit; the curators Marcelo Reguero, Alejandro Kramarz, Stella Alvarez, and Walter Joyce for assistance during collection visits; Simon D.

In this review, we discuss what is known about the patterns of adaptive evolution of gamete recognition proteins (GRPs). We focus on species that broadcast eggs and sperm into the environment for external fertilization, as the ease of observing and manipulating gamete interactions has allowed for greater advances in the understanding of GRP evolution, uncomplicated by confounding behavioral and physiological components that offer alternative evolutionary targets in internal fertilizers. We discuss whether interspecific mechanisms, such as selection to avoid fertilization between species (reinforcement selection), or intraspecific mechanisms, such as selection to increase (or decrease) the affinity between eggs and sperm based on the intensity of sperm competition, may be responsible for the pattern of GRP evolution observed. Variation in these proteins appears to influence gametic compatibility; GRP divergence among species is a better predictor of hybrid fertilization than neutral genetic markers and GRP variation within species predicts reproductive success among individuals within a population. Evidence suggests that sperm competition may play a large role in the evolution of gametic compatibility.","[Kosman, E. T.; Levitan, D.

Major global change drivers (e.g. land-use change) have induced declines in many native species, while facilitating only a few. Given that many resources are predicted to become increasingly scarce under the joint effects of climate and land-use change, disturbance-tolerant species that are able to defend high-value resources may further limit the persistence of disturbance-sensitive species. We sought to determine which nectarivorous birds track variation in flowering and if relationships between nectarivores and flowering are affected by on-transect vegetation structure or the occurrence of a native, hyper-aggressive species, the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, which has become more prevalent. We measured eucalypt flowering and abundances of nectarivorous birds over the course of a year; we measured vegetation structure on the same forest transects. Nectarivores tracked spatial and some temporal variation in flowering, but this relationship was disrupted by noisy miners. Where present in sufficient numbers, the noisy miner excluded small-bodied nectarivores (<63g) from fragments, limiting the ability of this numerically dominant component of the avifauna to gain access to flowering resources. Altered patterns of interspecific competition due to vegetation fragmentation and climate-induced degradation may have led to changes in the distribution of small nectarivore species that is a departure from the ideal free distribution' model. Interactions between noisy miners and small-bodied nectarivores appear to be best described by the ideal despotic distribution' model in which noisy miners exclude smaller competitors and monopolize local resources. Increases in the severity and frequency of extreme climatic events (e.g. long droughts) predicted under climate change may create a boom-bust pattern of availabilities of resources. The apparent insensitivity of noisy miners to such variation in flowering resource availability and the miners' influence on the ability of small nectarivores to access resources may lead to disproportionate declines in smaller-bodied nectarivorous species. Reduced tracking of flowering by nectarivores has the potential to disrupt ecosystem services (e.g. pollination, seed dispersal) and may have long-term consequences for the persistence of fragmented vegetation, adding further pressure on forest-dependent biota.","[Bennett, Joanne M.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Bennett, Joanne M.; Clarke, Rohan H.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Thomson, James R.; Mac Nally, Ralph] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia","Bennett, JM (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Joanne.Bennett@monash.edu,"Thomson, Jim/W-2950-2019","Bennett, Joanne.

We tested for the effect of an antibiotic, tetracycline, on interspecific interactions in vitro among four species of aquatic bacteria isolated from European water bodies. Interactions among species in experimental microcosms containing artificial lake water (ALW) supplemented with glucose were largely competitive, as detected by comparing mixed cultures to pure cultures of their constituent species. Sublethal concentrations of tetracycline changed the relative competitive abilities of different species and revealed considerable variation in antibiotic sensitivity, but did not reduce the average strength of competition. Interspecific interactions at a given concentration were largely predictable from growth in pure cultures and indirect interactions with other species. These results suggest that antibiotics such as tetracycline may have important consequences for interactions among bacterial species, but in our experiments this was because species varied in their capacities for growth in the presence of tetracycline, rather than reduced competition at increasing tetracycline concentrations.","[Hall, Alex R.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Corno, Gianluca] CNR Inst Ecosyst Study, I-28922 Verbania, Italy","Corno, G (corresponding author), CNR Inst Ecosyst Study, Microbial Ecol Grp, Largo Tonolli 50, I-28922 Verbania, Italy.",g.corno@ise.cnr.it,"CORNO, GIANLUCA/AAB-8889-2019; Corno, Gianluca/K-1658-2018","CORNO, GIANLUCA/0000-0002-7423-8797; Corno, Gianluca/0000-0002-7423-8797; Hall, Alex/0000-0002-3654-1373",Short-Term Mobility programme 2013 of the National Research Council of Italy; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework ProgrammeEuropean Commission,"G.C. was funded by the Short-Term Mobility programme 2013 of the National Research Council of Italy.

Because fertilization success is related to sperm number, size, and quality, both interspecific and intraspecific variation in these traits are predicted to correlate with the level of sperm competition. Specifically, species and individuals that experience high sperm competition are predicted to produce more sperm per ejaculate, produce longer sperm, and exert higher quality control, resulting in reduced numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm and reduced size variation via selection for the most successful sperm phenotype. However, the causes of sperm morphological and size variation and its consequences for sperm competition remain poorly understood, especially within species. We quantified variation in sperm morphology, size, and number in the Lance-tailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata), a Neotropical suboscine passerine with a cooperative lek mating system. Although alpha-status males sire almost all chicks, the numbers of sperm produced per ejaculate by betas, nonterritorial adults, and subadult males were similar to those produced by alphas. Sperm counts declined with age in alphas, which may explain the decreased siring success of older alphas. Most ejaculates contained both normal helical sperm and abnormal sperm with rounded heads. The proportion of morphologically normal sperm per ejaculate was unrelated to social status or age. The coefficients of variation in sperm component length (head, tail, and total) both between and within alpha males were comparable to variation reported in passerines with low sperm competition. Total sperm length was shorter than in the majority of avian species studied to date, and cloacal protuberance and relative testis size were small. These results indicate low sperm competition, despite evidence for multiple paternity, or that sperm number rather than sperm morphology may be a major postcopulatory mediator of male reproductive success in this species. This work represents the first thorough quantification of intraspecific sperm variability in a suboscine passerine.","[Sardell, Rebecca J.; DuVal, Emily H.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Duval, EH (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ehduval@bio.fsu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-0843334]; Florida State University,"This research was supported by National Science Foundation grant IOS-0843334 to E.H.D. and by Florida State University.

Salvelinus alpinus, however, inhabit environmental extremes ranging from lakes and rivers in the High Arctic to deep multi-fish species lakes far outside the polar region. Long-term responses to post-glacial environmental variations and successively increased interspecific interactions reveal an essential degree of natural ecological resilience and phenotypic flexibility. Case studies in Scandinavia and Newfoundland illustrate the alternate trophic roles of S. alpinus, and its flexible niche use and life-history changes in order to regain or maintain body size in gradients of lakes with increasing fish species diversity. While allopatric in northern low-productive upland lakes, landlocked populations are commonly structured by cannibalism. In sympatry with other fish species, S. alpinus mostly serve as prey, with their decreasing growth and body size reflecting the successive diet shift from littoral macro-benthos to zooplankton and profundal microbenthos as interspecific competition for food and habitat intensifies. Interactions with natural and introduced superior zooplankton feeders and ultimate predators finally become detrimental. Consequently, the niche of S. alpinus is increasingly compressed in lakes along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, although certain natural key conditions offer S. alpinus temporary asylum in the inescapable process towards local and regional extinction. The water temperature drop during winter allows S. alpinus to temporarily resume the richer littoral dietary and spatial niche use in low diversity lakes. In southern lowland and coastal lakes with more complex fish communities, access to key prey species such as profundal macro-crustaceans and smelt Osmerus spp. allow S. alpinus to regain its original niche space and characteristics as a large piscivore. In conclusion, S. alpinus along its evolutionary landscape demonstrates associated alterations of life-history characteristics, such as body size and longevity, and thus reproductive traits demonstrating similarities between northern cannibals and southern piscivores. Although including a high degree of natural resilience, obviously differing among S. alpinus populations along its range, differences seen in extreme marginal populations may have been adaptive and the product of an evolutionary response with optimized growth resulting from natural selection due to ultimate intra or inter-specific competition and predation.

Initially, we review the results on the global stability analysis of the system and present a new global energy function. Then, we extend the model analysis in the case of strong competition, when the system has two asymptotically stable equilibria. The influence of parameters on the size and shape of the basins of attraction of these equilibria was characterized. The results show that the higher the rate of interspecific competition of a population, the greater the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium that corresponds to the predominance of the same. In addition, the relative birth rate of population influences the curvature of the boundary between the basins of attraction which is the stable manifold of a saddle point. The influence analysis of this parameter reveals an interesting relation. Which population has more chances to survive depends on the context in which the initial conditions take place. In the case where populations begin with a large number of individuals, the one with a smaller birth rate will survive; in the case where populations begin with few individuals, the one with a greater birth rate will survive. We showed this result analytically by using the Picard method to approximate invariant manifolds and to obtain the expression for the curvature of the stability boundary. Finally, the analysis of the joint influence of competition and reproduction on the thresholds for initial conditions was made and the biological implications were discussed. We conclude that in terms of strategy for survival of a population, it is more efficient to adjust its reproductive rate than to improve its ability to withdraw resources from the environment.

The cryptic species Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) and Mediterranean (MED) of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci complex have invaded many parts of the world and often exhibit niche overlap and reproductive interference. However, contrasting patterns of competitive displacement between the two invaders have been observed between regions such as those in USA and China. Understanding the roles of reproductive interference in competitive interactions between populations of the two species in different regions will help unravel other factors related to their invasion. We integrated laboratory population experiments, behavioural observations and simulation modelling to investigate the role of reproductive interference on species exclusion between MEAM1 and MED in China. In mixed cohorts of the two species MEAM1 always excluded MED in a few generations when the initial proportion of MEAM1 was > 0.25. Even when the initial proportion of MEAM1 was only 0.10, however, MEAM1 still had a higher probability of excluding MED than that for MED to exclude MEAM1. Importantly, we show that as MEAM1 increased in relative abundance, MED populations became increasingly male-biased. Detailed behavioural observations confirmed that MEAM1 showed a stronger reproductive interference than MED, leading to reduced frequency of copulation and female progeny production in MED. Using simulation modelling, we linked our behavioural observations with exclusion experiments to show that interspecific asymmetric reproductive interference predicts the rate of species exclusion of MED by MEAM1. These findings not only reveal the importance of reproductive interference in the competitive interactions between the two invasive whiteflies as well as the detailed behavioural mechanisms, but also provide a valuable framework against which the effects of other factors mediating species exclusion can be explored.","[Sun, Di-Bing; Li, Jie; Liu, Yin-Quan; Liu, Shu-Sheng] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Insect Sci, Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Entomol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Crowder, David W.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Liu, SS (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Insect Sci, Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Entomol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",shshliu@zju.edu.cn,"Liu, Yin-Quan/AAY-4079-2021","Liu, Yin-Quan/0000-0002-0835-2700",China Agriculture Research System [CARS-25-B-08]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31272104]; USDA-AFRI NIFA Fellowship Program [2011-67012-30718],"Financial support for this study was provided by the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-25-B-08), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31272104) and the USDA-AFRI NIFA Fellowship Program (2011-67012-30718).",,46,15,15,1,39,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-4853,1475-2670,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

So far, however, it still remains unclear how competitive interactions respond to N and water additions, which will be important to understand how plant community composition changes. To test plant competition ability in different successional stages under N and water addition treatments, a pot experiment under field conditions was performed. Six dominant plant species, three early-successional species, Artemisia lavandulaefolia, Artemisia capillaris, and Pennisetum centrasiaticum versus three late-successional species, Stipa krylovii, Leymus chinensis, and Artemisia frigida, were grown in monocultures and in two-species mixtures under factorial combinations of N and water addition treatments. We found that (1) there were interactive effects of N addition, water addition and interspecific competition on plant biomass; (2) For a given species, competitive abilities were correlated with biomass difference of neighboring species; (3) N and water additions interactively increased competition intensity and shifted species competitive hierarchies; (4) Late-successional species had stronger competitive abilities in the N addition treatment, whereas early-successional species had stronger competitive abilities after water addition or N + water addition. Our results show that N and water additions increased the intensity and impact of interspecific competition on plant growth, which has great implications for community structures. Since interspecific differences in competitive abilities were not well explained by species biomass, species identity, such as plant functional traits, should be included to predict the impact of increased N and water availability on plant communities and ecosystem functions.","[Jiang, Lili] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Lan, Zhichun] Nanchang Univ, Inst Life Sci, Ctr Watershed Ecol, Nanchang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guifeng] Inner Mongolia Univ Nationalities, Coll Agr, Tongliao 028000, Peoples R China; [Kardol, Paul] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Jiang, LL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lljiang@itpcas.ac.cn; lanzihichun@ibcas.ac.cn; paul.kardol@slu.se,"Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015","Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41301600, 31260108]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2012BAC19B04]; State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of ChinaState Key Development Program for Basic Research of China [2013CB956002]",This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41301600; 31260108); supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2012BAC19B04) and supported by State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of China (2013CB956002).,,37,1,1,3,50,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

In each series, the proportions among ryegrass resistant and susceptible plants related to soybean were: 100: 0, 75: 25, 50: 50, 25: 75 e 0: 100. Leaf area and shoot dry mass were evaluated. Competitiveness statistical analysis consisted in applying diagrams to the replacement series and alternative interpretations of the competitiveness indexes. The soybean crop had equivalent competitiveness to the susceptible ryegrass biotype and inferior to the resistant biotype, while the biotypes, both susceptible and resistant to glyphosate, present equivalent competitive ability. In general, the intraspecific competition is more harmful to ryegrass when in competition with soybean, while interspecific competition is predominant for culture.","[Oliveira, C.; Agostinetto, D.; Vargas, L.; Avila, L.

Potentially, all carnivores have to do is wait until animals succumb to the debilitating effects of advancing age. However, this may be insufficient because of intense competition among other scavengers and decomposers for food. Moreover, the availability of carcasses of animals dying from causes other than predation varies seasonally, so carnivores must be adapted to exploit various sources of food through the seasonal cycle. We explore how mammalian carnivores cope with seasonality in carrion supply and in prey vulnerability to predation. We focus mainly on large carnivores and ungulates, and compare especially ecological communities in northern temperate and African savanna ecosystems. When carrion is scarce, carnivores can (i) take advantage of temporarily vulnerable segments of prey populations, such as newborn young, heavily pregnant females and males distracted or debilitated by reproduction, (ii) switch to carcass remains left by or stolen from other carnivores, or (iii) exploit small animals and non-animal food sources. Relationships between carnivores tending towards predation or scavenging can be both competitive and facilitative. Top carnivores may provide a supply of carcasses throughout the year, which subsidizes scavengers when carrion availability from other sources is low. Alterations of seasonal patterns due to anthropogenic environmental change may enhance the role of top carnivores as buffers of anthropogenic perturbations of natural processes. Megaherbivores, which are not normally regarded as prey but can provide huge carrion subsidies, may strongly influence interspecific interactions between carnivores and the proportion of food flowing towards scavenging relative to predation. Relationships among carnivores based on hunting vs. scavenging strategies are flexible and subject to changes in response to circumstances. Their functional complexity is relevant for assessing the effects of global change on ecosystem function.","[Pereira, Laura M.; Owen-Smith, Norman; Moleon, Marcos] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa","Owen-Smith, N (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",pereira.laura18@gmail.com; norman.owen-smith@wits.ac.za; mmoleonpaiz@hotmail.com,"Pereira, Laura M./L-7258-2013; Moleon, Marcos/K-2875-2014; Owen-Smith, Norman/ABI-5113-2020","Pereira, Laura M./0000-0002-4996-7234; Moleon, Marcos/0000-0002-3126-619X; Owen-Smith, Norman/0000-0001-8429-1201",Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government,MM was supported by a postdoctoral grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education (Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011).,,119,75,77,1,146,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,JAN,2014,44,1,,,,,44,55,,10.1111/mam.12005,,,12,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,263GZ,WOS:000327796800005,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

Studies in systems with multiple predator species have shown that the strength of these interactions may not be predictable and is largely dependent on individual behavioural traits, species density and habitat complexity. Although the association of prey consumption and satiation of a foraging predator has long been recognized, there has been relatively little research on how prey availability affects multiple predators' effects. In this work, we present a framework to investigate the variation in two coexisting/competing predators' effects on prey risk as affected by the prey availability rate. Functional responses by each predator species were first studied in single-predator treatments. Then, the intra- and inter-specific competition was investigated by employing additive and substitutative experimental designs to highlight the nature of multiple effects. Intra- and interspecific interactions were found to be similar and there was risk reduction, and risk enhancement for the prey at intermediate and high levels, respectively, according to the multiplicative risk model (MRM). The results indicated that when similar predators are concerned, the outcomes of MRM may vary according to the functional response curve of these predators. Thus, studies involving a wide range of prey densities are required to explore the nature of interactions. Moreover, this kind of experimental data can contribute to unravelling complexities in theoretical approaches by earlier studies and ultimately promote understanding the effect of multiple predators on prey population regulation.","[Lampropoulos, Panagiotis D.; Fantinou, Argyro A.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Perdikis, Dionyssios Ch.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Agr Zool & Entomol, GR-11855 Athens, Greece","Fantinou, AA (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, Iera Odos 75, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.",perdikis@aua.gr; argyr@aua.gr,,,,,,51,17,18,0,74,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1439-1791,1618-0089,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

A decline in habitat may lead to crowding of live coral specialists into remnant habitat patches, intensifying intraspecific competition. Increased local densities of conspecifics are known to negatively affect key demographic processes, but the magnitude of density effects and the role of crowding in response to habitat loss are poorly understood. In this study we examined habitat use and relationships between habitat availability and population density in a coral-dwelling damselfish - Chrysiptera parasema. First, we conducted habitat use and availability surveys to establish the level of habitat selectivity. We then investigated the evidence for crowding due to habitat loss by comparing densities within juvenile aggregations on natural reefs with high and low cover of the preferred habitat. Finally, we used a manipulative patch-reef experiment to measure the potential effects of crowding on mortality of juvenile C. parasema. Surveys revealed that 97% of juvenile C. parasema were associated with Acropora corals. Furthermore, C. parasema densities were closely related to the cover of bottlebrush Acropora, the preferred growth form. Contrary to predictions, there was no evidence of crowding on natural reefs with low coral cover, but rather, reefs with abundant Acropora cover supported larger aggregations with double the density of juveniles. We hypothesized that low densities of C. parasema on natural reefs with low coral cover could be explained by intense intraspecific competition. Experimental manipulations showed that juvenile mortality was density-dependent, with mortality 20% higher on high-density experimental patch-reefs compared to low-density reefs. Behavioural observations on the patch-reefs revealed that the frequency of agonistic interactions and distance to shelter were both unrelated to conspecific densities, highlighting the need for further research into mechanisms underpinning density dependent mortality. These results suggest that intraspecific competition may play an important role in reducing reef fish abundance as a consequence of habitat loss. Given that coral reef systems are currently under threat, with a global decline in coral cover, this study adds to the growing body of knowledge of how disturbances to habitat may affect reef fish communities.

Ecological differences across environments can alter the context of sexual selection, yet little research has addressed how this may influence the rapid, divergent evolution of male genitalia. Using the model system of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) undergoing ecological speciation across blue holes, we used geometric morphometric methods to test (i) whether male genital shape (the small, approximately 1mm long, distal tip of the sperm-transfer organ, the gonopodium) has diverged between populations with and without predatory fish and (ii) whether any observed divergence has a genetic basis. We additionally examined the effects of genetic relatedness and employed model selection to investigate other environmental factors (i.e. interspecific competition, adult sex ratio and resource availability) that could potentially influence genital shape via changes in sexual selection. Predation regime comprised the most important factor associated with male genital divergence in this system, although sex ratio and some aspects of resource availability had suggestive effects. We found consistent, heritable differences in male genital morphology between predation regimes: Bahamas mosquitofish coexisting with predatory fish possessed more elongate genital tips with reduced soft tissue compared with counterparts inhabiting blue holes without predatory fish. We suggest this may reflect selection for greater efficiency of sperm transfer and fertilization during rapid and often forced copulations in high-predation populations or differences in sexual conflict between predation regimes. Our study highlights the potential importance of ecological variation, particularly predation risk, in indirectly generating genital diversity.","[Heinen-Kay, J.

Competition for resources has long been considered a prevalent force in structuring plant communities and natural selection, yet our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie resource competition is still developing. 2. The complexity of resource competition is derived not only from the variability of resource limitation in space and time and among species, but also from the complexity of the resources themselves. Nutrients, water and light each differ in their properties, which generates unique ways that plants compete for these resources. 3. Here, we discuss the roles of supply pre-emption and availability reduction in competition for the three resources when supplied evenly in space and time. Plants compete for nutrients by pre-empting nutrient supplies from coming into contact with neighbours, which requires maximizing root length. Although water is also a soil resource, competition for water is generally considered to occur by availability reduction, favouring plants that can withstand the lowest water potential. Because light is supplied from above plants, individuals that situate their leaves above those of neighbours benefit directly from increased photosynthetic rates and indirectly by reducing the growth of those neighbours via shade. In communities where juveniles recruit in the shade of adults, traits of the most competitive species are biased towards those that confer greater survivorship and growth at the juvenile stage, even if those traits come at the expense of adult performance. 4. Understanding the mechanisms of competition also reveals how competition has influenced the evolution of plant species. For example, nutrient competition has selected for plants to maintain higher root length and light competition plants that are taller, with deeper, flatter canopies than would be optimal in the absence of competition. 5.In all, while more research is needed on competition for heterogeneous resource supplies as well as for water, understanding the mechanisms of competition increases the predictability of interspecific interactions and reveals how competition has altered the evolution of plants.","[Craine, Joseph M.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Dybzinski, Ray] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Craine, JM (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",jcraine@ksu.edu,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244; Dybzinski, Ray/0000-0002-1712-1875",,,,48,240,248,21,307,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Such bi-directional predation can be important during the establishment and spread of an invading species, but its role remains poorly understood. Using a combination of laboratory and mesocosm experiments and field introductions, we demonstrate that guppies, Poecilia reticulata, prey on juvenile killifish, Rivulus hartii, and thereby facilitate their establishment in the habitat of a potential predator. Laboratory studies found that mature guppies can consume larval Rivulus, and experimental stream studies showed that guppies reduced the number of Rivulus surviving from eggs. Growth trials found that interspecific competition, while significant, cannot account for the declines in the survival of juvenile Rivulus seen in field surveys. Finally, a field experiment, in which guppies were introduced into previously guppy-free stream reaches, resulted in a marked reduction in the abundance of juvenile Rivulus relative to guppy-free controls. Together, these results indicate that reducing the native Rivulus population represents an important mechanism promoting guppy invasion success.","[Fraser, Douglas F.] Siena Coll, Dept Biol, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA; [Lamphere, Bradley A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Fraser, DF (corresponding author), Siena Coll, Dept Biol, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA.",fraser@siena.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0108365, EF-0623632]","We thank Ronnie Hernandez (Simla research station), Daren Bhawanie of Ramdeen Estate (Ramdeen Stream), and our laboratory and field assistants: Sarah Beaudin, Dave Herasimtchuck, Pierson Hill, Ramon and Jose Rodriguez, Ephraim Farfan, and Kelley Malchan.

We are interested in why these adverse effects are weak in some cases whereas in others the native species declines to the point of extinction. While the introduction rate and the growth rate of the introduced species in the new environment clearly have a positive relationship with invasion success and impact, the influence of competition is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the intensity of interspecific competition influences the persistence time of a native species in the face of repeated and ongoing introductions of the nonnative species. We analyze two stochastic models: a model for the population dynamics of both species and a model that additionally includes the population genetics of the native species at a locus involved in its adaptation to a changing environment. Counterintuitively, both models predict that the persistence time of the native species is lowest for an intermediate intensity of competition. This phenomenon results from the opposing effects of competition at different stages of the invasion process: With increasing competition intensity more introduction events are needed until a new species can establish, but increasing competition also speeds up the exclusion of the native species by an established nonnative competitor. By comparing the ecological and the eco-genetic model, we detect and quantify a synergistic feedback between ecological and genetic effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A key reason is that known instances of continuous coexistence are fragile, requiring fine-tuning of parameters: A small alteration of the parameters leads back to the classical limiting similarity predictions. Here we present, but then cast aside, a new theoretical challenge to the expectation of limiting similarity. Robust continuous coexistence can arise if competition between species is modeled as a nonsmooth function of their differences-specifically, if the competition kernel (differential response of species' growth rates to changes in the density of other species along the trait axis) has a nondifferentiable sharp peak at zero trait difference. We will say that these kernels possess a kink. The difference in predicted behavior stems from the fact that smooth kernels do not change to a first-order approximation around their maxima, creating strong competitive interactions between similar species. Kinked kernels, on the other hand, decrease linearly even for small species differences, reducing interspecific competition compared with intraspecific competition for arbitrarily small species differences. We investigate what mechanisms would lead to kinked kernels in the first place. It turns out that discontinuities in resource utilization generate them. We argue that such sudden jumps in the utilization of resources are unrealistic, and therefore, one should expect kernels to be smooth in reality.","[Barabas, Gyoergy; D'Andrea, Rafael; Ostling, Annette Marie] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Barabas, G (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 810 N Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",dysordys@umich.edu; rdandrea@umich.edu; aostling@umich.edu,"D'Andrea, Rafael/I-2588-2019","D'Andrea, Rafael/0000-0001-9687-6178",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1038678]; Advancing Theory in Biology program; Emerging FrontiersNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1038678] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We would like to thank Rosalyn Rael, Mercedes Pascual, Antonio Golubski, Aaron King, and Geza Meszena for discussions.

We present the first simultaneous observations of at-sea behaviour and attendance patterns of 3 synchronously breeding, central place, krill foragers at Bouvetoya-a small, isolated, sub-Antarctic island in the South Atlantic. Time depth recorders and satellite transmitters were deployed during the austral summer of 2007/2008 on 47 lactating Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (AFS) rearing pups and on 20 macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus (MAC) and 30 chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica penguins (CHIN) rearing chicks. All 3 species showed a strong preference for the west side of the island, and their foraging ranges overlapped markedly. Solar elevation influenced the timing of departures from, and arrivals to, the island with markedly different patterns between the seals and the penguins. Diving patterns also showed significant differences among the 3 species, with the frequency of diving being higher at night for the AFS, while both penguin species dove more frequently during the day. But a common, vertical diel pattern occurred in all 3 species, with shallow diving occurring at night and deep diving during the day, consistent with the vertical migration of krill. MACs targeted 2 depth layers for feeding, including a deep prey layer at similar to 70 m, which was not exploited by AFSs and CHINs. The results suggest that there is potential for competitive overlap among these 3 krill predators at Bouvetoya, but that it is reduced via both spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal partitioning of foraging areas.","[Blanchet, Marie-Anne; Biuw, Martin; Lydersen, Christian; Kovacs, Kit M.] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Hofmeyr, G.

For furtive predators, like the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza which preys on aphids while simultaneously residing and remaining undetected within their colonies, oviposition behaviour is crucial because these slow moving offspring are restrained to their natal colony. Here we develop a new model for predicting the optimum number of eggs that a furtive predator should lay in an aphid colony, based on: (1) the number of available prey (aphids); (2) the protection from predation conferred by hiding in the colony and (3) the effects of interspecific and intraspecific competition. We also explore the effect of aphid attendance by ants on oviposition behavior. We compare model predictions with empirical field observations of the clutch sizes of A. aphidimyza in apple orchards. The simplest of the four models best fits the observed data and provides the first field evidence that a furtive predator adjusts its clutch size as a function of prey density. The slope of the relationship between clutch size and aphid number is quite close to that predicted by our models suggesting that intra-clutch competition is the main factor governing furtive aphid midge oviposition choice.","[Sentis, Arnaud; Lucas, Eric; Vickery, William L.] Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Sentis, A (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",asentis@hotmail.fr,"Sentis, Arnaud/K-5004-2014","Sentis, Arnaud/0000-0003-4617-3620",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This work was funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grants to Eric Lucas and William L.

Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that includes temperature-dependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e. g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly.

However, lacking direct evidence, the majority of studies only infer some form of interspecific interaction, often competition, as reinforcing these gradients. There is usually the further implication that environmental factors mediate asymmetries in the interaction. Recognising the lack of explicit experimental considerations of how key inter-specific interactions are modified by the environment, we chose a study system where we were able to bring the species in question into the laboratory and conduct experiments to test hypotheses about gradient-induced asymmetries in an interspecific interaction. To this end, we tested the hypothesis that a species-salinity gradient may be reinforced by changes in the asymmetry of intraguild predation between two species of amphipod crustaceans with wide salinity tolerances. River and estuary surveys showed that Gammarus duebeni and Gammarus zaddachi have overlapping distributions, with both surviving and reproducing in salinities ranging from freshwater to fully marine. However, the former species is relatively more abundant in low salinities and the latter in higher salinities. In the laboratory, survival of both species was high in all salinities and cannibalism occurred at low frequencies. However, intraguild predation by males on moulted females was asymmetric in favour of G. duebeni at low salinities, this asymmetry completely reversing to favour G. zaddachi at higher salinities. Thus, we provide evidence that this species environment gradient occurs due to overlapping physiological tolerances and salinity-driven shifts in the asymmetry of a key inter-specific interaction, intraguild predation.

Common species can become rare. Recent calls for experimental tests of the causes and consequences of rarity prompted us to investigate competition between co-existing rare and common species of intertidal gastropods. In various combinations, we increased densities of rare gastropod species to match those of common species to evaluate effects of intra-and interspecific competition on growth and survival of naturally rare or naturally common species at small and large densities. Rarity per se did not cause responses of rare species to differ from those of common species. Rare species did not respond to the abundances of other rare species, nor show consistently different responses from those of common species. Instead, individual species responded differently to different densities, regardless of whether they are naturally rare or abundant. This type of experimental evidence is important to be able to predict the effects of increased environmental variability on rare as opposed to abundant species and therefore, ultimately, on the structure of diverse assemblages.","[Matias, Miguel G.; Chapman, M.
