There is a wealth of such equations developed to incorporate the effects of multitude forms of foraging behaviour including intra-specific interference competition. However, there has been no attempt to include inter-specific behaviours beyond the obvious consumer-resource relationship, and thus, mechanistic models of communities and ecosystems remain limited in their incorporation of individual behaviour. In this paper we extend existing functional response models to account for both intra- and inter-specific interference behaviours. Together with response surface experiments, these can be used to investigate the role of both types of interference for a given species' resource acquisition efficiency. We illustrate this with data from foraging trials of guppies Poecilia reticulata in the presence and absence of a competitor species. Hart's killifish Rivulus hartii. Our results show that in the studied example, intra-specific interference is important and stronger than inter-specific competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated food hoarding behaviour of buff-breasted rat (Rattus flavipectus) under conditions of semi-natural enclosures in the tropical rain-forest of the Xishuangbanna area (altitude 475-2430 m, 21 degrees 09'-22 degrees 36'N, 99 degrees 58'-101 degrees 50'E), Yunnan Province, Southwest China. The main goal of this study was to understand the influence of intra-and inter-specific competition on food hoarding behaviour of rodents. Seeds of Lithocarpus truncatus (Fagaceae), with woody and hard seed coat, were selected and marked as a food item in this experiment. The result showed that: (1) R. flavipectus mainly exhibited food hoarding behaviour in larder form; and (2) the presence of intra-specific competitors significantly increased larder hoarding in R. flavipectus, while an inter-specific competitor, Chinese white-bellied rat (Niviventor confucianus), exerted no significant influence on food hoarding behaviour of subjects. These results indicated that rodent species would adjust their food hoarding behaviour in the presence of competitors, and intra-specific competition has a greater effect than inter-specific competition.","[Tong, L.; Zhang, Y. -F.; Wang, Z. -L.; Lu, J. -Q.] Zhengzhou Univ, Inst Biodivers & Ecol, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan Province, Peoples R China","Lu, JQ (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Inst Biodivers & Ecol, 100 Kexue Rd, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan Province, Peoples R China.",lujq@zzu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Yifeng/P-6682-2019",,National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2007CB109106]; Key Subject Funds of Zoology of Henan Province,"We thank Mr Qie Bo, Mr Liang-Yi Li, and Dr Lin Cao for their help in animal trapping, experiment preparation and assistance in the preparation of this study.

In a fully replicated, landscape scale experiment, we manipulated densities of domestic sheep in mountain pastures in Norway. We then determined population growth and densities of rodents by live trapping in each of the areas with different sheep densities. We found that the (summer) population growth rate and autumn density of the field vole (Microtus agrestis) was lower at high sheep density. This provides the first experimental evidence of negative interactions between an ungulate and small rodent species. There was no effect on the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), whose diet differs from sheep. Sheep density, therefore, potentially alters the pattern of inter-specific population synchrony amongst voles. Our study shows that negative interactions between large ungulates and small rodents may be species-specific and negative population consequences for the rodent population appear above threshold ungulate densities.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Program Expt Behav & Ecol Res, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Mysterud, A (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, POB 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",atle.mysterud@bio.uio.no,"Mysterud, Atle/AAQ-2864-2020; Steen, Harald/A-3198-2012","Mysterud, Atle/0000-0001-8993-7382; ",,,,61,66,75,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2005,143,3,,,,,357,364,,10.1007/s00442-004-1792-z,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,918CT,WOS:000228517300003,15726430,,,,2021-09-24,

(2) In forested ecosystems, predation risk for small consumers should increase with the intensity of disturbance. (3) For the same level of disturbance. foragers living in higher-quality habitats should protect their assets by investing more in anti-predatory behaviours than those living in low-quality habitats. Organisms: Red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) living in sympatry with deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Place and time: Twenty-nine pairs of natural and logged habitats sampled during 2006 in managed boreal forest. Province of Quebec, Canada. Methods: We identified a gradient of habitat disturbance along principal components summarizing 12 habitat variables. We estimated competition by measuring the giving-up density of rodents along the gradient of habitat disturbance. We assessed predation risk by measuring the giving-up density of rodents foraging in safe and risky patches. We tested for differences with multi-level statistical modelling. Conclusions: Competition and predation risk increased with habitat disturbance in the boreal forest studied. Foragers living in higher-quality habitats experienced higher predation costs than foragers living in low-quality habitats. Intra- and inter-specific competition, rather than predation, was the main mechanism responsible for the decline of red-backed vole populations associated with forest harvesting.","[Lemaitre, Jerome; Fortin, Daniel] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Darveau, Marcel] Ducks Unlimited Canada, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Lemaitre, J (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jerome.lemaitre.1@ulaval.ca,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020; Lemaitre, Jerome/S-1337-2017","Lemaitre, Jerome/0000-0001-7736-111X",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologiesFQRNT,"This study would not have been possible without the outstanding help of our field assistants, who carried hundreds of filled food patches to experimental sites, counted thousands of sunflower seeds, and collected data on small mammals and habitat variables: L.

Previous experimental studies in central Chile demonstrated that interference competition for refuges is the primary factor driving habitat segregation between the predatory crabs Acanthocyclus gayi and A. hassled, with the latter species monopolizing galleries inside mussel beds in the mid intertidal zone and limiting A. gayi to rock crevices. Yet, habitat partitioning between rival species can result from differences in habitat preferences and not solely from interference interactions. Moreover, since A. gayi is also known to shelter in turf-forming algae (predominantly Gelidium), which dominates extensive areas in the low intertidal zone, among-sites variation in the turf morphology and abundance could modify habitat preferences and the pattern of inter-specific interactions. We experimentally evaluated refuge habitat preferences of individual, similarly-sized adult A. gayi and A. hassleri in the laboratory, comparing choice patterns across multiple trials with paired combinations of the main refuge types commonly used by crabs in the field: a) mussel galleries, b) rock crevices, c) short algal turf, and d) tall algal turf Our results showed that both species display a strong ranking of preferences for some refuge habitats over others. In general, mussel galleries were the preferred refuge type for both crab species, but their preference rankings changed depending on turf morphology. When turf was short, A. hassleri and A. gayi made identical refuge choices, strongly preferring mussel galleries over crevices and these over the short turf. In contrast, when the turf was tall A. gayi selected equally the tall turf or mussel galleries, and these were strongly preferred over crevices. A. hassleri, on the other hand, largely ignored tall turf and kept the highest preference for mussel galleries. A field experiment in which crabs were offered to foraging birds demonstrated that A. hassleri is more susceptible than A. gayi to predation by kelp gulls when outside refuges. Differences in patterns of coloration between crabs may underlie between-species differences in predation susceptibility and their habitat choices. These results suggest that the among-site differences in turf morphology (height and shape of fronds), which is largely driven by varying intensity of upwelling, could affect crab preferences for refuge habitats and the relative importance of inter-specific interference competition.

Predation exerted by other species and predation by self (cannibalism) are commonly the chief sources of post-settlement mortality and can profoundly influence population dynamics and adult spatial distribution. In Chile, two predatory crab species (Acanthocyclus gayi and Acanthocyclus hassleri) coexist in the intertidal zone. Both settle preferentially in mussel beds, but adults show remarkable spatial segregation, apparently as a result of asymmetric competition for refuges. Although early recruits of A. gayi are an order of magnitude more abundant than A. hassleri, late juveniles are similarly abundant. Recruits of A. gayi are probably subjected to higher mortality before competition for refuges intensifies. Here, through laboratory experiments, we quantified the strength of intra and inter-cohort cannibalism and inter-specific predation as probable sources of differential post-settlement mortality. Intra-cohort cannibalism (among recruits of same size) accounted for the mortality of up to 30% of recruits in both species, with no evidence of density-dependent effects on mortality. Rates of cannibalism between juveniles and recruits (inter-cohorts) were also similar between the two species. Both species exhibit type III functional responses of juvenile predators with a tendency to consume heavily upon the most abundant recruits (A. gayi in the field), which could potentially provide A. hassleri recruits with a virtual refuge from the inter-cohort predation in the field. The combination of these different sources of mortality might contribute to the large reduction in abundance of A. gayi recruits by the time they reach juvenile stages. Our results illustrate the complexity of mechanisms that can underlay patterns of distribution and relative abundances among competitors through different life stages, especially among coexisting species in which attacking peers can provide higher rewards later in development than just the energy obtained from other food.

Field experiments demonstrated that large numbers of individuals of this species, comprising similar to 90% of a suite of gastropod scavengers, were attracted to baited traps in the subtidal sands of Lobster Bay, Cape d'Aguilar Marine Reserve, Hong Kong. Laboratory experiments identified the effective chemo-detection distances of E. contractus as 60 em in still and > 80 cm in flowing water, respectively. The average times to arrival at bait in still and flowing water were 92.3 and 69.0 min, respectively, but were significantly less for individuals experiencing a longer period of starvation. The mean dine taken for E contractus to consume a meal was 70.6 min. Comparisons were made between Ergalatax contractus and Nassarius nodifer, representative of a suite of sympatric scavenging nassariids in Lobster Bay The nassariid arrived significantly faster at bait in both still (30.2 min) and flowing water (20.8 min) than E. contractus and fed faster (25.7 min), as is typical of representatives of the Nassariidae. Although the two species partition carrion resources temporally, manipulation experiments provided evidence for inter-specific competition between them. That is, although E. contractus possesses the morphological and behavioural characteristics of a predator, its opportunistic scavenging abilities have led to its success and numerical superiority on the shallow subtidal sands of Lobster Bay. The dominance of E. contractus in Lobster Bay, and elsewhere in Hong Kong, is unusual. Here, the normally predatory E. contractus, far outnumbers all other scavengers, possibly because of an enhanced, largely allochthonous, supply of food which it is able to exploit by virtue of its previously identified opportunistic habit of scavenging the leftovers of other predators. The presence of inter-specific competition between E. contractus and a sympatric suite of nassariids enhances, not impedes; carrion exploitation.","Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Shek O, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Morton, B (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",prof_bsmorton@hotmail.com,,,,,,68,10,10,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Populations living in the same or overlapping geographic regions (sympatric) are generally subject to inter-specific competition, which can lead to the development of differing trophic strategies that maximize both nutritional and reproductive efficiency. The otariids of the islands in the western Galapagos Archipelago represent appropriate subjects for studying the response mechanisms of sympatric species exposed to strong competition, both trophic and spatial. The present study has focused on evaluating the possible differences in the trophic niches of the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) and the Galapagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) over time, based upon the analysis of stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (delta C-13 and delta N-15), and observation of both species at sea. A comparative analysis of the isotopic signal of skin samples from pups of both species was performed for rookeries on Fernandina Island between 2003 and 2009. Analyses of the isotopic signal present in prey covering the entire trophic range of these predators were also performed, in order to relate this information to otariid sighting records collected during offshore cruises in 1993-1994 and 2000. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values defined differences in the feeding zones and in the trophic level of each species; which were related with the interannual variability of the ecosystem, i.e. El Nino and La Nina events. Whereas Z. wollebaeki showed a coastal (inshore) foraging strategy, relying on the consumption of small epipelagic fishes, A. galapagoensis turned out to be a more oceanic (offshore) predator, with a preference for small squid. These results are in good agreement with the distribution of these animals at sea, as indicated by the sighting data. The findings of this study provide new insights to our understanding of how sympatric species exposed to strong inter-specific competition can develop foraging strategies leading to a decreasing level of food competition and facilitate their survival in a stochastic environment that is highly demanding in terms of the availability of resources.

Moreover, identification of habitat selection mechanisms of invasive organisms is crucial for predicting their distribution and impact in novel areas. We evaluated experimentally the habitat selection by Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides (Gammaroidea, Amphipoda, Crustacea), invasive in European fresh and brackish waters, with regard to depth, the presence of predators, the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus, and heterospecific gammarid competitors. We exposed gammarids in single- and mixed-species treatments in a 100-cm-long depth gradient (depth: 10-100cm, levels every 10cm) or in a control shallow tank (constant depth: 10cm) in the presence or absence of predators located behind a mesh barrier adjacent to the deeper side of the gradient. Dikerogammarus villosus always selected deeper locations than P.robustoides. Both species did not affect each other's depth selection, but P.robustoides limited the distribution of D.villosus and pushed it towards the mesh barrier in the shallow tank. Dikerogammarus villosus responded to predators only in the depth gradient, retreating to shallower sites and climbing towards the surface. Pontogammarus robustoides moved away from the predator area in the shallow tank, indicating that its response was independent of depth selection. Thus, different depth distributions of both gammarids result from their specific preferences rather than from competitive displacement. The observed behaviour is likely to result in their segregation in the field, limiting inter-specific competition, allowing for optimum utilization of resources and decreasing predatory pressure.","[Kobak, J.; Jermacz, L.; Rutkowska, D.; Pawlowska, K.; Witkowska, L.; Poznanska, M.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Torun, Poland","Kobak, J (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",jkob73@umk.pl,"Poznanska, Malgorzata/H-6261-2014; Jermacz, Lukasz/B-8728-2017; Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013","Jermacz, Lukasz/0000-0001-9182-116X; Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Poznanska-Kakareko, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7224-3093","National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland [2012/05/B/NZ8/00479, 2013/09/N/NZ8/03191]",Our study was supported by the grants of the National Science Centre no. 2012/05/B/NZ8/00479 and 2013/09/N/NZ8/03191.,,48,7,8,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

These advanced methodological approaches to OA research also include the study of inter-specific interactions that could be disrupted if participant species exhibit differential tolerances to stressors associated with OA. The host-parasite relationship is one of the most fundamental ecological interactions, alongside competition and predation, which can regulate individuals, populations, and communities. The recent integration of competition and predation into OA research has provided great insight into the potential effects of differential tolerances to acidified seawater, and there is no reason to believe that expanding OA research to include parasitology will be less fruitful. This essay outlines our current, limited understanding of how OA will affect parasitism as an ecological process, describes potential pitfalls for researchers who ignore parasites and the effects of infection, and suggests ways of developing parasitology as a sub-field of OA research.","[MacLeod, Colin D.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand","MacLeod, CD (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",colin.macleod@postgrad.otago.ac.nz,,,,,,55,15,16,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

In this study, we define patterns of local distribution and recruitment of two common intertidal chthamalid barnacles (Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus) at 15 sites along the shore of central Chile. Surveys revealed patterns of adult distribution to be consistent across the study region; Jehlius was numerically dominant at the highest intertidal levels and Notochthamalus was more abundant at lower shore levels. Despite slight spatial segregation, our results show that there is ample overlap in the distribution of these species, with inter-specific mixing over scales of few centimeters, occurring over 60-80% of the entire barnacle zone. Recruitment rates of the two species were highly correlated among sites (separated by kms), suggesting similar determinants of onshore larval transport between these species. Additionally, we found evidence that Notochthamalus was recruitment limited while Jehlius experienced higher post-settlement mortality. Densities of established individuals were generally positively correlated at scales of just 25 cm(2) and largely uncorrelated over scales of 2500 cm(2) across sites and tidal levels, indicating that asymmetric inter-specific competition is unlikely to affect adult populations. After monitoring individuals under various crowding conditions (single individuals, surrounded by conspecifics, and surrounded by heterospecifics) and at different tide elevations for more than a year, we found no evidence of negative intra- or inter-specific effects on individual growth rates. We conclude that lottery-type interactions and species-specific post-settlement mortality rather than an inter-specific competitive hierarchy likely determine patterns of coexistence of Jehlius and Notochthamalus in central Chile.

In this paper, I present a method for training an avian predator which can allow separating between its direct and indirect effects on prey in various experimental setups. Barn owls are found to be a valuable tool for empirically testing different hypotheses related to predator-prey interactions, population dynamics, and inter-specific competition, all performed in the field using authentic rodent prey and their natural predators. Barn owls are raised and trained to participate in field experiments using classical conditioning, and are trained either to catch rodents or only to fly above a certain area without making any attempt to attack the prey, simulating solely predation risk. Body mass is a crucial factor in the training procedure, and I thus define five body mass ranges that characterize different behavioral stages in the training of owls. A logistic model is used to calculate and to predict changes in the body mass during the growth and training periods of owls. Finally, I discuss several possible implications of the usage of trained barn owls in empirical studies.","[Subach, Aziz] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Subach, Aziz] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel","Subach, A (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel.; Subach, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel.",aziz@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,31,1,1,0,11,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

Population densities of C. aleuticus were only consistent with resource densities across years during two of five study years, indicating a lack of resource matching at large temporal scales. On shorter temporal scales, fish growth rates that were two to three times higher in the estuary compared with the stream were inconsistent with the predictions of resource matching theory. A manipulation of C. aleuticus density showed that the estuary could support at least twice the number of individuals that occurred there; thus, the profitable estuary is underutilized. Interspecific competition with Cottus asper was partially responsible for this underutilization as indicated by a substantial reduction in growth and condition among C. aleuticus individuals in experimental manipulations that compared intra- and inter-specific effects. Observed spatial overlap between these two cottids combined with the results of the competition experiment suggests that C. aleuticus is more strongly limited in its ability to use estuarine habitats opportunistically by interspecific competition than by intraspecific competition.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Polivka, KM (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Wenatchee Forestry Sci Lab, 1133 N Western Ave, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA.",kpolivka@fs.fed.us,,,,,,83,9,10,0,8,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

These effects can be both direct through removal of herbivores [density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs)] or indirect through changes in the behavior of the herbivores [trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs)]. How the relative importance of these two indirect interactions varies with predator diversity remains poorly understood. We tested the effect of predator diversity on both TMIIs and DMIIs on phytoplankton using two competitive invasive dreissenid mussel species (zebra mussel and quagga mussel) as the herbivores and combinations of one, two or all three species of the predators pumpkinseed sunfish, round goby, and rusty crayfish. Predators had either direct access to mussels and induced both TMII and DMII, or no direct access and induced only TMII through the presence of risk cues. In both sets of treatments, the predators induced a trophic cascade which resulted in more phytoplankton remaining with predators present than with only mussels present. The trophic cascade was weaker in three-predator and two-predator treatments than in one-predator treatments when predators had direct access to dreissenids (DMIIs and TMIIs). Crayfish had higher cascading effects on phytoplankton than both pumpkinseed and round goby. Increased predator diversity decreased the strength of DMIIs but had no effect on the strength of TMIIs. The strength of TMIIs was higher with zebra than quagga mussels. Our study suggests that inter-specific interference among predators in multi-species treatments weakens the consumptive cascading effects of predation on lower trophic levels whereas the importance of predator diversity on trait mediated effects depends on predator identity.","[Naddafi, Rahmat] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Rudstam, Lars G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Cornell Biol Field Stn, Bridgeport, NY USA","Naddafi, R (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Rahmat.Naddafi@slu.se,,"Rudstam, Lars/0000-0002-3732-6368",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [623-2008-486]; Cornell Agricultural Experiment Station; Swedish University of Agricultural Science,"This study was supported by the Swedish Research Council (http://vr.se/) (registration number: 623-2008-486) to RN and by a grant from the Cornell Agricultural Experiment Station (http://cuaes.cornell.edu/) to LGR and by the Swedish University of Agricultural Science (http://www.slu.se/viltfiskmiljo).

The relative importance of host-plants and predators in the population dynamics of herbivorous insects, and the frequency and intensity of inter-specific competition among herbivores, have both been intensively studied and debated. The joint effects of bottom-up, top-down, and within-trophic level interactions, however, have rarely been integrated in a single system. 2. I studied the dynamics of the cactus bug (Narnia pallidicornis), a specialist feeder on tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata), in response to variable host-plant quality, spider predation, and interactions with cactus-feeding beetles (Moneilema appressum). Previous work suggests that cactus reproductive effort (the proportion of meristems allocated to reproduction) is an important component of host-plant quality for Narnia. I conducted a 2-year field experiment to test the hypotheses that Narnia abundance is positively related to host-plant reproductive effort, and that interactions with predators and putative competitors alter the shape of this relationship. 3. I found strong support for the first prediction (positive Narnia-plant quality relationship) in both years, but neither predator removal nor beetle exclusion had detectable effects on this relationship in either year. I conclude that the dynamics of this insect herbivore are driven predominantly from the bottom-up, and that available data from this work and from previous studies are too variable to permit broad generalisations for the combined effects of host-plants, predation, and competition on herbivore dynamics.","[Miller, Tom E.

Field experimentation to identify density dependent effects is often cost and time prohibitive. Thus, assimilation of existing knowledge into a balance of probabilities can serve as a surrogate for experimental research. A case study of such a process is found in the mule deer Odocoileus hemionus herds of Colorado. Wildlife managers and hunters expressed concern over a recent decline in western Colorado mule deer herds, yet the underlying cause of this decline is yet to be determined. In response to this management concern, we conducted a review of scientific evidence on Colorado's mule deer population dynamics. This review was done in the context of a conceptual model that portrays population growth as a function of population size, per capita growth rate and population carrying capacity. Similar declines that occurred during the 1960s and early 1990s resulted in similar reviews that identified research and management topics that would benefit mule deer. These topics included: harvest, predation, intraspecific competition, disease, interspecific competition, and habitat loss and degradation. Between the late 1990s and present time, many of these topics were addressed by research. The conventional working hypothesis in Colorado is that mule deer herds are limited by winter range habitat. We identify new gaps in knowledge and suggest potential, future research topics, as well as potential management strategies. We suggest a focus on integrated studies of multiple herbivores with density reduction experiments to address intra- and inter- specific competition. In addition, we suggest focused experiments that address the roles of mountain lion predation, black bear predation, and disease in mule deer population dynamics.","[Bergman, Eric J.; Holland, A.

Highly complex habitats, for example, may reduce predation and competition, allowing more individuals living together in a certain area. However, the strength and direction of such interactions can differ strongly and are context dependent. Furthermore, as habitat characteristics are rapidly changing due to anthropogenic impacts, it becomes increasingly important to understand such interactions. Here, we studied the interactive effects of predation and competition on common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) recruitment, growth and survival under different habitat characteristics in the Wadden Sea, one of the world's largest intertidal ecosystems. In a predator-exclosure experiment, we manipulated cockle densities (100 vs. 1000 individuals m(-2)) and shorebird predation at two sites differing in habitat characteristics, namely at the wake of a blue mussel bed (Mytilus edulis) and at an adjacent sandy site. We found that recruitment was higher in the mussel-modified habitat, most likely due to reduction of hydrodynamic stress. Although bird predation strongly reduced recruit density, the combined effects still yielded more recruitment at the vicinity of the mussel bed compared to the sandy area. Furthermore, we found that high cockle densities combined with high densities of other potential prey (i.e. mussels) at the mussel-modified site, mitigated predation effects for adult cockles. Apart from these positive effects on adults, mussel-modified habitat reduced cockle growth, most likely by reducing hydrodynamics in the wake of the mussel bed and by increasing inter-specific competition for food. Our study experimentally underpins the importance of habitat characteristics, competition and predation in interactively structuring intertidal communities.","[de Fouw, Jimmy] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van der Zee, Els M.] Altenburg & Wymenga Ecol Res, Suderwei 2, NL-9269 TZ Veenwouden, Netherlands; [van Gils, Jan A.; van der Veer, Henk W.; Piersma, Theunis; van der Heide, Tjisse] Univ Utrecht, NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Eriksson, Britas Klemens; Olff, Han; Piersma, Theunis; van der Heide, Tjisse] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Weerman, Ellen J.] Univ Appl Sci, HAS Den Bosch, Onderwijsblvd 221, NL-5223 DE sHertogenbosch, Netherlands; [Donadi, Serena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources SLU Aqua, Stangholmsvagen 2, SE-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden","de Fouw, J (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Aquat Ecol & Environm Biol, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",j.defouw@science.ru.nl,"van der Heide, Tjisse/M-3000-2013; Eriksson, Britas Klemens/D-8601-2015","Donadi, Serena/0000-0002-8920-9630; Eriksson, Britas Klemens/0000-0003-4752-922X; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",NWO grant of the 'Nationaal Programma Zee-en Kustonderzoek' [839.08.310],"thank T.

Little is known of their ecological adaptations or fitness but they are clearly successful animals. Diversity within communities can be considerable, possibly relating to the small size of individuals and temporal and spatial resource gradients. Little is known about genetic diversity, environmental tolerances and demography. Local distribution patterns are better known but rarely proven with appropriate statistics. New data from work in Northern Ireland on behaviour and habitat choice of Procerodes littoralis and on species richness, population aggregation and microdistribution of meiofaunal turbellarians is presented. Nothing appears known about intra-specific competition but more about inter-specific relationships including responses to biogenic structures. Dietary information is sparse and mostly observational with little known about feeding efficiency. Studies at Sylt have revealed mainly univoltine or polyvoltine annual life cycles partly related to habitat preference and possibly giving some evidence of r and K selection. Factors controlling local abundance are largely uninvestigated and the reasons for the apparent rarity of many species not understood. Lists and counts of turbellarians within particular habitats provide some knowledge of community structure but very few numerical analyses, e.g. of diversity and similarity, exist. Contribution to energy flux and to structuring communities has not been determined in spite of the turbellarians' assumed major role as meiofaunal predators. Nevertheless marine turbellarians appear particularly fitted to studies such as habitat heterogeneity, community stability and biogeography and are surely suitable subjects for field and laboratory experiments.

However, lacking direct evidence, the majority of studies only infer some form of interspecific interaction, often competition, as reinforcing these gradients. There is usually the further implication that environmental factors mediate asymmetries in the interaction. Recognising the lack of explicit experimental considerations of how key inter-specific interactions are modified by the environment, we chose a study system where we were able to bring the species in question into the laboratory and conduct experiments to test hypotheses about gradient-induced asymmetries in an interspecific interaction. To this end, we tested the hypothesis that a species-salinity gradient may be reinforced by changes in the asymmetry of intraguild predation between two species of amphipod crustaceans with wide salinity tolerances. River and estuary surveys showed that Gammarus duebeni and Gammarus zaddachi have overlapping distributions, with both surviving and reproducing in salinities ranging from freshwater to fully marine. However, the former species is relatively more abundant in low salinities and the latter in higher salinities. In the laboratory, survival of both species was high in all salinities and cannibalism occurred at low frequencies. However, intraguild predation by males on moulted females was asymmetric in favour of G. duebeni at low salinities, this asymmetry completely reversing to favour G. zaddachi at higher salinities. Thus, we provide evidence that this species environment gradient occurs due to overlapping physiological tolerances and salinity-driven shifts in the asymmetry of a key inter-specific interaction, intraguild predation.

Conversely, no studies were designed to investigate the role of competition for resources and predation in shaping crab distribution in mangroves, despite these biotic factors are recognised as key determinants for spatial patterns observed in the communities colonising rocky and sandy intertidal habitats. We studied floral and faunal assemblages in two zones of a Sri Lankan mangrove, a man-made upper intertidal level and a natural eulittoral, mid-shore one. Leaf choice experiments were designed to study both feeding rate and intra and inter-specific interactions for food of sesarmid crabs in the two habitats in order to better understand crab spatial distribution. Results: The two intertidal belts differed in terms of floral composition and crab species abundance. The eulittoral zone was strongly dominated by Neosarmatium smithi, while within the elevated littoral fringe four sesarmids (N. smithi, N. asiaticum, N. malabaricum and Muradium tetragonum) were more evenly distributed. At both levels, all sesarmids showed to collect significantly more Bruguiera spp. and Rhizophora apiculata leaves than Excoecaria agallocha ones. There was no temporal segregation in feeding activity among the four species, resulting in a high interference competition for leaves. Regardless of the habitat, N. smithi was always successful in winning inter-specific fights. Conclusions: Our results showed that the elevated littoral fringe was more crowded with crabs, but was less favourable in terms of food availability and environmental conditions. The dominance of N. smithi in gathering mangrove leaves suggests that this species may segregate the other sesarmids into less favourable habitats. The present data strongly suggest for the first time that interference competition for food can contribute to shape mangrove crab spatial distribution.","[Cannicci, Stefano] Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cannicci, Stefano] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cannicci, Stefano; Cimo, Filippo; Fratini, Sara] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Via Madonna del Piano 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Fusi, Marco] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div BESE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Syst Ecol & Resource Management, Av FD Roosevelt 50,CPi 264-1, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid] Vrije Univ Brussel, Mangrove Management Grp, Lab Plant Biol & Nat Management, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid; Fratini, Sara] IUCN Species Survival Commiss, Mangrove Specialist Grp, 28 Rue Mauverney, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland","Fratini, S (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Via Madonna del Piano 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.; Fratini, S (corresponding author), IUCN Species Survival Commiss, Mangrove Specialist Grp, 28 Rue Mauverney, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.",sarafratini@unifi.it,"Cannicci, Stefano/N-8512-2019","Cannicci, Stefano/0000-0002-6544-0213; Fratini, Sara/0000-0002-5754-8830; DAHDOUH-GUEBAS, Farid/0000-0002-5906-8996",FIRB project (Italian MIUR) Mangrove fauna and flora: pattern of reproductive biology and dispersal mechanisms; Belgian National Science Foundation; Flemish Interuniversity Council (VLIR),"Funds are from a FIRB project (Italian MIUR) Mangrove fauna and flora: pattern of reproductive biology and dispersal mechanisms to Stefano Cannicci and from the Belgian National Science Foundation and from the Flemish Interuniversity Council (VLIR) to Farid Dahdouh Guebas.

Few studies, however, have addressed how relative susceptibility to predation influences such interactions. Here we examine the effect of chemical cues from the common shore crab Carcinus maenas on the foraging behavior of two common intertidal gastropod molluscs. Of the two model consumers studied, Littorina littorea is morphologically more vulnerable to crab predation than Gibbula umbilicalis, and it exhibited greater competitive ability in the absence of predation threat. However, Littorina demonstrated a greater antipredator response when experimentally exposed to predation cues, resulting in a lower level of foraging. This reversed the competitive interaction, allowing Gibbula substantially increased access to shared resources. Our results demonstrate that the susceptibility of consumers to predation can influence species interactions, and suggest that inter-specific differences in trait-mediated indirect interactions are another mechanism through which non-consumptive predator effects may influence trophic interactions.","[Mowles, Sophie L.; Rundle, Simon D.; Cotton, Peter A.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Mowles, Sophie L.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Loughborough, Leics, England","Mowles, SL (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",sophie.mowles@gmail.com,,"Cotton, Peter/0000-0002-4830-0868",,,,47,29,29,1,46,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"185 BERRY ST, STE 1300, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 17,2011,6,8,,,,,,,e23068,10.1371/journal.pone.0023068,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,810JJ,WOS:000294121300012,21857993,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-24,

Tapes philippinarum occurred at significantly higher densities and occupied a deeper stratum in the sediment than Anomalocardia squamosa, which is a species protected by a much thicker shell. Both species showed an aggregated pattern of spatial distribution over the scale of 10(1) to 10(-2) m. There was no correlation between the densities of the two bivalves nor was there any relationship between body condition and burying depth of Tapes philippinarum. However, individuals of Anomalocardia squamosa residing in the 2-4 cm depth stratum had a significantly higher condition index than their counterparts in the 0-2 cm stratum. The three-dimensional distribution pattern of the two bivalves in relation to density and presence of the other species was investigated by using tagging experiments in the laboratory whereby the exact three-dimensional position of the individuals was recorded in the form of an x,y,z coordinate. The same relative vertical distribution pattern of the bivalves as in the field was maintained while nearest neighbour analysis using the three- (x,y,z coordinates) or two-dimensional (only the x,y coordinates) data yielded different conclusions about the distribution pattern of the bivalves. The three-dimensional analysis consistently suggested an aggregated pattern whereas horizontal distribution was mostly random in the sediment matrix. Both horizontal, vertical and total displacement by individuals of Tapes philippinarum, but not Anomalocardia squamosa, were significantly affected by manipulations of the densities of conspecifics and/or A. squamosa. The latter species, however, was responsive to manipulations in terms of their burying depth. Both species showed considerable movements over the 2-week experimental period. The presence of a predator Portunus pelagicus did not significantly change the vertical distribution pattern of the two bivalves but the mortality of Tapes philippinarum was significantly higher than that of Anomalocardia squamosa. The results suggest that short-term responses such as emigration may be an important response to potential competitive interaction among infaunal bivalves and that such interaction may reduce the usefulness of long-term indicators such as growth and mortality. Whereas burying depth of infaunal bivalves may be influenced intra-specifically by trade-off between predation risk and hunger level, the soft tissue: shell weight (approximate to defence) ratio seems to be a more general predictor of vertical distribution in intra- as well as inter-specific comparisons.","UNIV HONG KONG,SWIRE INST MARINE SCI,HONG KONG,HONG KONG","Lee, SY (corresponding author), UNIV HONG KONG,DEPT ECOL & BIODIVERS,POKFULAM RD,HONG KONG,HONG KONG.",,"Lee, Joe S.

At the start of the research program, a number of general recruitment hypotheses were formulated, i.e. focusing on (1) predation, (2) food availability, (3) physical parameters, (4) the impact of current systems, and finally (5) the importance of top-clown vs bottom-up effects. The present study synthesizes the results of field sampling (2002 and 2003), laboratory experiments, and modeling studies to re-evaluate these hypotheses for the Baltic sprat stock. Recruitment success was quite different in the 2 years investigated. Despite a lower spawning stock biomass in 2003, the total number of recruits was almost 2-fold higher that year compared to 2002. The higher recruitment success in 2003 could be attributed to enhanced survival success during the post-larval/juvenile stage, a life phase that appears to be critical for recruitment dynamics. In the state of the Baltic ecosystem during the period of investigation, we consider bottom-up control (e.g. temperature, prey abundance) to be more important than top-down control (predation mortality). This ranking in importance does not vary seasonally. Prevailing water circulation patterns and the transport dynamics of larval cohorts have a strong influence on sprat recruitment success. Pronounced transport to coastal areas is detrimental for year-class strength particularly at high sprat stock sizes. A suggested mechanism is density-dependant regulation of survival via intra- and inter-specific competition for prey in coastal areas. A documented change in larval vertical migration behavior between the early 1990s and early 2000s increased the transport potential to the coast, strengthening the coupling between inter-annual differences in the magnitude and direction of wind-driven surface currents and year-to-year changes in reproductive success. However, due to the strong linkages and feed-back loops in the Baltic Sea food web, the most robust projections of the future strength of the Baltic sprat stock will need to take into account climate-driven changes in both abiotic (e.g., drift trajectories) and biotic (trophodynamic) factors. Although our understanding of processes affecting pre-recruit (larval) growth and survival has been advanced by the integrated research conducted within the GLOBEC Germany program, key mechanisms potentially affecting life stages outside of the spawning basins remain to be explored including the dynamics of coastal habitats of juveniles and the feeding and overwintering grounds of adults.

In experiment 1, P. dunni were more aggressive than P. vehiculum and P. vandykei, which rarely bit their opponents. In experiment 2, two different food levels had no detectable effect on the aggressiveness of residents. Resident P. dunni (males, females, and juveniles) were equally likely to bite conspecific and congeneric salamanders introduced into their cages. However, their dispersion under cover objects was uniform (suggesting territoriality) only in pairings between conspecific individuals. In contrast, P. vehiculum showed little aggression and were randomly dispersed under cover objects.

Here, we assessed preference and competition for habitat types (cobble vs. sand) for H. sanguineus and two competitor species; the previous invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, and the native rock crab, Cancer irroratus, in New England. In simple laboratory experiments, we paired similarly sized heterospecifics and conspecifics from each species, and also grouped combinations of C. maenas and H. sanguineus in a series of four-individual sets in order to dissect the outcome of intra- and inter-specific competition at different densities. Individually, all three species preferred cobble substrate. With paired conspecifics, H. sanguineus individuals would cohabitate in cobble, whereas C. maenas and C. irroratus individuals each excluded conspecifics from cobble. In heterospecific pairs, H. sanguineus excluded both C. maenas and C. irroratus from cobble. C. maenas and C. irroratus, were equally likely to exclude the other species, but rarely excluded H. sanguineus. In larger assemblages, H. sanguineus preferentially grouped under cobble, whereas C. maenas were more evenly distributed among habitat types. These observations demonstrate that conspecific tolerance and heterospecific competition can be effective, complementary mechanisms for overcoming invasion resistance.

Anopheles gambiae, the primary malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa, is typically associated with ephemeral, sunlit habitats; however, An. gambiae larvae often share these habitats with other anophelines along with other disease-transmitting and benign mosquito species. Resource limitations within habitats can constrain larval density and development, and this drives competitive interactions among and between species. Methods: We used naturally occurring stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen to identify resource partitioning among co-occurring larval species in microcosms and natural habitats in western Kenya. We used two and three source mixing models to estimate resource utilization (i.e. bacteria, algae, organic matter) by larvae. Results: Laboratory experiments revealed larval delta C-13 and delta N-15 composition to reflect the food sources they were reared on. Resource partitioning was demonstrated between An. gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae sharing the same microcosms. Differences in larval delta C-13 and delta N-15 content was also evident in natural habitats, and Anopheles species were consistently more enriched in delta C-13 when compared to culicine larvae. Conclusions: These observations demonstrate inter-specific resource partitioning between Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae larvae in natural habitats in western Kenya. This information may be translated into opportunities for targeted larval control efforts by limiting specific larval food resources, or through bio-control utilizing competitors at the same trophic level.","[Gilbreath, Thomas M., III] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kweka, Eliningaya J.] Trop Pesticides Res Inst, Mosquito Sect, Div Livestock & Human Dis Vector Control, Arusha, Tanzania; [Afrane, Yaw A.; Githeko, Andrew K.] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Kisumu 40100, Kenya; [Yan, Guiyun] Univ Calif Irvine, Program Publ Hlth, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Yan, GY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Program Publ Hlth, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",guiyuny@uci.edu,,"Kweka, Eliningaya/0000-0002-8891-758X",FIC NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43 TW001505] Funding Source: Medline; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI050243] Funding Source: Medline; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43TW001505] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI050243] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,36,10,10,0,14,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,DEC 12,2013,6,,,,,,,,353,10.1186/1756-3305-6-353,,,7,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,277RW,WOS:000328838000004,24330747,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-24,

We investigated possible indirect effects of seawater acidification on the feeding, fecundity, and hatching success of the calanoid copepod Acartia grani, mediated by potential CO2-induced changes in the nutritional characteristics of their prey. We used as prey the autotrophic dinoflagellate Heterocapsa sp., cultured at three distinct pH levels (control: 8.17, medium: 7.96, and low: 7.75) by bubbling pure CO2 via a computer automated system. Acartia grani adults collected from a laboratory culture were acclimatized for 3 d at food suspensions of Heterocapsa from each pH treatment (ca. 500 cells ml(-1); 300 iwg C l(-1)). Feeding and egg production rates of the preconditioned females did not differ significantly among the three Heterocapsa diets. Egg hatching success, monitored once per day for the 72 h, did not reveal significant difference among treatments. These results are in agreement with the lack of difference in the cellular stoichiometry (C: N,C: P, and N : P ratios) and fatty acid concentration and composition encountered between the three tested Heterocapsa treatments. Our findings disagree with those of other studies using distinct types of prey, suggesting that this kind of indirect influence of acidification on copepods may be largely associated with inter specific differences among prey items with regard to their sensitivity to elevated CO2 levels.","[Isari, Stamatina; Zervoudaki, Soultana] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, PO 712,46-7 Km Ave Athens Sounio, Athens 19013, Greece; [Isari, Stamatina; Pelejero, Carles; Saiz, Enric] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Peters, Janna] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, Grosse Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Papantoniou, Georgia] Univ Athens, Dept Biol, Athens 15701, Greece; [Pelejero, Carles] ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Catalonia, Spain","Isari, S (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, PO 712,46-7 Km Ave Athens Sounio, Athens 19013, Greece.; Isari, S (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",misari@hcmr.gr,"Isari, Stamatina/J-6987-2014; Saiz, Enric/K-4263-2014; Pelejero, Carles/AAF-4550-2019","Isari, Stamatina/0000-0003-3457-0274; Saiz, Enric/0000-0003-2611-0067; Pelejero, Carles/0000-0002-7763-7769; Zervoudaki, Soultana/0000-0002-3499-8433","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity [CTM2011-23480, CTM2012-32017]; project CROA [LS8-1893]; European Social Fund (ESF)European Social Fund (ESF); Greek State; ICREAICREA Funding Source: Custom","The authors thank Kaiene Griffell and Angel Lopez-Sanz for assistance in the experimental work, Afrodite Adroni for the C-N analysis, Joachim Lutke for the support with the lipid analyses, and Xavier Leal for his technical help.

Studies in systems with multiple predator species have shown that the strength of these interactions may not be predictable and is largely dependent on individual behavioural traits, species density and habitat complexity. Although the association of prey consumption and satiation of a foraging predator has long been recognized, there has been relatively little research on how prey availability affects multiple predators' effects. In this work, we present a framework to investigate the variation in two coexisting/competing predators' effects on prey risk as affected by the prey availability rate. Functional responses by each predator species were first studied in single-predator treatments. Then, the intra- and inter-specific competition was investigated by employing additive and substitutative experimental designs to highlight the nature of multiple effects. Intra- and interspecific interactions were found to be similar and there was risk reduction, and risk enhancement for the prey at intermediate and high levels, respectively, according to the multiplicative risk model (MRM). The results indicated that when similar predators are concerned, the outcomes of MRM may vary according to the functional response curve of these predators. Thus, studies involving a wide range of prey densities are required to explore the nature of interactions. Moreover, this kind of experimental data can contribute to unravelling complexities in theoretical approaches by earlier studies and ultimately promote understanding the effect of multiple predators on prey population regulation.","[Lampropoulos, Panagiotis D.; Fantinou, Argyro A.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Perdikis, Dionyssios Ch.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Agr Zool & Entomol, GR-11855 Athens, Greece","Fantinou, AA (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, Iera Odos 75, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.",perdikis@aua.gr; argyr@aua.gr,,,,,,51,17,18,0,74,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1439-1791,1618-0089,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

Of particular interest and importance are the effects of contaminants on inter-species interactions such as competition and predator-prey relationships. The objective of this study was to determine whether environmentally relevant concentrations of the commonly used insecticide, malathion, would alter predator avoidance behavior in a freshwater gastropod that could translate to increased predation risk. We exposed adult Physa pomilia snails to 0, 0.25, or 1.0 mg/L malathion for 2, 24, or 48 h and evaluated predator avoidance using a behavioral assay in which snails were exposed to cues from predatory crayfish. We found a significant reduction in predator avoidance in snails exposed to both concentrations of malathion after 48 h of exposure. To evaluate whether observed effects of malathion on predator avoidance actually increased susceptibility of snails to predators, we conducted a predator challenge experiment. Snails exposed to 0.25 mg/L malathion for 48 h were significantly more susceptible to predation. That increased predation risk was evident 48 h after initial malathion exposures is a unique result because most studies have evaluated behavioral responses soon after (< 12 h) initiation of pesticide exposure. The extent to which the observed interactions affect natural populations, and the mechanisms through which they are mediated are largely unexplored. However, our study is the first to show that a commonly used insecticide decreases predator avoidance and may actually increase predation susceptibility in gastropods at concentrations several orders of magnitude below acute toxicity levels.","[Salice, Christopher J.; Kimberly, David A.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Environm Toxicol, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA","Salice, CJ (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Environm Toxicol, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, POB 41163, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",chris.salice@ttu.edu,,,Texas Tech University; Institute of Environmental and Human Health (TIEHH),The authors would like to thank Texas Tech University and the Institute of Environmental and Human Health (TIEHH) for support to DAK.

We investigate changes in partitioning of the temporal niche in a mammalian community in response to both the rapid decline in abundance of a top predator and its rapid increase, produced by two concurrent natural experiments: 1) the severe decline of the Tasmanian devil due to a transmissible cancer, and 2) the introduction of Tasmanian devils to an island, with subsequent population increase. We focus on devils, two mesopredators and three prey species, allowing us to examine niche partitioning in the context of intra- and inter-specific competition, and predator-prey interactions. The most consistent shift in temporal activity occurred in devils themselves, which were active earlier in the night at high densities, presumably because of heightened intraspecific competition. When devils were rare, their closest competitor, the spotted-tailed quoll, increased activity in the early part of the night, resulting in increased overlap with the devil's temporal niche and suggesting release from interference competition. The invasive feral cat, another mesopredator, did not shift its temporal activity in response to either decreasing or increasing devil densities. Shifts in temporal activity of the major prey species of devils were stronger in response to rising than to falling devil densities. We infer that the costs associated with not avoiding predators when their density is rising (i.e. death) are higher than the costs of continuing to adopt avoidance behaviours as predator densities fall (i.e. loss of foraging opportunity), so rising predator densities may trigger more rapid shifts. The rapid changes in devil abundance provide a unique framework to test how the non-lethal effects of top predators affect community-wide partitioning of temporal niches, revealing that this top predator has an important but varied influence on the diel activity of other species.","[Cunningham, Calum X.; Scoleri, Vince; Johnson, Christopher N.; Barmuta, Leon A.; Jones, Menna E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Johnson, Christopher N.] Univ Tasmania, Australian Res Council, Ctr Australian Biodivers & Heritage, Hobart, Tas, Australia","Cunningham, CX (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",calum.cunningham@utas.edu.au,"Barmuta, Leon/J-2413-2013; Johnson, Christopher N/J-7894-2014; Cunningham, Calum X/O-9638-2015; CABAH, ARC/T-6419-2019","Barmuta, Leon/0000-0002-8946-3727; Johnson, Christopher N/0000-0002-9719-3771; Cunningham, Calum X/0000-0003-1640-2533; Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022; Scoleri, Vince/0000-0002-8112-6689","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP110103069, FT100100250]; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal","Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council (DP110103069 and FT100100250), Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment and the Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal.",,60,13,13,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,DEC,2019,42,12,,,SI,,2157,2168,,10.1111/ecog.04485,,SEP 2019,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JU0HZ,WOS:000487950700001,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-24,

Although documented predation is rare, studies regularly report competitive dominance by fish that, as larger competitors reliant on aquatic habitat, exclude semi-aquatic salamanders to marginal stream habitat. However, it is unclear whether fish interact with stream-breeding salamanders through indirect effects such as competition for resources (e.g. food or cover) or fear (i.e. threat of predation) nor is it known whether these interactions are consistent through time. This study used a novel caging approach to determine if competitive outcomes between a headwater fish and salamanders were regulated primarily through resource depletion (exploitative competition) or behavioural avoidance (interference competition). We paired banded sculpin (Cottus carolinae) and larval red salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber) of similar body size in independent flow through mesocosms with intra- and inter-specific pairs allowed to interact physically or non-physically. The experiment was repeated in the autumn and in the spring when stream salamander larvae begin to transform into terrestrial juveniles. Banded sculpin negatively influenced growth of red salamanders regardless of whether they were allowed to physically interact, suggesting interference competition and behavioural avoidance. This asymmetrical effect was strongest in the spring when salamanders underwent metamorphosis at higher rates in the presence of fish. However, in the autumn, the effects were more balanced between the two species with salamanders impacting fish through exploitative competition. By studying the temporal relationships between two competitors and using a caging method novel to competition studies, we established that the outcomes of competition are dependent on season and may vary in type relative to the timing of life-history events. For this community, these results suggest that outcomes of competition are highly dependent on season and could indicate a biotic mechanism maintaining headwater salamander distributions through source-sink dynamics. Our results also suggest that, in this species interaction, it may be unwarranted to assume that the outcomes of competition at one time represent the complex relationships regulating community interactions.","[Cecala, Kristen K.; Walker, Eli H.] Univ South, Dept Biol, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA; [Ennen, Joshua R.; Fix, Shawna M.] Tennessee Aquarium Conservat Inst, Chattanooga, TN USA; [Davenport, Jon M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Cecala, KK (corresponding author), Univ South, Dept Biol, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA.",kkcecala@sewanee.edu,,,AZFA Clark Waldram Fund,AZFA Clark Waldram Fund.,,108,1,1,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

We maintained yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in holding tanks throughout a twenty-year period, routinely collecting data on mass and length of individual fish over time. The water temperature of the holding tanks was maintained at 19.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C (mean +/- s.d.) and the yellowfin tuna were fed a diet amounting to 176 +/- 36 kJ center dot kg(-1) of tuna biomass center dot day(-1) across the study period. We integrated length records (n = 249) with a prior model of yellowfin tuna age to generate a von Bertalanffy growth function for this captive scenario with the parameters 224.26 cm straight fork length (SFL), 0.099, and -1.721 years for L-infinity, k, and t(o), respectively. We combined our growth model and analyses of tuna tissue energy with metabolic data from various sources to estimate a bioenergetic budget for this difficult -to-study species. We found that the captive tunas in this experiment grew significantly slower than yellowfin tuna studied in the wild and in other captive scenarios. Our energetic budget indicates that only 7.8% of an ingested meal's energetic content was utilized for growth. Furthermore, we calculated an average food conversion ratio of 37.2:1 for an 8.4 kg yellowfin tuna when fed a mixed-diet of squid, sardine, and vitamin gelatin. We conclude with a discussion of the various factors influencing tuna bioenergetics including the role of water temperature, diet, and inter-species competition on growth and energy assimilation. These findings are uniquely suited to the relatively cool temperatures and low energy diet maintained in this captive scenario, an important consideration for others hoping to draw on these results for comparative research.

In shallow-water sediments, competition is usually symmetric and relatively weak. Asymmetric competition that leads to the elimination of one species by another on time scales shorter than one generation is rare, apart from interactions that involve large-scale modification or disturbance of the sediment. Competition is therefore relatively unimportant as a process structuring communities and the impact of predation is usually to reduce rather than enhance diversity. These results have been largely ignored by the literature on deep-sea diversity. If deep-sea communities function in similar ways, coexistence of many species within small areas on short time scales does not need further explanation. We do, however, need to explain why abundances of all species remain bounded on large spatial scales and time scales of several generations. The model of diversity maintenance proposed by Huston (1979) and applied to the deep sea by Rex (1983) achieves this by implicit intra-specific, density-dependent processes that increase the population growth rate of species that have become locally rare. This would give robust maintenance of diversity, but there is no evidence for density dependence of this type in the deep sea, and nio plausible mechanisms by which it could occur. Alternative models require either spatial heterogeneity on a scale much larger than that envisaged by the grain-matching hypothesis or the placing of a cap on the abundance of common species, perhaps by frequency-dependent predation. Arbitrating between these possibilities will require assessments of the population dynamics and spatial distribution of individual species on spatial and temporal scales much greater than those usually considered in the deep sea.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Grant, A (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",a.grant@uea.ac.uk,"Grant, Alastair/L-7301-2018","Grant, Alastair/0000-0002-1147-2375",,,,97,19,21,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-9565,,,MAR ECOL-P S Z N I,Mar.

Between 2009 and 2011, densities of gobies in the Rhine increased while their condition decreased, assuming that the populations are approaching or even reached the capacity of the ecosystem. Consequently, we hypothesized a high level of competition on food resources within this group of invasive gobies that all exhibit the same sedentary life style, which might strengthen the differentiation of the ecological niche on a spatial and temporal axis. Invasive gobies were caught with electro fishing and beach seining in different types of habitats over a period of two years in the Lower Rhine, analyzing the food of more than 1500 gobies of the three species Neogobius fluviatilis (NF), Neogobius melanostomus (NM) and Ponticola kessleri (PK). All species showed an opportunistic feeding strategy. In NF and PK, a clear shift in preferred food resources was observed between individuals smaller and larger 50 mm that occurred in parallel with a habitat shift from sandy areas to riprap structures in PK, but not in NF that were only found on gravel and sand. In contrast, there were no distinct changes in food and habitat preference in NM. Small NM were found from spring to autumn on the sandy nearshore areas where they competed on food resources with juvenile PK in spring, and with NF in late summer, respectively. Abundance of juvenile NF and NM increased during the night in sandy nearshore areas in October: This behavior is assumed as predator avoidance against large piscivorous NF as well as native pikeperch, because active feeding occurred mainly during the day. The results on the three invasive Gobiids in the Lower Rhine give important hints how fine-tuned spatial and temporal characteristics in intra- and inter-specific competition shape the ecological niche of these invaders in their new environment.

In the absence of a competitor, intra-specific competition may favor an expansion of the species niche and drive morphological evolution in character release. Despite of this theoretical framework, we sometimes find potential competitor species using the same niche range without any partitioning in niche. We used a database on test fishing in Sweden to evaluate the factors (inter- and intraspecific competition, predation, and abiotic factors) that could influence habitat choice of two competitor species. The pattern from the database shows that the occurrence of perch and roach occupying both littoral and pelagic habitats of lakes in Sweden is a general phenomenon. Furthermore, the results from the database suggest that this pattern is due to intra-specific competition rather than inter-specific competition or predation. In a field study, we estimated the morphological variation in perch and roach and found that, individuals of both species caught in the littoral zone were more deeper bodied compared to individuals caught in the pelagic zone. Pelagic perch fed more on zooplankton compared to littoral perch, independent of size, whereas the littoral perch had more macroinvertebrates and fish in their diet. Pelagic roach fed more on zooplankton compared to littoral roach, whereas littoral individuals fed more on plant material. Furthermore, we sampled littoral and pelagic fish from another lake to evaluate the generality of our first results and found the same habitat associated morphology in both perch and roach. The results show a consistent multi-species morphological separation in the littoral and pelagic habitats. This study suggests that intra-specific competition is possibly more important than inter-specific competition for the morphological pattern in the perch-roach system.","Uppsala Univ, Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut Limnol, S-75123 Uppsala, Sweden; Inst Freshwater Res, S-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden","Svanback, R (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut Limnol, Husargatan 3,Box 573, S-75123 Uppsala, Sweden.",richard.svanback@ebc.uu.se,,,,,,54,104,106,2,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2008,117,1,,,,,114,124,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16267.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,237PG,WOS:000251387000014,,,,,2021-09-24,

While utilizing several natural enemies may enhance control, there is also the potential for disruptive interspecific interactions. Such interactions may be studied in the laboratory by focusing on the details of the interactions themselves and attempting to infer population level consequences from their sum, or by focusing more directly on the overall effects on natural enemy populations: we term these approaches 'reductionist' and 'holistic.' Here we conduct a holistic laboratory study on interactions between three species of parasitoid wasps that are parasitoids of the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae): Cephalonomia stephanoderis Betrem, C. hyalinipennis Ashmead and Prorops nasuta Waterston (all Hymenoptera: Bethylidae). We find evidence for both intra- and inter-specific resource competition. Interactions between C stephanoderis and P. nasuta, both indigenous to Africa, appear to be approximately symmetrical, while C hyalinipennis, naturally found in the coffee plantations of Chiapas, Mexico, may exert a disruptive influence. C hyalinipennis also has a low population growth rate. We now consider it to be a detrimental invader of the Mexican coffee agro-ecosystem that should not be encouraged by augmentative release or introduced into other regions. Overall, the most successful species, in terms of both emergence and female production, was P. nasuta. We compare these results with those from prior reductionist and holistic studies, and with observations on patterns of establishment of these bethylid species in the field. Given that it is increasingly clear that disruptive inter-specific interactions are generally common when multiple species are deployed in biological control, screening of potential agents should consider such interactions alongside the more 'traditional' focus on host specificity.

Antibiosis can occur through the release of plant chemicals from the roots into the soil, which malt adversely affect the host-finding behavior of the infective stage nematode, or the presence of these chemicals in the host insect may negatively affect nematode reproduction. In laboratory studies, intra-specific and inter-specific competition reduces nematode fitness, and inter-specific competition can cause local extinction of a nematode species. For example, after concomitant infection of a host, a steinernematid species usually excludes a heterorhabditid species. The mechanism for the steinernematid superiority has been postulated to be a bacteriocin(s) produced by Xenorhabdus, the symbiotic bacterium of the steinernematid which prevents Photorhabdus, the symbiotic bacterium of the heterorhabditid, from multiplying. Inter-specific competition between two steinernematid species shows that both can co-exist in a host, but one species will eventually prevail in the environment. By having different foraging strategies, however, both steinermatid species may co-exist in the same habitat. An important issue is whether the introduction of an exotic entomopathogenic nematode species will competitively displace an indigenous nematode species. Although the environmental risks are small, the recommended policy is that the introduction of exotic nematodes be regulated With other pathogens, entomopathogenic nematodes can out-compete entomopathogenic fungi, but not Bacillus thuringiensis, for the same host individual when both the nematode and entomopathogen are applied simultaneously. The best studied natural enemy is the nemnrophagous fungus, Hirsutella rhossiliensis, which causes higher mortality in Steinernema glaseri compared with Heterorhabditis bacteriorphora. Differential susceptibility to the fungus may be associated with the retention of the second-stage cuticle by H. bacteriophora. Invertebrate predators including mites and collembolans feed on entomopathogenic nematodes. Although a number of studies have been conducted with antagonists, there is a dearth of field data. We suggest that long-term research plots be established where natural populations of entomopathogenic nematodes occur and include antagonists as a component of such studies.",,"Kaya, HK (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT NEMATOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,101,86,88,3,35,CARFAX PUBL CO,ABINGDON,"PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE",0958-3157,,,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

Plants in the ecosystem are represented with a. generic model that can be configured to represent many different types of species, including herbs, bushes and trees. Each plant, or small collection of plants, is represented by a unique object with attributes and functions. Population level dynamics are therefore governed by and emerge from object-level rules that describe processes such as growth and reproduction. The plant objects are distributed over a spatially explicit terrain, and their behaviour is driven by irregular climatic forcing functions. The plant canopy is modelled with three layers of vertical differentiation, which affects inter-species competition for available radiant energy. In addition to competing with other plants for essential nutrients, sunlight and water, the plant objects may also be subject to predation by herbivores. The performance of the plant model is demonstrated with simulations based on ecosystems configured with small collections of species distributed about a 500 x 500 m(2) terrain. Results show this modelling approach to be effective in depicting phenomena at the individual, population, and ecosystem-levels, including effects of herbivory and inter-species competition on plant growth, patterns of plant population dynamics and spatial distribution, and total system biomass.

Considering migrations between patches to be faster than local interaction allows us to study a three-dimensional system by means of a two-dimensional one. On the other hand, a two time scales periodic eco-epidemic model is addressed by considering two competing species, one of them being affected by a periodic SIR epidemic process which is faster than inter-species interactions.

An example of the need to quantify the strength and direction of the species interactions is giant panda conservation in newly established reserves. Although the habitat requirements of giant panda have been broadly studied, the degree of its interactions with sympatric large mammals remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically surveyed for species occurrence in the southwestern China during 2008-2013, to better understand the interactions between giant panda and four sympatric large mammal species. We constructed species-specific occupancy models based on camera-trapping data using both environmental and detection variables. We then used the important predictor variables for each species to construct pairwise species co-occurrence models following a Bayesian framework. Our analysis detected significant habitat overlap between giant panda and its sympatric species. However, there was no evidence of native species limiting the distribution of giant pandas despite their extensive use of the same forests. The only evidence for negative interactions was between the distributions of giant panda and domestic cattle within bamboo forest, the primary habitat of giant pandas. The co-occurrence model has value for any conservation planning that benefits from knowledge of inter-species interactions.

Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus) was a major food of all three predators. White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was commonly eaten by Coyotes and Bobcats in winter, and use of deer corresponded with winter severity. Mice (Peromyscus spp. and Napaeozapus insignis), voles (Clethrionomys gapperi and Microtus pennsylvanicus), and shrews (Blarina brevicauda and Sorex spp.) were more common in fox scats than in those of Coyotes and Bobcats. During summer, fruits were common in Coyote and fox scats and absent from Bobcat scats. The prevalence of hare in all three diets suggests that inter-specific competition might occur, especially when hares are scarce. Such competition is likely to be most severe for Bobcats, because they showed the greatest reliance on a single food (hares).","UNIV MAINE,MAINE COOPERAT FISH & WILDLIFE RES UNIT,ORONO,ME 04469",,,"Arthur, Stephen/AAP-1708-2021",,,,,0,37,37,2,78,OTTAWA FIELD-NATURALISTS CLUB,OTTAWA,"BOX 3264 POSTAL STATION C, OTTAWA ON K1Y 4J5, CANADA",0008-3550,,,CAN FIELD NAT,Can.

At One Tree Reef, in the southern Great Barrier Reef, deposit-feeding cerithiid gastropods, Rhinoclavis aspera (Linnaeus, 1758), R. fasciata (Bruguiere, 1792) and R. vertagus (linnaeus, 1758), are most abundant in an atypical environment, the coarse sandy sediments of a back-reef sandflat. Densities in the finer sediments of the lagoon are several orders of magnitude smaller than on the sandflat. In this study, these three species were enclosed al a range of naturally occurring densities in fine and coarse sediments to investigate their competitive interactions and the influence of sediment on their growth. The type of substratum in experimental enclosures influenced the growth of each species. Growth was greatest in the fine sediments from the lagoon, despite the fact that recruitment of each species had been shown to be greatest into the coarse sediments of the sandflat. Adult R. aspera significantly reduced the growth of juveniles of the three species, but adults of R. fasciata and R. vertagus had no significant effect on the growth of juveniles of R. aspera. These results are probably a function of the large disparity in the densities of the three species: R. aspera occur in densities an order of magnitude greater than the other two species and naturally occurring densities were used in the experiments. Competition for food or other expendable resources was distinguished from direct interference competition for space by including in our experiments treatments with dead shells occupying the same volume as live adults, but not utilizing expendable resources. Direct competition for space between adults and juveniles of R. aspera is unlikely to be important as a factor affecting the growth of juvenile R. aspera. Dead shells had no significant effect on the growth of juveniles in coarse or fine sediment. Direct competition for space may be more important for R. fasciata and R. vertagus because, in some cases, the presence of dead shells reduced the growth of juveniles. These experiments demonstrate how complex competitive interactions among Rhinoclavis spp. are modified by the type of sediment and vary with the particular combination of competitors. Research in rocky intertidal systems has similarly shown how the physical environment may modify the nature of biological interactions such as competition and predation. Our results are consistent with findings from temperate systems in that growth of Rhinoclavis spp. was limited by the availability of food or a related resource such as the availability of suitably sized particles of sediment for ingestion. This system differs, however, because deposit-feeding snails occur in their greatest densities in a habitat where they have the slowest rates of growth. Further work is needed to explain these patterns of distribution and abundance and why they differ from those typical of studies in temperate systems in the northern hemisphere.",,"SKILLETER, GA (corresponding author), UNIV SYDNEY,INST MARINE ECOL,ZOOL BLDG AO8,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.",,"Underwood, A J/B-1299-2008; Skilleter, Greg Alan/F-9250-2010","Skilleter, Greg Alan/0000-0002-4719-0409",,,,70,10,10,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

This is the task that confronts efforts to understand dietary resource partitioning among co-occurring juvenile shark species within nursery areas. Here, stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) is used to overcome these challenges in describing species dietary resource partitioning strategies within the communal shark nursery area of Cleveland Bay, Queensland, Australia. We analyzed the isotopic composition of 3 distinct tissues, (muscle, blood plasma, and red blood cells), for 7 species of shark and 3 species of large predatory teleost to investigate whether these communal areas support their diverse array of predators without the need for resource partitioning strategies. Clustered delta N-15 values for all examined species indicated feeding within the same trophic level; however, wide ranging delta C-13 values denoted exploitation of several primary carbon sources. Our results demonstrate inter-species resource partitioning strategies at work within the examined communal shark nursery, altering the previous interpretation of these areas as resource-rich and/or competitionlimited environments.","[Kinney, Michael J.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Fishing & Fisheries Res Ctr, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hussey, Nigel E.; Fisk, Aaron T.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada","Kinney, MJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Fishing & Fisheries Res Ctr, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",michael.kinney@my.jcu.edu.au,"Kinney, Mike/Q-3787-2019; Simpfendorfer, Colin A/G-9681-2011; Hussey, Nigel E/F-9699-2015","Kinney, Mike/0000-0001-7846-8349; Simpfendorfer, Colin A/0000-0002-0295-2238; ",Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility (MTSRF); James Cook University (JCU); School for Earth and Environmental Sciences (SEES),"This research was supported by funding from the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility (MTSRF), James Cook University (JCU), and the School for Earth and Environmental Sciences (SEES).

Here, we have examined for effects of Wolbachia infection in Aedes aegypti. Specifically, differential survivorship is observed when young larvae (1st instar) are exposed to older Aedes albopictus larvae (4th instar) or con-specific larvae. In an additional experiment, we have examined for differential behavior and observed that Wolbachia-infected larvae differ from uninfected larvae in their reaction to light stimulation. Our results support a hypothesized effect of Wolbachia on A. aegypti larval behavior. The results are discussed in relation to the ability of Wolbachia to invade natural populations and recently applied public health strategies that target the replacement or suppression of this important disease vector.

Its age makes it a key site for studying the behavior of the early hominin groups of the Iberian Peninsula and western Europe and the ecological context in which they developed. At La Mina locality, three archaeostratigraphic levels have been identified, with level 2 being the richest in terms of the archaeological remains recovered. It exhibits high taxonomic diversity, with the most common taxa belonging to open and partially open habitats, although aquatic and riparian taxa have also been identified. Carnivore remains are present, although scarce. Coprolites from a hyaenid have also been found. Both hominin and carnivore activity has been documented at the site. Evidence of carnivore activity suggests at least one bone-cracking carnivore had access to the assemblage. The anatomical ratios employed suggest that La Mina was formed at a time of high competition (intra and/or inter-specific), with a high number of predators in this ecological context. Anthropic activity in a highly competitive context might suggest that these hominin groups had a high degree of control over the environment and over local resources, as has been shown at other Early Pleistocene sites.

Using data from three GPS-collared female leopards (Panthera pardus) and over an eight-month period, we attempted to establish whether leopards in a mountainous landscape display preferential behaviour (i.e. specialist) or not (i.e. generalist). We investigated whether female leopards used habitats in accordance with availability for both hunting and regular activities, and whether female leopards demonstrated preference for a particular prey species. Finally, we assessed tree caching behaviour and discuss leopard spatial dynamics in the context of superior competitors, such as lions (Panthera leo). Female leopards demonstrated selection for certain prey species. Mixed closed woodland (greatest vegetation density; lowest prey density) and tall open woodland (greatest vegetation biomass; high prey density) were preferred over other habitats. Female leopards on Welgevonden cached significantly larger prey species in trees. Our results suggest that female leopards in this landscape are selecting habitats - enabling the exploitation of certain ecological features - that balance energy expenditure against the likelihood of capturing prey in an attempt to maximize efficiency, whilst reducing inter-specific competition. We suggest that female leopards are limited in their foraging ability as a result of interference competition by superior species like lions, which in turn, affects their choice of prey. These findings highlight the potential importance of numerous ecological, spatio-temporal, and anthropogenic factors that influence leopard behaviour, and therefore have significant implications for leopard persistence and conservation.","[Pitman, Ross T.; Ramsay, Paul M.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biomed & Biol Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Kilian, Petrus J.] Khamab Kalahari Reserve, Bray, North West Prov, South Africa; [Swanepoel, Lourens H.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa","Pitman, RT (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biomed & Biol Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",rosstyzackpitman@me.com,"Ramsay, Paul M/A-9447-2008; Swanepoel, L H/O-3226-2019","Ramsay, Paul M/0000-0001-7631-6480; Swanepoel, L H/0000-0002-9955-8076",NRF [74819],"L.H.S. was supported by a NRF grant (No. 74819).

Different species vary in the way they forage in order to minimize encounters with their competitors and with their predators. However, it is still poorly known whether and how native species change their foraging behavior in the presence of exotic species, particularly in South America. Here we compare diet overlap of fruits and foraging activity period of two sympatric native ungulates (the white-lipped peccary, Tayassu pecari, and the collared peccary, Pecari tajacu) with the invasive feral pig (Sus scrofa) in the Brazilian Pantanal. We found high diet overlap between white-lipped peccaries and feral pigs, but low overlap between collared peccaries and feral pigs. Furthermore, we found that feral pigs may influence the foraging period of both native peccaries, but in different ways. In the absence of feral pigs, collared peccary activity peaks in the early evening, possibly allowing them to avoid white-lipped peccary activity peaks, which occur in the morning. In the presence of feral pigs, collared peccaries forage mostly in early morning, while white-lipped peccaries forage throughout the day. Our results indicate that collared peccaries may avoid foraging at the same time as white-lipped peccaries. However, they forage during the same periods as feral pigs, with whom they have lower diet overlap. Our study highlights how an exotic species may alter interactions between native species by interfering in their foraging periods.","[Galetti, Mauro; Camargo, Hileia; Siqueira, Tadeu; Ribeiro, Milton C.] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Dept Ecol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Keuroghlian, Alexine] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Donatti, Camila I.] Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci & Oceans, Arlington, VA USA; [Jorge, Maria Luisa S.

Yet facilitative behaviour is poorly studied, especially in marine ecosystems. We investigated the diet and foraging behaviour of 5 Afro-Palaearctic migratory seabirds during their non-breeding period in West Africa, focussing on their facilitative associations with predatory fishes. We used next-generation sequencing to describe the diet of 5 tern species, employing DNA metabarcoding for the identification of prey from droppings. This is the first time this method has been used for studying the diet of non-breeding migratory seabirds. Our results showed a high diet overlap among all seabirds, mostly due to the dominance of a single prey species, Sardinella maderensis (with a mean frequency of occurrence of 90% in tern diets). The subsurface marine predators identified in association with terns were crevalle jack Caranx hippos and West African Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus tritor, 2 predatory fishes which also rely on Sardinella maderensis as their most frequent prey in the study area, the Bijagos Archipelago. There were marked inter-specific differences in the reliance of terns on subsurface marine predators as facilitators, ranging from completely independent (little tern Sternula albifrons) to near-obligatory (black tern Chlidonias niger). The varied feeding strategies and small-scale spatial segregation may explain the co-existence of the 5 tern species during the non-breeding period, preying mostly on the same clupeids. Declines both in predatory fishes and in Sardinella maderensis and other clupeids are likely to impact the long-distance migrant seabirds studied here, calling for integrated management of fisheries in these coastal ecosystems.","[Correia, Edna; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Mata, Vanessa A.] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Regalla, Aissa] IBAP Inst Biodiversidade & Areas Protegidas Guine, Bissau, Guinea Bissau; [Catry, Paulo] ISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal","Correia, E (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",ednaritacorreia@gmail.com,"Correia, Edna/D-8766-2019; Mata, Vanessa Alves/L-7375-2013; Catry, Paulo/I-5408-2013; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/E-8060-2011","Correia, Edna/0000-0003-3893-1700; Mata, Vanessa Alves/0000-0003-3005-9030; Catry, Paulo/0000-0003-3000-0522; Regalla de Barros, Aissa/0000-0003-1522-8211; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/0000-0002-7207-3474","MAVA Foundation; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT Portugal)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [MARE-UID/MAR/04292/2019, IF/00502/2013/CP1186/CT0003]; FCT/MEC; FEDER within the PT2020 Partnership agreement [UID/AMB/50017]; FEDER within the Compete 2020 [UID/AMB/50017]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PD/BD/52594/2014]","This work was supported by the MAVA Foundation through a project granted to IBAP (Guinea-Bissau) - 'La recherche participative au service de la conservation de la biodiversite du Parc National Marin de Joao Vieira-Poilao (Archipel des Bijagos)'.

Resistance against an introduced fish can be through strong competition and/or predation from resident fishes. Here, the biotic resistance against introduced topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva (a highly invasive fish in Europe) by resident carp Cyprinus carpio was tested in experimental mesocosms. The introduction scenario was six adult P. parva (three male, three female) on a single occasion. Resistance to their establishment was provided by three and six resident C. carpio whose effects on P. parva growth and reproduction were compared to a Control (no resident fish at the time of introduction) and treatments containing three and six P. parva. After 120 days, the growth rates of the introduced P. parva were significantly depressed in C. carpio presence and in mesocosms with three C. carpio present, significantly decreased numbers of 0+P. parva were recorded. Where six C. carpio were present, no 0+P. parva were recorded, indicating resistance strength increased with carp abundance. In contrast, there were no differences in P. parva reproduction and growth rates between the Control and treatments containing conspecifics. Stable isotope analysis (delta N-15, delta C-13) revealed C. carpio were feeding at one trophic level above 0+P. parva, suggesting the process of resistance was predation (facultative piscivory) rather than competition. Thus, if P. parva are to establish and invade following an introduction, they must overcome this biotic resistance from cyprinid fishes such as C. carpio.","Bournemouth Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Ctr Conservat Ecol & Environm Change, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England","Britton, JR (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Ctr Conservat Ecol & Environm Change, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",rbritton@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Britton, Robert/AAO-6673-2020; Britton, Robert/B-5040-2009","Britton, Robert/0000-0003-1853-3086; Britton, Robert/0000-0003-1853-3086",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/H000429/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/H000429/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC research grant reference number NE/H000429/1).

Their inter-specific interactions can further complicate effects on community dynamics as a consequence of infra-guild competition. The capacity for competitive mammalian carnivores to segregate their hunting and activity regimes is in major part a function of their similarity, in terms of body-size and dietary niche; termed the 'niche variation hypothesis'. In this study, we used camera-trapping to investigate infra-guild interactions and spatio-temporal partitioning among five mesocarnivores, the golden jackal (Canis aureus), European badger (Metes meles), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European wildcat (Felis sylvestris) and stone marten (Martes foina), in the Stara Planina Mountains, Bulgaria. We collected a total of 444 images of golden jackals, 236 images of European badgers, 200 images of red foxes, 171 images of stone martens, and 145 images of European wildcats, from 6612 camera-days across fifteen camera-trapping stations. With respect to body size, the three smaller species (fox, wildcat and marten) were active in different time periods than the two larger competitors (jackal and badger) through both the warm and cold season. The more similar the trophic niche between species pairs (particularly relating to rodent consumption), the greater the spatio-temporal partitioning we observed within the pair; however, this adapted to seasonal dietary shifts. In conclusion, spatial and temporal (fine-scale and seasonal) niche partitioning appeared to reduce encounter probabilities and competition and may act to facilitate sympatric coexistence among this regional mesocarnivore guild.","[Tsunoda, Hiroshi] Ctr Environm Sci Saitama, 914 Kamitanadare, Kazo, Saitama 3470115, Japan; [Newman, Chris; Buesching, Christina D.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Peeva, Stanislava; Raichev, Evgeniy] Trakia Univ, Fac Agr, Students Campus, Stara Zagora 6000, Bulgaria; [Kaneko, Yayoi] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, 3-5-8 Saiwaicho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan","Tsunoda, H (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Sci Saitama, 914 Kamitanadare, Kazo, Saitama 3470115, Japan.",tsunoda.hiroshi@gmail.com; chris.newman@zoo.ox.ac.uk; st.peeva@abv.bg; eraichev@uni-sz.bg; christina.buesching@zoo.ox.ac.uk; ykaneko@cc.tuat.ac.jp,"Tsunoda, Hiroshi/L-2974-2019; Kaneko, Yayoi/G-1162-2013","Tsunoda, Hiroshi/0000-0001-6214-5625; Kaneko, Yayoi/0000-0002-3688-4309","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP26257404]; Trakia University; Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology",We thank to Kairi Ito for his cooperation for field sampling.

Ecological relationships around this pulsed resource are highly complex and are influenced by many factors, including those related to its availability and the management of carcasses by humans. In recent years progress has been made in understanding the scope, implications and value of carrion ecology, mainly using scavenger birds and arthropods as study models. However, carrion is important for other facultative scavengers, and even for other non-scavenger species, which may be influenced by the onset of the resources generated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of attendance of passerine birds, including the non-scavengers, at carrion inputs in order to divulge the importance of this resource, its relationship to other species, and to reveal its ecological implications. Individuals of the Corvidae family, recognized facultative scavengers, showed a similar trophic behavior to obligate scavenger raptors regarding the selection of carcass characteristics (i.e., format, scattering, biomass), the surrounding landscape and spatiotemporal conditions. Furthermore, corvids mismatched their presence with vultures, benefitting through commensalism from the generation of residual small pieces and scraps. The non-scavenger passerines avoided simultaneous presence with vultures and delayed their attendance to carcasses from the time of input. Non-corvid passerines profited from carrion opportunistically, especially through predation on scavenger arthropods. Thus, their appearance was linked to seasons and conditions with an increased abundance of invertebrates, and coincided with periods of higher energy demand (migration and wintering). Similarly, inter-specific competition in carrion exploitation as well as a decrease in abundance of arthropods may determine the segregation between non-corvid passerines and scavenger raptors.","[Moreno-Opo, Ruben] Univ Complutense Madrid, Vertebrate Biol & Conservat Grp, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Margalida, Antoni] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Moreno-Opo, R (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Vertebrate Biol & Conservat Grp, Madrid 28049, Spain.",rmorenoopo@gmail.com,"Margalida, Antoni/AAG-5337-2020; Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011; Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011","Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-0576-3993; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-7383-671X; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-3904-6212",TRAGSATEC [ESTRATEC 3076047]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [RYC-2012-11867],"This work was carried out within the framework of the Technical basis and guidelines for a strategy on feeding of endangered scavengers project (ESTRATEC 3076047), developed by TRAGSATEC and commissioned by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment.

Habitat quality, patch area and isolation are mainly focused on when analyzing distribution patterns in fragmented landscapes. The effects of landscape heterogeneity in the non-occupied matrix, however, have been largely neglected. Here, we determined the relative importance of patch quality and landscape attributes on the occurrence, density and extinction of the Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti), an endangered steppe passerine whose habitat has been extremely reduced to highly isolated and fragmented patches embedded in a mainly unsuitable landscape matrix. Habitat patch quality, measured in terms of vegetation structure, grazing pressure, arthropod availability, predator abundance, and inter-specific competition, did not affect occurrence, density or extinction. At the landscape scale, however, the species' occurrence was principally determined by the interactions among patch size, geographic isolation and landscape matrix. Isolation had the main independent contribution to explaining the probability of occurrence, followed by landscape matrix composition and patch size. The species' density was negatively correlated to patch size, suggesting crowding effects in small fragments, while extinction events were exclusively related to isolation. Our findings suggest that landscape rather than local population characteristics are crucial in determining the patterns of distribution and abundance of non-equilibrium populations in highly fragmented habitat networks. Consequently, conservation measures for these species should simultaneously involve patch size, isolation and landscape matrix and apply to the entire metapopulation rather than to particular patches.

However, the cost effectiveness of the surrogate species strategy (the use of information on one or more species to identify areas of value for other species for which there is no, or more limited, available information) has seldom been evaluated. In this study, we investigate the opportunity cost of setting aside breeding sites of two forest raptor species (the surrogate species) by evaluating their individual and combined contribution to preserve diversity of polypores (wood-decaying fungi) and birds against the contributions of previously established nature reserves. We use numeric optimization models to compare different reserve selection strategies. Site selection based on nest sites of the dominant raptor species was more cost-effective than strategies using sites of the subordinate species or those processes previously used to select nature reserves in Finland. The inclusion of both raptor species in the reserve selection model further improved its performance relative to other approaches. This indicates that the means by which Finnish reserves are selected could be enhanced by including the breeding sites of these, and maybe other species, among the criteria used to select reserves in the future. These results show that information on charismatic and well-surveyed species could be a cost-efficient add-on to help enhance conservation endeavours. Where there is inter-specific competition for biodiverse sites, and using multiple species is costly, basing reserve selection primarily on breeding sites of a dominant species may be the best strategy.

Several studies have typified species of echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks as the most important herbivores and carnivores of intertidal assemblages. Unfortunately, little is known about the diet and behavior of many consumers, making difficult addressing key issues related to the importance of omni vory, intra-and inter-specific competition, or individual specialization. The goal of this paper is to fill some gaps in the available information and provide researchers with an exhaustive dietary analysis and relevant ecological descriptors for a suite of 30 consumer species distributed along the southeastern Pacific coast. Our data integrate information collected through seasonal samplings conducted between 2004 and 2007 at 4 localities distributed over 1,000 km of coast in northern Chile. Based on laboratory and field work analysis, we present: (a) a consumer-resource matrix obtained from high-resolution analyses of gut contents of 6,377 individuals, including 222 prey items (80% identified at species or genus level); (b) estimates of the density, body size (length and weight), diet width (at individual and species levels), and within-individual diversity of consumer species; (c) an nMDS ordination of the compositional similarity of consumers' diets, and information on the relative importance and occurrence frequency of the most common preys of each consumer. Based on the high frequency of omnivory and the high diet overlap among consumers, we discuss their potential for competition and the role of individual specialization in shaping their generalist character, highlighting the need to reappraise their behavior and ecological effects in the intertidal community.","[Camus, Patricio A.; Arancibia, Paulina A.; Isidora Avila-Thieme, M.] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Concepcion, Chile; [Arancibia, Paulina A.; Isidora Avila-Thieme, M.] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Programa Magister Ecol Marina, Concepcion, Chile","Camus, PA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Casilla 297, Concepcion, Chile.",pcamus@ucsc.cl,"Avila-Thieme, M.

A total of 464 fish were caught, which belonged to the exotic species Oncorhynchus mykiss (270), Salmo trutta (177) and the native species Hatcheria mazacraei (17). The analysis of 336 stomach contents indicated that at the individual level, the three species had a generalized feeding strategy based on benthic invertebrates (Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera). In the three streams, the widest population niches were observed in winter. There was, however, also a slight tendency toward an increased between-phenotype contribution to the niche width in same season, indicating that a small proportion of individuals within the fish populations specialized by predominantly feeding on a few specific prey species. Hence, the wide population niche widths observed throughout the year were partly a result of mixed individual feeding strategies within the populations. The higher diet overlaps were registered between exotics O. mykiss S. trutta at Glyn and Carbon, and O. mykiss and the native H. macraei at Manguera, but it changed markedly through the year, perhaps depending on temporal changes in food availability suggesting a competitive coexistence of these species. This is mainly related to the fact that both species changed their food preferences in spring and foraged almost exclusively on Aubertoperla illesi. This implies that in order to reduce the predation risk or the inter-specific competition for food, the fish species might partition the feeding habitats.","[Yanina Di Prinzio, Cecilia; Jorge Casaux, Ricardo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Yanina Di Prinzio, Cecilia; Jorge Casaux, Ricardo] Univ Nacl Patagonia, LIESA, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Jorge Casaux, Ricardo] Inst Antartico Argentino, RA-1010 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Di Prinzio, CY (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Av Rivadavia 1917, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",cydiprinzio@yahoo.com.ar,,"di prinzio, cecilia/0000-0002-3561-4307",CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP5733]; PADI FOUNDATION [19/2006],"This study was partially supported by CONICET (PIP5733), PADI FOUNDATION (Grant 19/2006).

In the present study, we examine the small-scale spatial pattern of a mixed beech and oak seedling-sapling bank in two areas of an unmanaged temperate deciduous forest with different environmental conditions. We used environmental, biotic and spatial variables to establish the main factors that explain the spatial pattern of these seedling-sapling banks at different scales. The stand structure in both areas was similar, but while in plot A beech dominated the canopy, plot B was dominated by oaks. In both areas, established beech individuals showed a clear reverse J-shaped distribution, whereas established oaks showed a unimodal distribution with only a few young individuals. Seedlings of beech and oak were distributed in aggregates, whereas beech saplings had a random distribution. At broader scales, the abundance of seedlings and saplings is affected by the environment as well as by inter-species competition, while at finer scales the spatial pattern is mainly influenced by stochastic processes, probably related to seed predation and establishment. The structure of the seedling-sapling bank indicates an advantage of beech over oak as far as regeneration is concerned. Beech seedlings and saplings tolerate the stress induced by the canopy and the understorey and persist for many years, while oak seedlings decline in a few years. Therefore, if current conditions persist, after canopy opening beech seedlings and saplings can grow rapidly into the canopy and the stands will move towards beech dominance.","[Gazol, Antonio; Ibanez, Ricardo] Univ Navarra, Dept Plant Biol, Pamplona 31008, Spain","Gazol, A (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Dept Plant Biol, Irunlarrea S-N, Pamplona 31008, Spain.",agazolbu@alumni.unav.es,"Ibanez, Ricardo/C-4567-2017; Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015","Ibanez, Ricardo/0000-0002-1772-4473; Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543",Fundacion Caja Navarra; Fundacion Universitaria de Navarra; Asociacion de Amigos de la Universidad de Navarra,"The authors thank Etienne Laliberte and Daniel Borcard for technical advice in the variation partitioning analysis performed.

Xenostrobus securis is an invasive mussel species that is spreading in the inner part of the Galician Rias Baixas, particularly in areas of low salinity. It co-occurs with the commercially important blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in mixed patchy aggregations on intertidal shores. We asked whether biotic interactions, i.e. competition, facilitation and predation, could explain patterns of coexistence of the 2 species in an estuarine habitat. We also examined whether the effects of such interactions were dependent upon the environmental context. We manipulated predator access to synthetic aggregations of juvenile mussels at different sites using monospecific aggregations of X. securis and M. galloprovincialis and mixed aggregations at high and low densities. Performance of the species was measured as survivorship, growth and condition index. Predation played an important role in determining abundances of both species, especially in the case of the invader, although the effects on survivorship were context dependent. We did not find evidence of intra-or inter-specific competition. Growth rates of the invader were affected by environmental variability (i.e. significant site effect). Condition index of M. galloprovincialis improved in high density aggregations (monospecific and mixed), but only towards the sea (i.e. the outermost site). Results suggest that facilitative rather than competitive interactions contribute to the abundance patterns of the 2 species, at least during the juvenile stage. The environmental context was an important driver of such patterns. We emphasise the need to address the role of positive interactions regarding marine non-indigenous species.","[Gestoso, Ignacio; Olabarria, Celia] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Arenas, Francisco] Ctr Interdisciplinar Invest Marinha & Ambiental, CIIMAR, Lab Coastal Biodivers, P-4050123 Oporto, Portugal","Gestoso, I (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain.",ignaciogestoso@uvigo.es,"Arenas, Francisco/M-7095-2015; Olabarria, Celia/R-8555-2018; Olabarria, Celia/ABB-5554-2020; Arenas, Francisco/M-6367-2013; Gestoso, Ignacio/E-8742-2015","Arenas, Francisco/0000-0001-6925-3805; Olabarria, Celia/0000-0001-8332-5924; Olabarria, Celia/0000-0001-8332-5924; Arenas, Francisco/0000-0001-6925-3805; Gestoso, Ignacio/0000-0001-5521-3255",Spanish Government through the Ministry of Science and Innovation-FEDER (CLINVA) [CGL2009-07205]; University of Vigo; FCT project CLEF [PTDC/AAC-AMB/102866/2008]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the 'Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade' (POFC-COMPETE) within the 'Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional' (QREN);  [PEst-C/MAR/LA0015/2011],"The research was supported by the Spanish Government through the Ministry of Science and Innovation-FEDER (CLINVA PROJECT CGL2009-07205).

With increasing abundance, the proportion of a particular species in the total aphid population may remain constant, suggesting a density-independent exponential growth, or the proportion can change, suggesting density-dependent constraints on growth. The constraints that affect particular species, and thus their relative abundance, were studied. The proportionality between maximum abundances of the cereal aphids was studied using a 10-year census of the numbers of aphids infesting 268 winter wheat plots. For two species their abundance on leaves and ears was compared. With increasing aphid density the maximum abundance of Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) remained proportional, but not that of Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), which was constrained by the smaller surface area of ears compared to leaves. There was no evidence of inter-specific competition. Maximum abundance of R. padi and Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) on leaves did not change proportionally as the proportion of M. dirhodum decreased with increasing overall aphid density. This decrease was probably caused by the restricted distribution of M. dirhodum, which is confined to leaves, where space is limiting. No change in proportion between populations was detected when the average densities were below 0.54 aphids per leaf or ear. Non-proportional relationships between aphid populations appeared to be due to spatial constraints, acting upon the more abundant population. Detecting the limitation of population growth can help with the assessment of when density-independent exponential growth is limited by density-dependent factors. This information may help in the development of models of cereal aphid population dynamics.","Res Inst Crop Prod, Prague 16106 6, Czech Republic; Charles Univ, Dept Zool, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Honek, A (corresponding author), Res Inst Crop Prod, Drnovska 507, Prague 16106 6, Czech Republic.",honek@vurv.cz,,,,,,41,13,13,1,19,CABI PUBLISHING,WALLINGFORD,"C/O PUBLISHING DIVISION, NOSWORTHY WAY, WALLINGFORD OX10 8DE, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4853,,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

However, studies from different areas suggest their diet consists mostly of four to five types of prey. Previous studies in Galapagos sea lions have identified at least three feeding strategies for this species, suggesting diversification of their diet. Diet diversification is favored in organisms with relatively high trophic position and subject to high intra-specific and low inter-specific competition. Zalophus wollebaeki meet these criteria as the only pinniped on San Cristobal Island, where three sea lion rookeries are located within 11 km: a distance considerably shorter than their 41 km foraging range. To measure the degree of diet diversification, we used scats and stable isotope analyses. A total of 270 scat samples from lactating females and 142 fur samples from sea lion pups were collected during the breeding season 2006. The scat analysis identified distinct diets among rookeries, with minimal trophic overlap (C lambda = 0.19), a trophic level TL = 4.5 (secondary-tertiary carnivore), and trophic breadth of a specialist predator (B (i) = 0.37). The mean delta N-15 and delta C-13 values were 13.07 +/- A 0.52 and -16.34 +/- A 0.37, respectively. No significant difference was found in the delta N-15 values from the sea lion rookeries, but differences were found inter- and intra-population in delta C-13 values for pups from different groups (ANOVA P < 0.05). Our results indicate that diet diversification is present in the Galapagos sea lion and may play important role to the survival of the species in a habitat where pinniped populations are limited.","[Paez-Rosas, Diego; Aurioles-Gamboa, David] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Lab Ecol Pinnipedos Burney J Le Boeuf, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico","Paez-Rosas, D (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Lab Ecol Pinnipedos Burney J Le Boeuf, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl S-N, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico.",dpaezr@ipn.mx,"Paez-Rosas, Diego/X-3047-2019","Paez-Rosas, Diego/0000-0002-2446-9888",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [SEP-2004-C01-46806]; Servicio de Relaciones Exteriores de Mexico (SRE); CICIMAR of the Instituto Politecnico Nacional,"We thank the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT), Servicio de Relaciones Exteriores de Mexico (SRE), and CICIMAR of the Instituto Politecnico Nacional for their support in the form of scholarships and laboratory services.

In this study, stable isotope analyses were used to infer trophic ecology of a guild of large predatory fishes that are targeted by fisheries on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Each of four focal predators (Plectropomus leopardus, Plectropomus maculatus, Lethrinus miniatus and Lutjanus carponotatus) was found to have a distinct isotopic signature in terms of delta C-13 and delta N-15. A two-source mixing model (benthic reef-based versus pelagic) indicated that P. leopardus and L. miniatus derive the majority (72 and 62 %, respectively) of their production from planktonic sources, while P. maculatus and L. carponotatus derive the majority (89 and 74 %, respectively) of their production from benthic reef-based sources. This indicates that planktonic production is important for sustaining key species in reef fisheries and highlights the need for a whole-ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Unexpectedly, there was little isotopic niche overlap between three of four focal predators, suggesting that inter-specific competition for prey may be low or absent. delta(15)Nitrogen indicated that the closely related P. leopardus and P. maculatus are apex predators (trophic level > 4), while delta C-13 indicated that each species has a different diet and degree of trophic specialisation. In view of these divergent trophic ecologies, each of the four focal predators (and the associated fisheries) are anticipated to be differentially affected by climate-induced disturbances. Thus, the results presented herein provide a useful starting point for precautionary management of exploited predator populations in a changing climate.","[Frisch, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Ireland, Matthew; Baker, Ronald] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Baker, Ronald] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Land & Water, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Frisch, AJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",ashley.frisch@jcu.edu.au,"Baker, Ronald/J-9060-2014","Baker, Ronald/0000-0001-8408-0324",Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council,"The authors are grateful to K.

A camera trap method was used for a better understanding of the breeding behaviour of the griffon vulture, including the intra-and inter-species relations. A statistically significant difference was found between the independent feeding events during the pre-incubation and incubation periods of vultures. The duration of those events also differs, the ones in the second period being longer. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was observed between the number of vultures per photo for the two sample periods, as a result of a different number of unmarked wild birds and different activity patterns of the nesting pairs. In spite of the fact that the terrestrial predators are also active during the night, their daytime presence leads to a high enough overlap between the two ecological groups, showing that the carnivores are a disturbance factor for the scavengers. The raven is the most abundant species at the feeding site and thus is a food competitor to the griffon vulture. The two species have adapted their behaviour to use the feeding station more successfully during the different biological periods. A significant decrease in the activity overlap between the individuals of the successfully nesting pairs was observed on the feeding station after the beginning of the incubation period. On the other hand, the activity overlap of the unsuccessfully nesting pairs increased in the second sample period. Camera traps can be used in further studies of the mating ecology for individual breeding pairs, when a direct observation on the nest is hard or impossible. This can be a cheap alternative of the time-consuming field observations.","[Nenov, Dimitar I.; Zlatanova, Diana P.; Grozdanov, Atanas P.] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Stoynov, Emilian H.; Peshev, Hristo V.] Fund Wild Flora & Fauna, Sofia, Bulgaria","Nenov, DI (corresponding author), Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Sofia, Bulgaria.",dinenov@uni-sofia.bg; pirin@fwff.org,"Zlatanova, Diana/A-2434-2013; Stoynov, Emilian/AAP-8999-2020; Grozdanov, Atanas/AAE-9119-2019; Peshev, Hristo/AAF-4320-2021","Zlatanova, Diana/0000-0002-4115-2786; Peshev, Hristo/0000-0001-8925-053X",Fund for Wild Flora and Fauna team,The authors express their sincere gratitude to the Fund for Wild Flora and Fauna team for their hard work on the griffon vulture reintroduction project in Kresna Gorge.

Moreover, sandy beaches are characterized by low in-situ productivity, so their food webs rely heavily on marine inputs. Studies have shown that estuarine organic matter plays a key role in influencing the dynamics of marine ecosystems. However, very few studies have tested the role of estuarine input on sandy beaches. Here, we aim to determine the impact of estuarine input on the food web of a sandy beach macrobenthic community. To this end, particulate organic matter (POM) samples from the marine environment and the estuary, as well as macrobenthic samples from the beach, were analysed for their stable isotope (SI) signature. Our results indicated that the POM SI signatures were not different along the beach, but differences were recorded between marine and estuarine sources. Bayesian mixing models indicated that the organisms did not make use of the estuarine POM at the beginning of the wet season, but relied more heavily on this resource towards the end of the wet season. This leads to the conclusion that changes in estuarine flow throughout the wet season can impact the trophic structure of macrobenthos communities, confirming a link between lotic and marine communities. Moreover, SI signatures suggest that the species collected here exhibit overlapping trophic niches, indicating high level of inter-specific competition. This highlights that species in low-productivity areas, such as the one studied here, can experience high levels of competition even in physically controlled environments such as sandy beaches.

The long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum was particularly effective at controlling macroalgae and facilitating coral dominance on Caribbean reefs until its ecological extinction from a catastrophic disease epidemic in the early 1980s. Despite their important role in the structure and functioning of Caribbean reef ecosystems, the natural dynamics of Caribbean reef urchin communities are poorly known due to the paucity of ecological survey data prior to large-scale human disturbances and the Diadema dieoff. To help resolve the baseline abundances and ecological roles of common urchin taxa, we track changes in urchin abundance and composition over the past 3000 yr from analysis of subfossil urchin spines preserved in reef matrix cores collected in Caribbean Panama. Echinometra consistently dominated the subfossil spine assemblage, while Diadema was consistently rare in the subfossil record in this region. Rather than increasing during a period of heightened human exploitation of their fish competitors and predators, Diadema began declining over a millennium ago. Convergent cross mapping (CCM) causality analyses reveal that Diadema abundance is causally related to coral community composition. Diadema is negatively affected by Acropora cervicornis dominance, likely due to the tight association between this coral and the threespot damselfish, an effective Diadema competitor. Conversely, Diadema positively affects the abundance of the coral Madracis mirabilis, possibly via its control of macroalgae. Causal relationships were not detected among abundances of individual urchin taxa, indicating that inter-specific echinoid competition is not a factor limiting Diadema recovery. Our detailed record of prehistorical and historical urchin community dynamics suggests that the failure of Diadema to recover over 30 yr after its mass mortality event may be due in part to the prey release of damselfish following the long-term overfishing of piscivorous fishes.","[Cramer, Katie L.; O'Dea, Aaron] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Cramer, Katie L.; Carpenter, Carolina; Norris, Richard D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA USA","Cramer, KL (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama.; Cramer, KL (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA USA.",katie.cramer@gmail.com,,"O'Dea, Aaron/0000-0001-5495-4764; Cramer, Katie/0000-0001-8760-180X",Smithsonian Inst.Smithsonian Institution; MarineGEO Postdoctoral Fellowship; UC San Diego Frontiers of Innovation Scholars Program Postdoctoral Fellowship,"KLC was supported by Smithsonian Inst.

We investigated interspecific competition between the Endangered tiger and two sympatric carnivore species (Near-Threatened leopard and Endangered dhole) in Malaysia. We used a spatially-explicit camera trapping method to sample the three carnivore species in order to assess their: relative abundance; spatial co-occurrence; and, temporal overlap. Our focal landscape consists of two adjacent study areas that have different forest management regimes: 1) Royal Belum State Park (RBSP) which has relatively higher levels of enforcement resulting in high tiger and prey densities, and 2) Temengor Forest Reserve (TFR) which has no enforcement resulting in low tiger and prey densities. Our analyses found inter specific competition in the form of fine-scale spatial avoidance of tiger by leopard in RBSP, but not in TFR. Thus, leopard was less likely to occur in forest patches with greater tiger presence in RBSP. Dhole was not detected in RBSP, and showed no fine-scale spatial avoidance of tiger on TRF. It was unclear if absence of dhole in RBSP was due to the high tiger density, or another factor such as disease. Regardless, our results indicate dhole can persist in human-degraded forest landscapes. Neither leopards nor dholes showed any major temporal avoidance of tigers on either site. Our findings of fine-scale spatial avoidance by leopard towards tiger and possible exclusion of dhole by tiger in areas of high tiger density were similar to that found in other areas of Asia. Our study demonstrates that degraded forest can be important for threatened carnivores. It also provides a reminder that efforts to recover tiger populations, a conservation priority, may require flanking measures to secure meso-predator populations, especially those forced into edge environments where they come into greater contact with people.

We show that even predators with a broad diet may actively avoid alien prey and selectively feed on native species, despite alien prey being more abundant and easier to consume. This lack of predation pressure combined with the removal of competing native prey offers 2 sources of facilitation of prey invasions.Biotic invasions can result in the displacement of native species. This can alter the availability of native prey and the choices made by native predators. We investigated prey selection by 2 native South African predators, the west coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii and the starfish Marthasterias africana in response to the invasive mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Semimytilus algosus, and native mussels, Aulacomya atra and Choromytilus meridionalis. As the diets of lobsters and starfish are broad and have been suggested to reflect prey availability, we hypothesized that they would consume the most abundant prey, regardless of its native or alien status. Laboratory studies presented predators with varying proportions of native and invasive mussels that represented pre- and post-invasion scenarios. Mussel parameters (shell strength, adductor muscle size, and energy content) that may be of importance in selection by predators were compared among species. Both predators exhibited preference towards the native mussel C. meridionalis, even when it was the least abundant prey. The selection of native species occurred despite mussel parameters suggesting that invasive species would be easier to consume. These findings highlight the potential for facilitation of prey invasions, especially when predators avoid alien prey and select for native comparators that may offer resistance to the invasion through inter-specific competition. It is presently unclear how often such a lack of predator-driven biotic resistance acts in combination with indirect facilitation, but interrogating the behaviors that drive such outcomes will advance our understanding of successful invasions.","[Skein, Lisa; Robinson, Tamara B.] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1,Nat Sci Bldg,Merriman Ave, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Matieland, South Africa; [Alexander, Mhairi E.] Univ West Scotland, Sch Sci & Sport, IBEHR, High St, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland","Robinson, TB (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1,Nat Sci Bldg,Merriman Ave, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Matieland, South Africa.",trobins@sun.ac.za,"Robinson, Tamara B/I-1806-2019","Robinson, Tamara B/0000-0001-5515-1445; Skein, Lisa/0000-0003-2273-3048",DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion BiologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India),This work was supported by the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology.; Andrea Plos and Clova Mabin are gratefully acknowledged for collecting lobsters and starfish in the field.

Local ecological factors are likely to act simultaneously at smaller spatial scales, but have hardly been contrasted with wide-ranging predictors. We tested here whether the morphological variation of Dupont's Larks (Chersophilus duponti) responded to ecological parameters at two different spatial scales. First, we investigated the effects of geographic and climatic gradients over its breeding range. Second, we focussed at a smaller spatial scale on a fragmented population and tested additionally several fine-grained ecological factors related to key components in the species' habitat. Contrary to Bergmann's rule, wing length and cranium size decreased with rainfall and increased with aridity and maximum temperature at the large scale, so birds tend to be larger at lower latitudes. At the same time, wing and tarsus length increased at high elevations where minimum temperatures are lower, providing some support to Bergmann's rule. At the small spatial scale we failed to detect any relationship between body size and positional or climatic variables, nor did food availability, intra- and inter-specific competition and predation pressure produce any significant effect on morphology. Nevertheless, cranium size and wing length differed between habitats as measured by soil and vegetation types, and wing length decreased with patch size. This later result could be explained in the context of strong habitat fragmentation if larger individuals have a higher propensity of dispersing or a higher probability of surviving dispersal events. Our study indicates that several geographic and environmental sources may occur simultaneously at different spatial scales. Further, even at the same scale, intraspecific morphological variation may show contrasting patterns for climatic, latitudinal, and elevational gradients that make their interpretation difficult in the context of ecogeographical rules. The effects elicited by aridity, habitat loss, and fragmentation on body size should be considered in future studies of global change, as they may have serious consequences for the distribution, abundance, and ultimately the persistence of birds in arid environments.","[Vogeli, Matthias] Fed Off Environm, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland; [Serrano, David; Mendez, Maria; Tella, Jose L.] CSIC, EBD, Dept Conservat Biol, C Avda Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain","Serrano, D (corresponding author), CSIC, EBD, Dept Conservat Biol, C Avda Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",serrano@ebd.csic.es,"Serrano, David/B-5352-2013; Vogeli, Matthias/M-4269-2019; Vogeli, Matthias/G-1815-2010","Serrano, David/0000-0001-6205-386X; Vogeli, Matthias/0000-0002-3408-0972; Vogeli, Matthias/0000-0002-3408-0972",Spanish Research Council (CSIC); Telefonica Moviles S.A.; Swiss Academy of Natural Sciences SCNAT+,"We are indebted to numerous people helping during fieldwork, especially P.

However, the acoustic signals are often eavesdropped on by other species. If a species with higher competitive ability eavesdrops on the acoustic signals of a species with lower competitive ability, the former can deprive the latter of their suitable calling sites. Therefore, the species with higher competitive ability exhibits a positive response to the acoustic signals of those with lower competitive abilities, whereas the species with lower competitive ability exhibits a negative response to the calling songs of those with higher competitive abilities. In the present study, male responses to conspecific and heterospecific song in two field cricket species Teleogryllus occipitalis (Audinet-Serville 1839) (Gryllidae) and Loxoblemmus equestris Saussure 1877 (Gryllidae) were investigated by playback experiments. T. occipitalis has larger body size than L. equestris. Both species did not exhibit precise negative or positive responses to conspecific and heterospecific songs.

Thus, spatial and trophic competition can emerge, especially between related seabird species belonging to the same ecological guild. Here we studied the foraging ecology of two sympatric species-brown booby (BRBO) Sula leucogaster (breeding) and red-footed boobies (RFBO) Sula sula (non-breeding)-at Raso islet (Cabo Verde), across different seasons. Sexual segregation was only observed during Jun-Oct, when RFBO were present, with larger females BRBO remaining closer to the colonies, while males and RFBO travelled further and exploited different habitats. Overall, species appeared to prefer areas with specific oceanic features, particularly those related with oceanic currents and responsible for enhancing primary productivity in tropical oceanic areas (e.g. Sea Surface Height and Ocean Mixed Layer Thickness). Female BRBOs showed high foraging-site fidelity during the period of sympatry, while exploiting the same prey species as the other birds. However, during the months of co-existence (Jun.-Oct.), isotopic mixing models suggested that female BRBO would consume a higher proportion of epipelagic fish, whereas female RFBO would consume more squid compared to the other birds, possibly due to habitat-specific prey availability and breeding energy-constraints for BRBO. We conclude that divergent parental roles, environmental conditions, habitat preference and competition could be mechanisms simultaneously underlying sexual segregation for BRBO during a period of co-existence, while inter-specific foraging differences appear to be more affected by habitat preference and different breeding stages. These results support previous statements that BRBO can adapt their foraging ecology to different circumstances of environmental conditions and competition, and that marine physical features play an important role in foraging decisions of boobies.","[Almeida, Nathalie; Ramos, Jaime A.; dos Santos, Ivo; Pereira, Jorge M.; Matos, Diana M.; Araujo, Pedro M.; Paiva, Vitor H.] Univ Coimbra, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Life Sci, Coimbra, Portugal; [Almeida, Nathalie; Rodrigues, Isabel; Melo, Tommy] Biosfera Cabo Verde, Sao Vicente, Cape Verde; [Araujo, Pedro M.] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agrario Vairao, Vairao, Portugal; [Geraldes, Pedro] SPEASoc Portuguesa Estudo Aves, Lisbon, Portugal","Almeida, N (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Life Sci, Coimbra, Portugal.",mellonaty@hotmail.com,"Pereira, Jorge Miguel/I-5814-2016; Ramos, Jaime/B-6616-2018","Pereira, Jorge Miguel/0000-0002-7594-3535; Paiva, Vitor/0000-0001-6368-9579; Ramos, Jaime/0000-0002-9533-987X",project Alcyon -Conservation of seabirds from Cabo Verde; BirdLife International; MAVA foundation [MAVA17022]; strategic program of MARE - FCT [UID/MAR/04292/2020],"This work received financial and logistic support (for fieldwork campaigns, GPS tracking devices and laboratory analysis) from the project Alcyon -Conservation of seabirds from Cabo Verde, coordinated by BirdLife International and funded by the MAVA foundation (MAVA17022; http://en.mava-foundation.org), through its strategic plan for West Africa (2017-2022).

Salvelinus alpinus, however, inhabit environmental extremes ranging from lakes and rivers in the High Arctic to deep multi-fish species lakes far outside the polar region. Long-term responses to post-glacial environmental variations and successively increased interspecific interactions reveal an essential degree of natural ecological resilience and phenotypic flexibility. Case studies in Scandinavia and Newfoundland illustrate the alternate trophic roles of S. alpinus, and its flexible niche use and life-history changes in order to regain or maintain body size in gradients of lakes with increasing fish species diversity. While allopatric in northern low-productive upland lakes, landlocked populations are commonly structured by cannibalism. In sympatry with other fish species, S. alpinus mostly serve as prey, with their decreasing growth and body size reflecting the successive diet shift from littoral macro-benthos to zooplankton and profundal microbenthos as interspecific competition for food and habitat intensifies. Interactions with natural and introduced superior zooplankton feeders and ultimate predators finally become detrimental. Consequently, the niche of S. alpinus is increasingly compressed in lakes along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, although certain natural key conditions offer S. alpinus temporary asylum in the inescapable process towards local and regional extinction. The water temperature drop during winter allows S. alpinus to temporarily resume the richer littoral dietary and spatial niche use in low diversity lakes. In southern lowland and coastal lakes with more complex fish communities, access to key prey species such as profundal macro-crustaceans and smelt Osmerus spp. allow S. alpinus to regain its original niche space and characteristics as a large piscivore. In conclusion, S. alpinus along its evolutionary landscape demonstrates associated alterations of life-history characteristics, such as body size and longevity, and thus reproductive traits demonstrating similarities between northern cannibals and southern piscivores. Although including a high degree of natural resilience, obviously differing among S. alpinus populations along its range, differences seen in extreme marginal populations may have been adaptive and the product of an evolutionary response with optimized growth resulting from natural selection due to ultimate intra or inter-specific competition and predation.

Even though Scandinavian forest ecosystems are strongly influenced by small mammals' dynamics, the effects of anthropogenic changes on these communities are still debated. We conducted an extensive capture-mark-recapture study to examine the relative abundance and distribution of 11 species of small mammals during the reproductive season with respect to all available landscape-scale habitat types and fine-scale vegetation characteristics. At the landscape scale, the highest abundance and diversity of small mammals was recorded in abandoned meadows. The community was dominated by Myodes glareolus in old abandoned meadows sparsely colonized by trees and bushes, and by Micron's agrestis in younger grass-dominated meadows, likely reflecting inter-specific competition and niche separation. Notwithstanding the remarkably low availability of both types of meadows, these habitats sustained by far the highest abundance of small mammals. Intensively managed forest monocultures at logging age and cultivated fields sustained the lowest abundance of small mammals. However, while the former also supported the lowest species diversity, the latter unexpectedly sustained the highest number of species. Only Apodemus sylvaticus attained highest densities in cultivated fields, but its marked association with forest edges clearly indicates its need for landscape-scale complexity. Contrary to previous theories, clear-cuts and forests overall did not support the highest abundance of M. agrestis and M. glareolus. Both young and mature forests failed to explain a significant amount of variation in community structure when taking into account other habitat types. However, a few old clear-cuts characterized by higher vegetational complexity, and a few stands preserving characteristics typical of late successional stages (moss, berries, woody debris) were able to support relatively high abundance of small mammals. Our study shows that sampling in all available habitats at different spatial scales is essential for a comprehensive understanding of community dynamics in forest-farmland ecosystems, as even habitat types that are under-represented at the landscape scale might play a significant role for the community dynamics. Forest-farmland mosaic landscapes with a high degree of heterogeneity at both large spatial scale (e.g. meadows, shelterbelts) and at fine-scales (e.g. varied and multi-layered ground cover) allow for the conservation of small mammal diversity and abundance in human-dominated areas. Nonetheless, the low number of Myodes rujocanus trapped in this highly fragmented mosaic landscape supports the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation negatively affects the dynamic of this forest specialist.

The most abundant lizard and web-spider species (Anolis sagrei and Merepeira datona, respectively), were manipulated within field enclosures over a 30-mo period. The design was a 2 x 2 factorial: A. sagrei present and removed, crossed with M. datona present and removed. A. sagrei reduced abundance of Eustala cazieri, the second most abundant web spider, and tended to reduce abundance of all rare spider species combined. M. datona had no significant effect on abundance of E. cazieri or of all rare species combined. In each statistical analysis of abundance, the A. sagrei x M. datona interaction term was not significant, indicating that lizards did not intensify (or reduce) interactions among spider species. Furthermore. data on spider food supply, body length, and web height showed no evidence for two proposed mechanisms in which interactions among spider species are stronger with lizards than without. Thus, this experiment supports the hypothesis that direct predation is the major mechanism by which lizards reduce the abundance and species richness of spiders.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Spiller, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",daspiller@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,47,16,19,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2001,82,6,,,,,1560,1570,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1560:AETFPM]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,446PG,WOS:000169521200005,,,,,2021-09-24,

Facilitation is recorded from diverse plant-insect interactions, including pollination and herbivory. 2. The significance of facilitation resulting from the behavior of males of multiple fig wasp species inside figs was investigated. Female fig wasps emerge from natal figs via exit holes dug by males, especially male pollinators. When no males are present, the females struggle to escape and may die. 3. Ficus microcarpa L. is a widely-established invasive fig tree from Southeast Asia. Its pollinator is absent in South Africa, so the tree cannot reproduce, but two Asian non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW) Walkerella microcarpae and Odontofroggatia galili occupy its figs. Abundance patterns of the two NPFW and the proportion of male-free figs in South Africa, Spain (where the pollinator is introduced), and in China, where the native fig wasp community is diverse, were compared to determine the consequences of reduced species richness for insect survival. 4. Female fig wasps in male-free figs were found to be trapped, and small clutch sizes contributed to the absence of males in both species. The presence of pollinators in Spain allowed most NPFW to develop in figs containing males. Far more male-free figs were present in South Africa, elevating mortality rates among female NPFW. Facilitation of female release by males of other NPFW species nonetheless benefitted the rarer species. 5. Selection pressures in South Africa currently favour greater aggregation of NPFW offspring and/or less female biased sex ratios.","[Wang, Rong; Harper, Maximilian; Quinnell, Rupert J.; Compton, Stephen G.] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wang, Rong] E China Normal Univ, Tiantong Natl Stn Forest Ecosyst, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Segar, Simon T.] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Yu, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Compton, Stephen G.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","Compton, SG (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.g.a.compton@leeds.ac.uk,"Segar, Simon/K-6783-2015; Barwell, Louise J J/F-3309-2019","Barwell, Louise J J/0000-0002-1643-1046; Wang, Rong/0000-0003-4652-2149",China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council; project Postdoc USB through EU Education for Competitiveness Operational Programme [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0006]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Czech State Budget,"We thank Dr Simon van Noort for helpful advice on fig wasps in South Africa.

A stream simulator was used to test the effects of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) (fork length range 66-115 mm) on habitat use of inanga (Galaxias maculatus) (fork length range 51-100 mm) during autumn. The stream simulator consisted of a single run-riffle-pool sequence lined with gravel and cobble substrates, and c. 8 m(3) of untreated artesian water was recirculated through the stream simulator at a rate of 3 litres s(-1). Stream invertebrates were introduced into the stream simulator to provide food for the fish. Four experiments were run, each consisting of three 1-day trials using either 10 inanga, 20 inanga, or 10 inanga and brown trout. Counts of inanga visible in each of 12 designated habitat zones were made throughout the day, and proportions of visible inanga were used in repeated measure ANOVAs to test whether the proportion of fish visible varied according to the time of day, the density of inanga, or the presence of trout. Our experiments showed that neither the presence of juvenile brown trout nor the density of inanga had significant influence on inanga habitat use in the stream simulator. We conclude that in New Zealand streams any influence of brown trout on inanga is more likely to result from predation and/or competition for food by larger brown trout.","Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand; Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 1, New Zealand","Bonnett, ML (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, POB 8602, Christchurch, New Zealand.",m.bonnett@niwa.co.nz,"McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011","McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813",,,,32,10,10,1,13,SIR PUBLISHING,WELLINGTON,"PO BOX 399, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND",0303-6758,,,J ROY SOC NEW ZEAL,J.

In Lake Vattern, relict Arctic char, fourhorn sculpin, smelt and seven species of crustaceans form a deep-water food-web, and interact closely as competitors, predators and prey. Here, we analyzed new and archived data back to the late 1960s in order to understand and relate observed life-history shifts in the smelt population, to concurrent adverse life-history changes observed in the endangered Arctic char population. Smelt growth was sigmoidal and the size frequency distribution dominated by fish up to 110 mm and age 0-4, although smelt occasionally reached 250 mm. Smelt diet shifts as the fish grow, from zooplankton, to Mysis relicta, to piscivory for individuals larger than 150 mm. Recruitment commonly demonstrates regular inter-annual pulses of YOY abundance although strong year classes produced during years with higher spring temperature cause post-annual irregularity of year class strength. Young smelt reside in surface water and older fish in deeper water. This ontogenetic shift in distribution depends on temperature occupied, prey availability and risk of inter- and intra-specific predation. Interestingly, even though very small Arctic char feed on smelt, most small Arctic char are found in deep water together with large smelt, and most large Arctic char are found in shallow water with small smelt.

Large carnivores can have a key role in the maintenance of biodiversity through direct and indirect effects at lower trophic levels, which are the result of predation and competition. In this sense, it is expected that changes in abundance of large predators driven by humans will affect the abundance of smaller carnivores. We explore the effects of varying degree of human intervention on the structure of a felid community of five sympatric species in Ecuador's Amazon region. We used camera traps to survey carnivore populations in seven different areas between 2007 and 2016 and estimated density with spatial explicit capture-recapture models. The density of margays, jaguarundis, ocelots and jaguars showed a positive relationship with the conservation status of study sites, while no significant relationship was observed for pumas. We found that the anthropogenic impacts had asymmetric effects on the density of the different taxa. Jaguar and margays, the species with more stringent ecological requirements, presented higher reductions on density. Our findings support of the mesopredator release hypothesis in this tropical ecosystem. Maximum densities of pumas were detected in areas of low jaguar density, while there was a negative relationship between density of pumas and margays, jaguarundis, and ocelots. Our results show how human disturbance can have important ecological effects on the carnivore community. As felids are top predators, we can predict that changes in this trophic level can lead to changes in ecosystem function and structure. Therefore, conservation efforts should be addressed to maintain the structure of these communities.","[Maria Gil-Sanchez, Jose; Salvador, Julia; Espinosa, Santiago] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Ave 12 Octubre 1076, Quito, Ecuador; [Maria Gil-Sanchez, Jose] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain; [Jimenez, Jose] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo 0, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [Salvador, Julia] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Mariana Jesus E7-248 & Pradera, Quito, Ecuador; [Sanchez-Cerda, Mariola] Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, Conservat & EvolutionaryGeneticsGrp, Avda Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Espinosa, Santiago] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Fac Ciencias, Av Chapultepec 1570, San Luis Potosi 78295, San Luis Potosi, Mexico","Gil-Sanchez, JM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Ave 12 Octubre 1076, Quito, Ecuador.; Gil-Sanchez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain.",jmgilsanchez@yahoo.es,"Jimenez, Jose/I-9840-2019; Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/AAW-1016-2021","Jimenez, Jose/0000-0003-0607-6973; Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/0000-0002-7052-8332",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador,"This research was part of the project: Conflictos entre gente y grandes carnivoros: evaluacion de posibles soluciones en la Amazonia del Ecuador supported by Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador.

We evaluated competition for spatial and trophic niches between otter and mink in overlapping and non-overlapping areas, comparing distribution, habitat preference, diet and mink marking behavior. We surveyed otter and mink signs along 250 km of Beagle Channel coastline. Habitat suitability models were constructed based on species presence/absence and habitat characteristics, using generalized linear models. Feces were collected for diet analyses. Otters used forested coasts with 12A degrees-32A degrees shoreline slope and without human influence, and our evidence suggests they were not affected by mink presence. Mink preferred forested and shrubland coasts with 10A degrees-28A degrees shoreline slope. Neither human influence nor otter presence affected mink habitat occupation, but in the presence of otters, mink left fewer signs. Otters consumed more aquatic prey than mink, and mink modified their diet in the presence of otters, consuming more exotic small terrestrial mammals and less fish as well as shifting to smaller and shallower fish species that are less consumed by otters. Mink showed more plastic, generalist behavior than otters, being more tolerant of human presence, using more habitat types and having greater diet breadth. At the same time, otters apparently affect mink adversely and could help limit their invasion in sympatric areas. Conservation and recovery of otters, therefore, may produce a secondary benefit of simultaneously reducing the effect of mink, thereby providing an additional way to control this exotic predator's population.","[Valenzuela, Alejandro E.

The local communities of ladybirds were characterized in terms of biodiversity, the average difference in body mass between H. axyridis and other coccinellid species and the rarefied total body mass of all individuals (as a surrogate for aphid abundance and availability). The lack of success of H. axyridis in the Azores, as well as its low success in Southern Europe, can be explained by a combination of resource availability and intraguild competition. We suggest the success of this invasive alien species to establish in a habitat depends first on resource availability and second when most direct competitors for limited resources are absent or are uncommon.","[Soares, Antonio Onofre; Cardoso, Pedro; Borges, Isabel] Univ Azores, CE3c ABG Ctr Ecol Evolut Environm Changes, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal; [Soares, Antonio Onofre; Cardoso, Pedro; Borges, Isabel] Univ Azores, Dept Biol, Azorean Biodivers Grp, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal; [Honek, Alois; Martinkova, Zdenka; Skuhrovec, Jiri] Crop Res Inst, Drnovska 507, Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Cardoso, Pedro] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Pohjoinen Rautatiekatu 13,POB 17, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Soares, AO (corresponding author), Univ Azores, CE3c ABG Ctr Ecol Evolut Environm Changes, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal.; Soares, AO (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Dept Biol, Azorean Biodivers Grp, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal.",antonio.oc.soares@uac.pt,"Skuhrovec, Jiri/E-9699-2016; Cardoso, Pedro/A-8820-2008; Borges, Isabel/AAF-6509-2019; Soares, Antonio Onofre/M-4207-2013","Skuhrovec, Jiri/0000-0002-7691-5990; Cardoso, Pedro/0000-0001-8119-9960; Soares, Antonio Onofre/0000-0001-7922-6296","Portuguese National Funds, through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/BIA/00329/ 2013, M1.1.a/009/Funcionamento-C-/2016]; Fundo Regional da Ciencia, Regional Government of the Azores [M3.1.7/F/012/2011]; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-26561S]; Ministry of Education Youth and SportsMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LD14084]; Ministry of AgricultureGida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi [RO0416]","This study was financed by Portuguese National Funds, through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, within the projects UID/BIA/00329/ 2013 and M1.1.a/009/Funcionamento-C-/2016 (GBA).

The associated increase in browsing pressure and trampling often resulted in significant vegetation changes and associated conservation problems in other taxa. In this study we investigated the effects of increased deer browsing (0.4-1.5 deer/ha) on a temperate woodland ecosystem by comparing small mammal communities and vegetation characteristics in 4 deer-free exclosures with adjacent woodland transects subjected to deer grazing. Jolly-Seber analyses of Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) results revealed that the significant reduction of bushes and shrubs in deer-grazed woodland was associated with significantly lower rodent densities than in deer-free exclosures at all times. However, whereas bankvoles (Myodes glareolus) outnumbered woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in exclosures by 4:1, on average there were 1.6 times as many woodmice in the open woodland than bankvoles. Population structure did not differ between animals caught in exclosures vs. open woodland in terms of body weight, reproductive status, age structure nor sex ratio in either species. Our results highlight the need of bankvoles for denser understorey as protection from predators, compared with the woodmouse's greater agility and resulting ability to escape predators in open woodland as well as the ability to exploit arboreal habitats. The study emphasises the necessity for effective and informed deer management in order to conserve forest ecosystems.","[Buesching, C. D.; Newman, C.; Jones, J. T.; Macdonald, D.

Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina are major consumers of biomass in the eastern region of the Southern Ocean and have been declining in numbers since the 1960s. Previous studies have identified evidence for habitat and diet partitioning over a range of spatial and temporal scales between juveniles and adults in the Macquarie Island population. We first analysed the stable isotopes (SI) of 6 entire vibrissae from a dead adult female southern elephant seal from Kerguelen Islands to determine moult and growth patterns. Secondly we analysed the SI from the vibrissae of 102 juvenile southern elephant seals to investigate diet. The results from the growth pattern analysis indicated that vibrissae do not grow or moult simultaneously. However, it is likely that at least part of the vibrissae will have been produced sometime during the most recent trip to sea and will give a broad indication of diet. The subsequent SI analysis confirmed that juveniles are consuming greater proportions of fish species, and identified myctophids as the primary component of juvenile diet. Myctophids are also consumed by king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus which have greatly increased in numbers recently in the Macquarie Island area. This may have presented the juvenile southern elephant seals with increased competition and may influence survival.","[Newland, China; Field, Iain C.; McMahon, Clive R.; Hindell, Mark A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Antarctic Wildlife Res Unit, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Field, Iain C.] Macquarie Univ, Grad Sch Environm, Marine Mammal Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Cherel, Yves; Guinet, Christophe] CNRS, UPR 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Bradshaw, Corey J.

However, the short-term benefits of priority access to resources have not always translated into long-term benefits in terms of growth and survival. In the present study, we test whether dominant Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that were able to monopolize a food source in laboratory conditions had a growth advantage over subordinates in their natural stream. There was no relationship between initial size and rank, and high-ranking individuals showed no growth advantage over subordinates over a 2-month period when returned to the wild. A fish's growth rate in the wild was also unrelated to its sex or initial size, or the density of other salmon of the same age class within each experimental site. There was, however, spatial variability in growth, with salmon in one site gaining twice as much weight as did fish from the other sites. This suggests that at most of the sites, resources were limited in availability and that the absence of a relationship between growth and dominance rank was not owing simply to an excess of food being available. The lack of a positive correlation between social status and growth in the wild may be explained by several mechanisms, including the spatio-temporal variability in resources, interspecific interactions, fluctuations in habitat, or the presence of predators.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Fish Biol Grp, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Fisheries Res Serv Freshwater Lab, Pitlochry PH16 5LB, Perthshire, Scotland; Cardiff Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, S Glam, Wales","Harwood, AJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, W Vancouver Lab, 4160 Marine Dr, W Vancouver, BC V7V 1N6, Canada.",andrewh@interchange.ubc.ca,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Griffiths, Sian/A-5240-2010; Brennan, Shea/A-9877-2010; Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009","Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349; Armstrong, John/0000-0003-2015-0500; Griffiths, Sian/0000-0001-6348-7352",,,,47,56,57,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Laboratory experiments revealed that in general both parasitoids could not reliably differentiate between unparasitized and previously parasitized eggs whatever quality or combination was provided. This situation was beneficial for T. cacoeciae, as all eggs successfully parasitized by both parasitoids developed solely into T. cacoeciae adults. Nonetheless, the latter's parasitism rate was much lower in the case of simultaneous presence of a A. quadridentata female than alone showing A. quadridentata capability to defend its own offspring.

It is believed that this problem results at least in part from difficulties of effectively integrating factors that act across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Here, as an aid to developing more robust modelling and sampling methodologies, a simple process-based model for local-scale dynamics of Atlantic salmon juveniles is developed from first principles by integrating contemporary understanding of self-thinning, density-dependent growth and dispersal. The aim is to present a readily understood structure to illustrate the links between spawning and stocking strategies, habitat, migration and fish production. Based on this structure, contemporary understanding of the more complex biological processes that affect density, growth and habitat are discussed in relation to some of the key requirements of managers, including stocking for rehabilitation, assessment of predation impact and development of strategies for sampling populations effectively when deriving habitat-production models. A major conclusion is that more structured, integrated research is required to provide the basic variables needed to model links between local and global scale habitat and fish production effectively. Nevertheless, application of the current understanding of the biology of Atlantic salmon should be of great benefit to managers in extracting key information from field surveys.

In this review, we propose a new and complementary hypothesis describing the biophysical processes intervening in the recruitment of temperate fish larvae into estuaries. This new hypothesis, the Sense Acuity And Behavioral (SAAB) hypothesis, recognizes that recruitment is unlikely if the larvae drift passively with the water currents, and that successful recruitment requires the sense acuity of temperate fish larvae and their behavioral response to the estuarine cues present in coastal areas. We propose that temperate fish larvae use a hierarchy of sensory cues (odor, sound, visual and geomagnetic cues) to detect estuarine nursery areas and to aid during navigation towards these areas. The sensorial acuity increases along ontogeny, which coincides with increased swimming capabilities. The swimming strategies of post-flexion larvae differ from offshore areas to the tidal zone. In offshore areas, innate behavior might lead larvae towards the coast guided by a sun compass or by the earth's geomagnetic field. In areas under limited influence of estuarine plumes (either in energetic nearshore areas or offshore), post-flexion larvae display a searching swimming behavior for estuarine disconnected patches (infotaxis strategy). After finding an estuarine plume, larvae may swim along the increasing cue concentration to ingress into the estuary. Here, larvae exhibit a rheotaxis behavior and avoid displacement by longshore currents by keeping bearing during navigation. When larvae reach the vicinity of an estuary, merging diel rhythms with feeding and predator avoidance strategies with tidally induced movements is essential to increase their chances of estuarine ingress. A fish larva recruitment model developed for the Ria Formosa lagoon supports the general framework of the SAAB hypothesis.

Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo, body mass approximate to 2700 g), Ural Owls (Strix uralensis, 900 g), and Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus, 130 g) coexist in Fennoscandia and feed mainly on small rodents. Predation may play an important role in interactions among these owl species, because Eagle Owls and Ural Owls can kill Tengmalm's Owls but cannot enter the small entrance hale of Tengmalm's Owl nest boxes. We asked (i) whether predation risk and interspecific competition due to Eagle Owls and Ural Owls reduced breeding density and fitness of Tengmalm's Owls, and (ii) whether these interactions increased intraspecific competition for safe nesting sites among Tengmalm's Owls. We manipulated breeding densities of potentially competing owls by erecting nest boxes, the control being boxes in areas where breeding attempts of competing owl species were absent. Control nest boxes in areas with no Eagle Owl and Ural Owl territories, and nest boxes within Eagle Owl territories, were used by breeding Tengmalm's Owls more than nest boxes within Ural Owl territories. Most breeding attempts of Tengmalm's Owls near Ural Owls failed during the courtship period. The observational data revealed that breeding frequency of Tengmalm's Owls was reduced and the mean start of egg laying was delayed by 11 d within 2 km of Ural Owl nests. In addition, male Tengmalm's Owls at these nests were younger and paired more often with short-winged (i.e., young and generally subdominant) females than when farther away from Ural Owl nests. Our results suggest that inexperienced male Tengmalm's Owls are forced to establish their territories in the vicinity of Ural Owls where they often paired with subdominant females. The areas near Ural Owl nests are suboptimal habitats fdr Tengmalm's Owls, whereas those near Eagle Owls are not. We conclude that predatory and competitive interactions from Ural Owls decrease the breeding population size of Tengmalm's Owls by reducing the suitable habitats. This is the first experimental demonstration that such interactions may decrease fitness of raptors.",,"Hakkarainen, H (corresponding author), TURKU UNIV,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,FIN-20500 TURKU,FINLAND.",,,,,,,72,104,109,0,45,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1996,77,4,,,,,1134,1142,,10.2307/2265582,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UN894,WOS:A1996UN89400016,,,,,2021-09-24,

Two mechanisms have been advanced by which a decrease in growth may increase the mortality of young predators: (1) increased time during which juvenile predators are susceptible to gape-limited predation and (2) increased susceptibility to starvation. To study the effects of competition from a prey fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) on the recruitment of a piscivorous fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis), roach were introduced in two of four small adjacent unproductive lakes inhabited by natural populations of perch. We thereafter studied the diet, growth, and survival of the new-born cohorts of perch during a 13-mo period. Growth and survival of larval perch were not affected by roach whereas during the latter part of the growing season, growth and condition of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch were negatively affected by roach. The growth retardation of YOY perch in roach-treatment lakes coincided with a shift in diet from free-swimming zooplankton to benthic cladocerans and chironomids, which in turn was related to a stronger decline in pelagic zooplankton resources in these lakes. The small size and poor condition of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes resulted in almost all these perch dying from starvation during the winter and subsequent spring. There was a tendency for there to be higher densities of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes, possibly due to a strong die-off of adult perch in these lakes that in turn may have reduced cannibalism in these lakes. The results from an enclosure experiment on intra-cohort competition among YOY perch, however, suggested that the discrepancy in growth of YOY perch between the lakes was mainly due to direct competition from roach for the zooplankton resource. Temporal variation in competition intensity and in duration of periods for growth and energy gain (e.g., summer) vs. periods of only energy loss (e.g., winter) are suggested to have major effects on juvenile predator growth and subsequent recruitment to the adult stage through competitive juvenile bottlenecks, and thus to affect overall community dynamics. The relative importance of size-dependent winter starvation mortality compared to mortality caused by gape-limited predators as a mortality agent on juveniles is hypothesized to increase with latitude. Whole-lake experiments lend themselves both to testing the importance in natural systems of mechanisms previously identified at small spatial and short temporal scales, and also to identifying important mechanisms that cannot be studied at smaller scales.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,,,,94,121,127,1,43,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1998,79,6,,,,,2153,2167,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2153:CPAPJB]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,116YM,WOS:000075752700026,,,,,2021-09-24,

In a laboratory experiment, we evaluated the relative importance of competition and predation from juvenile and adult brown trout, respectively, on foraging performance of groups of three stone loaches. We observed loach consumption rate, time spent inactive, and aggressive interactions between juvenile trout and loach in artificial stream sections. The controlled experiments were complemented by examining stone loach population densities in natural systems as functions of juvenile and adult trout. In the laboratory experiments, increasing numbers of competitors decreased prey availability, which ultimately led to lower consumption rates for loach. Loach responded to predation risk by increasing time being inactive, thereby decreasing consumption rates. However, there were no effects of juvenile trout competitors on loach consumption rates in treatments with adult trout presence, suggesting no additive effect of predation and competition on loach foraging success. Partial regressions of loach and trout densities in natural streams revealed a positive relationship between juvenile trout and loach, and a negative relationship between adult trout and loach. Our laboratory and field data thus suggest that predation is a limiting factor for loach success, and predator presence could mediate species coexistence at high interspecific densities.","[Nilsson, Erika; Persson, Anders; Nilsson, P.

We found that both predation and interspecific competition greatly reduced the survivorship of larvae and the number of larvae emerging into adulthood. Treatments with both predators and competitors had fewer larvae transitioning among instars and into adulthood but not in an additive way. In addition, mosquito larvae in the presence of predators and competitors took two days longer to emerge than where predators and competitions were absent. Our work provides evidence that biotic interactions, such as predation and competition: can strongly regulate the number or mosquito larvae by reducing the number of larvae that survive through instars and to emergence and by increasing the generation time.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Knight, TM (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,"Goss, Charles/R-7296-2019",,,,,42,50,51,2,32,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,SANTA ANA,"PO BOX 87, SANTA ANA, CA 92702 USA",1081-1710,,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Using a new factorial metaanalysis technique, we combined the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments to ask whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects and to compare the average effects of competition and predation. Across all studies, the effects of competition in the presence of predators were less than in the absence of predators, and the interaction between competition and predation for most response variables was statistically significant. Removal of competitors had much more positive effects on organisms' growth and mass than did exclusion of predators. Predator exclusion had much more beneficial effects on organisms' survival than did competition. The mean effects of competition and predation on density did not differ from one another. The results differed among trophic levels. Further understanding would benefit greatly from more field experiments that manipulate both competition and predation, that focus on a wider range of organisms and environments, that focus on population-level parameters such as density, and that report results more completely, including data such as sample sizes and variances.","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Coll New Jersey, Dept Biol, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Gurevitch, J (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",,"Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008","Hedges, Larry/0000-0002-7531-0631",,,,76,296,309,5,193,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

When both species were analysed together, and for D. longispina alone, there were weak negative relationships between mean population density and population variability. Interspecific competition resulted in lower population densities and higher population variability. Extinct populations had lower densities and were also more variable than persisting ones. There was still an effect of population variability on extinction probability after the effect of density on population variability had been accounted for. Hence, the effects of population density and variability on population persistence were partly independent of each other. The effects of size-selective predation on population persistence were more species-specific and not directly related to density or variability. Since the effects of species interactions on persistence were large, we suggest that it is likely that population vulnerability analyses not incorporating effects of interspecific interactions are often misleading.","UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN; SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, DEPT ECOL & ENVIRONM RES, S-75007 UPPSALA, SWEDEN","BENGTSSON, J (corresponding author), UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL, NERC, CTR POPULAT BIOL, SILWOOD PK, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,41,28,28,1,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1995,101,4,,,,,397,406,,10.1007/BF00329418,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QT597,WOS:A1995QT59700001,28306954,,,,2021-09-24,

By alleviating interspecific competition among prey, predators may promote biodiversity, but the precise mechanisms of how predators alter competition have remained elusive. Here we report on a predator-exclosure experiment carried out in a tropical intertidal ecosystem, providing evidence for a three-level trophic cascade induced by predation by molluscivore Red Knots (Calidris canutus) that affects pore water biogeochemistry. In the exclosures the knots' favorite prey (Dosinia isocardia) became dominant and reduced the individual growth rate in an alternative prey (Loripes lucinalis). Dosinia, a suspension feeder, consumes suspended particulate organic matter (POM), whereas Loripes is a facultative mixotroph, partly living on metabolites produced by sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria, but also consuming suspended POM. Reduced sulfide concentrations in the exclosures suggest that, without predation on Dosinia, stronger competition for suspended POM forces Loripes to rely on energy produced by endosymbiotic bacteria, thus leading to an enhanced uptake of sulfide from the surrounding pore water. As sulfide is toxic to most organisms, this competition-induced diet shift by Loripes may detoxify the environment, which in turn may facilitate other species. The inference that predators affect the toxicity of their environment via a multi-level trophic cascade is novel, but we believe it may be a general phenomenon in detritus-based ecosystems.","[van Gils, Jan A.; van der Geest, Matthijs; Jansen, Erik J.; de Fouw, Jimmy; Piersma, Theunis] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Govers, Laura L.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Piersma, Theunis] Univ Groningen, CEES, Anim Ecol Grp, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","van der Geest, M (corresponding author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands.",matthijs.van.der.geest@nioz.nl,"van Gils, Jan/B-5544-2008; Govers, Laura/B-8838-2011; Piersma, Theunis/D-1871-2012; van der Geest, Matthijs/A-4744-2013","van Gils, Jan/0000-0002-4132-8243; van der Geest, Matthijs/0000-0002-9837-3803; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",NWO-WOTRONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [W.01.65.221.00],"We are grateful to the staff of the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin for allowing us to work and stay in the area under their management.

Here, we examine how the density of an IG predator can affect feeding group size, IG egg predation, and the growth responses of IG prey. We used laboratory feeding trials and outdoor mesocosm experiments to study interactions between a social intraguild predator (larvae of the wood frog; Rana sylvatica) and its prey (spotted salamander; Ambystoma maculatum). Larvae of R. sylvatica could potentially affect A. maculatum by consuming shared larval food resources or by consuming eggs and hatchlings. However, successful egg predation requires group feeding by schooling tadpoles. We established from five to 1,190 hatchlings of R. sylvatica in mesocosms, then added either 20 A. maculatum hatchlings to study interspecific competition, or a single egg mass to examine IGP. Crowding strongly suppressed the growth of R. sylvatica, and IGP was restricted to the egg stage. In the larval competition experiment, growth of A. maculatum was inversely proportional to R. sylvatica density. In the predation experiment, embryonic mortality of A. maculatum was directly proportional to the initial density of R. sylvatica and the mean number of tadpoles foraging on egg masses. IGP on eggs reduced A. maculatum hatchling density, which accelerated larval growth. Surprisingly, the density of R. sylvatica had no overall effect on A. maculatum growth because release from intraspecific competition via egg predation was balanced by increased interspecific competition. Our results demonstrate that the density of a social IG predator can strongly influence the nature and intensity of interactions with a second guild member by simultaneously altering the intensity of IGP and intra- and interspecific competition.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Petranka, JW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Hts, Asheville, NC 28804 USA.",petranka@unca.edu,,,,,,37,17,19,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,641,649,,10.1007/s00442-006-0398-z,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,056OG,WOS:000238533400011,16514532,,,,2021-09-24,

I quantified the effects of predation and competition on the growth and survival of two temperate reef fishes, Lythrypnus dalli and Coryphopterus nicholsii, in field experiments in which I manipulated the densities of the two species and the abundance of predators (using exclosure cages) on small replicate patch reefs. I also evaluated the influence of predators on the behavior of the two species to help interpret the mechanisms of any predatory influences on growth or survival. Predation was much more important than competition (inter- or intraspecific) in Lythrypnus. For Corphopterus, neither competition nor predation were particularly important. Behaviorally, both species responded to predators by reducing foraging rate and hiding. This altered behavior, however, had no repercussions for growth or survival of Coryphopterus!. In contrast, Lrthrypnus grew more slowly and suffered greater mortality when exposed to predators. Interspecific competition did not significantly influence either species. Intraspecific competition did not affect the growth of Coryphopterus, but survival tended to be lower at high densities. Growth of Lythrpnus was depressed by intraspecific competition, but survival was not, except that, in the presence of predators, survival was density dependent. In contrast to the historical emphasis placed on the role of competition, this study indicates that predation can be more important than competition in determining patterns of abundance of some reef fishes. For example, predators not influenced foraging of both Lythrpnus and Coryphopterus us, but they also reduced growth and survival of Lythrpnus and therefore appear to help maintain the marked habitat segregation between the two species. only.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Biol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Steele, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol, 621 Circle Dr S,Box 951606, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",masteele@ucla.edu,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917",,,,51,39,40,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,222,232,,10.1007/s004420050511,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700028,28308456,,,,2021-09-24,

In our model, the successful rate for a predator to prey depends on the individual ability to prey and the two interacting clusters sizes, and the size of a cluster is determined by the aggregation degree between individuals. Experimental results show that only one species can survive when competition occurs on one niche. And which species can survive ultimately depends on the relative relationship between the average individual ability to prey and the aggregation degree between it and its competing species. If competing species have identical values for the average individual ability to prey and the aggregation degree, the species that can survive is determined at random. Therefore, Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle is correct, but the causes of competing species to survive are different. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a series of laboratory experiments with a freshwater assemblage consisting of two predators that differd in their foraging modes ( a crayfish, Procambarus sp., and the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis) and their prospective anuran prey (tadpoles of the narrow-mouthed toad, Gastrophyrne carolinensis, and the squirrel treefrog, Hyla squirella). We examined whether competition occurs within and between these two prey species and, if so, whether the non-lethal presence of predators alters the outcome of competitive interactions. We also asked whether the two species of prey differ in their susceptibility to the two types of predators and whether interspecific differences in predator avoidance behavior might account for this variation. Our results indicated that Gastrophyrne was a stringer competitor than Hyla at high densities of surviving conspecifics that metamorphosed. However, the presence of mosquitofish did not alter the outcome of this competition, nor did either type of predator affect the density-dependent responses of Gastrophryne. In laboratory foraging trials, the number of tadpoles of each species that was killed, but not completely consumed by mosquitofish, was similar for Gastrophryne and Hyla. Yet, significantly more individualsof Gastrophryne than of Hyla were killed and completely eaten by mosquitofish at the end of the experiment. The two species of prey did not differ in their spatial avoidance of either type of predator, suggesting that this behavior did not play a significant role in the differential vulnerability of the prey to predation. By reducing the abundance og G. carolinensis, the potential exists for predators, such as mosquitofish to ameliorate this species' competitive impact on other species. In this way, predators may promote coexistence of species withi some assemblages of amphibians.","Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA","Walls, SC (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Natl Wetlands Res Ctr, Biol Resources Div, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA.",,,,,,,53,9,9,1,18,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,EMPORIA,"EMPORIA STATE UNIV, DIVISION BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 1200 COMMERCIAL ST, EMPORIA, KS 66801-5087 USA",0018-0831,,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,MAR,2002,58,1,,,,,104,118,,10.1655/0018-0831(2002)058[0104:IDISTC]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Zoology,Zoology,527EB,WOS:000174172700009,,,,,2021-09-24,

Indirect interactions between competition and predation, such as keystone predation, can influence both invasion success and the impact of an invasive species on resident competitors. The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald) has been established within the North American range of the indigenous competitor Aedes triseriatus (Say) and indigenous mosquito predator Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett). The effects of Tx. rutilus predation on competition between Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus were tested in laboratory microcosms. Consistent with a prior study, there was minimal evidence of competitive asymmetry between Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus, with similar effects of intraspecific versus interspecific interactions on both species. Tx. rutilus predation caused high mortality of both Ae. j. japonicus and Ae. triseriatus, and minimized the effects of density-dependent competition. Ae. japonicus females that survived predation had larger adult body sizes than those in treatments without predators. Ae. triseriatus females that survived Tx. rutilus predation were larger and developed quicker than individuals in treatments without predators. Intraspecific competition and predation negatively affected the finite rate of population increase for Ae. j. japonicus, but only affected individual fitness correlates for Ae. triseriatus, indicating that the overall population performance of the invader ismoresensitive to these interactions than the native species. Based on these results, we predict that predation is likely to be an important barrier to the establishment and spread of Ae. j. japonicus in tree holes in North America.","[Freed, T.

The initial biomass varied as 0.33 and 0.22 mu g/ml for B. plicatilis and B. rotundiformis respectively. Experiments were performed at (25 +/- 1)degrees C. Population densities were enumerated and the medium was changed daily up to 8 d in the experiment. At the lowest food level tested, B. rotundiformis formed superior competitor than B. plicatilis, regardless of starting inoculation density. Generally when the food concentrations increased, B. plicatilis showed a greater increase in biomass than B. rotundiformis. B. rotundiformis formed the largest in population growth, regardless of increasing food concentrations. When grown alone, B. plicatilis reached peak abundances of (1.311 5 +/- 0.028) and (137.5 +/- 0.014) mu g/ml at low and high food densities respectively. The corresponding values of B. rotundiformis were 0.724 5 +/- 0.016 and 18.15 +/- 0.021. The adverse effects of B. rotundiformis on the peak abundances of B. plicatilis were observed at the lowest food level and higher initial density. The rate of population growth in controls varied from (0.792 +/- 0.162) to (1.482 +/- 0.132) mu m/d for B. plicatilis and (0.445 +/- 0.041) to (0.856 +/- 0.012) mu m/d for B. rotundiformis, depending on food level. When both species were introduced together, low food levels favoured higher abundance of B. rotundiformis than B. plicatilis, suggesting that increased population density of the smaller B. rotundiformis was more successfull than larger B. plicatilis in brackish waters. Our work reveals that available food (type and quantity) along with starting inoculation density had significant effect on the interspecific competition between marine sibling rotifer species in zooplankton community structure.","[Divya, S.

In rock pools, there are no environmental factors preventing successful reproduction by S. nigrolineata.

The two plots contained single species of either D. japonicus or D. major, respectively, and one plot had both species in equal number. We compared the development and the reproductive performance between plots in each species. In D. japonicus, the number of eggs and early instar nymphs were significantly smaller in the plots containing both species than in the monospecific plots. However, the numbers of late instar nymphs and newly emerged adults were not significantly different between plots. The proportions of starved nymphs in both plots were larger than those in the D. japonicus's natural habitats. The final densities of adults in both plots were lower than those in the natural habitats. These results suggest that lower density of D. japonicus in these paddy fields is due to the lack of available food for nymphs rather than the effects of interspecific competition with D. major.

Although recently resurrected as an organizing force in arthropod communities on plants, there is still general agreement that resource competition among herbivores is reduced by predators. Here we show the reverse: predators induce interspecific resource competition among herbivores. We found that thrips larvae (Frankliniella occidentalis) use the web produced and inhabited by the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a refuge from predation by the phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus curumeris. Thrips larvae prefer clean plant parts, but move into the web upon perceiving volatile cues associated with thrips and predators. This behaviour leads to lower predation risk, but also to reduced developmental rate and lower production of thrips larvae due to competition with spider mites. In addition, thrips larvae consume spider-mite eggs. Thus, predators induce interspecific competition and intraguild predation among herbivores within refuge space, even when host plants have an overall green appearance.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Systemat & Populat Biol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Pallini, A (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Anim, BR-36571000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545",,,,30,61,65,2,31,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Herein, we explore how fish predation and competition interact to drive this change in crayfish species composition. In outside pools, we conducted selective predation experiments exposing crayfish to largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, to quantify patterns of crayfish vulnerability. To determine how interactions among crayfish influence susceptibility, we quantified shelter use and behavioral interactions among crayfish in aquaria and outside pools. At equal size, O, virilis was more susceptible to fish predation than either of the invaders, O. rusticus and O. propinquus; the two invaders were equally susceptible to predation. However, sizes of these crayfish in the field are O. virilis > O. rusticus > O. propinquus. Because fish predators prefer small crayfish, at unequal size, small O. propinquus were more vulnerable to predation than large O. rusticus. Thus, O. rusticus can replace O. propinquus due to natural size differences. Although O. virilis grows larger than the invaders, it was more susceptible even when 3 mm larger. We hypothesized that O. virilis, although large, participated in behaviors that increased its risk to predation. When provided with unlimited shelters, all three species increased refuge use under predatory risk. When shelters were limiting and fish present, O. virilis was excluded from shelters by invaders. O. virilis also participated in risky behaviors, such as increased activity and swimming. Both agonistic interactions with congeners and approaches by largemouth bass increased risky behaviors in O. virilis. In addition, O. virilis was innately less aggressive than invaders. Given these behaviors, O. virilis was consumed at high rates and would be eventually replaced in lakes. In northern Wisconsin lakes, fish predation and crayfish-crayfish competition interact to influence crayfish replacements. Based on our results, largemouth bass predation modifies the outcome of interference competition among the three crayfishes and, in turn, competitive interactions among the crayfishes influence susceptibility to fish predation. We predict that O. virilis should suffer high mortality to fish predation in the presence, rather than in the absence, of the two invading species. Our results support the hypothesis that, in areas of sympatry where predators are selective and prey species compete, predation and competition interact to determine community structure.",,"GARVEY, JE (corresponding author), OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,AQUAT ECOL LAB,COLUMBUS,OH 43210, USA.",,"Garvey, Jim/A-4919-2012; Langerhans, R.

By causing large reductions in native prey, invasive predators may modify native species interactions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment in The Bahamas to investigate the possibility that the invasive Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) alters competition between planktivorous fairy and blackcap basslets (Gramma loreto and Gramma melacara, respectively). Competition between these coral-reef fishes is known to have symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species, whereby the feeding positions under reef ledges and growth rates of these individuals are hindered. Following baseline censuses of local populations of competing basslets, I simultaneously manipulated the abundance of lionfish on entire reefs, and the abundance of basslets in local populations under isolated ledges within each reef, resulting in three treatments: unmanipulated control populations of both basslets, reduced abundance of fairy basslet, and reduced abundance of blackcap basslet. For eight weeks, I measured the change in biomass and feeding position of 2-5cm size classes of each basslet species and calculated the growth rates of similar to 2cm individuals using a standard mark-and-recapture method. Experimental populations were filmed at dusk using automated video cameras to quantify the behavior of lionfish overlapping with basslets. Video playback revealed lionfish hunted across all ledge positions, regardless of which basslet species were present, yet lionfish differentially reduced the biomass of only juvenile (2cm) fairy basslet. Predation reduced the effects of interspecific competition on juvenile blackcap basslet as evidenced by corresponding shifts in feeding position toward coveted front edges of ledges and increases in growth rates that were comparable to the response of these fish in populations where competition was experimentally reduced. Thus, an invasive marine predator altered the outcome of interspecific competition via differential predation, which tipped the balance of competition between native prey species from symmetrical to asymmetrical effects on juveniles. This study reveals a newly demonstrated context in which predation can indirectly facilitate prey, further broadening our understanding of the interactive effects of predation and competition in the context of invasive species.","[Kindinger, Tye L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Kindinger, Tye L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.; Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",tkinding@ucsc.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This study is a chapter from the author's doctoral dissertation (committee: M.

Studying these interactions under fluctuating food availability, while taking habitat characteristics into account, offers a quasi-experimental setup to determine the relative impact of con-and heterospecifics on reproductive success of predators. We analyzed the settlement decisions and reproductive success of Eurasian Pygmy Owls (Glaucidium passerinum) in the presence of both breeding conspecifics and their competitor and intraguild predator, Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus), under fluctuating abundance of their primary prey (voles). We used detailed data, collected across 11 years in a large study area (1300 km(2)), on the spatial and temporal variation of habitat characteristics in all available nesting sites, local densities of both species, and vole abundance. We found that Pygmy Owls strongly avoided breeding close to conspecifics but did not avoid Tengmalm's Owl nests. Nest box occupation of Pygmy Owls was positively correlated to the proportion of old spruce, mature and old pine forests, and farmlands, and occupation probability was higher at high vole abundance and in areas occupied in previous years. Pygmy Owl avoidance of conspecifics decreased when voles were abundant. At high conspecific density, Pygmy Owls showed lower hatching success and delayed hatching date, in agreement with the observed spatial avoidance. Finally, even though breeding Pygmy Owls did not spatially avoid Tengmalm's Owls, the density of heterospecifics correlated with low hatching and fledging success in Pygmy Owls. This suggests short term fitness costs when living close to competitors, even when lethal effects of intraguild interactions are subtle. Our results suggest that joint costs of exploitative and interference competition by Tengmalm's Owls, as well as intraguild predation, were lower than those induced by intraspecific competition only. This result might be due to the similar body size between the species considered, Tengmalm's Owls being only twice as large as Pygmy Owls. Interactions among con-and heterospecifics can therefore modify the spatial settlement and reproductive success of individuals on a landscape scale, also within the predator guild.","[Morosinotto, Chiara; Villers, Alexandre; Thomson, Robert L.; Varjonen, Rauno; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Villers, Alexandre] Univ Rochelle, CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UMR7372, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Thomson, Robert L.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa","Morosinotto, C (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",chimor@utu.fi,"Morosinotto, Chiara/AAK-5266-2020; Villers, Alexandre/W-8184-2019; Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Morosinotto, Chiara/0000-0002-9172-894X; Villers, Alexandre/0000-0003-3050-4106","Center for International Mobility (CIMO [TM-07-4819]; Finnish Cultural Foundation-South Ostrobothnia Regional fund; Turku University Foundation; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Biological Interactions Graduate School; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [138049, 123379, 136717, 250709]","The two-first authors (C.

Interspecific competition is often asymmetrical and the smaller carnivore is usually affected the most. We investigated the behavioural responses of two native species, the larger Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the smaller spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) to each other's odour and to that of an introduced predator, the feral cat (Felis catus), in north-west Tasmania, Australia. We used an experimental array of camera traps, in which carnivore scats were added as treatments. Behavioural responses exhibited by devils and quolls are indicative of a dominant predator-mesopredator relationship and suggest the potential for interspecific competition. The larger predator, the devil, was as vigilant at quoll odour as at control camera traps, but showed decreased vigilance at cat odour and did not avoid cat or quoll odours. The smaller predator, the spotted-tailed quoll, increased its vigilance near devil odour compared to control camera traps but did not avoid it. This experiment shows that assessing the behavioural responses of sympatric carnivores to each other's odour can help understand predator interactions and reveal the potential for interspecific competition. Understanding these interactions is crucial in managing and conserving carnivores. Animals navigate through an environment full of faecal odours left by predators, competitors and conspecifics. These odours provide information on both the immediate presence and the indirect risk of encountering a predator or an aggressive competitor. Tasmania's largest predator, the Tasmanian devil, coexists with the smaller spotted-tailed quoll and the introduced feral cat. We tested the behavioural responses of Tasmanian devils and spotted-tailed quolls to each other's faecal odour and to cat faecal odour. Behavioural patterns exhibited by predators in this experiment are indicative of a dominant predator-mesopredator relationship and suggest the potential for interspecific competition. Knowledge of the ecological interactions amongst sympatric carnivores can aid managers in making more informed decisions when trying to achieve specific conservation goals.","[Andersen, Georgina E.; Johnson, Christopher N.; Jones, Menna E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia","Andersen, GE (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",georgina.andersen@utas.edu.au,"Johnson, Christopher N/J-7894-2014","Johnson, Christopher N/0000-0002-9719-3771; Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022; Andersen, Georgina/0000-0001-9425-8296",,,,58,6,6,3,82,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

A laboratory experiment showed that the competitive interactions between the two shrimps were qualitatively altered in the presence of a predator. H. geniculatus was competitively superior in the absence of the predator, while the presence of the predator acted to lower activities of both species, resulting in a reduced intra- and interspecific interference competition. Based on the experimental data on the behavioral changes, we constructed a model for population dynamics of the shrimp community, and examined the conditions for coexistence of the prey species in terms of their recruitment rates and death rates in the presence and absence of predator.

It is spreading in south-west Iberia where it is the dominant corixid in pennanent, saline wetlands, where it may have excluded halotolerant native corixid species. In the Donana wetland complex in south-west Spain, it is abundant in temporary, brackish ponds but almost absent from temporary fresh ponds where the native S. lateralis is the dominant corixid. We conducted an outdoor experiment to test whether the alien is intolerant of low salinities, or if it can be competitively excluded by the native species S. lateralis. We established single species tanks for each species in semi-natural conditions, as well as mixed species tanks and controls lacking corixids. Trichocorixa verticalis was able to complete its life-cycle at a low salinity of 2 g/l. Compared to S. lateralis, it showed higher daily adult mortality and nymph production, but a shorter generation time. When mixed together, both species had lower adult mortality than in the alone treatment, suggesting they can coexist. Adult abundance at the end of the experiment was highest for T verticalis, which performed better in mixed tanks whereas S. lateralis performed better alone. These results confirm that T. verticalis can tolerate freshwaters and suggest that its rarity in these ponds in nature is due to other ecological factors such as dispersal limitation, poor adaptation to fluctuating water levels, or the effects of ectoparasitic water mites known to prefer the alien as a host.","[Carbonell, Jose Antonio; Cespedes, Vanessa; Green, Andy J.] EBD CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Coccia, Cristina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile; [Coccia, Cristina] Univ Santo Tomas, Santiago, Chile","Carbonell, JA (corresponding author), EBD CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",jcarbonell@ebd.csic.es; ecovanekimi@gmail.com; crcoccia@uc.cl; ajgreen@ebd.csic.es,"Cespedes, Vanessa/AAF-6316-2019; Green, Andy J/A-5189-2008","Cespedes, Vanessa/0000-0002-9399-8791; Green, Andy J/0000-0002-1268-4951","Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa, Junta de Andalucia project [P10-RNM-6262]; Programa Estatal de Promocion del Talento y su Empleabilidad en I+D+I -Juan de la Cierva-Formacion programme postdoc contract from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) [FJCI2017-31709]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN)Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [SVP-2013-067595]; Conicyt/Fondecyt Iniciation grant [11180668]","This research was supported by the Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa, Junta de Andalucia project (P10-RNM-6262) to AJG, a Programa Estatal de Promocion del Talento y su Empleabilidad en I+D+I -Juan de la Cierva-Formacion programme postdoc contract (FJCI2017-31709) from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) to JAC, a Severo Ochoa predoctoral contract (SVP-2013-067595) from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) to VC, and a Conicyt/Fondecyt Iniciation grant (11180668) to CC.",,39,3,3,0,0,REGIONAL EURO-ASIAN BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS CENTRE-REABIC,HELSINKI,"PL 3, HELSINKI, 00981, FINLAND",1798-6540,1818-5487,,AQUAT INVASIONS,Aquat.

However, the indirect effects of such biological interactions are poorly known because of the difficulties in measuring predation risk in nature. We addressed this issue by assessing the effect of asymmetrical competition among brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and two superior non-piscivorous competitors, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and white sucker (Catostomus commersonii), on the predation risk of a brook trout prey, northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos). We determined the spatio-temporal patterns of relative predation risk of dace with tethering experiments in 11 lakes containing either only brook trout and dace (n = 5), or brook trout, dace, chub, and sucker (n = 6). The diel pattern of the relative predation risk and the overall relative predation risk of dace were not significantly different in lakes with or without brook trout competitors. However, we observed a significant shift in the relative predation risk from the lower pelagic to the upper pelagic and littoral zones in the presence of brook trout competitors. This study highlights the fact that the outcome of interactions can vary in space and that care should be used when extrapolating the results of small-scale experiments or coarse-scale estimates to the whole ecosystem.","[Dupuch, Angelique; Bertolo, Andrea; Magnan, Pierre] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Interact Bassins Versants Ecosyst Aquat, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Dill, Lawrence M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Evolutionary & Behav Ecol Res Grp, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Dupuch, A (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",angelique.dupuch@uqo.ca,"Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019","Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163; Bertolo, Andrea/0000-0002-6018-816X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"We thank Julie Adams, Maryse Blanchette, Come Garceau, Annie Jacob, Kathy-Andree Laplante-Albert, Maxime Leveille, Rachel Massicotte, Aurore Perot, Daniel Pouliot, Raphael Proulx, Evelyne Roy, and Sylvain Theleme for their assistance at various stages of this research as well as Daniel Boisclair, Laure Devine, and Jim Grant for their comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Strategies should be different for indirect resource competition (exploitation, e.g., foraging and avoidance behaviour) than for direct interspecific interference (e.g., aggression, vigilance, and nest guarding). We studied the effects of resource competition and nest predation in sympatric small mammal species using semi-fossorial voles and shrews, which prey on vole offspring during their sensitive nestling phase. Experiments were conducted in caged outdoor enclosures. Focus common vole mothers (Microtus arvalis) were either caged with a greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) as a potential nest predator, with an herbivorous field vole (Microtus agrestis) as a heterospecific resource competitor, or with a conspecific resource competitor. Results: We studied behavioural adaptations of vole mothers during pregnancy, parturition, and early lactation, specifically modifications of the burrow architecture and activity at burrow entrances. Further, we measured pre- and postpartum faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) of mothers to test for elevated stress hormone levels. Only in the presence of the nest predator were prepartum FCMs elevated, but we found no loss of vole nestlings and no differences in nestling body weight in the presence of the nest predator or the heterospecific resource competitor. Although the presence of both the shrew and the field vole induced prepartum modifications to the burrow architecture, only nest predators caused an increase in vigilance time at burrow entrances during the sensitive nestling phase. Conclusion: Voles displayed an adequate behavioural response for both resource competitors and nest predators. They modified burrow architecture to improve nest guarding and increased their vigilance at burrow entrances to enhance offspring survival chances. Our study revealed differential behavioural adaptations to resource competitors and nest predators.","[Liesenjohann, Monique; Liesenjohann, Thilo; Eccard, Jana Anja] Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med, Dept Nat Sci Biochem, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Liesenjohann, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",monique.liesenjohann@uni-potsdam.de,"Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008","Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [ec361/4-1],"We thank Prof. Fritz Trillmich for providing his laboratory at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, for the FCM extractions and Elke Hippauf for technical support with the extractions.

Researchers have frequently examined the roles of competition and predation in terrestrial or semi-aquatic communities of salamanders, but have rarely examined the influence of these factors between these communities. We conducted mesocosm and laboratory behavioral experiments (1) to test hypotheses, derived from by a previous laboratory study, in a semi-natural setting and (2) to formulate new hypotheses regarding novel species-pair combinations. Our mesocosm experiments did not support a previous hypothesis of predation by Desmognathus fuscus (a semi-aquatic species) on Plethodon cinereus (a terrestrial species), but did support a prediction that P cinereus would avoid D. fuscus. We predicted that behavioral experiments between pairs of semi-aquatic species would demonstrate predatory behavior by D. fuscus toward E. cirrigera and aggressive behavior by D. ochrophaeus toward Eurycea cirrigera; we did not find strong evidence for either predation or aggression. This finding was surprising given the similar activity patterns and dietary habits of these species. Although we predicted that Desmognathus might influence local distributions of heterogeneric salamanders through interspecific aggression in a manner similar to that seen within this genera, we found that both D. fuscus and D. ochrophaeus displayed much less aggression than expected. However, D. juscus, in particular, appears to induce avoidance behavior in both P. cinereus and E. cirrigera without evidence of predation or excessive aggression, indicating that interference competition may be an important factor in structuring plethodontid communities.","Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA","Ransom, TS (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Gilmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",tsr6a@virginia.edu,,,,,,48,8,8,0,14,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,NOV,2006,143,,11,,,,1357,1382,,10.1163/156853906778987524,,,26,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,127BR,WOS:000243560800004,,,,,2021-09-24,

Contrary to these premises, evidence of interspecific competition in web-weaving spiders is ambiguous, and new experiments on natural communities are interesting. This paper reports on an experiment designed to test competitive effects in a natural community of web-weaving spiders, accomplished by selective removal of each of the three locally dominant species: Araneus marmoreus, Argiope bruennichi, and Agelena labyrinthica. No statistically significant difference was found among control plots and the plots where one of the three species had been removed, for any of the variables measured, but the small number of replicates limited statistic power. Considering only effect direction, and not statistical significance, these removal experiments supported competitive effects on community structure, habitat overlap, and spider body size. On the other hand, effects were contrary to competitive expectations as regards abundance and habitat breadth. These results are in line with the findings of the other removal experiments conducted so far on spiders, that uncovered small intra- and interspecific competitive effects fbr some variables but not for others. So Ear, there is no evidence that interspecific competition may affect spider communities, although a low-level competition remains possible, but difficult to test statistically for its evolutionary consequence.","Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Fasola, M (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, Piazza Botta 9, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",fasola@ipv36.unipv.it,,"FASOLA, MAURO/0000-0002-7366-5893",,,,19,3,3,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1125-0003,1748-5851,,ITAL J ZOOL,Ital.

Habitat segregation seems to be the major factor contributing to the coexistence of these two species: I. baltica is the dominant species among surface drift weed, whereas I. emarginata occurs mainly on the sea bed among accumulations of broken decaying algae. In laboratory cultures with food in excess, there is intense intra- and interspecific competition through direct interference. Single species cultures of both species thrive and rapidly attain an equilibrium population size which is about four times greater in I. emarginata than in I. baltica. In mixed-species cultures, I. baltica lacks a 'realized niche'; independent of starting densities, I. baltica is competitively excluded by I. emarginata within a short period of time. The crucial behavioural mechanism of interference is cannibalism (intraspecific competition) and mutual predation (interspecific competition). Both intra- and interspecific interference occur mainly through density-dependent control of juvenile mortality by cannibalistic /predatory adults. Experiments on the relative strengths of intra- and interspecific interference revealed strong asymmetries in competitive relationships: Intraspecific inhibitory effects in I. baltica are much greater than in I. emarginata; I. emarginata exerts much more inhibition on I. baltica than on itself, whereas I. baltica exerts much more inhibition on itself than on its congener I. emarginata. These asymmetries account for a complete competitive dominance of I. emarginata over I. baltica, and (according to the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition) inevitably result in competitive exclusion of I. baltica by I. emarginata. All types of asymmetry are due to the fact that juveniles of I. emarginata are much better protected from being cannibalized and preyed upon by conspecifics and heterospecifics, respectively, than juveniles of I. baltica. This protection is probably based on an active chemical defense mechanism that becomes ineffective immediately after death. The possibility is discussed that current interference competition is an important factor in maintaining habitat segregation in I. baltica and I. emarginata in the field. Extrapolation of the laboratory results to the field suggests an essentially unidirectional effect, with I. emarginata itself being largely unaffected by I. baltica but competitively excluding the latter from zones of potential overlap.

It has been suggested that E. willamettei may be beneficial in vineyards because it may have a negative impact: an the more damaging T, pacificus through their shared predator or through some form of interspecific competition, We conducted field and greenhouse experiments to determine the relative effects of these interactions between the two herbivores on the population dynamics of T, pacificus in 'Thompson Seedless' grape vineyards. We also used the field data to generate a functional relationship for the combined impact of E. willamettei and M. occidentalis on T, pacificus. 2, Predation and predator-mediated apparent competition were the only factors affecting T, pacificus densities in the field experiment, The addition of the predatory mite M, occidentalis alone resulted in a significant reduction in T, pacificus densities, while the addition of E, willamettei alone had little impact on T, pacificus densities. The greatest reductions in T. pacificus densities occurred in plots where both the predatory mite M, occidentalis and E, willamettei were added, The predatory mite occurred earliest and increased at the greatest rate in plots where it was released along with E. willamettei. From April to June, M. occidentalis abundance was positively correlated with E. willamettei abundance while T. pacificus abundance in July and August was negatively correlated with M. occidentalis abundance in the period April to June. 3, Under greenhouse conditions, the addition of E. willamettei to T. pacificus vines resulted in a marked decrease in T pacificus population growth rate. In contrast, doubling T. pacificus abundance in the absence E willamettei did not affect T. pacificus population growth rate, indicating that interspecific competition is more important than intraspecific competition in determining T. pacificus abundance, 4, Contrary to the greenhouse data and other studies in 'Zinfandel' vineyards, we found no evidence that E, willamettei competed with T, pacificus in the absence of predation in a Thompson Seedless vineyard. We suggest that the outcome of interactions between E, willamettei and T. pacificus may be affected by grape cultivar, growing region, a combination of cultivar and region-specific differences, or size and timing of vine infestations with E, willamettei. 5, In Thompson Seedless vineyards, ville infestation with E, willamettei would be most useful in increasing the effectiveness of the predatory mite M. occidentalis in controlling T, pacificus, primarily through an elevated predatory mite abundance prior to the development of large T, pacificus populations.",,"Hanna, R (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,"Wilson, Lloyd T/E-9971-2011",,,,,40,28,28,0,14,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Ecological theory on the trophic impacts of invasive fauna on native competitors is equivocal. Whilst increased interspecific competition can result in coexisting species having constricted and diverged trophic niches, the competing species might instead increase their niche sizes to maintain energy intakes. Empirical experiments can test invasion theory on competitive interactions and niche sizes across different spatial scales and complexity. 2. The consequences of increased interspecific competition from a model alien fish Leuciscus idus were tested on two taxonomically and trophically similar native fishes, Squalius cephalus and Barbus barbus. Competitive interactions were tested in tank aquaria using comparative functional responses (CFRs) and cohabitation trials. The consequences of these competitive interactions for the trophic niche sizes and positions of the fishes were tested in pond mesocosms. 3. Comparative functional responses revealed that compared to B. barbus, L. idus had significantly higher attack and consumption rates; cohabitation trials revealed B. barbus growth rates were depressed in sympatry with L. idus. For L. idus and S. cephalus, differences in their functional response parameters and growth rates were not significant. 4. Pond mesocosms used stable isotope metrics to quantify shifts in the trophic niche sizes of the fishes between allopatry and sympatry using a substitutive experimental design. Isotopic niches were smaller and more divergent in sympatric paired species than predicted by their allopatric treatments, suggesting trophic impacts from interspecific competition. However, an all-species sympatric treatment revealed similar niche sizes with allopatry. This maintenance of niche sizes in the presence of all species potentially resulted from the buffering of direct competitive effects of the species pairs by indirect effects. 5. Experimental predictions from tank aquaria assisted the interpretation of the constricted and diverged trophic niches detected in the paired-species sympatric treatments of the pond mesocosms. However, the all-species sympatric treatment of this experiment revealed greater complexity in the outcomes of the competitive interactions within and between the species. These results have important implications for understanding how alien species integrate into food webs and influence the trophic relationships between native species.","[Britton, J.

Most studies have focused on the effect of large invasive fishes such as salmonids, whereas the effect of smaller fish on amphibians has been seldom investigated. We experimentally studied effects of the invasive Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) on pygmy newts (Triturus pygmaeus), a species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. We set up outdoor mesocosms in Doana National Park with native aquatic flora and invertebrate fauna, and containing larval newts at two experimental densities. Density of larval newts was also crossed with presence or absence of mosquitofish, either free-swimming or caged, in order to distinguish consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Increased density of coexisting larval newts did not reduce their survival, but reduced their growth and development. Newt survival and size at metamorphosis were dramatically reduced in the presence of free-swimming mosquitofish, whether at low or high fish densities. Caged mosquitofish, however, had no effect on larval newts. In laboratory trials, mosquitofish preyed more efficiently on insect larvae than did larval pygmy newts, highlighting the high competitive potential of mosquitofish. This was confirmed by the depletion of zooplankton that free fish caused in the experimental outdoor mesocosms. Our study suggests that invasive mosquitofish exert a high negative impact on coexisting newt populations. Such effects can be explained by a combination of direct predation, injuries caused by predation attempts, and intense competitive exploitation of common food resources.","[Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Ave Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain; [Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Cabrera-Guzman, E; Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Ave Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain.",elisa.cabrera_guzman@okstate.edu; igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RDI [SEV-2012-0262, SO-07]; CONACYT (ConsejoNacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia deMexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [204202]","We thank Lola Asencio, Rosa Arribas, Pablo Burraco, Rafael Carmona, Sara Castro, Carmen Fernandez, Pilar Fernandez, Ana Herrero, Maria Leon, Raquel Lopez and Daniel Moen for help in the field or in the laboratory.

The research presented here uses a survey, foraging observations, and a manipulative field experiment that test the included-niche competition hypothesis as a mechanism structuring the distribution of a generalist grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum, along a food-resource gradient. A field survey of 10 old fields revealed a step-like reduction in M. femurrubrum abundance as the proportion of grass cover in the fields exceeded 60%. Furthermore, M. femurrubrum abundance and the abundance of a potential competitor, the grass specialist Chorthippus curtipennis, were negatively correlated among the fields. Experimental foraging observations showed that M. femurrubrum was a polyphagous feeder that preferred grass and consumed less grass in the presence of C. curtipennis. The pattern of grasshopper distribution and foraging data support an included-niche competition hypothesis. However, in a field experiment that manipulated C. curtipennis presence and absence and the composition of vegetation in which competition might occur, growth and mortality rates in M. femurrubrum did not respond to C. curtipennis competition. Performance was predicted to be lowest in grass-dominated conditions, those corresponding to the locations when M. femurrubrum does not exist. Instead, growth rates were highest and mortality rates were lowest in grass-only treatments. While the survey and foraging observations support the included-niche hypothesis, the experiments suggest that interspecific competition in adult grasshoppers is not the cause of the grasshopper distribution pattern. Similar experiments in western North American prairies indicate that interspecific competition can be important and that foraging ecology can be a good indicator of the interaction. This study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge about interspecific competition's role in organism distributions. It demonstrates that geographic similarity in natural history need not lead to a similar importance of limiting factors.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Beckerman, AP (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Inst Biol Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",a.p.beckerman@stirling.ac.uk,"Beckerman, Andrew P/D-3020-2011","Beckerman, Andrew P./0000-0002-4797-9143",,,,54,25,28,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,948,957,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0948:COOICB]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500007,,,,,2021-09-24,

In field experiments, I varied densities of one or both isopod species in enclosures in which food and virus presence were also manipulated. I estimated the effects of intra- and interspecific competition, additional food, and virus infection on both the survival of P. scaber and the prevalence of the virus. In uninfected populations, intraspecific and interspecific competition negatively affected isopod survival, although food resources had no effect. In infected treatments, interspecific competition produced higher levels of virus prevalence than did intraspecific competition. Virus infection and reduced food interacted to produce higher overall mortality in interspecific competition treatments than in intraspecific competition treatments. The lack of significant effect of food on competition suggests that interference interactions rather than resource competition predominated. This mechanism is supported by a laboratory study in which total food availability was controlled. These results indicate that competition and parasitism interacted to produce the observed mortality patterns, and that ignoring mortality due to the virus would produce apparent interspecific competition. The data suggest that the impact of P. laevis on P. scaber involves both direct and indirect effects.","UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720",,,,,,,,49,76,78,0,57,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1992,73,2,,,,,507,514,,10.2307/1940756,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HK464,WOS:A1992HK46400010,,,,,2021-09-24,

Although interspecific competition is based on two mechanisms, exploitation of resources and physical interference, trade-off studies largely consider only species' ability to exploit resources. Using a mesocosm experiment, we examined the trade-off between interference competition ability and susceptibility to predation in larvae of two newt species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. In the presence of heterospecifics, L.vulgaris larvae slowed somatic growth and developmental rates, and experienced a higher frequency of injuries than in conspecific environments which suggests asymmetrical interspecific interference. During short-term predation trials, L.vulgaris larvae suffered higher mortality than I.alpestris. Larvae of the smaller species, L.vulgaris, had both lower interference and antipredator performance than the larger I.alpestris, which suggests a lack of trade-off between interference competition ability and predator susceptibility.

We analysed nest-site characteristics, breeding success and competitive interactions between two apex predator populations. Whereas the Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus has nested in the Judean Foothills (Israel) for a long time, the Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus has only invaded the nesting habitat of the Short-toed Eagle during their breeding season in the last two decades. These two recently sympatric species have similar nesting ecology and frequently use the same nests. They are therefore expected to compete over nesting sites and territories. We analysed interspecific interactions between these two species by combining information from comprehensive observational, experimental, GIS analysis and remote sensing data, deriving 65 variables to characterize the nest- sites used and the breeding success in 381 breeding attempts over four consecutive breeding seasons. To assess interspecific and intraspecific territorial behaviour and aggressiveness, stuffed Long-legged Buzzards and Short-toed Eagles were presented close to nests. Nestsite characteristics overlapped substantially between species, and Long-legged Buzzards occupied 21% of all Short-toed Eagle nests. Intraspecific aggression rates among Long-legged Buzzards were higher than their interspecific aggression rates with Short-toed Eagles and also higher than intraspecific aggression among Short-toed Eagles. Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle breeding densities (1.59 +/- 0.11 and 2.96 +/- 0.11 pairs per 10 km(2), respectively) are likely to be the highest across their respective breeding distributions, with a maximum productivity of 0.96 +/- 0.01 and 0.56 +/- 0.05 (young fledged/breeding pair) for Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle, respectively. Intraspecific interactions among both species play an important role in determining their breeding success and the spatial distribution of nesting sites. Our results suggest that interspecific competition over nesting sites and territories between both species, and the potential dominance of Long-legged Buzzard, has both direct and indirect impacts on the spatial and demographic distribution of Short-toed Eagles due to the recent establishment of Long-legged Buzzard territories in the Judean breeding area.","[Friedemann, Guilad; Leshem, Yossi; Kerem, Lior] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Bar-Massada, Avi] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, Qiryat Tivon, Israel; [Izhaki, Ido] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Fac Nat Sci, Haifa, Israel","Friedemann, G (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.",gilad.fridman@gmail.com,"Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF); Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel); Smaller-Winnikow Foundation; Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA); Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI); Rieger Foundation (USA); Raptor Research Foundation (RFF); International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel); Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel),"This research was supported by the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel), Smaller-Winnikow Foundation, Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI), Rieger Foundation (USA), Raptor Research Foundation (RFF), The International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel) and Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel).

This is still the case in size-structured predator communities where predators consume prey species of different sizes (interspecific prey responses) or consume different size classes of the same species of prey (intraspecific prey responses). A mechanism has recently been proposed to explain coexistence between predators that differ in size but share the same prey species, emergent facilitation, which is dependent on strong intraspecific responses from one or more prey species. Under emergent facilitation, predators can depend on each other for invasion, persistence or success in a size-structured prey community. Experimental evidence for intraspecific size-structured responses in prey populations remains rare, and further questions remain about direct interactions between predators that could prevent or limit any positive effects between predators [e.g. intraguild predation (IGP)]. Here, we provide a community-wide experiment on emergent facilitation including natural predators. We investigate both the direct interactions between two predators that differ in body size (fish vs. invertebrate predator), and the indirect interaction between them via their shared prey community (zooplankton). Our evidence supports the most likely expectation of interactions between differently sized predators that IGP rates are high, and interspecific interactions in the shared prey community dominate the response to predation (i.e. predator-mediated competition). The question of whether emergent facilitation occurs frequently in nature requires more empirical and theoretical attention, specifically to address the likelihood that its pre-conditions may co-occur with high rates of IGP.","[ten Brink, Hanna; Mazumdar, Abul Kalam Azad; Huddart, Joseph; Persson, Lennart; Cameron, Tom C.] Umea Univ, S-90742 Umea, Sweden; [Cameron, Tom C.] Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","Cameron, TC (corresponding author), Umea Univ, S-90742 Umea, Sweden.",tcameron@essex.ac.uk,"Brink, Hanna ten/R-3606-2019; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012; Cameron, Tom/H-9555-2012","Brink, Hanna ten/0000-0001-6772-7229; Cameron, Tom/0000-0002-5875-1494",Marie Curie Intra-European FellowshipEuropean Commission [275873]; Erasmus; Umea University,"This work was funded by a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship to TCC (FANTI-SIZE, 275873), Erasmus travel grants (HTB, JH) and by Umea University (LP, MAKA).

In systems where predators regulate prey abundance, it is reasonable to assume that differential patterns of habitat use by prey species represent adaptive responses to spatial variation in predation. However, patterns of habitat use also reflect interspecific competition over habitat. Collared (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) and brown (Lemmus trimucronatus) lemmings represent such a system and possess distinct upland tundra versus mesic meadow habitat preferences consistent with interspecific competition. Yet, we do not know whether this habitat preference might also reflect differences in predation risk or whether the two species differ in their behavioral tactics used to avoid predation. We performed experiments where we manipulated putative predation risk perceived by lemmings by increasing protective cover in upland and meadow habitats while we recorded lemming activity and behavior. Both lemming species preferentially used cover more than open patches, but Dicrostonyx was more vigilant than Lemmus. Both species also constrained their activity to protective patches in upland and meadow habitats, but during different periods of the day. Use of cover and vigilance were independent of habitat, suggesting that both species live in a fearsome but flattened landscape of fear at Walker Bay (Nunavut, Canada), and that their habitat preference is a consequence of competition rather than predation risk. Future studies aiming to map the contours of fear in multi-prey-predator systems should consider how predation and competition interact to modify prey species' habitat preference, patch use, and vigilance.","[Dupuch, Angelique] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Dupuch, Angelique; Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Halliday, William D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",Douglas.Morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Canada's International Polar Year program Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable EcoSystems; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Department of Indian and Northern Affairs; Northern Scientific Training Program; Polar Continental Shelf Project (Natural Resources Canada)Natural Resources Canada,"We thank Canada's International Polar Year program Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable EcoSystems, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, Northern Scientific Training Program, and Polar Continental Shelf Project (Natural Resources Canada), for financial and logistical support.

Whether such intraguild interactions can also occur between adult females of one species and adult males of another, is not known. Herein, we report on intraguild interactions between adults of the two sexes in cross-pairing experiments involving three related phytoseiid species (Neoseiulus paspalivorus, N. baraki and N. neobaraki) that are potential candidates for controlling the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis, a serious pest of coconut palms in tropical countries. For comparative reasons, the experiments were repeated with larvae instead of males, and with only males or only females of two different species together. In the presence of an ample supply of prey, females of N. neobaraki never fed on individuals of their own species, yet appeared to be very aggressive against males, as well as larvae of the other two phytoseiid species. They also fed on females of N. paspalivorus, but rarely on females of N. baraki. Males of N. neobaraki did not suffer mortality when together with females of either of the two other phytoseiid species. Males of N. baraki did not suffer predation from females of N. paspalivorus, but males of N. paspalivorus suffered some mortality (15 %) from N. baraki females. Larvae of each of the three species were vulnerable to intraguild predation by heterospecific adult females, except for N. neobaraki larvae when together with N. baraki females. The absence or presence of intraguild predation is largely explained by the size ratios of the individuals that were put together: large individuals feed on smaller ones, but never the reverse. For each sex, size declines in the following order: N. neobaraki > N. baraki > N. paspalivorus. Moreover, for each species, females are larger than males and males are larger than larvae. Strikingly, however, females did not kill males and larvae of their own species. We propose that niche competition between related phytoseiid species is not only determined by intraguild predation on heterospecific larvae, but also by imposing great mortality on males from the intraguild prey because phytoseiid females being pseudo-arrhenotokous require insemination to produce offspring of both sexes.","[Sourassou, Nazer Famah; Hanna, Rachid; Negloh, Koffi] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin; [Sourassou, Nazer Famah; Negloh, Koffi; Breeuwer, Johannes A.

Interactions among predators can disrupt, facilitate, or augment biological pest control. We estimated the relative strengths of cannibalism and interspecific predation in a maize-aphid-coccinellid predator system. We know from previous work that Adalia bipunctata females tend to oviposit at the top of the plant near large aphid aggregations and that Coleomegilla maculata females tend to oviposit at the bottom of the plant far from large aphid aggregations. We used this information to design experiments to estimate the relative strength of cannibalism and interspecific predation. At high aphid densities, eggs at the top of the plant, near aphids, were preyed upon more than eggs at the bottom of the plant, far from aphids. This result implies that A. bipunctata suffers greater egg mortality than C. maculata. Tn part, this was due to the foraging pattern of A. bipunctata and also the large populations of aphidophagous predators that develop as a result of the large aggregations of aphids at the top of the maize plant. In predator-enclosure experiments, A. bipunctata searched primarily near large aggregations of aphids and therefore fed more on eggs at the top of plants near large aggregations of aphids. C. maculata searched throughout, yet tended to feed on more eggs at the bottom of the plant. This demonstrated that for both species the effect of cannibalism was equal to or stronger than that of interspecific predation. These findings suggest that species-specific oviposition behaviors largely determined the relative strength of cannibalism and interspecific predation. Cannibalism and interspecific predation can be analyzed as interference competition. Using competition theory, we were able to make predictions about coccinellid species' joint impact on aphids and species dominance.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Ctr Community Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Schellhorn, NA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Schellhorn, Nancy/B-6716-2009",,,,,50,83,85,0,34,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

While temporal resource partitioning has long been hypothesized to reduce the negative effects of interspecific competition, empirical evidence suggests that time may not often be an axis along which animal species routinely subdivide resources. Here, we present evidence to the contrary in the world's most biodiverse group of animals: insect parasites (parasitoids). Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis of 64 studies from 41 publications to determine if temporal resource partitioning via variation in the timing of a key life-history trait, egg deposition (oviposition), mitigates interspecific competition between species pairs sharing the same insect host. When competing species were manipulated to oviposit at (or near) the same time in or on a single host in the laboratory, competition was common, and one species was typically inherently superior (i.e. survived to adulthood a greater proportion of the time). In most cases, however, the inferior competitor could gain a survivorship advantage by ovipositing earlier (or in a smaller number of cases later) into shared hosts. Moreover, this positive (or in a few cases negative) priority advantage gained by the inferior competitor increased as the interval between oviposition times became greater. The results from manipulative experiments were also correlated with patterns of life-history timing and demography in nature: the more inherently competitively inferior a species was in the laboratory, the greater the interval between oviposition times of taxa in co-occurring populations. Additionally, the larger the interval between oviposition times of competing taxa, the more abundant the inferior species was in populations where competitors were known to coexist. Overall, our findings suggest that temporal resource partitioning via variation in oviposition timing may help to facilitate species coexistence and structures diverse insect communities by altering demographic measures of species success. We argue that the lack of evidence for a more prominent role of temporal resource partitioning in promoting species coexistence may reflect taxonomic differences, with a bias towards larger-sized animals. For smaller species like parasitic insects that are specialized to attack one or a group of closely related hosts, have short adult lifespans and discrete generation times, compete directly for limited resources in small, closed arenas and have life histories constrained by host phenology, temporal resource subdivision via variation in life history may play a critical role in allowing species to coexist by alleviating the negative effects of interspecific competition.","[Hood, Glen Ray; Blankinship, Devin; Doellman, Meredith M.; Feder, Jeffrey L.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Galvin Life Sci Ctr 100, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hood, Glen Ray] Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 5047 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA","Hood, GR (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Galvin Life Sci Ctr 100, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.; Hood, GR (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 5047 Gullen Mall, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",glenrayhood@wayne.edu,,,Entomological Society of America; Indiana Academy of Science; Sigma Xi; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF-IGERT GLOBES Fellowship from the University of Notre Dame; NSF-GLOBES REU Fellowship from the University of Notre Dame; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Agriculture NIFA program,"We thank G.

Such bi-directional predation can be important during the establishment and spread of an invading species, but its role remains poorly understood. Using a combination of laboratory and mesocosm experiments and field introductions, we demonstrate that guppies, Poecilia reticulata, prey on juvenile killifish, Rivulus hartii, and thereby facilitate their establishment in the habitat of a potential predator. Laboratory studies found that mature guppies can consume larval Rivulus, and experimental stream studies showed that guppies reduced the number of Rivulus surviving from eggs. Growth trials found that interspecific competition, while significant, cannot account for the declines in the survival of juvenile Rivulus seen in field surveys. Finally, a field experiment, in which guppies were introduced into previously guppy-free stream reaches, resulted in a marked reduction in the abundance of juvenile Rivulus relative to guppy-free controls. Together, these results indicate that reducing the native Rivulus population represents an important mechanism promoting guppy invasion success.","[Fraser, Douglas F.] Siena Coll, Dept Biol, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA; [Lamphere, Bradley A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Fraser, DF (corresponding author), Siena Coll, Dept Biol, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA.",fraser@siena.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0108365, EF-0623632]","We thank Ronnie Hernandez (Simla research station), Daren Bhawanie of Ramdeen Estate (Ramdeen Stream), and our laboratory and field assistants: Sarah Beaudin, Dave Herasimtchuck, Pierson Hill, Ramon and Jose Rodriguez, Ephraim Farfan, and Kelley Malchan.

One might therefore expect snail assemblages to be equilibrial and structured by interspecific interactions such as competition. If competition is strong and persistent throughout an assemblage, then it should manifest as density compensation (a negative correlation in population density between competitors) and be most pronounced for species pairs that are morphologically similar, as they should compete most strongly for resources. We assessed the degree to which terrestrial snails in the LEF exhibit density compensation, from both spatial and temporal perspectives. In general, density compensation was weak, especially from a spatial perspective. Moreover, the degree of density compensation was not significantly associated with dissimilarity in body size or shell shape. These results suggest that external factors such as predation or disturbance probably maintain population densities at low enough levels that the effects of interspecific competition do not become intense or persistent enough to mold patterns of assemblage structure for terrestrial snails.","[Bloch, Christopher P.] Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Bloch, CP (corresponding author), Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA.",cbloch@bridgew.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, DEB 0218039]","This research was supported by grants BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, and DEB 0218039 from NSF to the Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies, University of Puerto Rico, and to the International Institute of Tropical Forestry, USDA Forest Service, as part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Program in the Luquillo Experimental Forest.

Only the first two hypotheses have been fairly well studied. To test the predator-removal hypothesis as a force determining IGP in avian predators, we performed a field experiment to simulate the presence of an IG predator (eagle owl Bubo bubo dummy) in the surrounding of the nests of four potential IG prey (black kite Milvus migrans, red kite Milvus milvus, booted eagle Aquila pennata and common buzzard Buteo buteo). To discard the possibility that an aggressive reaction towards the eagle owl was not related to the presence of the IG predator, we also presented a stuffed tawny owl Strix aluco, which is a potential competitor but cannot be considered an IG predator of the studied diurnal raptors considered in the experiment. While almost always ignoring the tawny owl, raptors chiefly showed an interspecific aggressive behaviour towards their IG predator. Our results seem to support the predator-removal hypothesis, as the IG prey may take advantage of the diurnal inactivity of the IG predator to remove it from their territory. However, the recorded behaviour may be also considered as a special variety of mobbing (i.e. a prey's counter-strategy against its predator), where the mobber is sufficiently powerful to escalate predator harassment into deliberate killing attempts. In their turn, eagle owls can respond with an IG predatory behaviour aimed at removing IG prey species which are highly aggressive mobbers.","[Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo] Univ Evora, LabOr Lab Ornithol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo] Univ Evora, Inst Mediterranean Agr & Environm Sci, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Lourenco, Rui; Penteriani, Vincenzo; del Mar Delgado, Maria] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Penteriani, Vincenzo] Univ Helsinki, Zool Museum, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [del Mar Delgado, Maria] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Marchi-Bartolozzi, Michela] Bourne Bridge Cottages, Little Abington, Cambridge CB21 6AN, England","Lourenco, R (corresponding author), Univ Evora, LabOr Lab Ornithol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",ruifazendalourenco@gmail.com,"Lourenco, Rui F/B-7148-2012; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo/A-7851-2011","Lourenco, Rui F/0000-0001-7694-0478; Delgado, Maria del Mar/0000-0002-3009-738X; Rabaca, Joao E./0000-0002-2196-3709","Consejeria de Medio Ambiente, Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [700/2005/M/00./]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [BD/27434/2006]; Ministry of Education and Science, C.S.I.C.

These species were chosen based on their high abundance and overlapping diets. Juvenile mosquitofish and sailfin mollies, at a range of densities matching field estimates, were maintained in the presence of adult mosquitofish, sailfin mollies, and bluefin killifish to test for effects of competition and predation on juvenile survival and growth. The mesocosms held 1,200 1 of water and all conditions were set to simulate those in Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (ENP), USA. We placed floating mars of periphyton and bladderwort in each tank in standard volumes that matched field values to provide cover and to introduce invertebrate prey. Of 15 possible intra- and interspecific age-structured interactions, we found 7 to be present at the densities of these fish found in Shark River Slough marshes. Predation by adult mosquitofish on juvenile fish, including conspecifics, was the strongest effect observed. We also observed growth limitation in mosquitofish and sailfin molly juveniles from intra- and interspecific competition. When maintained at high densities, juvenile mosquitofish changed their diets to include more cladocerans and fewer chironomid larvae relative to low densities. We estimated size-specific gape limitation by adult mosquitofish when consuming juvenile mosquitofish and sailfin mollies. At high field densities, intraspecific competition might prolong the time period when juveniles are vulnerable to predation by adult mosquitofish. These results suggest that path analysis, or other techniques used to document food-web interactions, must include age-specific roles of these fishes.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; USGS Biol Resources Div, Everglades Nalt Pk Field Stn, Homestead, FL 33034 USA","Taylor, RC (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana, Dept Biol, POB 42451, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",,"Trexler, Joel C/I-5265-2012",,,,,47,38,40,1,30,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2001,127,1,,,,,143,152,,10.1007/s004420000575,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,413UA,WOS:000167629200016,28547165,,,,2021-09-24,

Orconectes rusticus, an invading crayfish species, is replacing O. propinquus and O. virilis in northern Wisconsin lakes. We test the hypothesis that periodicity of species interactions influences invasion success. Specifically, we test whether the intensity of interspecific competition varies on a diel cycle as a function of predation risk from visually feeding fishes. We tested for competitive exclusion in experimental pools (1.4 m in diameter) by determining habitat use of the three crayfishes in single- and three-species treatments. The pools contained equal area habitats of cobble, open sand, macrophytes in organic sediments (muck), and macrophytes in sand. In single-species treatments, all three species preferred cobble habitat during the day with a secondary preference for muck-macrophyte habitat. In three-species relative to single-species pools, O. rusticus increased daytime use of cobble habitat while O. virilis and O. propinquus reduced use of cobble and increased use of muck-macrophyte and sand-macrophyte habitats, respectively. Crayfish were evenly distributed among habitats at night. All three crayfishes altered habitat use between night and day, consistent with the need to forage at night and seek refuge from predation during the day. Results of a laboratory experiment giving crayfish the choice of feeding in the open or hiding in clean cobble in the presence and absence of a predator showed that crayfish chose habitat on the basis of food availability when predation risk was low and on the basis of shelter availability when risk was high. Data from experiments were consistent with habitat use observed in single-and mixed-species lakes, supporting our hypothesis that the interaction of competition with diel fluctuations in predation risk contributes to the ongoing O. rusticus invasion.","UNIV NOTRE DAME,DEPT BIOL SCI,NOTRE DAME,IN 46556",,,"Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021",,,,,44,120,123,1,29,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1994,75,7,,,,,2118,2126,,10.2307/1941615,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PK129,WOS:A1994PK12900025,,,,,2021-09-24,

Both Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stepehensi are container breeding mosquitoes and co-exist which may result in larval competition. In this study, interspecific competition between the above two species has been monitored under the laboratory conditions. Methods: Three sets of experiments were conducted with different stages of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi larvae. First two experiments were set up with I/II instar and III/IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi respectively in the ratios of 20:20, 20:40 and 40:20 in plastic bowls. For third set of experiment 20 IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti were put with equal number of I instar larvae of An. stephensi. Results: In the presence of food, 12.5-15 % mortality was recorded in I/II stage larvae of Ae. aegypti while in An. stephensi mortality ranged from 21-55%. Pupation commenced from Day 6 onwards in Ae. aegypti while in An. stephensi it commenced from Day 11 onwards. In the absence of food, there was no pupation in both the species but Ae. aegypti survived up to longer duration (7.5-18.5 days with 50% mortality) in comparison to An. stephensi (2-7 days with 50% mortality). When younger stages of An. stephensi (I/II) were put together with older stages of Ae. aegypti (III/IV) in the presence of food, pupation was completed in 85% Ae. aegypti population while there was 100% mortality in An. stephensi population. Interpretation & conclusion: The better survival and development of Ae. aegypti than An. stephensi under the same conditions exhibits interspecies competition showing competitive advantage of Ae. aegypti over An. stephensi. Further research is required to have a thorough understanding of the interaction between these two container inhabiting mosquito species in the nature.","[Haq, S.; Kumar, Gaurav; Dhiman, Ramesh C.] ICMR Natl Inst Malaria Res, Sect 8, New Delhi 110077, India","Dhiman, RC (corresponding author), ICMR Natl Inst Malaria Res, Sect 8, New Delhi 110077, India.",r.c.dhiman@gmail.com,"Dhiman, Ramesh/P-3836-2016","Dhiman, Ramesh/0000-0001-9844-9970",,,,25,0,0,0,0,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0972-9062,,,J VECTOR DIS,J.

In the sciences of population biology, however, the laboratory is often seen as a poor approximation of what occurs in nature. Results obtained in the field are usually more convincing. This raises special problems: it is much more difficult to obtain stable, repeatable results in the field, where environmental conditions vary out of the experimenter's control, than in the laboratory. We examine here how this problem affected an influential experimental research tradition in community ecology, the study of the ecology of the rocky seashores. In the 1960s, a handful of North-American ecologists, most notably Joseph Connell, Robert Paine and Paul Dayton, made the rocky seashores a model study system for experimenting in the field. Their experiments were deceptively simple: they removed species living on the seashore and described the resulting effects on the local ecology. These experiments exerted a deep influence on community ecology. They provided evidence for speculative developments concerning the theory of interspecific competition, the factors responsible for species richness and the ecology of food webs. They also stimulated novel conceptual developments. In particular, Paine developed the predation hypothesis, which states that the presence of predators can favour species richness, before introducing the keystone species concept, according to which some species exert disproportionate effects on ecological systems. More broadly, these experiments gave support to a methodological trend in favour of field experimentation. Only controlled perturbations in the field, it seemed, provided a reliable method to get insights into the structure of ecological communities. However, as experiments were continued in time and repeated in different sites, divergent results appeared. We analyse here how intertidal researchers coped with the variability of environmental conditions and tried to stabilize their results. In the process, they reconsidered not only their early conclusions, but also the exclusive status given to field experiments. Expanding on this case study, we discuss some significant differences between laboratory and field experiments.","[Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste; Porto, Franco; El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFHBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cambridge, England; [Porto, Franco; El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Natl Inst Sci & Technol Interdisciplinary & Trans, Salvador, BA, Brazil","Grodwohl, JB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Hist Philosophy & Biol Teaching Lab LEFHBio, Salvador, BA, Brazil.; Grodwohl, JB (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cambridge, England.",jb.grodwohl@gmail.com,"El-Hani, Charbel/Q-1364-2019","grodwohl, jean-baptiste/0000-0003-1445-8277",,,,61,2,2,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0391-9714,1742-6316,,HIST PHIL LIFE SCI,Hist.

We report findings from such experiments assessing competitive interactions among three species of parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Aplielinidae) of the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia argentifolii Bellows & Perring (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), a pestiferous species of worldwide importance. The parasitoids used in the study (Encarsia pergandiella Howard, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet, and Encarsia formosa Gahan) encompass the range of life histories found within Aphelinidae, and they exhibit a high degree of niche overlap. The objectives of our studies were ( I) to investigate the occurrence of interspecific competition among the whitefly parasitoids, (2) to quantify shifts in resource utilization patterns as influenced by experimental manipulations of the parasitoid assemblage and (3) to assess the impact of interspecific competition on the ability of the parasitoids to suppress their host populations. Field cages enclosing cotton plants were inoculated with whitefly by releasing adults at either a high or a low rate followed by releases of all possible combinations of the parasitoid species (including a no-parasitoid release control). The treatments were replicated three and four times each in 1996 and 1997. The presence of interspecific competitors reduced population growth rates of E. formosa and E. pergandiella but not the population growth rate of E. mundus. The spatial distribution of parasitism by E. pergandiella along the vertical axis of cotton plants differed in the multiple species treatments compared to the single species treatments. Changes in parasitoid activity in the presence of competitors may reduce potentially adverse effects of competition and promote species coexistence. Only releases of E. formosa together with E. pergandiella resulted in lower levels of host mortality than would be expected based on observed mortality by individual species. Our results demonstrate competitive interactions among three parasitoids of B. argentifolii under field manipulations but indicate that, in most cases, competitive interactions among parasitoids do not affect host population suppression.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Biol Control Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; USDA, APHIS PPQ, Mission Plant Protect Ctr, Mission, TX 78573 USA","Bogran, CE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Biol Control Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,96,76,82,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2002,83,3,,,,,653,668,,10.2307/3071871,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,523QY,WOS:000173967500008,,,,,2021-09-24,

Previous studies showed that the competitive displacement occurs rapidly and is facilitated by clumped insect resources. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of displacement is primarily due to differences in the ability of each species to exploit insect resources. (1) These species show nearly complete diet overlap. (2) Insects are a limiting resource for both geckos as evidenced by positive demographic effects with increased insect abundance. (3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris. (4) This reduced resource acquisition translates into significant reductions in the body condition, fecundity, and survivorship of L. lugubris individuals. (5) Evidence for interference (and other) mechanisms does not account for these negative demographic effects on L. lugubris. Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for L. lugubris, with increasing L. lugubris density having negligible effect on H. frenatus, mirroring the asymmetry of the large-scale displacement. The superior harvesting ability of H. frenatus is most pronounced when insects are clumped spatially and temporally, and is attributable to a variety of species-specific traits such as their larger body size, faster running speed, and reduced intraspecific interference while foraging. We conclude that clumped resources can increase interspecific exploitation competition, and this mechanism may contribute to species turnover when human environmental alterations redistribute resources.","UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, DEPT BIOL 0116, LA JOLLA, CA 92117 USA",,,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Petren, Kenneth/0000-0002-7936-6042",,,,44,222,237,1,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1996,77,1,,,,,118,132,,10.2307/2265661,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TR079,WOS:A1996TR07900014,,,,,2021-09-24,

We addressed this question in a temporary-pond community where the broken-striped newt Notophthalmus viridescens doralis is known to act as a keystone predator on larval anurans. We independently manipulated the initial density of adult Notophthalmus (two or four) and the presence or absence of one adult Siren intermedia in a set of 20 artificial ponds to determine if this additional predator affected the ability of Notophthalmus to function as a keystone predator. Each pond received a diverse assemblage of larval anuran prey: a spring-breeding assemblage of 275 Rana utricularia, 100 Pseudacris crucifer and 25 Bufo americanus tadpoles, and a summer assemblage of 200 Hyla chrysoscelis and 150 Gastrophryne carolinensis tadpoles. Two additional ponds received neither predator, to assay the outcome of competition among the tadpoles. The effect of the salamander Siren on Notophthalmus survival and fecundity depended on the density of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren had no effect on survival, but at high newt density competition reduced the survival and growth rates of Notophthalmus. The density of Notophthalmus and the presence of Siren interacted to determine the fecundity of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren reduced Notophthalmus reproductive success by preying on larvae. At high newt density Siren indirectly enhanced reproductive success by reducing survival of adults, thus releasing larvae from intraspecific competition and cannibalism. Notophthalmus density had no effect on adult Siren survival or growth rate in this experiment, but other evidence indicates that competition with Notophthalmus reduces the growth rates of Siren. Notophthalmus acted as a keystone predator on the assemblage of spring-breeding anurans; it increased the number of metamorphs of the weak competitor Pseudacris crucifer by releasing them from interspecific competition. Siren preyed on tadpoles in a nonselective manner. An additive model was sufficient to describe the effects of Siren and initial density of Notophthalmus on the structure of the tadpole assemblage. In our system of experimental ponds, the strong interaction between Siren and Notophthalmus density did not extend its effects to lower trophic levels, and the direct and indirect effects of Siren did not alter the role of Notophthalmus as a keystone predator.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,,,,,,49,73,76,0,27,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1991,72,3,,,,,827,838,,10.2307/1940585,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FM084,WOS:A1991FM08400007,,,,,2021-09-24,

Programs to control invaders are common but gauging the effectiveness of such programs using carefully controlled, large-scale field experiments is rare, especially at higher trophic levels. Experimental manipulations coupled with long-term demographic monitoring can reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of interspecific competition among apex predators and suggest mitigation options for invasive species. We used a large-scale before-after control-impact removal experiment to investigate the effects of an invasive competitor, the barred owl (Strix varia), on the population dynamics of an iconic old-forest native species, the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Removal of barred owls had a strong, positive effect on survival of sympatric spotted owls and a weaker but positive effect on spotted owl dispersal and recruitment. After removals, the estimated mean annual rate of population change for spotted owls stabilized in areas with removals (0.2% decline per year), but continued to decline sharply in areas without removals (12.1% decline per year). The results demonstrated that the most substantial changes in population dynamics of northern spotted owls over the past two decades were associated with the invasion, population expansion, and subsequent removal of barred owls. Our study provides experimental evidence of the demographic consequences of competitive release, where a threatened avian predator was freed from restrictions imposed on its population dynamics with the removal of a competitively dominant invasive species.","[Wiens, J.

By conducting aquarium experiments, the habitat occupancy of P. fluviatilis was documented in the presence and absence of a predator (pike Esox lucius; size: 25.4 +/- 2.1 cm) and a potential competitor (ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus; size: 14.1 +/- 0.3 cm) fish species. Two P. fluviatilis individuals generally shared the same habitat. In the presence of a conspecific, P. fluviatilis favoured the structurally more-complex, artificial macrophyte habitat over the less-structured rock and sand habitat, which in turn were used equally. In the predator- and competitor treatments, P. fluviatilis seemed to adapt their habitat use to the habitat occupancy of E. lucius and G. cernuus in the Macrophyte vs. Rock and, in the predator treatment, also in the Macrophyte vs. Sand habitat combination, by increasingly occupying a habitat that was used less by the predator or competitor species, respectively. This behaviour suggests that P. fluviatilis tried to avoid the other fish species by choosing a, in some cases less preferred, predator- or competitor-free habitat. This study emphasizes the importance of biological interactions illustrated by the potential of predation risk and competition to structure fish communities by influencing habitat use at small spatial scales.","[Henseler, Christina; Nordstrom, Marie C.; Tornroos, Anna; Snickars, Martin; Bonsdorff, Erik] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Environm & Marine Biol, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland","Henseler, C (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Dept Environm & Marine Biol, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland.",christina.henseler@abo.fi,"Nordstrom, Marie C./C-8956-2012","Nordstrom, Marie C./0000-0001-5763-1813; Henseler, Christina/0000-0001-9777-7753; Snickars, Martin/0000-0001-9168-7474",Abo Akademi University Foundation; Horizon 2020 (European Union),Abo Akademi University Foundation; Horizon 2020 (European Union),,55,2,2,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

The common sea star, Asterias rubens (Linneaus), is a dominant indigenous predator in rocky subtidal habitats in eastern Canada, affecting community structure through sustained consumption of bivalve prey, mainly blue mussel, Mytilus edulis (Linneaus). Yet, considerable spatial and dietary overlaps with the indigenous rock crab, Cancer irroratus (Say), and introduced green crab, Carcinus maeneas (Linneaus), together with comparatively lower mobility in A. rubens, suggest the latter is poorly fit to compete with both crabs for M. edulis. A laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions for variably-sized M. edulis between small and large, 3-week starved A. rubens, and large C. irroratus or C. maenas (in one-on-one sea star versus crab face-offs) from southeastern Newfoundland. Mussel consumption in starved A. rubens, as well as four components of its natural feeding behaviour, were quantified over 75-h trials in relatively cold (similar to 4 to 5.5 degrees C) seawater representative of the current northern limit of C. maenas' distribution in the northwestern Atlantic. Results showed that starved A. rubens (1) prioritizes consumption, upon contacting mussel prey, over non-feeding activities such as responding to physical contacts initiated by crabs; (2) alters consumption and feeding behaviour under prolonged exposure to C. irroratus; and (3) increases movement in presence of green crab, more so in large than small sea stars. Overall, findings demonstrate that A. rubens' foraging decisions vary ontogenetically and with competitor's identity. Observed differences in consumption and feeding behaviour in A. rubens exposed to familiar (rock crab) or unfamiliar (green crab) competitors also suggest timing and frequency of encounters with competitors have the potential to alter feeding patterns throughout an organism's lifetime.","[St-Pierre, Anne P.; Gagnon, Patrick] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ocean Sci Ctr, Dept Ocean Sci, 0 Marine Lab Rd, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Moreland, Hali R.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, 232 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada","St-Pierre, AP (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ocean Sci Ctr, Dept Ocean Sci, 0 Marine Lab Rd, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",apsp66@mun.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI-Leaders Opportunity Funds); Research & Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador (Ignite RD); Department of Biology of Memorial University of Newfoundland,"We are grateful to D.

However, both the study and management of invasive prey have historically overlooked indirect effects. In southern California estuaries, introduction of the Asian nest mussel Arcuatula senhousia has been linked to profound changes in native bivalve assemblages, but the mechanisms of these interactions remain unclear. We performed three field experiments to assess the mechanisms of competition between Arcuatula and native bivalves, and evaluated the potential for Arcuatula to indirectly mediate native predator-prey dynamics. We found that Arcuatula reduces the diversity, abundance, and size of native bivalve recruits by preemptively exploiting space in surface sediments. When paired with native shallow-dwelling clams (Chione undatella and Laevicardium substriatum), Arcuatula reduces adult survival through overgrowth competition. However, Arcuatula also attracts native predators, causing apparent competition by indirectly increasing predation of native clams, especially for poorly defended species. Therefore, invasive prey can indirectly increase predation rates on native competitors by changing the behavior of shared native predators, but the magnitude of apparent competition strongly depends on the vulnerability of natives to predation. Interestingly, our results indicate that the vulnerability of invasive prey to predation can greatly exacerbate impacts on their native competitors. Our findings suggest that consideration of both direct and indirect effects of invasive prey, as well as native predator-prey relationships, should lead to more effective invasive species management.","[Castorani, Max C.

The organisms studied were two microzooplankton (MZP) predators competing for the phototrophic dinoflagellate prey Scrippsiella trochoidea. Since the smaller dinoflagellate predator Gyrodinium dominans was also potential prey for the larger predator, the tintinnid ciliate Favella ehrenbergii, the experimental system included the probability of intraguild predation (IGP). The development of the three species was studied in set-ups containing either one of the two predators or both together with their prey. The IG predator F. ehrenbergii grew at a mean rate of 0.77 d(-1) independent of the presence of the IG prey G. dominans. High grazing of the IG predator on the smaller IG prey was detected in treatments containing only the two predators. However, when all three species were present, the IG prey displayed significantly higher growth rates (0.42 d(-1)) compared to treatments containing only the IG prey as predator (0.32 d(-1)). The results of further experiments allowed the exclusion of mechanical or chemical signals induced by the IG predator being responsible for the observed increase in growth rate of IG prey. Live observations revealed that the IG predator rejected a significant proportion of its S. trochoidea catch after initial uptake. This behavior led to an immobilization of around 26% of the caught cells. We tested if this prey immobilization by the IG predator facilitated prey uptake by the IG prey and thus could be potentially responsible for the higher growth rates of the IG prey. Indeed, the smaller predator selected positively for immobilized prey and reacted with higher grazing and growth rates. Consequently, the IG prey benefitted from this commensalism between IG predator and IG prey and the strength of this pattern predominated IGP in our model system. As both predators co-occur in the same environment their feeding relationship could increase exploitation efficiency of common mobile prey items. Furthermore, such commensalism potentially opens a loophole for a stable coexistence of MZP predators despite their competition.","[Loeder, Martin Guenther Joachim; Boersma, Maarten; Kraberg, Alexandra Claudia; Aberle, Nicole; Wiltshire, Karen Helen] Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany","Loder, MGJ (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, POB 180, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany.",Martin.Loeder@awi.de,"Aberle, Nicole/C-7366-2014; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013; Wiltshire, Karen H./N-9494-2017","Aberle, Nicole/0000-0003-3254-5710; Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X; Kraberg, Alexandra/0000-0003-2571-2074",Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research,"This study was part of a PhD thesis at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research and we are grateful for the funding.

Because snails share similar diets, these interactions have been interpreted as the result of exploitative competition, but they could also result from intraguild predation. Here we present three experiments aimed at testing the hypothesis that interspecific interactions among three species of freshwater gastropod (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta and Stagnicola elodes) are mediated by intraguild egg predation. Foraging trials, conducted in a laboratory, showed that some snails readily prey on eggs, but the extent of egg predation depended on both the identity of the snail predator and the identity of the egg mass. Of the three species considered, Stagnicola had the largest effect on egg mortality and Physa had no effect on egg mortality. Foraging trials also showed that the eggs of Physa were the most vulnerable to predators and that the eggs of Stagnicola were largely invulnerable. A study conducted in large outdoor mesocosms assessed the occurrence of egg mortality in an environment of more extensive spatial scale and complexity. The results largely mirrored those of the laboratory study, with Stagnicola being the most voracious predator and the eggs of Physa being most vulnerable to predation. The reproductive success of Physa and Stagnicola raised in sympatry and allopatry was assessed in a mesocosm study conducted over three months. Recruitment of both species was depressed in sympatry, but patterns of growth in the survivors suggest contrasting mechanisms of suppression: Physa suppressed Stagnicola via exploitative competition, but Stagnicola suppressed Physa via egg predation. These experiments support the hypothesis that freshwater snail assemblages are structured by strong interspecific interactions and that a rich interplay of egg predation and interspecific competition underlie interactions among the members of this guild.","Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA","Turner, AM (corresponding author), Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA.",aturner@clarion.edu,,,,,,41,23,23,0,14,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2007,116,11,,,,,1895,1903,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15883.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,236BT,WOS:000251278700012,,,,,2021-09-24,

In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whole costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a trait-mediated interaction (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.","Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 96516 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Plant Soil & Insect Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Bolnick, DI (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",danbolnick@mail.utexas.edu,"Preisser, Evan/C-3469-2013; Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015","Preisser, Evan/0000-0002-8737-5619; Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296",,,,37,91,92,1,73,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2005,86,10,,,,,2771,2779,,10.1890/04-1249,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971DP,WOS:000232361800022,,,,,2021-09-24,

Recent models examining the ways in which spatial pattern in the landscape will influence the outcome of species interactions assume a trade-off between colonization ability and competitive ability in the interacting species. We tested for differential colonization and competitive ability in two interacting species of wolf spider (Hogna helluo and Pardosa milvina) which co-occur in agricultural and early successional habitats in the eastern USA. We conducted our research in replicated experimental soybean plots in which we created islands of enhanced habitat by supplementing natural litter and enhancing weed growth. Our experimental manipulations were repeated once for each of the two spider species: (1) spiders added, (2) prey attractants (composted vegetable waste) added, (3) spiders and prey attractants added, and (4) one control, for a total of eight subplots. We replicated the experiment six times, three times each in conventionally tilled fields and conservation tilled fields. We censused these plots at the end of the summer and found that conspecific addition significantly elevated numbers of one species (H. helluo) but not the other (P. milvina). These findings were consistent with our predictions that H. helluo is limited in colonization ability when compared to P. milvina, The addition of prey attractants significantly elevated numbers of both species, but the effect was far stronger for the superior colonist (P. milvina). This indicates that P. milvina is able to track resource abundance (both habitat structure and prey), a trait correlated with colonization ability. We found no strong evidence for a negative effect of H. helluo addition on numbers of P. milvina, as would be predicted if H. helluo strongly competed with or significantly preyed upon P, milvina. Body condition of P, milvina was lowest in subplots with higher numbers of H. helluo, indicating that H. helluo may have influenced the foraging success of P. milvina. We also found a strong and unexpected effect of the context of the plots (background tillage regime) on numbers of P. milvina, with there being approximately twice the P. milvina in the subplots in conventionally tilled fields.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Marshall, SD (corresponding author), Hiram Coll, Dept Biol, JH Barrow Field Stn, Hiram, OH 44234 USA.",marshallsd@hiram.edu,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305",,,,36,56,58,0,37,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2000,81,12,,,,,3341,3349,,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,387QZ,WOS:000166134400008,,,,,2021-09-24,

In northern Wisconsin lakes, the invading crayfish Orconectes rusticus is replacing O. virilis, the native, and O. propinquus, a previous invader. We tested the impacts of interspecific competition for food and of nonconsumptive effects of predation by largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, on growth and mortality of these three species. In competition experiments, O. virilis grew less, and O. propinquus suffered increased mortality in the presence of O, rusticus relative to single-species treatments. Orconectes rusticus was unaffected by the presence of congeners. In experiments testing nonconsumptive effects of predation, O. virilis growth declined substantially in the presence of largemouth bass, O, rusticus growth declined slightly, and O. propinquus growth was unaffected. Mortality of all three crayfishes increased in the presence of largemouth bass, with O. virilis experiencing the greatest and O. rusticus the least mortality. To explore how competition, predation, and their interaction influence species replacements, we compared a fitness index (mortality/growth = mu/g) among species across biotic interaction domains: no interaction, intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, predation by fish, fish predation with competition, and predation risk with competition. In three of six domains, O. virilis and O. propinquus had somewhat similar mu/g, but reversals in I mu/g rank between O. virilis and O. propinquus among domains occurred. These reversals are consistent with lack of unidirectionality of species replacements observed where O. virilis and O. propinquus distributions overlap. In all four interspecific interaction domains, O. rusticus had the lowest mu/g (indicating greatest fitness), which is consistent with observed unidirectional replacement of O, propinquus and O. virilis by O. rusticus. Whereas some fish management strategies might reverse the replacement of O. virilis by O. propinquus, no realistic interaction domain is likely to reverse replacement of the native species by O. rusticus.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Hill, AM (corresponding author), NE Louisiana Univ, Dept Biol, Monroe, LA 71209 USA.",,"Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021",,,,,72,143,151,4,68,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In a divided experimental pond, target densities of YOY bass and juvenile bluegill were subjected to different densities of bass and bluegill neighbors to examine the dependence of juvenile growth on fish density and species composition. After 7 wk, clear differences in growth rates of both species existed across densities, Bass growth was reduced in the presence of both bass and bluegill neighbors, whereas bluegill growth was primarily affected intraspecifically. Bluegill had strong competitive effects on bass despite substantial resource partitioning between the two species. These effects were mediated through changes in the size-structure of important invertebrate prey in both open water and vegetation habitats. Data collected from a set of seven lakes in Michigan indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile bluegill and YOY bass is an important process in natural populations, However, once bass become piscivorous, bluegill become a significant resource for bass. As a result, bass populations are split into two functionally distinct stages that respond differently across a gradient of bluegill density. Because of the competitive stage between predator and prey, dynamics of the interaction differ from predictions based on classical predator-prey or competition theory.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,WK KELLOGG BIOL STN,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060; UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720","OLSON, MH (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,CTR LIMNOL,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,"Osenberg, Craig/M-9904-2013; Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013","Mittelbach, Gary/0000-0001-6971-9273; Osenberg, Craig/0000-0003-1918-7904",,,,62,138,142,1,61,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1995,76,6,,,,,1758,1771,,10.2307/1940708,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RQ248,WOS:A1995RQ24800006,,,,,2021-09-24,

On exposing pairs of triclad species to D. cephalotes, significantly more P. felina than Ph. vitta were consumed, whereas similar numbers were eaten in each of the other two triclad combinations. Cannibalism and interspecific predation by triclad species were not observed. It is concluded that predation is unlikely to have a major influence in determining the observed distribution and abundance of triclad species in a Welsh study stream which harbours low numbers of effective predators. The de Wit model of competition was used to examine the competitive relationships between Ph. vitta, and C. alpina and P. felina, using chironomids or tubificid worms as food. In mixed cultures of Ph. vitta and P. felina fed on tubificids a stable equilibrium existed within the range of relative densities used in the experiments, whereas Ph. vitta was competitively superior to C. alpina in cultures fed on each of the food types, and to P. felina fed on chironomids. However, in theory, an equilibrium could occur when 10 or 6-7 times as many Ph. vitta as P. felina and C. alpina respectively are in the culture, when intraspecific rather than interspecific competition would become more important. Where the three triclad species coexist in the Welsh study stream, they are in similar numbers. This could imply that food is not limiting, with no consequent interspecific competition, or that the laboratory experiments were too simplistic to allow any interpretation of the field situation.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUT BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,1,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR 15,1991,211,1,,,,,43,50,,10.1007/BF00008615,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,FG274,WOS:A1991FG27400005,,,,,2021-09-24,

Many freshwater ecosystems are resource-limited and both intra-and interspecific competitiveness is a common requirement to gain and defend resources necessary for reproduction. Although predation risk is an important selective force affecting behavioral decisions, little is known about the impact of predation risk on interspecific competition. Here, we investigate whether chemically mediated predation risk affects interspecific territorial aggression by the freshwater cichlid Pelvicachromis taeniatus. In our experiments, territorial P. taeniatus males were visually confronted with a territorial intruder: a heterospecific, sympatric cichlid (Benitochromis nigrodorsalis) which generally induced aggression in P. taeniatus. Predation risk for P. taeniatus was simulated by a concurrent release of conspecific chemical alarm cues. In control treatments, no chemical cues, dissolved heterospecific alarm cues, or aliquots of distilled water were provided during these aggressive encounters. The results show that interspecific aggression of territorial male P. taeniatus is significantly decreased under predation risk compared to the control treatments. This suggests that interspecific competition becomes less intense under concurrent predation risk. As this process could hinder competitive exclusion, predation risk may indirectly promote and stabilize biodiversity in natural ecosystems.","[Meuthen, Denis; Baldauf, Sebastian A.; Bakker, Theo C.

Hence, competition is often considered to be one of the primary determinants of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. In this paper, we investigate how the native Vespa crabro and the recently introduced Vespa velutina show some degree of niche differentiation that potentially minimizes their interspecific competition, the two dimensions investigated here being seasonal activity patterns and preferences for food. These two species share common characteristics: they are closely related, live in the same areas, belong to the same guild (predators), exploit the same kind of food sources, and exhibit a similar annual life cycle. Considering all these similarities, interspecific competition may occur if the two species exhibit identical seasonal phenologies. Our data show that their seasonal phenologies overlap to some extent probably due to biological constraints common to Vespinae. The shifts in time observed here allow the hornet species to not directly compete for food sources at the same time. It does not however exclude indirect competition, especially in a 'first-come, first-served' fashion.","[Monceau, K.; Maher, N.; Bonnard, O.; Thiery, D.] INRA, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, ISVV, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France; [Monceau, K.; Maher, N.; Bonnard, O.; Thiery, D.] Univ Bordeaux, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, Bordeaux Sci Agro, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France","Thiery, D (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Sante & Agr Vignoble 1065, ISVV, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France.",thiery@bordeaux.inra.fr,,"Monceau, Karine/0000-0003-3786-1835",France Agrimer [797/2007-2010]; Region AquitaineRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine; INRA,"This research was financially supported by France Agrimer # 797/2007-2010, a grant from Region Aquitaine and INRA.

We experimentally examined interactions between two microparasites (entomopathogenic nematodes) isolated from sandy grassland soils of coastal California: Heterorhabditis marelatus (Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema feltiae (Steinernematidae). Heterorhabditis marelatus drives trophic cascades by attacking root- and stem-boring ghost moth caterpillars (Hepialus californicus, Hepialidae), thereby indirectly protecting bush lupine shrubs (Lupinus arboreus, Fabaceae). Extensive field surveys demonstrated sympatric overlap in microhabitat use under lupine canopies and similar mean prevalence of the two nematode species. Using a response-surface design in the laboratory, we varied relative and absolute microparasite densities to test for competitive outcomes within an evolutionary naive host, larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae), and within the native host Hepialus californicus. Independent of conspecific or interspecific density, S. feltiae dominated as expected over H. marelatus within the naive Galleria, but S. feltiae infected hosts at low frequency and showed lower reproductive fitness than H. marelatus within native Hepialus hosts. Contrary to studies that demonstrate the pairwise dominance of steinernematid over heterorhabditid species in laboratory hosts, host resistance to S. feltiae may provide a mechanism for coexistence of multiple microparasite species. We hypothesize that the ubiquitous field prevalence and rapid life history of S. feltiae imply its use of widespread, abundant but small-bodied hosts and indicate the lack of direct competition with H. marelatus in the Hepialus-Lupinus trophic cascade.","[Gruner, Daniel S.; Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kolekar, Arunima] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [McLaughlin, John P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Gruner, DS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0620475],"We thank Evan Preisser, Karthik Ram, the Gruner lab, and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on the manuscript; Betsy Harbert and Wei-Chen Hsu for technical assistance; and the National Science Foundation for financial support (DEB-0620475).

Temporary ponds are excellent arenas for the study of food webs because they are discrete communities that can be mimicked in containers that approach the realism of natural habitats. Artificial ponds permit repeatable initial conditions and sufficient replication of independent experimental units in complex experiments to test hypotheses about the control of structure and function in natural communities. I used a combination of observations of natural ponds, ''experimental natural history'' of artificial ponds in my study area, and controlled experiments in an array of 144 replicate ponds to develop, then test, hypotheses about how the structures of food webs are regulated. Understanding food webs begins with population biology. Amphibians use the aquatic larval stage of their biphasic life cycle to exploit ephemeral opportunities for growth and development in temporary ponds. The regulation of population density and the fitness of individuals are determined by complex interactions among competition, predation, and uncertainty in the length of the time ponds retain water. Exponential models of density-dependent recruitment relate the number of metamorphs to the input of eggs into ponds without predators. Extensions of these models include interspecific competition and predation. The addition of predation to these systems has three effects. (1) Predators can reduce, even eliminate, prey. There are species-specific differences among co-occurring prey in their risks of predation, and these risks change with relative body sizes of predator and prey. (2) individuals may evoke an inducible defense that reduces their risk by either decreasing active foraging or developing morphological adaptations, such as changes in the coloration and shape of tails. These defenses may entail costs in body size and timing of metamorphosis. (3) Finally, mortality due to predators may reduce competition, thereby benefiting the population of the prey by permitting individuals that escape predation to grow rapidly enough to escape drying ponds. The order of arrival of species at breeding ponds has an impact on their own success as well as having a lasting impact on the success of species that arrive later. Such priority effects may result from size-specific changes in trophic connections or indirect effects between species mediated through the food web. Anurans can have strong effects on the partitioning of the flow of nutrients through the phytoplankton vs. the periphyton. This effect on partitioning of production can then have strong effects on zooplankton and insects. Salamanders can play the role of keystone, or critical, predators by affecting the structure of the assemblages of zooplankton and anurans that determine much of the dynamics of nutrient flows within food webs in temporary ponds.","UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT BIOL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA","Wilbur, HM (corresponding author), UNIV VIRGINIA, MT LAKE BIOL STN, GILMER HALL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA.",,,,,,,172,332,344,7,179,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1997,78,8,,,,,2279,2302,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2279:EEOFWC]2.0.CO;2,,,24,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YK726,WOS:A1997YK72600001,,,,,2021-09-24,

Surfbirds Aphriza virgata (Gmelin) and gulls, primarily western gull Larus occidentalis Audubon and glaucous-winged gull Larus glaucescens Naumann, occur each winter in flocks of greater-than-or-equal-to 40-100 individuals along the coast of California. On their wintering grounds, they feed almost exclusively in the intertidal zone and consume large numbers of gooseneck barnacles. A bird-exclusion experiment showed that winter feeding by shorebirds and gulls significantly reduced the abundance of Pollicipes barnacles in plots accessible to birds compared to plots from which birds had been excluded. However, predation by birds was found to be both spatially and temporally patchy. Predation by birds may account for the distribution and abundance of gooseneck barnacles along the coast of northern California.

Both species are known to compete directly through egg cannibalism and indirectly through the density-dependent release of allelopathic chemicals. To better characterize these indirect interactions, recent work has focused on quantifying the per-capita effects of intraspecific chemical competition. However, the effects of interspecific chemical competition in this system have not previously been estimated. We used experimental microcosms to examine how interspecific chemical secretions affected the reproductive activity and development time of laboratory populations of T. castaneum and T. confusum. We created replicated habitats containing flour medium that had been occupied and chemically 'conditioned' by one of the two beetle species across a range of densities, then examined how beetles of the other species responded in terms of the number of eggs laid by females and, separately, the development time of offspring. We found that T. castaneum fecundity was reduced when beetles experienced flour conditioned by T. confusum. In contrast, fecundity of T. confusum was largely unaffected by flour conditioned by T. castaneum. Additionally, we found that interspecific conditioning decreased development times for beetles of both species, particularly the development of larvae to pupae. Our results indicate that interspecific chemical competition impacts the life history of Tribolium species and suggests that models incorporating chemical competition may more accurately describe the biology of flour beetle communities.","[Bullock, Marissa; Legault, Geoffrey; Melbourne, Brett A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Legault, Geoffrey] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Coker Hall,120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Legault, G (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.; Legault, G (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Coker Hall,120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",legault@unc.edu,,"Legault, Geoffrey/0000-0003-2136-587X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1457660],"M.B. and G.L. conceived of the project.

We focussed on the mechanisms by which an increase of a mutant with a higher growth rate and/or lower mortality leads to decreases in original phenotypes, with a particular emphasis on ''predator-mediated (apparent) competition''. The bacterial population was cultured together with the protozoan population over a long period of time. These were contrasted with single-species control cultures of E. coli (i.e., without predator) experiencing high density-independent mortality from continual dilution of the population, and also a population with strong density-dependent regulation arising from intraspecific competition. The long-term cultures of predator and prey revealed the following changes: predator density increased for some time after inoculation; correspondingly, the specific growth rate of prey increased, and mutants with the long-cell form (which experience low predation rate) appeared and increased in frequency in the population. Comparison of these results with results from control cultures, suggests that predator-mediated competition existed between mutants and the original types in the predator-prey system, i.e., increases in densities of mutants with higher growth rate and/or lower predation rate in the prey population enhanced the predator equilibrium density, which in turn exerted higher predation pressure on the original prey which then decreased in abundance.","TOHOKU UNIV,INST BIOL,DEPT SCI,AOBA KU,SENDAI,MIYAGI 980,JAPAN",,,,,,,,44,12,12,2,9,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1994,71,1,,,,,24,34,,10.2307/3546168,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PQ835,WOS:A1994PQ83500003,,,,,2021-09-24,

However, we argue that using a pluralistic approach that combines field manipulations with observations, laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling will prove fruitful for understanding natural systems.",,"HOM, CL (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT MATH,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,61,1,1,1,2,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,JOHNSON CITY,"EAST TENNESSEE STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, BOX 70726, JOHNSON CITY, TN 37614-0726",0018-0831,,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,DEC,1991,47,4,,,,,460,473,,,,,14,Zoology,Zoology,GU137,WOS:A1991GU13700009,,,,,2021-09-24,

The relationships between growth rate, survival, and temperature may thus be important for predicting biological responses to climate change. Although it is well known that growth rates and survival are affected by competition and predation in addition to temperature, the combined effect of these factors on growth rates, survival, and size structure has rarely been investigated simultaneously in the same ecological system. To address this question, we conducted experiments on the larvae of two species of damselflies and determined the temperature dependence of growth rate, survival, and cohort size structure under three scenarios of increasing ecological complexity: no competition, intraspecific competition, and interspecific competition. In one species, the relationship between growth rate and temperature became steeper in the presence of competitors, whereas that of survival remained unchanged. In the other species, the relationship between growth rate and temperature was unaffected by competitive interactions, but survival was greatly reduced at high temperatures in the presence of interspecific competitors. The combined effect of competitive interactions and temperature on cohort size structure differed from the effects of these factors in isolation. Together, these findings suggest that it will be challenging to scale up information from single-species laboratory studies to the population and community level.","[Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor; Johansson, Frank] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, BE-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Johansson, Frank] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Nilsson-Ortman, V (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",viktor.j.nilsson@gmail.com,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",FWOFWO; KULeuven research fundKU Leuven; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas,"Financial support to R.

In this study, the intra- and interspecific competition between two congeneric sandy beach amphipods Bathyporeia pilosa and B. sarsi was examined by means of a two-way factorial mesocosm experiment. The amount of natural food resources as well as population densities of B. pilosa and B. sarsi were manipulated in order to investigate whether firstly, the species compete for food, and secondly, whether crowding effects, such as damaging encounter competition, are present within and between both Bathyporeia species. The absence of food negatively influenced survival and recruitment and enhanced aggressive behavior in the B. sarsi population, while there was no influence of the absence of food in the B. pilosa population. In the field, B. pilosa is occurring high in the intertidal where food supply is low, while B. sarsi is occurring in the mid-intertidal where food supply is higher. Hence, B. pilosa is more adapted to low food conditions than B. sarsi. Although an increased intraspecific density stimulated encounter competition within the B. sarsi population, no evidence of interspecific competition was found in this study. This first report on encounter competition for the deposit-feeding amphipod Bathyporeia sarsi suggests that zonation patterns of the two amphipods may be the result of the combined influence of species-specific physiological restrictions and biotic interactions within the B. sarsi population, indicating that on dissipative beaches, biotic interactions may be more common than generally considered.

Delaying introduction of T. sinensis relative to normal egg hatch phenology reduced mortality for T. angustipennis, but did not affect its rate of development.

We performed field-cage experiments to detect the presence of both intra- and interspecific competition among adults of two common, grass-feeding grasshoppers, Ageneotettix deorum (Scudder) and Amphitornus coloradus (Thomas). Based on increased mortality and lowered fecundity at higher densities, strong evidence for intraspecific competition exists for both species. Interspecific competition was weaker than intraspecific competition in this study. When interspecific competition existed, it was asymmetric in its effect, with the larger species (A. coloradus) negatively impacting the smaller one (A. deorum). Although there was little evidence for interspecific effects on mortality, egg production was impacted in a size-dependent, asymmetric manner between the two species. Significant density-dependent depression of available food was observed for A. coloradus, the larger species. Experiments were run at high densities (10-30 individuals per square meter), levels only irregularly reached under natural conditions (either in sporadic patches or overall about every 10-12 yr).

The consequences of omnivory have been studied theoretically, but empirical studies are still lacking. Omnivory is nevertheless common in nature and omnivorous predators coexist with specialists in many ecosystems, even when they are intraguild predators. This type of association is also common in agroecosystems in which biological control strategies are used. Our study provides an example of the outcome of such an association in the context of biological control of the invasive pest Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera) in a tomato agroecosystem. The two natural enemies involved, that is, a specialist (Stenomesius japonicus (Hymenoptera) parasitoid) and an omnivore (Macrolophus pygmaeus (Hemiptera) predator), were able to coexist for 3months in our experimental cages in the absence of metacommunity mechanisms (i.e., emigration and recolonization), contrary to theoretical expectations. However, they negatively affected each other's population dynamics. We found that spatial resource segregation was not a mechanism that promoted their coexistence. Regarding pest control, the specialist and omnivorous natural enemies were found to exhibit complementary functional traits, leading to the best control when together. Mechanisms that may have promoted the coexistence of the two species as well as consequences with regard to the inoculative biological control program are discussed.","[Chailleux, Anais] ISRA UCAD IRD, Biopass, Dakar, Senegal; [Chailleux, Anais] CIRAD, UPR HortSys, Montpellier, France; [Chailleux, Anais] InVivo AgroSolut, Paris, France; [Droui, Anthony; Bearez, Philippe; Desneux, Nicolas] Univ Cote dAzur, INRA French Natl Inst Agr Res, CNRS, UMR 1355 7254,Inst Sophia Agrobiotech, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France","Chailleux, A (corresponding author), IRD Joint Res Ctr, Biopass, Dakar, Senegal.",chailleux.anais@gmail.com,"Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013","Chailleux, Anais/0000-0001-5653-8019",ANRTFrench National Research Agency (ANR); InVivo AgroSolutions; French Ministry of Agriculture [10063]; CASDAR project [10063],"ANRT; InVivo AgroSolutions; French Ministry of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 10063; CASDAR project, Grant/Award Number: 10063",,80,10,11,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In this study, we used a manipulative experiment to test the effects of habitat degradation on competition between two planktivorous, coral-dwelling damselfishes, Chrysiptera parasema and Dascyllus melanurus. Experimental reefs were constructed with either healthy (100% live) or degraded (10% live) Acropora longicyathus coral, stocked with varying densities of these two fish species, and monitored for two months. On healthy habitat, the mortality of C. parasema was density dependent, and increased substantially in the presence of the dominant interspecific competitor D. melanurus. In contrast, on reefs where habitat was degraded, C. parasema mortality was highly variable, density independent, and was no longer influenced by the presence of dominant competitor D. melanurus. Behavioral observations revealed that agonistic interactions for both species increased with density on degraded habitat, but not on healthy habitat. In addition, on degraded reefs, both species displayed a reduced association with reef habitat and ventured further away from shelter with increasing densities of the dominant competitor D. melanurus. These results suggest that reduced habitat quality can have such a profound effect on reef fishes, that it eliminates density-dependent mortality and competitive dominance hierarchies, thereby substantially altering the mechanisms that structure reef fish communities.","[Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Bostrom-Einarsson, L (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",lisa.bostromeinarsson@my.jcu.edu.au,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/B-5436-2015; Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011; Bonin, Mary/H-3433-2012","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/0000-0003-4814-9552; Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Bonin, Mary/0000-0001-7249-0887","Australian Research Council through the Center of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia","We are grateful to E.

However, the mechanisms underlying environmental changes, such as a decrease in the relative abundance of native species, are poorly understood. Since the introduction of the ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), in Chile in the 1970s for biological control of aphids, a reduction in the relative abundance of the native ladybird beetle Eriopis connexa (Germar) has been noticed. To explore the role of cannibalism, intraguild predation (IGP) or competition as possible mechanisms that might increase dominance of H. variegata over E. connexa, several laboratory experiments were carried out. The native and the exotic species were very similar in their voracity and biotic interactions. Although H. variegata was able to maintain constant reproductive performance, E. connexa reproduction decreased at lower densities of aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The impacts of cannibalism, IGP, and competition exerted by these species were very symmetrical in both larvae and adults. We conclude that these biotic factors may not fully explain the increase in relative abundance of H. variegata. The higher sensitivity of E. connexa to prey patch size, along with other factors such as chemical-mediated negative interspecific interactions may be operating in alfalfa fields, changing the composition of associated coccinellid assemblages.","[Grez, A.

The coastal estuaries of Washington State, USA, provide appropriate habitat fur recently introduced green crab, yet these areas are important nursery grounds for Dungeness crab and contribute greatly to the coastal crab fishery. Juvenile Dungeness crabs are dependent on limited intertidal epibenthic shell for refuge habitat during early benthic life and experience increased mortality on open sand and mud as a result of predation by fish and birds, Early juveniles throughout the subtidal are similarly at risk due to predation by fish and especially adult conspecifics. Laboratory experiments and infrared video observations revealed that juvenile green crab displace Dungeness crab of equal size from shelters during one-on-one competition. Green crab also consistently win nocturnal foraging trials in which the species compete for fresh, damaged clams. Field and laboratory enclosure experiments show that juvenile Dungeness crab emigrate from oyster shell habitat as a result of competition and predation by adult green crab, Depending on the extent to which the two species overlap, interactions with the dominant nonindigenous species could have a negative influence on juvenile Dungeness crab survival and could conceivably impact recruitment to the fishery. However, current evidence indicates that the distribution of green crab in Washington State is far removed from nursery areas of Dungeness crab. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The competition hypothesis proposes that this pattern of habitat segregation reflects the effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection. To test this hypothesis we conducted field experiments that allowed the two species to select from among several habitats when alone and when together. We expected to find a lower proportion of each species in the habitat most associated with the other species, and a negative correlation between the demography and density of each species and the density of the competing species, but this was not the case. Interspecific competition did affect movement patterns of prairie voles. In the presence of meadow voles, net movement (immigration minus emigration) of prairie voles in high-cover habitats decreased and net dispersal of individuals from high- to low-cover habitats increased. Thus, our results indicated only a weak effect of competition on habitat selection. We suggest that other mechanisms, such as differences in habitat preference (or tolerance), differences in dispersal ability, and the advantage of first residency, need to be considered in conjunction with interspecific competition to explain the habitat segregation observed in these species.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Batzli, GO (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",,,,,,,28,13,15,0,4,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Field experiment 1 tested which species has a competitive advantage as larvae developing in water-filled tires. Densities and al availability of resources (leaf litter, which is a substrate for microorganisms fed upon by larvae) were manipulated in a factorial design. Contrary to previous laboratory experiments, A. albopictus was clearly the superior competitor in this tire environment, maintaining positive population growth at higher combined density and lower per capita resource availability than did A. aegypti. The primary determinant of success in this experiment was survivorship to adulthood, and A. aegypti only survived well in this environment when raised alone at low density, with high resource availability. Field experiment 2 tested whether this advantage for A. albopictus resulted from apparent competition mediated by shared protozoan parasites in the genus Ascogregarina. In field experiment 2, A. albopictus larvae had moderate to high levels of parasitism, but A. aegypti larvae were virtually free from Ascogregarina in all experimental tires, implying that Ascogregarina played little or no role in producing the advantage for A. albopictus in field experiment 1. Thus, apparent competition does not appear to be necessary to account for the replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus. As a first step toward understanding variation in the outcome of this invasion, numbers of Aedes immatures and masses of adults from field collected pupae (indicators of the intensity of competition) were compared for three sites with known histories of invasion by A. albopictus ana decline or A. aegypti. Differences among sites in both number of Aedes per container and masses of adults of both species were consistent with the hypothesis that intensity of competition varies among sites, and suggest that A. aegypti persists only at sites where interspecific competition is less intense. Resource competition among larvae appears to be sufficient to account for replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus in suburban and rural areas of South Florida, which may have been marginal habitats for A. aegypti.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Grp, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",,,,57,276,279,1,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1998,79,1,,,,,255,268,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0255:SIARAM]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YR740,WOS:000071525500023,,,,,2021-09-24,

The availability of small mammals in four different environmental types was also investigated by means of live-trapping and mark-and-recapture procedures. All snakes fed primarily on small mammals and lizards, whereas owls preyed essentially upon small mammals. A. noctua was also largely insectivorous. In general, diet composition of phylogenetically unrelated predators was similar (as shown by relatively high overlap estimates), and several prey taxa were eaten by all predators (including both owls and snakes). However, (i) interphyletic comparisons and (ii) multivariate statistical procedures revealed some interesting differences in predator diet composition. Owls were found to prey mainly upon small mammal taxa from semicultivated open grassy habitats, whereas snakes did so upon forest-associated small mammals. Correlation analyses confirmed this evidence. The potential for competition for food seems to be higher between phylogenetically related than between phylogenetically unrelated taxa, due to separation among groups in frequented macrohabitat and, possibly, also to daily activity rhythms. Food niche partitioning was more evident among owls than among snakes, in agreement with the fact that snakes, contrary to owls, are low-energy organisms that can survive on limited food resources.","UNIV ROMA LA SAPIENZA,DIPARTIMENTO BIOL ANIM & UOMO,I-00161 ROME,ITALY; CNR,CTR GENET EVOLUZIONIST,I-00161 ROME,ITALY",,,"CAPIZZI, DARIO/O-6431-2019; Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020","Capizzi, Dario/0000-0003-0871-9602",,,,71,55,59,1,18,GAUTHIER-VILLARS,PARIS,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS, FRANCE",1146-609X,,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

We investigated the population dynamics and competitive interactions of two Daphnia species in Gull Lake, Michigan. In each of 3 yr D. pulicaria was always common, while D. galeata mendotae became abundant only in late summer. The summer invasion of D. galeata mendotae was associated with a decline in abundance of D. pulicaria in some, but not all years. Decline of D. pulicaria was strongly predicted by the loss of oxygen from deep water during summer, which resulted in greater spatial overlap between the species, and by changes in the quality of the phytoplankton resources. We employed in situ enclosures to manipulate the density of each species and quantify the intensity of intra- and interspecific competition. Repeated competition experiments demonstrated that the relative exploitative ability of the species reversed from early to late summer. Strong interspecific competition was often observed, but its strength varied with juvenile or adult stage, and with season. Daphnia pulicaria juveniles were always affected strongly by interspecific effects: while D. galeata mendotae juveniles were impacted largely by intraspecific effects. The relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition on adults reversed from early to late summer for each species. The magnitude of intra- and interspecific effects on D. pulicaria adults was similar during early summer, but by late summer interspecific effects were much stronger than intraspecific effects. The reverse was true for D. galeata mendotae adults; interspecific effects greatly decreased in late summer. This seasonal shift in the nature of competitive interactions provides an explanation for seasonal succession in this Daphnia assemblage.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,WK KELLOGG BIOL STN,E LANSING,MI 48824","HU, SXS (corresponding author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,E LANSING,MI, USA.",,,,,,,94,88,91,0,47,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1995,76,7,,,,,2278,2294,,10.2307/1941702,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RX362,WOS:A1995RX36200028,,,,,2021-09-24,

We tested experimentally for interactions between mosquito larvae, Culiseta longiareolata, and green toad immatures, Bufo viridis, the two most abundant macrospecies of temporary pools in the Negev Desert, Israel. Since both appear to feed largely on periphyton, and since they co-occur in extremely high densities, competition for food may occur. 2. In artificial outdoor pools, we followed the fate of first-instar Culiseta larvae (50 per litre) and early-stage tadpoles (5 per litre) in the presence or absence of the other species over 1 month. These densities were well within the range of densities found in natural pools. We replicated each treatment five times. 3. Survival of neither species was affected by the other species. However, time to pupation in Culiseta was longer and pupal size was smaller in the presence of Bufo tadpoles. Similarly, tadpole weights were lower and the percentage of Bufo reaching metamorphosis by the end of the experiment was lower in the presence of Culiseta larvae. We attribute these mutual negative effects upon each other to interspecific competition. 4. Late-stage Culiseta larvae also preyed upon Bufo hatchlings in both field enclosure and laboratory experiments. This is the first demonstration of a mosquito larva as a natural predator of a vertebrate. The high predation rates indicate that Culiseta affects Bufo populations significantly via predation in nature. 5. These two surprising roles of a mosquito larva-a competitor and predator of a vertebrate-emphasize that how communities are organized may be misinterpreted by presuming particular roles for species based on taxonomic affiliation.","BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,BIOL CONTROL LAB,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL; UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUNITY ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","BLAUSTEIN, L (corresponding author), UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUNITY ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,58,53,63,2,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Birds and mammals significantly increased their cone harvest when the other group was experimentally prevented access to trees, and mammals harvested more cones when insects were removed from trees with an insecticide. These results suggest that stem- and cone-boring insects (primarily Dioryctria albovittella), birds (Clark's Nutcrackers, Pinyon Jays, and Scrub Jays), and mammals (cliff chipmunks and rock squirrels) compete for pinyon pine seeds. Additionally, insects affected the interaction between birds and mammals because the ratio of mammal to bird harvest increased up to 350-fold as insect cone consumption increased.

The three-species, the three two-species combinations, and one-species controls were used. The predictions from island biogeography and metapopulation theory that extinctions rates increase with decreasing patch size and increasing number of species present were also examined. Analyses of reproductive indices and population dynamics indicated that the species used similar resources and that interspecific competition operated during substantial parts of each year. The number of eggs per adult female (adult female egg ratio; E(A)) in the three species were positively related to each other, and concordant changes in the E(A)-values of pairs of species between subsequent sampling dates were significantly more common than discordant changes. There were negative relationships between E(A)-values and total Daphnia density in each species, but these were strong in one species only. Relative extinction rates (extinctions-population-1.year-1) were higher in experiments with three species initially present than in two-species experiments. No extinctions occurred in the one-species controls. Relative extinction rates were also higher in smaller than in larger volumes. The large species D. magna went extinct fewer times than the two smaller species D. pulex and D. longispina. In two-species experiments in volumes larger than 4 l, coexistence of both species after four years was the rule, in spite of interspecific competition. This is not consistent with the classical view that interspecific competition should lead to either niche differentiation or competitive exclusion, but it supports the view that environmental variability may promote coexistence of competing species. Although interspecific competition by itself may not be the most important factor determining the distribution of rockpool Daphnia, the finding that extinctions were most common in three-species experiments still indicates that competition may limit species richness in the rockpool system.","UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ZOOL, S-75122 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",,,,,,,,98,34,36,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1993,67,3,,,,,451,464,,10.2307/3545357,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LN449,WOS:A1993LN44900007,,,,,2021-09-24,

The purpose of this study was to examine this phenomenon. We tested the effects of an abiotic factor (pH) and two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition) on survival and growth to metamorphosis by larvae of two anurans (Hyla gratiosa and Hyla femoralis) in outdoor tanks. Two levels of pH (4.5 and 6.0) and three levels of density (0, 30, or 60 embryos per 580 L tank) of each species were arranged in a fractional factorial design and replicated three times. Larvae of H. gratiosa exhibited typical patterns of intraspecific density-dependent responses: as density increased, survival and size at metamorphosis decreased and larval period increased. The interactions of the abiotic factor and the biotic factors were complex in this experiment. The addition of H. femoralis at high pH caused decreased survival and increased larval period of H. gratiosa, but at low pH these negative effects were not detected. Variation in pH had no effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa. Interspecific competition from H. femoralis caused decreased size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa only at the high initial densities. Some of the responses of H. femoralis were different than those of H. gratiosa. In this species, intraspecific competition affected only the size at metamorphosis. Low pH increased the survival of H. femoralis, but had no effect by itself on any other trait. Increased conspecific density and pH interacted only in their effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. femoralis. Interspecific competition resulted in decreased size at metamorphosis but only increased larval period at the high initial densities. Interspecific competition at the high density interacted with pH to increase survival and size at metamorphosis at low pH in contrast to those results at high pH. Overall, the larval period was the response most strongly affected in H. gratiosa while for H. femoralis the size at metamorphosis was the most strongly affected. Hyla gratiosa had more negative impact on H. femoralis than vice versa. This may be due to the larger body size of H. gratiosa. Low pH enabled H. femoralis to compete more effectively, because the negative impact of H. gratiosa was lessened. Even in a relatively simple simulation, complex interactions occurred between biotic and abiotic factors. This finding demonstrates the importance of multi-factor analysis in furthering our understanding of the structure of assemblages.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA","WARNER, SC (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, 208 MUELLER LAB, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,58,70,72,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,183,194,,10.2307/1939513,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500019,,,,,2021-09-24,

I tested for interspecific competition between these two species during a drought year when primary productivity in the prairie was unusually low. In late June 1989, 1 transferred young nymphs of P. nebrascensis among enclosed plots (each 550-900 m2) to produce three pairs of plots with grasshoppers removed or added. Pretransfer densities in the six plots were estimated at 6 nymphS/m2. Experimental transfers resulted in densities of P. nebrascensis in addition plots 2-3 times as large as in paired removal plots; significant differences in density between addition and removal plots persisted throughout the summer. Densities of O. speciosa in plots with P. nebrascensis removed or added did not differ significantly throughout the growing season of 1989, nor in early summer of 1990. Furthermore, growth and development of O. speciosa in these plots (as measured by rate of maturation, and adult femur length and mass in 1989) were not reduced in the presence of high densities of P. nebrascensis, nor was reproductive potential (measured as the ratio of young nymphs present in early summer 1990 to adults in late summer 1989). These results are similar to those of a previous experiment at the same site during 1987 when primary productivity was moderate. Even under the extreme conditions of 1989, with particularly high ratios of grasshoppers to available food resources, variation in P. nebrascensis density did not adversely affect populations of O. speciosa. These results contrast with recent results for sedentary phytophagous insects, but are consistent with the hypothesis that free-ranging insect herbivores may rarely experience interspecific competition for food resources.",,"EVANS, EW (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,LOGAN,UT 84322, USA.",,,,,,,49,25,32,0,17,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1992,73,3,,,,,1038,1044,,10.2307/1940178,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU767,WOS:A1992HU76700028,,,,,2021-09-24,

These negative competitive interactions could also affect the coexistence of predatory species. The co-occurrence of aphidophagous ladybird species in crops creates opportunities for CANN and IGP, especially when aphids become scarce. The Lotka-Volterra model predicts the coexistence of two species if intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific interference interactions. Cycloneda sanguinea L. and Eriopis connexa (Germar) (both Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) coexist in sweet pepper crops in La Plata (Argentina) consuming mainly Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The present study used laboratory experiments to estimate levels of CANN and IGP by adults and larvae on eggs, and by adults on larvae, in both the presence and absence of prey (i.e., M.persicae), to explain the effect of prey on coexistence of these two predators. Levels of CANN by C.sanguinea and E.connexa were high in the absence of aphids, and decreased when prey was present. Intraguild predation was bidirectional and asymmetric. Adults and larvae of E.connexa were more voracious IG predators of C.sanguinea than vice versa, the former being the stronger IG predator and interference competitor. Eriopis connexa always won when larvae of the same instar were compared, whereas the larger larva always won when larvae were of different instars, regardless of species. In the presence of prey, CANN by both species decreased, but IGP by E.connexa on C.sanguinea remained high, suggesting that E.connexa could displace C.sanguinea via interspecific interference competition. Other factors potentially affecting the coexistence of C.sanguinea and E.connexa in sweet pepper crops are discussed.","[Rocca, Margarita; Rizzo, Estefania; Greco, Nancy; Sanchez, Norma] Univ Nacl La Plata, Ctr Estudios Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, CONICET, Blvd 120 S No 60 & 64, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Greco, N (corresponding author), Univ Nacl La Plata, Ctr Estudios Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, CONICET, Blvd 120 S No 60 & 64, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",ngreco@cepave.edu.ar,,,Programa de Incentivos [UNLP N712];  [BID PICT 2012-1624];  [BID PICT 2013-0108],"We thank the three anonymous reviewers whose suggestions helped us improve the manuscript.

In this work, we examined the role of abiotic conditions in shaping the structure of a simple agricultural community that is dominated by two species of predatory mites (i.e., Eusieus stipulatus and Eusieus scutalis) competing for resources. Population and community dynamics experiments were carried out at two abiotic conditions mimicking local climates in a Mediterranean region, to estimate the population cariying capacity (k) and interspecific competition (a) for each predatory mite species. Subsequently, we used this data to parameterize a competition model, thereby predicting species dominance at each abiotic condition. To test our model predictions, we sampled several orchards located in areas influenced by each of the local climates, to determine the abundance of each species of natural enemy. Results showed that the outcome of the competitive interactions between predatory mites was strongly affected by abiotic conditions, leading to temperature-dependent changes in the community structure. Furthermore, the pattern of species dominance found in the field agreed with the model predictions built upon our laboratory experiments. We therefore emphasize that, in a changing climate, if we are to guarantee the successful use of biocontrol agents, we need to account for the effect of temperature upon biotic interactions.

Specialized animal species are commonly affected by resource and interference competition with generalist and/or omnivorous competitors, so avoidance behavior could be expected. We hypothesize that specialist species may exploit broad range cues from such potential resource competitors (i.e., cues possibly common to various generalist and/or omnivorous predators) to avoid costly competition regarding food or reproduction, even in new species associations. We tested this hypothesis by studying short-term interactions between a native larval parasitoid and a native generalist omnivorous predator recently sharing the same invasive host/prey, the leaf miner Tuta absoluta. We observed a strong negative effect of kleptoparasitism (food resource stealing) instead of classical intraguild predation on immature parasitoids. There was no evidence that parasitoid females avoided the omnivorous predator when searching for oviposition sites, although we studied both long- and short-range known detection mechanisms. Therefore, we conclude that broad range cue avoidance may not exist in our biological system, probably because it would lead to too much oviposition site avoidance which would not be an efficient and, thus, beneficial strategy. If confirmed in other parasitoids or specialist predators, our findings may have implications for population dynamics, especially in the current context of increasing invasive species and the resulting creation of many new species associations.","[Chailleux, Anais; Wajnberg, Eric; Zhou, Yuxiang; Amiens-Desneux, Edwige; Desneux, Nicolas] Inst Sophia Agrobiotech, French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Chailleux, Anais] InVivo AgroSolut, F-75782 Paris, France; [Chailleux, Anais] Cirad, UPR HortSys, F-34398 Montpellier, France","Chailleux, A (corresponding author), Cirad, UPR HortSys, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",chailleux.anais@gmail.com,"Wajnberg, Eric/A-4862-2009; Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013","Wajnberg, Eric/0000-0002-6700-7114; Chailleux, Anais/0000-0001-5653-8019",ANRTFrench National Research Agency (ANR); InVivo AgroSolutions; French Ministry of Agriculture [10063],"We thank Anthony Droui for carrying out some of the experiments and helpful comments on the experimental design, Cecile Thomas and Philippe Bearez (INRA Sophia Antipolis) for the technical assistance, Meline Beal and Jacques Frandon (Biotop, InVivo AgroSolutions) for providing biological materials, ANRT and InVivo AgroSolutions for the funding to AC (Ph.D. fellowship) and the French Ministry of Agriculture for the funding to ND (CASDAR project 10063).

The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus has established in the North American range of the competitively superior resident congener, Aedes albopictus, and the predatory native mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. We tested predictions for two hypotheses of invasion success and species coexistence: keystone predation and spatial partitioning. We tested competition between A. japonicus japonicus and A. albopictus with or without T. rutilus in laboratory microcosms, and measured abundances of A. japonicus japonicus, A. albopictus, other resident competing mosquito species, and the presence of T. rutilus among tree holes and tires in metropolitan Washington, DC. In laboratory microcosms, A. albopictus was competitively dominant over A. japonicus japonicus, which is consistent with the few prior studies of competition between these two Aedes species. T. rutilus predation severely lowered performances of both Aedes species but more severely lowered A. japonicus japonicus performance than A. albopictus performance when all three species co-occurred, thus yielding no evidence for keystone predation. Consistent with the spatial partitioning hypothesis, A. japonicus japonicus was negatively correlated and independently aggregated with A. albopictus and all combined resident mosquito competitors and was not associated with T. rutilus among field containers. These results suggest that predation from T. rutilus and competition from A. albopictus are barriers to the spread of A. japonicus japonicus, but that A. japonicus japonicus may escape these interspecific effects by utilizing spatially partitioned container habitats.","[Freed, T.

The size of an individual is an important determinant of its trophic position and the type of interactions it engages in with other heterospecific and conspecific individuals. Consequently an individual's ecological role in a community changes with its body size over ontogeny, leading to that trophic interactions between individuals are a size-dependent and ontogenetically variable mixture of competition and predation. 2. Because differently sized individuals thus experience different biotic environments, invasion success may be determined by the body size of the invaders. Invasion outcome may also depend on the productivity of the system as productivity influences the biotic environment. 3. In a laboratory experiment with two poeciliid fishes the body size of the invading individuals and the daily amount of food supplied were manipulated. 4. Large invaders established persistent populations and drove the resident population to extinction in 10 out of 12 cases, while small invaders failed in 10 out of 12 trials. Stable coexistence was virtually absent. Invasion outcome was independent of productivity. 5. Further analyses suggest that small invaders experienced a competitive recruitment bottleneck imposed on them by the resident population. In contrast, large invaders preyed on the juveniles of the resident population. This predation allowed the large invaders to establish successfully by decreasing the resident population densities and thus breaking the bottleneck. 6. The results strongly suggest that the size distribution of invaders affects their ability to invade, an implication so far neglected in life-history omnivory systems. The findings are further in agreement with predictions of life-history omnivory theory, that size-structured interactions demote coexistence along a productivity gradient.","[Schroder, Arne] Present address Wageningen IMARES, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands; [Schroder, Arne; Nilsson, Karin A.; Persson, Lennart; van Kooten, Tobias; Reichstein, Birte] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Schroder, A (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",arne.schroder@emg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Reichstein, Birte/0000-0002-0551-6896",Memorial of J.C.

The wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) Hogna helluo (Walckenaer) and Pardosa milvina Hentz co-occur in soybean fields of south-west Ohio, U.S.A. As adults, Hogna is the larger species and has the competitive advantage in most interactions; due to differing phenologies, however, their size-classes frequently overlap and as such there is potential for shifts in competitive ability and intra-guild predation. The hypothesis that competitive interactions and intra-guild predation will favour Pardosa when Pardosa is similar-sized, or has a size advantage over Hogna, was tested in laboratory and field experiments. 2. Studies in laboratory arenas, pairing similar-sized individuals of these species and Hogna spiderlings with larger spiders of both species, revealed that intra-guild predation seldom occurs with similar-sized Hogna and Pardosa, however Pardosa will consume small Hogna individuals in laboratory arenas. 3. Field experiments involved stocking high densities (50 m(-) (2)) of Pardosa and Hogna in enclosures placed in soybean fields. In experiments with spiders of similar size, no interspecific effects were uncovered, but an intraspecific effect was found for Pardosa as its survival and weight gain were lower in the presence of more conspecifics. Large Hogna or Pardosa had no effect on the survival or weight gain of Hogna spiderlings. 4. Although Hogna is a better competitor as an adult, it has no advantage over Pardosa when their size-classes overlap, and Pardosa effects on Hogna may be inconsequential under field conditions. Therefore, the co-existence of these species is fostered by the fact that there are few negative interspecific interactions during their ontogeny.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA","Rypstra, AL (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 1601 Peck Blvd, Hamilton, OH 45011 USA.",,"Walker, Sean E/A-4722-2008","Walker, Sean/0000-0001-9310-3305; Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732",,,,40,41,43,0,13,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The differences in morphology between these two species generate: specific predictions under limiting similarity regarding the likelihood of competition and its relative strength: the congener should be a more important potential competitor. Increased fish density had a strong effect on the multivariate response of survival and growth, and on the relative condition of C. bairdi, indicating competition. The effect of additional C. bairdi or Kanawha sculpins were roughly equal, but the effect of E. flabellare was significantly greater. The most important potential impact on C. bairdi came from interspecific competition by a species that is smaller and very different in morphology, contrary to predictions based, on limiting similarity.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706; MT LAKE BIOL STN,PEMBROKE,NC 27708",,,,,,,,44,14,14,0,8,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,1995,104,1,,,,,31,38,,10.1007/BF00365559,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RZ359,WOS:A1995RZ35900005,28306910,,,,2021-09-24,

Chemical signals can act as repellents or attractants and may therefore have applications for wildlife management. We devised a field experiment to investigate whether dominant predator (ferret Mustela furo) body odor would alter the behavior of three common mesopredators: stoats (Mustelaerminea), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), and ship rats (Rattus rattus). We predicted that apex predator odor would lead to increased detections, and our results support this hypothesis as predator kairomones (interspecific olfactory messages that benefit the receiver) provoked eavesdropping behavior by mesopredators. Stoats exhibited the most pronounced responses, with kairomones significantly increasing the number of observations and the time spent at a site, so that their occupancy estimates changed from rare to widespread. Behavioral responses to predator odors can therefore be exploited for conservation and this avenue of research has not yet been extensively explored. A long-life lure derived from apex predator kairomones could have practical value, especially when there are plentiful resources that reduce the efficiency of food-based lures. Our results have application for pest management in New Zealand and the technique of using kairomones to monitor predators could have applications for conservation efforts worldwide.","[Garvey, Patrick M.; Clout, Mick N.; Wyse, Sarah V.] Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Garvey, Patrick M.; Glen, Alistair S.] Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Wyse, Sarah V.] Royal Bot Gardens Kew, Wakehurst Pl, Haywards Heath RH17 6TN, W Sussex, England; [Nichols, Margaret] Lincoln Univ, Ctr Wildlife Management & Conservat, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Pech, Roger P.] Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.; Garvey, PM (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",pgar874@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,"Wyse, Sarah/0000-0002-7015-8685; Glen, Al/0000-0002-7777-7630; Wyse, Sarah/0000-0002-0442-9950",,,,84,15,15,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

There was no statistically significant change in body condition between the control and darter present treatments. However, salamander body condition was significantly reduced in the presence of the creek chubs suggesting an asymmetric competitive interaction between those two species. While predation is often cited as a potential mechanism limiting the distribution of stream species, the role of interspecific competition may be just as vital. Overall, our results highlight that competition, and not solely predation, may explain why some stream salamanders are restricted to headwater reaches.","[Ennen, Joshua R.; Alford, Kathlina F.] Tennessee Aquarium Conservat Inst, 201 Chestnut St, Chattanooga, TN 37402 USA; [Davenport, Jon M.] SE Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA","Ennen, JR (corresponding author), Tennessee Aquarium Conservat Inst, 201 Chestnut St, Chattanooga, TN 37402 USA.",jre@tnaqua.org,"Davenport, Jon M/AAG-8457-2020","Davenport, Jon M/0000-0002-9911-2779",Aquarium and Zoo Facilities Association's Clark Waldram Conservation Fund,"We thank Christine Bock and Dave Collins of the Tennessee Aquarium for sharing space for our streams.

Very little is known though about the shape of the cost function for species with direct interference competition. Here we report the results of an experiment with two vole species in artificial coexistence in large enclosures, where density of the dominant competitor species (Microtus agrestis) was manipulated. Experimental populations of the subordinate vole species (Clethrionomys glareolus) were composed of same aged individuals to study distribution of costs of coexistence with a dominant species within an age-cohort. Survival and space use decreased gradually with increasing field vole numbers. Thus, responses to interference competition in our system appeared to be similar as expected from resource competition. The total number of breeders was stable. Reproductive characteristics such as the timing of breeding, and the litter size were not affected. In the single species enclosures a proportion of surviving individuals were not able to establish a breeding territory against stronger conspecifics. Under competition with heterospecifics such nonbreeders suffered high mortality, whereas the breeders survived. Combined interference of dominant conspecifics and heterospecifics probably increased the frequency of aggressive interactions, social stress and mortality for the weaker individuals within a homogeneous age cohort of the subordinate competitor population. Our results suggest, that in open systems where bank voles are outcompeted over the breeding season by faster reproducing field voles, animals able to establish a territory may be able to withstand competitor pressure, while nonbreeding bank vole individuals are forced to emigrate to suboptimal forest habitats.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",jana.eccard@uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,42,14,16,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The latter two hypotheses are versions of Tilman's R*-hypothesis, which suggests that the species that is able to survive under the lowest resource concentrations will win in competition, but they differ in the role of body size determining R*. We used a laboratory model system of four species of Daphnia commonly occurring in ponds and rock-pools in the northern temperate zone, D. magna, D. pulex, D. obtusa and D. longispina (in order of decreasing adult body size), and the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda as food. Life-table and competition experiments were focused on the factors explaining the good competitive ability of D. obtusa. One-, two-and four-species experiments were run without predation and under different predation profiles mimicking vertebrate and invertebrate predators. Life-history traits of D. obtusa under high food conditions at 20degreesC were measured and compared with previous measurements on the other three species. D. obtusa was the superior species in most situations, except under high invertebrate predation when the large D. magna was superior. The outcomes did not depend on the specific composition of the zooplankton community (two or four species present initially). Mean population sizes of all four species were higher in experiments with fewer species, indicating strong interspecific competition also under predation. D. obtusa had a higher intrinsic rate of increase (r) than the other three species studied. Therefore, our results mainly support the r-max-hypothesis. We suggest that a competitive hierarchy among the four Daphnia species may exist, but the relative positions of the species in the hierarchy may vary with environmental conditions like the type of predator present, food quality and quantity, and temperature. Competitive ability did not seem to be strongly related to body size.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Zool, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Milbrink, G (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Anim Ecol, Norbyvagen 18B, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",Goran.Milbrink@ebc.uu.se,"Bengtsson, Jan/AAF-2325-2021",,,,,52,6,7,0,24,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

For both species, the presence of the other (as detected by both contact and chemical signals) decreased feeding activity and provoked behavioral changes (avoidance, decrease in percentage feeding). These effects were reversible and short-lived, and were more pronounced when there was a shortage of food and when sea stars were exposed to simulated attacks by the other species (involving pedicellarial pinching). L. polaris seemed to be the inferior competitor as (1) it switched to less profitable prey size (smaller mussels, Mytilus edulis) when A. vulgaris was present, and (2) it avoided A. vulgaris and reduced its feeding activity when food was scarce, The dominance of A. vulgaris is possibly attenuated at our study site (near its northern distributional limit) by the reduction of its fitness when water temperatures are low (most of the year) and during the winter when it migrates to deeper water, Competition for food resources seems to occur periodically (mainly summer), in localized areas (patches and beds of mussels) or when sea stars form dense aggregations in which they are likely to interact frequently, Interactions, and thus the chance of competition, are less likely at greater depths. Coexistence seems to be permitted by both the attenuation of the dominance of A. vulgaris and by the great variations in how L. polaris and A. vulgaris interact (strongly affected by variations in prey availability, sea star abundance, and in the patterns of prey use by both sea stars).","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, GIROQ, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Himmelman, JH (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",john.himmelman@bio.ulaval.ca,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,73,33,35,1,21,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Meta-analysts will vary in the criteria they use to screen studies and select data within studies, even when addressing exactly the same question. We summarize some of the many decisions that an ecologist must make in deciding what data to include in a synthesis. We then show, using multiple meta-analyses taken from the same literature on stream predation experiments, that meta-analytic conclusions can be colored by selection criteria that are not specifically a function of the relevance of the data. As a consequence, we recommend that meta-analysts perform several meta-analyses using different selection criteria to examine the robustness of reported findings. We also advise ecological meta-analysts to minimize use of selection criteria that are based on judgments of study quality when extracting data from the literature, because of the potential for unconscious bias. The influence of quality criteria on patterns in the data set can then be examined empirically. Our comparisons of mean effect size,for studies included vs. excluded on the basis of quality criteria, provided no evidence that rejected studies were aberrant or more variable than acceptable studies. One result of excluding such studies was a loss of statistical power. We urge ecologists to be more explicit about how data are selected for a meta-analysis, to examine the robustness of the patterns they report, and to conduct meta-analyses to describe as well as to infer.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Englund, G (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",,"Englund, Goran/A-7434-2008","Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602",,,,40,132,140,1,46,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1999,80,4,,,,,1132,1141,,10.2307/177060,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,215EG,WOS:000081368500004,,,,,2021-09-24,

Because spring peepers are believed to be poor competitors, I hypothesized that competition from green frog larvae limits the distribution of spring peeper larvae. I stocked field enclosures with a constant density of spring peeper larvae, and one of four densities of green frog larvae (a ''target-neighbor'' design). Increased green frog density had a small effect on metamorphic size and no effects on survivorship, larval period or growth rates of spring peepers. In contrast to these small interspecific effects, green frogs had a large effect on their own performance. Intraspecific competition resulted in a 50% decline in growth rate and an 11% decline in metamorphic size. These results suggest that the species are segregated in resource use, or that compared with green frogs, spring peepers are better able to cope with depressed resource densities. In either case, this field experiment provides no evidence that interspecific competition from green frogs limits distributions of spring peepers.

Observational studies indicate that the introduced, North American species P. leniusculus may gradually replace the native A, astacus, but the mechanism behind the replacement is not known. This study examined the direct effects of interspecific competition between the crayfish, and indirect effects of competitive interactions and fish (European perch, Perca fluviatilis L.) predation. Three different experiments with young-of-the-year (YOY) crayfish were performed. P. leniusculus was strongly dominant over similar-sized A. astacus in interference competition for shelter in a laboratory experiment. However, in a 35-day experiment in outdoor pools, A, astacus growth and survival were about equally affected by interactions with conspecifics and P. leniusculus. In contrast, P. leniusculus was significantly more affected by intraspecific competition than by competition with A. astacus, suggesting asymmetric competition between the two species. The presence of perch in outdoor ponds with mixed-species groups of the two crayfish species resulted in considerably higher predation rates on A. astacus than on P. leniusculus. Both species showed strong antipredator responses to perch by increasing refuge use. I suggest that higher perch predation rates on A. astacus originate from P. leniusculus being the superior species in interspecific competition for shelter. Because of displacement from refuges, A. astacus individuals become more exposed to the predator. This indirect effect of interactions among the two crayfish species and the predator may be important in the observed in situ replacement of A. astacus by P. leniusculus.","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT ENVIRONM ASSESSMENT,S-75007 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","SODERBACK, B (corresponding author), UPPSALA UNIV,INST LIMNOL,NORBYVAGEN 20,S-75236 UPPSALA,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,60,71,71,0,23,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1994,100,3,,,,,229,235,,10.1007/BF00316949,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PZ755,WOS:A1994PZ75500004,28307005,,,,2021-09-24,

In the study area, Microtus densities fluctuated from ten to 100-fold and predator densities fluctuated more than ten-fold. M. epiroticus suffered more from predation than M. agrestis, probably because densities in M. epiroticus patches were higher than densities in M. agrestis patches making M. epiroticus more profitable prey for patch-searching predators. The proportion of M. epiroticus among all voles declined during the crash phase of the vole cycle, at least partly as a result of predation. Breeding female voles showed little spatial overlap and presumably competed for space at high densities. At low densities, interference competition through predators may have been more important than space competition. The proportion of the smaller species M. epiroticus in the total number of all voles increased rapidly with increasing vole densities. This could be due to more aggregated way of life which gives an advantage in competition for space. Predation reduced the time for space competition to short periods, and decreased periodically the proportion of the more successful competitor. Thus, the coexistence of the two vole species seemed to be predator-induced. In this sense predation was a more important factor.than interspecific competition.","UNIV TURKU,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,SF-20500 TURKU 50,FINLAND","NORRDAHL, K (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,P RAUTATIEKATU 13,SF-00100 HELSINKI 10,FINLAND.",,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,33,71,72,0,5,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1993,67,1,,,,,149,158,,10.2307/3545105,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KZ779,WOS:A1993KZ77900017,,,,,2021-09-24,

The communities consisted mainly of aquatic dipteran larvae. Community M was dominated by a filter feeder, Tripteroides tenax, which reached a high density despite a strongly aggregated distribution. Community K had five trophic groups: carrion feeders, filter feeders, detritus feeders, nipping predators and hooking predators, each including multiple species. The summed density of filter feeders in Community K remained much below the level attained by filter feeders in Community M. Niche differentiation within each trophic group with regard to pitcher age and feeding behaviour was not sufficient to allow species coexistence through niche separation alone. Aggregated distributions directly reduced interspecific encounters. Nevertheless, species belonging to the same trophic group commonly shared the same pitcher, because of high occurrence probabilities of dominant species and positive associations between some taxa (due mainly to similar occupancies by pitcher age). Predator coexistence in Community K may have been facilitated by self-limitation of the large predators through intraspecific cannibalism strengthened by aggregation. Prey coexistence, on the other hand, may have relied more on population suppression by predation, especially the selective removal of old instar Tripteroides.","UNIV MALAYA,DEPT ZOOL,KUALA LUMPUR 59100,MALAYSIA","MOGI, M (corresponding author), SAGA MED SCH,DEPT MICROBIOL,DIV PARASITOL,NABESHIMA,SAGA 849,JAPAN.",,"Yong, Hoi Sen/C-1548-2010","Yong, Hoi Sen/0000-0002-9832-8826",,,,64,40,41,1,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1992,90,2,,,,,172,184,,10.1007/BF00317174,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU052,WOS:A1992HU05200004,28313712,,,,2021-09-24,

We examined interactions among a pair of early season grasshopper species (May-June; Arphia conspersa and Pardalophora apiculata) and a late season pair (July-August; Melanoplus femur-rubrum and Melanoplus bivittatus). Each grasshopper species was placed in cages by itself and with another grasshopper species. Grasshoppers generally survived at higher density in fertilized cages and they reduced plant abundance relative to empty cages, suggesting that grasshoppers may be food limited at these densities. In unfertilized plots, early season grasshoppers preferred grasses (Schizachyrium scoparium and Poa pratensis) and favored the growth of forbs (especially Solidago spp.). However, late in summer, Melanoplus spp. preferred Solidago spp. and favored the growth of grasses. The pattern of grasshopper survivorship and plant reduction within these experimental environments provide preliminary support for some of the predictions of resource competition theory. Grasshoppers exhibited interspecific competition only if they significantly reduced plant biomass. If two species competed, a grasshopper species was eliminated only if the superior competitor, when living by itself, could reduce plant biomass to a significantly lower level than the inferior competitor. Competitors persisted only if they did not differ in their ability to reduce plant biomass or reduced the abundance of different plant species.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA","RITCHIE, ME (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,40,48,48,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1992,89,4,,,,,524,532,,10.1007/BF00317159,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL791,WOS:A1992HL79100011,28311883,,,,2021-09-24,

When body size determines the outcome of competitive interactions between individuals, coexistence depends also on how resource use and the ability to compete for these resources change with body size. Testing coexistence theory in size-structured communities, therefore, requires disentangling the effects of size-dependent competitive abilities and niche shifts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the evolution of species- and size-dependent competitive asymmetries increased the likelihood of coexistence between interacting species. We experimentally estimated the effects of size-dependent competitive interactions on somatic growth rates of two interacting fish species, Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata and killifish Rivulus hartii. We controlled for the effects of size-dependent changes in the niche at two competitive settings representing the early (allopatric) and late (sympatric) evolutionary stages of a killifish-guppy community. We fitted the growth data to a model that incorporates species- and size-dependent competitive asymmetries to test whether changes in the competitive interactions across sizes increased the likelihood of species coexistence from allopatry to sympatry. We found that guppies are competitively superior to killifish but were less so in sympatric populations. The decrease in the effects of interspecific competition on the fitness of killifish and increase in the interspecific effect on guppies' fitness increased the likelihood that sympatric guppies and killifish will coexist. However, while the competitive asymmetries between the species changed consistently between allopatry and sympatry between drainages, the magnitude of the size-dependent competitive asymmetries varied between drainages. These results demonstrate the importance of integrating evolution and trait-based interactions into the research on how species coexist.","[Anaya-Rojas, Jaime M.; Blanchette, Allison; Framstead, Nick; Travis, Joseph] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Anaya-Rojas, Jaime M.] Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, Munster, Germany; [Bassar, Ronald D.] Williams Coll, Dept Biol, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Potter, Tomos] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Callahan, Shay] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Reznick, David] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Anaya-Rojas, JM (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Anaya-Rojas, JM (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, Munster, Germany.",jaime.anaya-rojas@uni-muenster.de,"Potter, Tomos/AAF-8255-2020","Potter, Tomos/0000-0003-3201-6130; Anaya-Rojas, Jaime Mauricio/0000-0002-0688-3401",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1556884],"NSF, Grant/Award Number: 1556884",,52,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

An observed community structure is often shaped by a combination of bottom-top and top-bottom processes, affected by biotic and abiotic factors. These factors affect community structure either directly (each species separately) or indirectly, via other species. Few studies have observed the combined effects of biotic and abiotic factors on primary producers and consumer communities composed of numerous species. 2. This study investigated the combined effects of a predatory hemipteran and water salinity on abundance and species richness of the periphyton and arthropod communities in an artificial pool experiment. 3. The abundance and species richness of both periphyton and arthropod communities were affected by the combination of salinity and predator. 4. It is suggested that the observed consumer community is composed of arthropod species that vary in salinity tolerance and response to the predator. In addition, the abundance of euryhaline species or species that are not consumed by this particular predator increases indirectly in specific treatment combinations that eventually result in reduced interspecific competition. Periphyton variables were strongly correlated to densities of larval Ochlerotatus caspius (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting that this species may be largely responsible for structuring the producer community. 5. It is suggested that O. caspius distribution is the result of female oviposition habitat selection that is manipulated by chemical signals. Therefore, chemical signals that inform about habitat suitability also play an important role in shaping both consumer and primary producer communities.","[Silberbush, Alon] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, IL-36006 Tivon, Israel; [Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Haifa, Israel; [Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Haifa, Israel","Silberbush, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, IL-36006 Tivon, Israel.",alonsil@gmail.com,"Silberbush, Alon/AAD-3650-2021","Silberbush, Alon/0000-0002-8762-6836",,,,37,0,0,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Propagule size and number often vary by several orders of magnitude among co-occurring plant species. Explaining the maintenance of this variation and understanding how propagule size contributes to coexistence remain a central challenge for community ecologists. The dominant paradigm is that a competition-colonization trade-off maintains interspecific variation in seed size, but empirical support is limited and other coexistence mechanisms, such as size-dependent seed predation, have not been examined. 2. We examined how seed size, fecundity, and other functional traits of 18 co-occurring perennial forbs trade-off with both vulnerability to rodent seed predation and competitive response to a community-dominant perennial bunchgrass. We added seeds of these species to 1 m(2) plots at 10 sites where we factorially manipulated rodent seed predation and competition from the community dominant, Festuca campestris. For a given plot, seeds of each species were added at densities that reflected the fecundity (i.e., per capita seed production) for each species. Moreover, we varied total seed density among plots by adding seeds at one of five relative densities (0, 0.25. 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 times each species' fecundity) to examine how fecundity affected overall recruitment for each species. 3. There was a trade-off between seed size and fecundity, as expected, but larger seed size was also associated with greater plant height, lower C/N ratios, and lower water use efficiency, suggesting that seed size represented a resource acquisitive trait syndrome (as quantified by trait principal component scores). 4. In the field experiment, the suppressive effects of seed predation on seed recruitment rate increased with increasing seed size. In contrast, smaller seeded species with less resource-acquisitive traits were more negatively affected by competition from F. campestris than were species with more resource acquisitive traits. 5. Synthesis. While the competition-colonization trade-off has been the predominant mechanism thought to maintain coexistence among species that vary in fecundity and seed size, our work suggests that susceptibility to rodent seed predation and competitive response to community dominants represent alternative mechanisms that can differentially influence plant recruitment of species based on their seed size and associated traits.","[Maron, John L.; Hajek, Karyn L.; Hahn, Philip G.; Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,,Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-1553518]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518; NSF, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518",,55,9,9,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, the influence of interspecific aggression and fatigue on the predation cost of fighting is seldom examined, although both are unignorable aspects of fighting. Here, I incorporated both factors in a series of field experiments on the cichlid Lamprologus ocellatus. If territorial males respond more strongly to conspecific territorial intruders than to heterospecific intruders, then they should delay escape more frequently during intraspecific fighting than during interspecific fighting. Consequently, although I predicted that vigilance would be decreased as fighting progresses in both cases, intraspecific aggression should decrease vigilance more than interspecific aggression. Males were also exposed to a predator approaching at different (slow or fast) speeds during these fighting bouts. Delays in predator detection and flight initiation were quantified and these predictions were tested. As predicted, males responded more strongly to intraspecific intruders, resulting in slower predator detection and fleeing times than when encountering interspecific intruders. Furthermore, flight latency decreased with increasing fight duration, suggesting that fatigue negatively influenced escape responses. However, contrary to the prediction, the vigilance decrement rate was faster in response to slow predators than in response to rapid predators, and was not influenced by intruder identity. This suggests that fighting males reserve their attention for information critical to their survival and are less vigilant toward a less-threatening (slowly approaching) predator. This cognitive allocation may be an adaptive compensation for fatigue-related low vigilance during fighting.","[Ota, Kazutaka] Osaka City Univ, Dept Biol & Geosci, Sumiyoshi Ku, Osaka 5588585, Japan","Ota, K (corresponding author), Osaka City Univ, Dept Biol & Geosci, Sumiyoshi Ku, Osaka 5588585, Japan.",otkztk@gmail.com,,"Ota, Kazutaka/0000-0002-7097-7330","Overseas Research grant from Osaka City University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16777290]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K18614] Funding Source: KAKEN",This study was supported by an Overseas Research grant from Osaka City University and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (no. 16777290).,,63,6,6,0,6,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

In the field, however, contaminant effects are ubiquitously co-occurring with ecological interactions such as species competition and predation, which might influence the sensitivity of the individuals exposed to toxicants. The present experimental study investigated how intra- and interspecific competition influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms to a pesticide. For this, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the mortality and growth of the snail Bithynia tentaculata and the crustacean Gammarus pulex under different levels of intraspecific and interspecific competition for a food resource. Interspecific competition was created by adding individuals of Radix peregra and Asellus aquaticus, respectively. The interaction of competition and carbendazim exposure significantly influenced B. tentaculata growth, however, combined effects on survival and immobility were considered transient and were less easily demonstrated. Positive influence of competition on G. pulex survival was observed under low-medium carbendazim concentrations and under medium-high density pressures, being partly related to cannibalistic and predation compensatory mechanisms, enhanced under food limiting conditions. This study shows that intra- and interspecific competition pressure may influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms in a more complex way (positive, non-significant and negative effects were observed) than just increasing the sensitivity of the studied species, as has generally been hypothesized.

Intraspecific and interspecific competition are expected to result in additional stress and might increase the sensitivity of aquatic populations to pesticide contamination. To test this hypothesis, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the population dynamics of the micro-crustacean Daphnia magna under different levels of intraspecific and interspecific competition for an algal food resource, using the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus as competing species. The experiments were performed in glass jars with three different carbendazim concentrations (i.e., 50, 100 and 150 A mu g/L), and had a duration of 25 days, with a 4-day pre-treatment period in which competition was allowed to take place and a 21-day exposure period. The endpoints evaluated were D. magna total population abundance and population structure. Results of these experiments show that competition stress on its own had a significant influence on shaping D. magna population's structure, however, a different response was observed in the intraspecific and interspecific competition experiments. The use of a 4-day pre-treatment period in the intraspecific experiment already led to an absence of interactive effects due to the quick abundance confluence between the different intraspecific treatments, thus not allowing the observation of interactive effects between competition and carbendazim stress. Results of the interspecific competition experiment showed that rotifers were quickly outcompeted by D. magna and that D. magna even profited from the rotifer presence through exploitative competition, which alleviated the original stress caused by the algal resource limitation. These experiments suggest that competition interactions play an important role in defining population-level effects of pesticides in a more complex way than was hypothesized (increasing competition leading to a sensitivity increase), as the interspecific experiment showed. Therefore, these should be taken into account in the extrapolation of single-species toxicity data to protect higher levels of biological organization.","[Isabel Del Arco, Ana] Univ Jaen, Dept Plant Biol Anim Biol & Ecol, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Rico, Andreu; van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Del Arco, AI (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Dept Plant Biol Anim Biol & Ecol, B3 078 Campus Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain.",aarco@ujaen.es,"van den brink, Paul/AAT-7144-2020; Rico, Andreu/G-1102-2016","van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347; Rico, Andreu/0000-0002-1820-4218; del Arco Ochoa, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-5690-4979",Long Range Initiative of CEFIC [LRI-ECO19]; Jaen University,"The authors thank John Beijer, Marie-Claire Boerwinkel and Ivo Roessink for providing useful advices, and Carry van Mameren and Steven Crum for performing the chemical analysis.

Intraguild interactions between predators have significant implications for how multiple predators impact on their prey. Carabid assemblages are not generally thought to be structured by interspecific competitive interactions, species relative abundances instead being determined mainly by abiotic factors. However, several field studies report negative associations between the abundance of certain carabid species and the presence of wood ants. 2. Replicated laboratory experiments were used to monitor the behaviour of individual female Abax parallelepipedus (Piller & Mitterpacher) in the presence of a range of wood ant (Formica rufa L.) densities (including ant-free controls) over 23 h. Carabids did not feed when wood ants were present. Running and defence activities were high at low ant densities but decreased with increasing ant density. At the highest ant density, all carabids were killed within the first 2 h of the experiment, but the ants did not consume the carabids after they had killed them. Carabid diurnal activity increased at the higher wood ant densities. 3. Female A. parallelepipedus and Pterostichus madidus (F.) maintained individually in the presence of five wood ants had significantly lower mean body weights and carried fewer eggs after 21 days compared to control beetles that had been kept without ants. 4. The results help to explain the reduced abundance of these two carabid species under field conditions when wood ants are present. We interpret these findings to mean that the interaction between wood ants and carabids is one of asymmetric aggressive interference competition rather than predation.","[Hawes, Cathy; Evans, Hugh F.] Alice Holt Lodge, Forest Res, Surrey, England; [Hawes, Cathy] James Hutton Inst, Dundee, Scotland; [Evans, Hugh F.] Rhodfa Padarn, Forest Res, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Stewart, Alan J.

Interactions with classical predators (e.g., those not competing for shared resources) can strongly influence nest-site selection, but whether intraguild predation also influences this behavior is unknown. We tested whether risk of predation from an intraguild predator [the diurnal scincid lizard Eutropis (Mabuya) longicaudata] influences nest-site selection by its prey (the nocturnal gecko Gekko hokouensis) on Orchid Island, Taiwan. These two species putatively compete for shared resources, including invertebrate prey and nesting microhabitat, but the larger E. longicaudata also predates G. hokouensis (but not its hard-shelled eggs). Both species nested within a concrete wall containing a series of drainage holes that have either one (closed-in) or two openings (open). In allopatry, E. longicaudata preferred to nest within holes that were plugged by debris (thereby protecting eggs from water intrusion), whereas G. hokouensis selected holes that were open at both ends (facilitating escape from predators). When we experimentally excluded E. longicaudata from its preferred nesting area, G. hokouensis not only nested in higher abundances, but also modified its nest-site selection, such that communal nesting was more prevalent and both open and closed-in holes were used equally. Egg viability was unaffected by the choice of hole type, but was reduced slightly (by 7%) in the predator exclusion area (presumably due to higher local incubation temperatures). Our field experiment demonstrates that intraguild predators can directly influence the nest density of prey by altering maternal nest-site selection behavior, even when the predator and prey are active at different times of day and the eggs are not at risk of predation.","[Huang, Wen-San] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Taichung, Taiwan; [Pike, David A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Huang, WS (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Taichung, Taiwan.",wshuang@mail.nmns.edu.tw,"Pike, David A/B-2032-2012","Huang, Wen-San/0000-0003-0073-3557","Kuo Wu Hsiu Luan Culture and Education Foundation; National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC96-2621-B-178-002-MY3]; National Museum of Natural Science, Taichung, Taiwan [NMNSHP97-002]","We are grateful to C.

In Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, surveys were used to quantify microhabitat use and selectivity in two live-coral specialist damselfishes (Pomacentridae), Chrysiptera parasema, and Dascyllus melanurus. A patch reef experiment was then conducted to test how intra- and interspecific competition interacts with two types of microhabitat to influence survival of recently settled C. parasema. Surveys demonstrated that C. parasema and D. melanurus recruits utilized similar coral microhabitats; 72% of C. parasema and 85% of D. melanurus used corymbose and bottlebrush growth forms of Acropora. One microhabitat type, Pocillopora sp. coral, was commonly used by D. melanurus but rarely by C. parasema. The patch reef experiment revealed that both microhabitat and interspecific competition influence abundance of recently settled C. parasema. Microhabitat had the strongest influence on survival of C. parasema. In the absence of interspecific competitors, 85% of C. parasema survived for 5 days after transplantation to high-complexity bottlebrush Acropora reefs when compared to only 25% survival of Pocillopora reefs. In both microhabitats, interspecific competition with D. melanurus, but not intraspecific competition, significantly decreased the survival of C. parasema. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed distribution of C. parasema results from specialized microhabitat requirements and competition for space in those microhabitats. This study demonstrates that interspecific competition and microhabitat type can interact to influence early post-settlement survival in coral reef fishes, though, whether and how these factors influence survival will depend on the behavioural attributes and strength of habitat associations among potential competitors.","[Bonin, M.

We studied the effect of predation risk imposed by the least weasel Mustela nivalis nivalis on space use, foraging and activity of two competing vole species, the grey-sided vole Myodes rufocanus, and the bank vole Myodes glareolus. The experiment was conducted in a large indoor arena, consisting of microhabitat structures providing food, shelter, trees for refuge and separated areas with high and low predation risk. Voles were followed for 5 days: 2 days before, 1 day during and 2 days after the presence of weasel. Our results suggest an effect of weasel presence on the vole community. Voles of both species shifted their activity from risky to less risky areas, climbed trees more often and were less active. Seed consumption was not affected by weasel presence. The time spent in the risky and less risky area did not differ between species, but bank voles spent more time in trees than grey-sided voles. Males of both species were more exposed to predation risk than females, i.e. generally spent more time in the risky area. Proportion of time spent in the risky area, the use of area, trees and food stations were sex dependent. Activity and use of trees were species dependent. We found no evidence for despotic distribution between our two species, although bank voles seemed to be more affected by coexistence, since they lost weight during the experiment. Based on our results we conclude that predator response was largely similar between species, while the sex-specific responses dominated. Besides a stronger escape response in the bank vole, the strongest individual differences were sex specific, i.e. males were more prone to take risks in space use and activity.","[Trebaticka, Lenka; Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Metapopulat Res Grp, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Tkadlec, Emil] Palacky Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic","Trebaticka, L (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",letrebat@cc.jyu.fi,"Tkadlec, Emil/A-6230-2014",,"CIMO; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [208478, 44878]","Jyrki Raatikainen is greatly acknowledged for building the tube system, Jani Korpilauri, Janne Koskinen, Helina Nisu, Irja Hanninen and Risto Latvanen for technical help.

We discuss the implications of these results regarding predator-prey interactions in environments where prey form shoals and multiple predators are present.","Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Botham, MS (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Miall Bldg,Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",bgymsb@leeds.ac.uk,"Krause, Jens/C-2750-2011; Krause, Jens/J-4381-2013; Botham, Marc/F-5425-2011","Krause, Jens/0000-0002-1289-2857; ",,,,24,1,1,1,10,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,APR,2005,142,,4,,,,441,453,,10.1163/1568539054011994,,,13,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,943EV,WOS:000230336200003,,,,,2021-09-24,

I used a number of experiments to document competitor-induced behavior and morphology in wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica), to quantify how competitor-induced changes affected subsequent competitive ability, and to investigate the cues responsible for the competitor-induced response. Competitors induced wood frogs to increase their activity and generally develop larger bodies and smaller tails. Further, wood frogs were able to discriminate between intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Whereas behavioral responses to competitors are well documented, the widespread morphological responses are a new discovery; these responses are particularly intriguing because they are in the opposite direction of predator-induced responses in tadpoles. The competitor-induced phenotypes are not simply an allometric effect, but appear to be adaptive responses to competitors; competitor-induced wood frogs experienced higher relative growth rates than noninduced wood frogs in subsequent performance trials, but past studies suggest that the competitor-induced phenotype should experience higher predation risk. When responding to competition, wood frogs were not responding only to reduced food. They were able to sense changes in both the per capita food levels and changes in density (per unit volume) that were independent of per capita food level. Thus, these animals have an amazing ability to sense changes in their environments and respond in very precise ways. When one considers competitor-induced responses in light of past studies on predator-induced phenotypes in larval anurans, one sees that predator-induced traits provide individuals with increased predator resistance but decreased competitive ability, whereas competitor-induced traits provide individuals with increased competitive ability but decreased predator resistance. This suggests that predator- and competitor-induced plasticity have evolved an intricate link that presents a trade-off between competitive ability and predator resistance ability. This trade-off is common across species and makes sense in light of the environments in which wood frogs live, ranging from ponds with high densities of predators and few tadpoles competing to ponds with few predators and extremely high densities of tadpoles competing. Further, there is evidence that this type of plasticity trade-off might be quite common in other phenotypically plastic taxa.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea+@pitt.edu,,,,,,106,181,187,0,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Females should choose to oviposit in habitats where risk of predation and competition are low. The ovipositional responses of a mosquito, Culiseta longiareolata, to a predator and to species sharing the same trophic level as this mosquito (controphic species) were assessed experimentally in outdoor artificial pools. 2. The predator, larval Anax imperator, which strongly reduced larval C. longiareolata survival, resulted in a 52% reduction of C, longiareolata egg rafts. The controphic species (primarily Daphnia magna), which had a small but statistically significant negative effect on the survival of C. longiareolata larvae, did not have a statistically significant influence on the number of egg rafts. 3. Laboratory trials indicated that only a small fraction of the reduced number of egg rafts seen in predator pools may be due to consumption of the egg rafts by A. imperator. 4. The experimental evidence indicates that the reduced number of C. longiareolata egg rafts found in the presence of A. imperator is due largely to oviposition habitat selection, i.e. C, longiareolata females choose pools with low risk of predation for their offspring.","Univ Haifa, Lab Community Ecol, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Biol Chem Lab, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Lab Community Ecol, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",,,,,,,61,79,81,1,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Synthesiomyia nudiseta is a species that has recently been recorded on human corpses in Europe, and it has been cited in forensic cases in Spain and Italy. The mature larvae are known to be facultative predators on necrophagous fly larvae, but their role as predators is unknown. The aim of this paper is to investigate the predatory behavior of S. nudiseta on the most abundant blowfly larvae in sarcosaprophagous communities in southwestern Europe (i.e., Chrysomya albiceps, Lucilia sericata, and Calliphora vicina). Intraspecific and interspecific competition experiments were carried out to study the effect of this species in the necrophagous diptera community. First-instar larvae were placed in plastic cups with the same amount of pig liver (15g) at different densities (50, 100, 150, and 300 individuals/cup). Mortality in blowflies increased when S. nudiseta larvae were present: up to 98.40% in Ch. albiceps, 89.60% in L. sericata, and 84.93% in C. vicina. Pre-imaginal developmental time and adult wing size were analyzed and compared under each of the intraspecific and interspecific conditions; both variables were affected by competition in all cases. The implications of the presence of S. nudiseta for sarcosaprophagous community dynamics and its effect on the estimation of postmortem interval (PMI) are discussed.","[Ivorra, Tania; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel; Rojo, Santos] Univ Alicante, Dept Environm Sci & Nat Resources, E-03080 Alicante, Spain","Ivorra, T (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Environm Sci & Nat Resources, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",tania.ivorra@gmail.com,"Rojo, Santos/L-9717-2014; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel/H-1376-2014","Rojo, Santos/0000-0003-2160-9643; Ivorra, Tania/0000-0002-4656-6347; Martinez-Sanchez, Anabel/0000-0003-1497-8571",Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat ValencianaEuropean Commission [GV/2011/039]; University of Alicante [GRE09-27],"This work belongs to Tania Ivorra PhD and was partially supported by the projects GV/2011/039 (Generalitat Valenciana) and GRE09-27 (University of Alicante).

Here, we examine the role of seasonality in moderating interactions between a globally important invasive mysid shrimp (Hemimysis anomala) and an ecologically similar native species (Mysis salemaai) by combining distribution and diet surveys with experimental quantification of comparative resource exploitation rates and mutual aggressive interactions. We found partial overlap in winter, but not summer horizontal distributions of the two species. Diets were highly similar in the seasonally overlapping range, potentially resulting in competition for the high-quality, but seasonally scarce, zooplankton prey in invaded lakes. Despite its smaller size, H. anomala had similar feeding rates to M. salemaai on three key zooplankton prey species. H. anomala was more aggressive toward M. salemaai than M. salemaai was toward H. anomala, although there was no evidence for intraguild predation. Our findings indicate that spatio-temporal niche partitioning permitted invasion by H. anomala and coexistence with M. salemaai, in spite of their high trophic similarity.","[Penk, Marcin R.; Donohue, Ian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Irvine, Kenneth] UNESCO IHE Inst Water & Educ, Delft, Netherlands","Penk, MR (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",penkm@tcd.ie,"Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013","Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064; Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991","Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [ECS/2009/01]; Ecological Consultancy Services Limited [ECS/2009/01]",We thank Magda Gluza and Tomek Pia. tek for help in the field.

Infra-guild predation (IGP) has been suggested as the main mechanism causing such species displacements. This study elucidates a mechanism for species displacement that is based on competition for shelter, viz, species excluding each other from a shelter place. Preferences of Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus roeselii for shelter space were studied in laboratory experiments. In contrast with night conditions both species showed a strong preference for shelter sites under daytime conditions so that all experiments were carried out under permanent light conditions. Single individuals of D. villosus sheltered more than those of G. roeselii. Intraspecific competition experiments with different size classes and sexes showed that in contrast with D. villosus, the size class had a significant effect on the mean sheltering proportion of individuals of G. roeselii. When both species were brought together in a basin with a shelter site to test interspecific competition, individuals of G. roeselii were actively pushed out of their shelters within 24 h, while D. villosus showed no change in shelter. This led to a significantly increased predation risk for G. roeselii, which was confirmed in an experiment in which a benthic fish was added. IGP only manifested itself after 48h, indicating that competition for shelter preceded IGP When shelter opportunities are in short supply, shelter exclusion may be one of the initial mechanisms for gammarid species displacements.","[de Gelder, S.; van der Velde, G.; Leung, N.; Hendriks, H.

Understanding the interaction among predators and between predation and climate is critical to understanding the mechanisms for compensatory mortality. We used data from 1999 radio-marked neonatal elk (Cervus elaphus) calves from 12 populations in the north-western United States to test for effects of predation on neonatal survival, and whether predation interacted with climate to render mortality compensatory. 2. Weibull survival models with a random effect for each population were fit as a function of the number of predator species in a community (3-5), seven indices of climatic variability, sex, birth date, birth weight, and all interactions between climate and predators. Cumulative incidence functions (CIF) were used to test whether the effects of individual species of predators were additive or compensatory. 3. Neonatal elk survival to 3 months declined following hotter previous summers and increased with higher May precipitation, especially in areas with wolves and/or grizzly bears. Mortality hazards were significantly lower in systems with only coyotes (Canis latrans), cougars (Puma concolor) and black bears (Ursus americanus) compared to higher mortality hazards experienced with gray wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus horribilis). 4. In systems with wolves and grizzly bears, mortality by cougars decreased, and predation by bears was the dominant cause of neonatal mortality. Only bear predation appeared additive and occurred earlier than other predators, which may render later mortality by other predators compensatory as calves age. Wolf predation was low and most likely a compensatory source of mortality for neonatal elk calves. 5. Functional redundancy and interspecific competition among predators may combine with the effects of climate on vulnerability to predation to drive compensatory mortality of neonatal elk calves. The exception was the evidence for additive bear predation. These results suggest that effects of predation by recovering wolves on neonatal elk survival, a contentious issue for management of elk populations, may be less important than the composition of the predator community. Future studies would benefit by synthesizing overwinter calf and adult-survival data sets, ideally from experimental studies, to test the roles of predation in annual compensatory and additive mortality of elk.","[Griffin, Kathleen A.; Hebblewhite, Mark; Robinson, Hugh S.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Zager, Peter] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Lewiston, ID 83501 USA; [Barber-Meyer, Shannon M.] Teton Sci Sch, Kelly, WY 83011 USA; [Christianson, David; Creel, Scott] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Harris, Nyeema C.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hurley, Mark A.] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Salmon, ID 83467 USA; [Jackson, DeWaine H.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, Roseburg, OR 97470 USA; [Johnson, Bruce K.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Myers, Woodrow L.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Spokane, WA 99216 USA; [Raithel, Jarod D.] Kihei Charter Sch, Kihei, HI 96753 USA; [Schlegel, Mike] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Kamiah, ID 83536 USA; [Smith, Bruce L.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Jackson, WY 83001 USA; [White, Craig] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Boise, ID 83707 USA; [White, P.

These interaction types may overlap and vary with the season and life-history state of individuals. We studied effects of competition and potential nest predation by common shrews (Sorex araneus) on lactating bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in two seasons. The species coexist and may interact aggressively. Additionally, shrews can prey on nestling voles. We studied bank vole mothers' spatial and temporal adaptations to shrew presence during summer and autumn. Further, we focused on fitness costs, e.g. decreased offspring survival, which bank voles may experience in the presence of shrews. In summer, interference with shrews decreased the voles' home ranges and they spent more time outside the nest, but there were no effects on offspring survival. In autumn, we found decreased offspring survival in enclosures with shrews, potentially due to nest predation by shrews or by increased competition between species. Our results indicate a shift between interaction types depending on seasonal constraints. In summer, voles and shrews seem to interact mainly by interference, whereas resource competition and/or nest predation by shrews gain importance in autumn. Different food availability, changing environmental conditions and the energetic constraints in voles and shrews later in the year may be the reasons for the varying combinations of interaction types and their increasing effects on the inclusive fitness of bank voles. Our study provides evidence for the need of studies combining life history with behavioural measurements and seasonal constraints.","[Liesenjohann, Monique; Liesenjohann, Thilo; Eccard, Jana A.] Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Trebaticka, Lenka; Haapakoski, Marko; Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Trebaticka, Lenka; Haapakoski, Marko; Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Metapopulat Res Grp, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Liesenjohann, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",monique.liesenjohann@uni-potsdam.de,,"Haapakoski, Marko/0000-0003-0901-6319",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [ec361/4-1],This study was supported by the German Science Foundation (grand to JAE ec361/4-1).,,74,17,17,0,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Predators typically reduce the effect of competition on growth and competitors provide alternative prey subjects, which may also alter predation. Here, we examine the independent and combined effects of competition and predation on the survival and growth of hatchling tadpoles of two widespread co-occurring Neotropical hylid frogs (Agalychnis callidryas and Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Using 400 L mesocosms, we used a 2 x 3 factorial substitutive design, which crossed tadpole species composition with the presence or absence of a free-roaming predator (Anax amazili dragonfly larva). Dragonflies were effective predators of both species, but had larger effects on A. callidryas survival. Both species had similar growth rates when alone, whereas A. callidryas grew 30 percent faster than D. ebraccatus when they co-occurred, suggesting interspecific rather than intraspecific competition had relatively stronger effects on D. ebraccatus growth, while the opposite was true for A. callidryas. Predator presence dramatically reduced growth rates of both species and erased this asymmetry. Results suggest that the effects of predator induction (i.e., nonconsumptive effects) on growth were larger than both consumptive and competitive effects. Our study demonstrates that predators have strong effects on both survival and growth of prey, highlighting the potential importance of predators in shaping prey populations and tropical aquatic food web interactions.","[Vonesh, James R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Gonzalez, Sergio C.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Touchon, Justin C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Vonesh, JR (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 W Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",jrvonesh@vcu.edu,"Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988",National Science Foundation (U.S.A.)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717220]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716923]; University of FloridaUniversity of Florida,"We thank the Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente de Panama for permission to conduct this research in Panama (Permiso No. SE/A-41-08) and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for use of their facilities and logistical support.

This study tested whether these changes in gammaridean dominance could have been determined by interspecific competition and unequal mortality, for example by intraguild predation (IGP). Single and two species tests have been carried out in aquariums provided with all substrata present in the main channel of the Rhine. Changes in substratum choice, increased swimming activity and increased mortality of a species were used as indicators of interspecific competition during interaction between gammaridean species. Interspecific competition and mortality between the most abundant invasive gammaridean species in the Rhine, viz. Gammarus tigrinus, Echinogammarus ischnus and Dikerogammarus villosus were tested. In single-species experiments, G. tigrinus and D. villosus showed similar preferences for a stony substratum, whereas E. ischnus mostly occupied the water column. The two-species aquarium experiments indicated direct interference competition for substratum and unequal mortality between G. tigrinus and D. villosus, with D. villosus being the stronger competitor. Competitive stress was influenced by population density, was size-dependent and varied between the different types of substratum due to substratum choice. G. tigrinus did not show any behaviour indicative of interference competition in the presence of E. ischnus, and neither did E. ischnus or D. villosus in the presence of any of the other gammarideans. Swimming in the water layer may already enable E. ischnus to minimise its encounters with the stone-dwelling D. villosus and G. tigrinus. To maximise the encounters between E. ischnus and D. villosus, a fish (Lepomis gibbosus) was added to occupy the water layer during the aquarium experiments. E. ischnus showed a higher mortality in the presence of both D. villosus and fish, probably due to increased stress, as shelter opportunities to escape the predators had been minimised. The study shows that interference competition between gammaridean species can explain the replacement of the North American invader G. tigrinus by D. villosus in the river Rhine. E. ischnus and D. villosus both Ponto-Caspian invaders did not show interference competition in our experiments and co-exist in the Rhine.","[van Riel, M.

Due to the costs of coexistence with competitors, a breeding habitat selection strategy that avoids competitors is expected to be favored. However, many migratory birds appear to gain benefits from an attraction to the presence of resident birds, even though residents are assumed to be competitively dominant. Thus far the mechanisms of this habitat selection process, heterospecific attraction, are unknown, and the consequences for resident birds of migrant attraction remain untested. Through heterospecific attraction, migrants may gain benefits if the density or territory location of residents positively reflects habitat quality, and/or they gain benefits through increased frequency of social interactions with residents in foraging or predator detection. In this experiment, we examined the reciprocal effects of spatial proximity on fitness-related traits in migrant pied flycatcher (Ficedula, hypoleuca) and resident great tit (Parus major) by experimentally forcing them to breed either alone or in close proximity to each other. Surprisingly, great tits bore all the costs of coexistence while flycatchers were unaffected, even gaining slight benefits. In concert with an earlier study, these results suggest that flycatchers use tits as information about good-quality nest-site locations while benefits from social interactions with tits are possible but less important. We suggest that utilizing interspecific social information may be a common phenomenon between species sharing similar resource needs. Our results imply that the effects of interspecific information rise can be asymmetric and may therefore have implications for the patterns and consequences of species coexistence.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; Uppsala Univ, Anim Ecol Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Forsman, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",jukka.forsman@oulu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X",,,,56,54,56,0,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The former species is normally allotopic with the latter two but has recently suffered competition from them following successional changes on sand-dune habitats that have rendered all three species syntopic. In a replicated cage experiment using natural densities of larvae, survivorship of B. calamita was reduced more strongly by interspecific than by intraspecific competitors. Predation did not relieve interspecific competition and in some treatments further increased the mortality of B. calamita. Survival was highly correlated with growth rate, and the negative effects of interspecific competition on growth were much stronger than those of intraspecific competition. Feeding-niche overlaps among all three species were high, and growth rates of B. calamita were related to total algal cell numbers available in the treatment cages. However, larvae in treatments exhibiting interspecific competition also generated large numbers of Anurofeca (= Prototheca) richardsi. This unicellular organism is implicated in interference competition between anurans. B. calamita growth also correlated inversely with A. richardsi numbers. Taken together the data demonstrate strong adverse effects of interspecific competition on the endangered B. calamita and indicate that both resource and interference mechanisms were probably operative, though the former was more important than the latter. Methods for alleviating the destructive impact of competition on the endangered species are discussed.","Univ Sussex, Sch Biol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Beebee, TJC (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Biol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,55,16,19,0,23,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The presence of predatory fish was found to alter the foraging activities of the baetid, but not of the glossosomatid. We investigated the local distribution of Baetis thermicus and Glossosoma sp. to examine the potential for competition between the two grazers in a northern Japanese stream. Further, we carried our a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that the freshwater sculpin Cottus nozawae, when not allowed to attack prey, mediates the resource-limited competitive influences of Baetis on the growth of Glossosoma, but not the reverse. We found a negative correlation between the densities of Baetis and Glossosoma in the stream, suggesting the strong potential for resource-limiting competitive interactions to occur between the grazers. Using a laboratory channel experiment employing a target-neighbor design, neither the presence of sculpin nor the density of the two grazers altered any life-history traits measured for the grazers. However, the proportion of Baetis individuals positioned on the upper surface of a ceramic plate substrate (with greater periphyton biomass) largely decreased in the presence of sculpin, with only a minor behavioral shift being detected in Glossosoma. This difference in behavioral shift resulted in greater growth suppression in Baetis than in Glossosoma. In the absence of sculpin, growth of both target grazers was lowered by experimentally increasing the density of neighboring competitors. In par tial contradiction to the above hypothesis, the growth of not only Glossosoma but also Baetis was never influenced by the density of neighbor competitors when sculpin were present. The biomass of periphyton in the presence of sculpin was greater than when sculpin were absent, and was lower with higher densities of either grazer. Predator-avoidance behavioral modifications in both grazers may be the mechanism responsible for mediation of their exploitative competition.","Chitose Board Educ, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan; Hokkaido Univ Forests, Tomakomai Res Stn, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan; Inst Low Temp Sci, Biodivers Grp, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600019, Japan","Kuhara, N (corresponding author), Chitose Board Educ, 958-1 Kamiosatsu, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan.",naotoshi.kuhara@nifty.ne.jp,,,,,,42,27,27,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1999,87,1,,,,,27,35,,10.2307/3546993,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,248AG,WOS:000083252700003,,,,,2021-09-24,

Ideal free models for unequal competitors predict a truncated competitor phenotype distribution among patches when relative payoffs of phenotypes vary across patches. Partial truncation is expected under field conditions. This prediction was tested in a field experiment with an overwintering population of mute swans (Cygnus olor). 2. Two food patches were generated in which adult and subadult swans were expected to have different relative success. In one patch ('clumped'), pieces of bread were thrown over a small area on the water surface. In the other patch, pieces of bread were scattered over a larger area. 3. When only one patch was offered at a time (no choice situation), adult swans were more successful than subadult swans in the 'clumped' patch, but were similarly successful in the 'scattered' patch. Relative payoffs of adult and subadult swans differed significantly between patches. 4. When the two patches were offered simultaneously, black-headed gulls (Larns ridibundus) competed with the swans to a considerable extent in some replicates. The gulls appeared to be the poorest competitors. They snatched more bread in the scattered than in the clumped patch. Both classes of swans avoided the scattered patch but not the clumped patch with increasing competition from gulls. Gulls preferred the scattered patch and swans increasingly preferred the clumped patch under gull competition, creating a partially truncated distribution. 5. Without the four replicates in which the gulls had consumed more than 25% of the bread, the percentage of adult swans that chose the clumped patch was significantly higher than the percentage of subadult swans that chose that patch. This is the first experimental verification of a partially truncated phenotype distribution. Subadult swans significantly preferred the scattered patch whereas adults tended to prefer the clumped patch.

These larvae live in water-filled holes in fallen and living trees, where they and three other common odonate species are the top predators. By mid wet season, M. coerulatus larvae were found in nearly half of all tree holes that harbored odonates. Although M. coerulatus were typically, but not always, eliminated from holes inhabited by larger heterospecifics, M. coerulatus were more likely to encounter conspecifics than other odonate species. Hole with less than 1 1 of water rarely contained more than a single larva. In large holes where M. coerulatus was the only odonate species present, multiple larvae coexisted at a density of one larva per 1-21 of water. There the absence of 2-4 of the 5 larval size classes, despite a continuous input of eggs, suggested that cannibalism was a common cause of mortality. The size of the final instar, which determined adult body size, was correlated positively with tree hole volume for male, but not female, larvae. Experiments showed that when two larvae were placed together in 0.4-1 holes with abundant tadpole prey, the larger larva killed the smaller one. Often the larva that was killed was not eaten. Small larvae were more tolerant of each other than were pairs of medium of large larvae. Before killing occurred, the presence of larger larvae reduced the growth of smaller individuals, relative to controls. 'Obligate' killing was density-dependent. In 3.0-1 holes with ad libitum prey, conspecific killing occurred until the larval density stabilized at one larva per 1-1.5 1, similar to the density found in large holes under field conditions, For M. coerulatus, cannibalism functions to reduce the number of potential competitors for food in addition to providing nutrition. When interactions between paired larvae in small holes were experimentally prevented, competition for food reduced the growth of one or both larvae relative to controls. Holes that were watered during the dry season supported larval densities similar to those in the wet season. Thus, dry season mortality could not be attributed to a decrease in available prey. Rather, M. coerulatus larvae could not survive more than 1 month of complete drying. Because the dry season typically lasts more than 6 weeks, habitat drying is a secondary source of mortality, affecting second- or third-generation larvae that fail to emerge before tree holes dry out completely.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST,BALBOA,PANAMA",,,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,42,87,94,3,29,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,1994,100,1-2,,,,,118,127,,10.1007/BF00317138,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PR645,WOS:A1994PR64500015,28307035,,,,2021-09-24,

The rationale behind this approach is twofold. First, interspecific competition among herbivorous arthropods is thought to be weak; populations are kept at low levels through the action of natural enemies. Second, the potential benefits of an herbivorous biological control agent must be weighed against the damage it causes to the host plant through its feeding. In the field we have been successful at using less economically important Willamette mites to control economically important Pacific mites. In greenhouse and field experiments reported here, we examined both direct and indirect mechanisms (via the host plant or a shared predator) to explain this negative interaction. In our first greenhouse experiment we injured leaves on single canes of young Zinfandel grapevines with Willamette mites at four density levels, removed these mites and then measured consequences of this past injury on Pacific mites placed on newly produced leaves. Pacific mite populations were reduced significantly by previous Willamette mite injury, suggesting a systemic induced response. In our second greenhouse experiment we measured the relative importance of interspecific interactions between concurrent populations of Willamette and Pacific mites, direct predation by a phytoseiid predator, and interactions between predation and competition (apparent competition). Predators and prey were confined to single canes and, at this small scale, direct predation was of overriding importance while interspecific competition and apparent competition were not significant in determining Pacific mite populations. We examined the relative importance of an early season release of Willamette mites, predaceous mites, or both in a large field experiment conducted in a commercial Zinfandel vineyard. Pacific mite populations were most strongly reduced by the early release of Willamette mites and by midseason abundance of predaceous mites. Our ANOVA results did not detect a significant interaction between the early season release of Willamette mites and predaceous mites. The presence of Willamette mites did not make releases of predators more effective at controlling Pacific mites. Grape yield and berry sugar concentration were unaffected by either Willamette mite or predaceous mite treatments in the year of the mite releases nor in the following season. Path analysis showed that Willamette mite density was never strongly negatively correlated with Pacific mite density in the subsequent time period (2-wk intervals between sampling dates), despite the strong negative effect that the early-season release of Willamette mites had on Pacific mite densities later in the season. This suggests that Willamette mites affected Pacific mites indirectly.",,"ENGLISHLOEB, GM (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,34,33,33,0,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In these microcosms, ladybeetle larvae foraged singly or as conspecific or heterospecific pairs, for pea aphids on bean plants over a two-day period. Similarly sized third instar larvae of Hippodamia convergens and H. tredecimpunctata, H. convergens and H. sinuata, and H. convergens and Coccinella septempunctata, were tested in experiments designed to ensure that paired larvae experienced moderate competition. Interspecific competition in these experiments did not differ significantly from intraspecific competition, in that an individual's weight gain did not depend on whether its competitor was heterospecific or conspecific. Furthermore, aphid populations were reduced equally by heterospecific and conspecific pairs. These results suggest that there is little or no difference between intra and interspecific interactions among larvae of these ladybeetles when two similarly sized individuals co-occur on a host plant.

Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids as well as immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as aphids, whiteflies and soft scales. Field experiments assessing the importance of interspecific competition between autoparasitoids and primary parasitoids, as well as its impact on herbivore suppression, are scarcely found in the ecological literature. 2. Using field data from 40 olive orchards, this study examined the mechanisms that regulate: (i) the interspecific competition between primary parasitoids of the genus Metaphycus and the autoparasitoid Coccophagus lycimnia; and (ii) the density of their shared herbivore host, the soft scale Saissetia oleae. 3. Metaphycus parasitoids used smaller hosts than C. lycimnia, yet did not outcompete C. lycimnia. On the other hand, C. lycimnia preferred to use Metaphycus females as secondary hosts for producing males rather than their own females. This preference might explain why the autoparasitoid negatively affected the density of the primary parasitoids. 4. Parasitism by the autoparasitoid C. lycimnia at the beginning of the season was the sole variable positively related to host mortality throughout the season, showing its greater effect on herbivore suppression. 5. In this study, an autoparasitoid, inferior at resource exploitation, was shown to outcompete a primary parasitoid without disrupting herbivore suppression.","[Marrao, Rosalina; Pereira, Jose A.] Inst Politecn Braganca, Escola Super Agr, CIMO, Braganca, Portugal; [Frago, Enric] CIRAD, Ctr Biol Gest Populat, UMR CBGP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Tena, Alejandro] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Ctra CV 315,Km 10-7, E-46113 Moncada, Spain","Tena, A (corresponding author), Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Ctra CV 315,Km 10-7, E-46113 Moncada, Spain.",atena@ivia.es,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Pereira, Jose A./L-6798-2014","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Pereira, Jose A./0000-0002-2260-0600",,,,44,0,0,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Therefore, survival and reproductive success depend not only on the ability to secure prey but also on minimizing foraging costs. African wild dogs often coexist with lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta); these competitors can seriously increase foraging costs by kleptoparasitism. In this study, we empirically and experimentally assessed the risk and costs of kleptoparasitism for African wild dogs inside Hwange National Park, where hyena densities are high, and outside the park, where hyena densities are lower. Lion densities within the study area have been fluctuating. The risk and costs of kleptoparasitism were determined by comparing direct observations during hunt follows of radio collared African wild dog packs and by the use of experimental call-ups with African wild dog sounds inside and outside Hwange National Park. The risk of kleptoparasitism was found to be significantly higher inside the park. The time it took lions and hyenas to get to the kill site during African wild dog hunts was longer outside the park allowing the dogs a longer carcass access time. The found differences in risk and costs of kleptoparasitism could contribute to African wild dog habitat choice for the buffer zone outside Hwange National Park. As habitat choice in and around protected areas is often related to the possibility of exposure to an edge effect,'' interspecific competition should be considered in the conservation strategy of African wild dogs.","[van der Meer, Ester; Moyo, Mkhalalwa; Rasmussen, Gregory S.

The invasive amphipod has been particularly successful in some habitats (e.g. on pebbles) where it has become one of the most abundant gammarid species. We studied experimentally if the dominant fish Gasterosteus aculeatus preyed differentially on the exotic G. tigrinus and the native Gammarus salinus, if predation differed among habitats, and if one gammarid species facilitated predation on the other. The experiment demonstrated that (1) fish preyed more on the exotic G. tigrinus than the native G. salinus. (2) Predation did not differ among habitats. (3) Gammarus tigrinus facilitated the predation on G. salinus and this facilitation varied among habitats with significant effects on pebbles. Thus, the combined effect of habitat-specific fish predation and competition between gammarid amphipods is a possible explanation of the current range of G. tigrinus in the northern Baltic Sea. G. tigrinus seems to establish in habitats where it can significantly increase fish predation on the native gammarids. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

With these clones, two competition experiments were conducted in two large-scale indoor mesocosms, the Plankton Towers in Plon, Germany. We varied the presence of fish and kairomones. Using allozyme electrophoresis we observed Diel Vertical Migration (DVM) of individual clones. Without fish, two clones belonging to the largest taxa (D. galeata and D. galeata X hyalina) became numerically dominant after three weeks. The mere presence of fish kairomones led to a significant decrease in the niche overlap between the five taxa. With fish present in the towers relative densities of smaller D. cucullata X galeata clones were highest. We observed that under different predation intensities different taxa showed the highest instantaneous rate of increase. Without fish and fish kairomones this rate was the highest for D. galeata, when fish kairomones were present D. galeata X hyalina had the highest relative r.

Recent studies have identified chytridiomycosis as an emerging infections disease, whose widespread occurence poses a significant risk for amphibian populations. We manipulated the presence of B. dendrobatidis in replicated experimental tanks and examined if exposure to this fungus during development could influence recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Bufo and Hyla. Tanks were followed throughout larval development, and we recorded survival. time to metamorphosis. and body mass at metamorphosis. We also tested the effects of competitive and pathogen-mediated stress on developmental stability by measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of surviving metamorphs. B. dendrobatidis had no significant effect on larval survival, but the pathogen reduced metamorphic body mass and increased larval-period length. B. dendrobatidis had different effects oil larval growth depending on the community sructure; in the presence of the pathogen, both Bufo and Hyla metamorphosed at smaller body masses when reared together compared to when reared separately.

FA of hind-limb length was significantly higher for metamorphs front pathogen tanks, but was not associated with density or competitive environment.

This is particularly relevant to classical biological control of cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar) (Tetranychidae) in Africa, as this pest mite is shared by several natural enemies in the Neotropics (its area of origin), two of which have been introduced and established widely in Africa. We conducted two screenhouse experiments using the two neotropical phytoseiid predatory mites, Typhlodromalus aripo DeLeon and Typhlodromalus manihoti Moraes, to determine the effects of single and two-predator species on population dynamics of the two predators and on suppression of M. tanajoa populations. The two predators are thought to be complementary in their impact on their shared prey M. tanajoa, due to similarities in their preference for this prey and to differences in their spatial distribution and foraging activities on cassava. The two predator species were released alone or together at low and at high initial densities of M. tanajoa. In all cases, predator releases resulted in significant suppression of M. tanajoa, but the degree of suppression did not differ among single and two-species releases with one exception: at high initial density of M. tanajoa, releases of T. aripo alone had less impact than that of either T. manihoti alone or of the two species together. Typhlodromalus aripo also appeared to be inferior as a competitor of T. manihoti: at low initial density of M. tanajoa, the proportion of T. aripo in the two-predator release treatments gradually declined and was strikingly lower than in the single species release, probably due to intraguild predation on its larvae by T. manihoti. However, T. aripo persisted longer than T. manihoti after elimination of M. tanajoa . On the basis of this study under semi-natural conditions, it appears that either species is sufficient for controlling M. tanajoa populations, with T. manihoti being more efficient at high initial prey densities and T. aripo at low initial prey densities. At high prey density, T. manihoti increased to large numbers and outcompeted T. aripo. Relevance of these findings to larger spatial scale and under natural conditions is discussed.","Int Inst Trop Agr, Biol Control Ctr Africa, Cotonou, Benin; Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hanna, R (corresponding author), LW Lambourn & Co, IITA Benin, 26 Dingwall Rd, Croydon CR9 3EE, England.",r.hanna@cgiar.org,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,36,18,21,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-3157,1360-0478,,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

Arvicoline rodents have a typical, season-dependent, bimodal, age distribution of breeding individuals within a population. This distribution may influence population fluctuations. In this study, we measured effects of interspecific competition from field voles (Microtus agrestis) on various fitness components of female bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in an age-structured breeding population in large (0.25 ha) outdoor enclosures. We monitored survival, reproduction, and space use of experimental bank vole populations with females from two different age groups. Within the enclosures we manipulated the presence and absence of field voles. When coexisting with field voles, the year-born bank vole females had lower survival rates than the over-wintered ones did. Home ranges of bank voles were smaller in the presence of field voles than in their absence. Characteristics of litters of breeding females were not affected by the competition treatment. Reproduction of the youngest of the year-born females stopped earlier in the season than for over-wintered females although both age groups had reproduced prior to the trial. We did not observe indications of senescence, such as lower reproduction or survival of the over-wintered females in late summer. An earlier cessation of breeding in the younger females suggests an age-specific trade-off of summer reproduction and winter. survival for parous females. Inter- and intraspecific competition seemed to work additively on the year-born, females through direct interference. By selectively reducing survival of younger breeders, interspecific competition could influence age distribution and population growth of breeders toward the end of the breeding season. Because old, over-wintered females are not surviving to the next noribreeding season, the lower survival of young breeders through interspecific competition might impact greatly the structure of the breeding population at the start of the next breeding season, thus altering population growth patterns.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,,,,,,57,14,17,1,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2003,84,12,,,,,3284,3293,,10.1890/02-0220,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762LN,WOS:000187973500018,,,,,2021-09-24,

Research in this area is needed due to the often contradictory predictions provided by the many theoretical models, the increasing dependence on biological control, and the concern that biological control agents may adversely affect some nontarget organisms. We describe a study whereby the occurrence and dynamics of interspecific interactions among three natural enemies (two parasitoids: Encarsia formosa and Encarsia pergandiella; and one predator Delphastus pusillus) of the whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii (previously referred to as Bemisia tabaci strain ''B''), were evaluated in greenhouse cage experiments. Eight populations consisting of all possible combinations of the three natural enemies and one population of whitefly alone were established to test the following hypotheses: (1) Natural enemy introductions are capable of suppressing B. argentifolii populations; (2) all interspecific interactions are detrimental to achieving biological control; (3) the likelihood of achieving biological control decreases as the potential number of interspecific interactions increases; and (4) the species composition of biological control agents is of greater consequence than the number of natural enemy species released. In addition, we tested the hypothesis (5) that the frequency of interspecific interactions increases with a decrease in host or prey availability. Our results demonstrate that all combinations of natural enemies provided significant levels of whitefly suppression. While the intensities of interspecific interactions among natural enemy species were frequently positively and significantly correlated with the densities of parasitized whitefly, interspecific interactions among natural enemies were not detrimental to achieving higher levels of biological control. The composition of species released, rather than the number of species released, was of greater importance to accomplishing biological control. Releases of D. pusillus in combination with one or both of the parasitoids provided the greatest levels of whitefly suppression. These results suggest that the types of interspecific interactions rather than the numbers of interspecific interactions among natural enemies may be important to the outcome of inundative biological control programs.

Daphnia pulicaria is mostly found in the hypolimnion whereas D. galeata mendotae undergoes diel vertical migration between the hypolimnion and the epilimnion. I examined how habitat segregation between these two potentially competing species might be affected by trophic interactions with their resources and predators by performing a field experiment in deep enclosures in which I manipulated fish predation, nutrient levels, and the density of epilimnetic Daphnia. The results of the experiment indicate that habitat use by D. pulicaria can be jointly regulated by competition for food from epilimnetic Daphnia and predation by fishes. Patterns of habitat segregation between the two Daphnia species were determined by predation by fish but not by nutrient levels: The removal of epilimnetic fish predators resulted in higher zooplankton and lower epilimnetic phytoplankton densities and allowed D. pulicaria to expand its habitat distribution into the epilimnion. In contrast, increased resource productivity resulted in higher densities of both Daphnia species but did not affect phytoplankton levels or habitat use by Daphnia. The two species exhibit a trade-off in their ability to exploit resources and their susceptibility to predation by fish. D. g. mendotae (the less susceptible species) may thus restrict D. pulicaria (the better resource exploiter) from the epilimnion when fish are common due to lower minimum resource requirements than those needed by D. pulicaria to offset the higher mortality rate imposed by selective epilimnetic fish predators. D. g. mendotae does not appear to have this effect in the absence of fish.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,KELLOGG BIOL STN,HICKORY CORNERS,MI 49060",,,,,,,,51,83,83,0,24,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,86,4,,,,,510,520,,10.1007/BF00318317,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN885,WOS:A1991FN88500008,28313332,,,,2021-09-24,

These types of interaction are particularly exemplified in freshwater pond communities, where substantial size variation exists both within and among species of top consumers. We investigated whether density dependence can modify the outcome of size-structured interactions between larval stages of two pond-breeding salamanders, Ambystoma annulatum and Ambystoma opacum. Size structure exists in populations of these species due to variation in the timing of breeding, which we hypothesised would amplify predation rates and competitive asymmetries from the early-arriving species (A. annulatum) on the later-arriving species (A. opacum). We manipulated the relative densities of both A. annulatum and A. opacum in outdoor mesocosms. We maintained the experiment through metamorphosis, and analysed size at metamorphosis, larval period length and survival of each species. Ambystoma annulatum imparted a strong density-dependent effect on A. opacum through a combination of predation and competition. Survival of A. opacum was negatively related to the density of A. annulatum. For the A. opacum that survived, body size was reduced and larval period lengthened at higher A. annulatum densities, indicative of interspecific competition that was partly explained by resource pre-emption. In contrast, A. annulatum was only affected by intraspecific density-dependent competition. Our results suggest that density-dependent effects reinforce asymmetric interactions among larval salamanders. However, the intensity of the asymmetric interactions is mediated by the arrival time and size of conspecifics. Specifically, earlier-arriving species can negatively affect the later-arriving species via size-mediated predation and competition. The interactive effects of density dependence and arrival time of community members are probably a common mechanism generating size variability in ecological communities. Yet, most studies only evaluate one mechanism or the other. By interweaving these two processes, our work displays the importance of understanding context-dependence in species interactions.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Burkhart, Jacob J.; Davenport, Jon M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Biol, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Biol, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",thander@siue.edu,,,,,,54,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

We use replacement series experiments with three species of blow flies: Phormia regina (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae), and Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) to characterize competitive relationships. From experimental results, P regina showed a significant competitive advantage over L. sericata. Infestation of carrion differs between L. sericata and P. regina; specifically, L sericata oviposits on carrion without any delay, while P. regina typically delays oviposition. Our findings are consistent with the notion that differences in oviposition times represent a mechanism for L. sericata to avoid potential competition. Competition by C. rufifacies differs since C. rufifacies, in the event of a limited food supply, will prey on other maggot species. In replacement series experiments, C. rufifacies killed all P. regina in mixed treatments, representing an ultimate competitive advantage. In the United States, these two species do not often overlap because of differences in seasonal distribution. However, with climate change, phenological separation may grow less distinct. Surprisingly, in replacement series experiments with C. rufifacies and L. sericata, no competitive interactions were observed. In other studies, L. sericata has been shown to form clusters away from predaceous maggots, allowing improved survival, which may account for the absence of predation by C. rufifacies. Finally, this study shows that replacement series models are useful in measuring competition, supporting the notion that interspecific competition between necrophagous insect species may have driven life history traits of those species.","[MacInnis, Amber E.; Higley, Leon G.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, 1400 R St, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","MacInnis, AE (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, 1400 R St, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",thesocialblowfly@gmail.com,"Higley, Leon G/E-3311-2010",,,,,56,0,0,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Rather, the differences that promote stable coexistence can be those which cause each species to experience stronger intraspecific than interspecific competition. Recent approaches have established how to detect the demographic signature of these competitive effects, but alone they cannot elucidate the ecological differences among species that yield these patterns. Here, we present a unifying experimental and observational framework that identifies potential ecological differences among species shaping their responses to intra- and interspecific competition. We first describe a conceptual model establishing why the strength of intra- and interspecific competitive interactions should vary along environmental gradients related to species ecological differences. We then show how to apply the framework using Enallagma damselflies, a diverse group of predatory aquatic insects. To determine how species responded to intra- and interspecific competition along environmental gradients, we experimentally manipulated the relative abundances of three species and replicated this across five lakes which varied in environmental conditions affecting larval damselfly per capita growth and mortality rates-key vital rates regulating their populations. Results suggest Enallagma are ecologically differentiated in ways that in some communities can result in intraspecific competition exceeding interspecific competition. However, in many cases the opposite was true, or the effects of intra- and interspecific competition were equivalent via growth and mortality responses. Moreover, these effects tended to be weak and asymmetrical among competitors, which suggests that differential responses of larval growth and mortality to intra- and interspecific competition may not contribute strongly to the maintenance of Enallagma diversity. Different environmental factors appear to shape these demographic responses to competition, providing insight into the ecological mechanisms regulating damselfly assemblages. This framework can be broadly applied to identify the ecological differences among species that may promote coexistence, advancing knowledge of the mechanisms underlying coexistence and overcoming some limitations of purely phenomenological approaches.","[Ousterhout, Brittany H.; Serrano, Mabel; Bried, Jason T.; Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Ousterhout, Brittany H.] Natl Great Rivers Res & Educ Ctr, East Alton, IL USA; [Bried, Jason T.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Siepielski, AM (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",amsiepie@uark.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021; Bried, Jason/AAF-9492-2021","Bried, Jason/0000-0002-8659-9848",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1748945],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB1748945",,83,5,5,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Carabid communities are regulating weeds in arable fields and include a mix of species ranging from granivores to predators that are obligate omnivores. It is not clear from field studies whether granivore and obligate omnivore species either contribute equally or are complementary in the process of weed suppression, and little is known about the impact of potential predator interference within carabid communities on weed suppression. We compared the weed seed foraging strategy of the granivore Harpalus affinis and the obligate omnivore Poecilus cupreus. Using no-choice test experiments, we compared their activity and seed acceptance for four weed species through a scoring of the proportion of tested individuals consuming weeds, their latency before the consumption of the first seed and the total number of seeds consumed. We then evaluated their seed acceptance for dandelion seed Taraxacum officinale under predator interference by using chemical cues of carabids and tested the impact of three treatments, namely cues of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition and intraguild predation. We found that the obligate omnivore P. cupreus was highly active, had a low latency before consuming its first seed but had an interest in only two of the four weed species. P. cupreus seed acceptance remained unchanged in the presence of predator cues. By contrast, H. affinis was slow to start its seed consumption, accepted equally seeds of the four weed species and significantly increased its seed consumption in the presence of cues mimicking intraguild predation. These findings indicate that the two species differ in their foraging strategies, and as such, could have different contributions to weed seed suppression. This novel result calls for further studies documenting the foraging strategy of carabid species that thrive in arable fields as this could significantly improve our understanding of the delivery of weed seed regulation.

The species responded differently in their proportional use of two habitat types, a low cover (productive but riskier) and a high cover (safer but poorer). When alone, field voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability at low densities, but decreased its use with increasing density. Sibling voles, however, avoided the low-cover habitat in single-species populations. Under interspecific competition, the habitat-use patterns switched between species: sibling voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability, with decreasing use as densities increased. Sibling voles responded to predation risk by showing a stronger density-dependent decrease in the use of low-cover habitat. Field voles, initially using mostly high cover, did not change behaviour under risk of predation.

It has the potential to shape population dynamics and community structure. Although there is much empirical evidence for the occurrence of intraguild predation in natural ecosystems, the study of its effects is mainly limited to short-term microcosm experiments. There is, therefore, certain skepticism about its actual significance in nature. A relevant concern is that there is no consensus regarding criteria to evaluate the possible occurrence of intraguild predation in short-term experiments, and methodological differences may therefore underlie apparent inconsistencies among studies. Our purpose here was to evaluate existing criteria to offer guidance for the design of experiments to determine whether two species may potentially engage in intraguild predation. The criteria are based on the condition that intraguild predators need to experience immediate energetic gains when feeding on the intraguild prey. Thus, a relevant experimental design must quantify predation but also fitness benefits of feeding on the other species, i.e. increases in reproduction, somatic growth, or survival.","[Fonseca, Morgana Maria; Pallini, Angelo] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Montserrat, Marta; Guzman, Celeste; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada] IHSM UMA CSIC, Inst Mediterranean & Subtrop Hort La Mayora, Malaga 29750, Spain; [Guzman, Celeste] EEZA CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",arne.janssen@uva.nl,"Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada/AAF-4983-2020; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Montserrat, Marta/A-7625-2012; Guzman, Celeste/L-4519-2014; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/Z-3908-2019","Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Montserrat, Marta/0000-0002-6859-4955; Guzman, Celeste/0000-0003-2053-4213; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/0000-0002-2135-8488; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada/0000-0002-8775-7537",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [151777/2013-6]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [CBB-3000309]; MINECO [CGL2015-66192-R],"We thank two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

Using a long-term laboratory mesocosm experiment, we quantified competition strength and the plasticity of foraging traits in a guild of generalist predators of arthropods with a range of foraging modalities. Each mesocosm contained eight passively foraging pink sundews, and we employed an experimental design where treatments were the presence or absence of a sit-and-wait foraging spider and actively foraging toad crossed with five levels of prey abundance. We hypothesized that actively foraging toads would outcompete the other species at low prey abundance, but that spiders and sundews would exhibit plasticity in foraging traits to compensate for strong competition when prey were limited. Results generally supported our hypotheses. Toads had a greater effect on sundews at low prey abundances, and toad presence caused spiders to locate webs higher above the ground. Additionally, the closer large spider webs were to the ground, the greater the trichome densities produced by sundews. Also, spider webs were larger with than without toads and as sundew numbers increased, and these effects were more prominent as resources became limited. Finally, spiders negatively affected toad growth only at low prey abundance. These findings highlight the long-term importance of foraging modality and plasticity of foraging traits in determining the strength of competition within and across taxonomic kingdoms. Future research should assess whether plasticity in foraging traits helps to maintain coexistence within this guild and whether foraging modality can be used as a trait to reliably predict the strength of competitive interactions.","[Jennings, David E.; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, 4202 East Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Krupa, James J.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Jennings, DE (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, 4112 Plant Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",david.e.jennings@gmail.com,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Jennings, David/0000-0001-7179-3069",American Arachnological Society Grant; Fern Garden Club Scholarship; Rutlish Foundation Grant; Sigma Xi GIAR; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM109499] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Our research was supported by an American Arachnological Society Grant, Fern Garden Club Scholarship, Rutlish Foundation Grant and Sigma Xi GIAR to DEJ.

Belowground predators feeding on microbial grazers like Collembola could decelerate nutrient mineralization by reducing microbial turnover in the soil, which in turn could negatively influence plant growth. However, empirical evidences for the ecological significance of belowground predators on nutrient cycling and plant communities are scarce. Here, we manipulated predator density (Hypoaspis aculeifer: predatory mite) with equal densities of three Collembola species as a prey in four functionally dissimilar plant communities in experimental microcosms: grass monoculture (Poa pratensis), herb monoculture (Rumex acetosa), legume monoculture (Trifolium pratense), and all three species as a mixed plant community. Density manipulation of predators allowed us to test for density-mediated effects of belowground predators on Collembola and lower trophic groups. We hypothesized that predator density will reduce Collembola population causing a decrease in nutrient mineralization and hence detrimentally affect plant growth. First, we found a density-dependent population change in predators, that is, an increase in low-density treatments, but a decrease in high-density treatments. Second, prey suppression was lower at high predator density, which caused a shift in the soil microbial community by increasing the fungal: bacterial biomass ratio, and an increase of nitrification rates, particularly in legume monocultures. Despite the increase in nutrient mineralization, legume monocultures performed worse at high predator density. Further, individual grass shoot biomass decreased in monocultures, while it increased in mixed plant communities with increasing predator density, which coincided with elevated soil N uptake by grasses. As a consequence, high predator density significantly increased plant complementarity effects indicating a decrease in interspecific plant competition. These results highlight that belowground predators can relax interspecific plant competition by increasing nutrient mineralization through their density-dependent cascading effects on detritivore and soil microbial communities.","[Thakur, Madhav Prakash; Herrmann, Martina; Steinauer, Katja; Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Thakur, Madhav Prakash; Steinauer, Katja; Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Herrmann, Martina; Rennoch, Saskia] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Thakur, MP (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",madhav.thakur@idiv.de,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Cesarz, Simone/A-8468-2012; Cesarz, Simone/AAA-8702-2020; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019","Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Thakur, Madhav/0000-0001-9426-1313",German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ei 862/2],German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG; Ei 862/2).,,85,14,15,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Mites of the families Stigmaeidae and Phytoseiidae coexist in various agricultural crops, often promoting the biological control of pest mites. The aim of this work was to study the interactions of Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Phytoseiidae) and Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira (Stigmaeidae), in the presence or absence of B. phoenicis. Two experiments were carried out. In the first, a N. californicus female was placed in each leaf disc arena, with eggs of B. phoenicis and A. brasiliensis as food sources. In the second, an A. brasiliensis female was placed in each arena, with eggs of B. phoenicis and N. californicus as food sources. Adults of both predators were able to consume both types of eggs available as food sources, but they fed on considerably higher proportions of B. phoenicis than on eggs of the predator. Eggs of A. brasiliensis were not a suitable food source for N. californicus, which produced only 0.1 egg per female per day when only eggs of that species were present in the experimental unit. The results suggest that eggs of N. californicus were a suitable food source for A. brasiliensis, which oviposited 1.12 eggs per day, when only eggs of N. californicus were provided to the stigmaeid mite. The possible interactions among N. californicus, A. brasiliensis and B. phoenicis in citrus orchards are discussed.","[da Silva, Marcos Zatti; Sato, Mario Eidi] APTA, Inst Biol, Lab Acarol, BR-13001970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [da Silva, Marcos Zatti] Inst Biol, BR-13092543 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Leite de Oliveira, Carlos Amadeu] UNESP, Fac Ciencias Agr & Vet, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Nicastro, Roberto Lomba] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Energia Nucl Agr, Lab Irradiacao Alimentos & Radioentomol, BR-13400970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil","da Silva, MZ (corresponding author), Inst Biol, Rodovia Heitor Penteado Km 3-5, BR-13092543 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",makdsil@ig.com.br,"Sato, Mario/AAD-1386-2020","Sato, Mario/0000-0001-5947-7717","FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [Process 2008/52691-9, Process 2013/05829-3, Process 2009/08789-7]; CNPq-Brazil (The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)","The authors are thankful to FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation) for the financial support to this research (Processes 2008/52691-9 and 2013/05829-3) and for the Postdoctoral fellowship to Marcos Zatti da Silva (Process 2009/08789-7); also, thanks go to CNPq-Brazil (The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) for providing the research fellowship to the second author.

To determine whether intraguild predation and competition for prey may be partially responsible for the decline, we paired first-instar larvae of two populations of C. novemnotata (eastern and western) with first-instar C. septempunctata at low or high aphid densities. Survival of both C. novemnotata populations was significantly lower when larvae were paired with C. septempunctata, and western C. novemnotata exhibited significantly lower survival compared with the eastern population. This relationship depended on aphid density with the greatest survival of both C. novemnotata populations occurring at the high aphid density. Both male and female C. novemnotata weighed less on the day of eclosion when paired with C. septempunctata as compared with pairings with conspecifics. In a second test, C. septempunctata and C. novemnotata instars were varied at the start of the trial and C. novemnotata survival to adulthood in the presence of C. septempunctata was dependent of the instar of C. novemnotata used to initiate the experiment. C. novemnotata exhibited higher rates of survival and weighed significantly more on the day of eclosion when C. novemnotata was older than its C. septempunctata partner. These results suggest that interspecific competition including intraguild predation by C. septempunctata may contribute to C. novemnotata population declines, but that the intensity of this impact may vary across C. novemnotata populations.","[Turnipseed, Rakim K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Turnipseed, Rakim K.; Ugine, Todd A.; Losey, John E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Turnipseed, RK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rturnipseed@berkeley.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank the Lost Lady Project participants for helping us to collect rare species to start our colonies, and the National Science Foundation for project and salary support.

Interspecific competition and facilitation between predators may either enhance or dampen trophic cascades, ultimately influencing total predator effects on communities and biogeochemical cycling of ecosystems. However, previous studies have only investigated the effects of a single predator species on CO2 flux of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we measured and compared the individual and joint effects of predatory damselfly larvae and diving beetles on total prey biomass, leaf litter processing, and dissolved CO2 concentrations of experimental bromeliad ecosystems. Damselfly larvae created strong trophic cascades that reduced CO2 concentrations by 46 % relative to no-predator treatments. Conversely, the effects of diving beetles on prey biomass, leaf litter processing, and dissolved CO2 were not statistically different to no-predator treatments. Relative to multiplicative null models, the presence of damselfly larvae and diving beetles together resulted in antagonistic relations that eliminated trophic cascades and top-down influences on CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, we showed that the antagonistic interactions between predators occurred due to a tactile response that culminated in competitive displacement of damselfly larvae. Our results demonstrate that predator identity and predator-predator interactions can influence CO2 concentrations of an aquatic ecosystem. We suggest that predator effects on CO2 fluxes may depend on the particular predator species removed or added to the ecosystem and their interactions with other predators.","[Atwood, Trisha B.; Richardson, John S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & C onservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4069, Australia; [Hammill, Edd; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hammill, Edd; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hammill, Edd] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia","Atwood, TB (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & C onservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",tatwood16@gmail.com,"Richardson, John/G-1513-2012","Richardson, John/0000-0001-8135-7447",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada) grants,"We would like to thank J.

We examined whether intraspecific density-dependence altered IG predator traits, as well as the subsequent interspecific effects among its intraguild prey within a larval salamander guild. Four densities of ringed salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum), the IG predator, were combined with the presence/absence of spotted salamanders (A. maculatum), the IG prey, within experimental mesocosms. We modeled the effects of A. annulatum density on both conspecific and heterospecific responses that would be indicative of density-dependent competition and predation, respectively. We also modeled the reciprocal interspecific effects of A. maculatum on A. annulatum. We found that increasing intraspecific density negatively affected morphological traits but not survival of A. annulatum. No interspecific effects of A. maculatum on A. annulatum were observed. Alternatively, traits of A. maculatum showed nonlinear relationships with increasing A. annulatum density. Thinning effects of A. annulatum on A. maculatum were observed, as survival was positively and size negatively related for A. maculatum with IG predator density. The temporal overlap of the IG predator and prey also increased nonlinearly with IG predator density, intensifying the potential encounter rate of the two species. Overall, this study shows that density-dependent processes in IG predators can significantly affect traits of both themselves, as well as IG prey, which could ultimately change whether competition or predation occurs between the two groups.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 110 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",tlarkf@mail.missouri.edu,,"Semlitsch, Raymond/0000-0002-7999-5762",Department of Defense Strategic Environment Research and Development Program [RC-2155],"We would like to thank the Semlitsch lab for their input on study design, D.

However, long-term analyses of size-dependent interactions within simpler network modules, for instance, competitive guilds, are scant. Here, we model the assembly dynamics of the largest breeding seabird community in the Mediterranean basin during the last 30 years. This unique data set allowed us to test, through a natural experiment, whether body size drove the assembly and dynamics of an ecological guild growing from very low numbers after habitat protection. Although environmental stochasticity accounted for most of community variability, the population variance explained by interspecific interactions, albeit small, decreased sharply with increasing body size. Since we found a demographic gradient along a body size continuum, in which population density and stability increase with increasing body size, the numerical effects of interspecific interactions were proportionally higher on smaller species than on larger ones. Moreover, we found that the per capita interaction coefficients were larger the higher the size ratio among competing species, but only for the set of interactions in which the species exerting the effect was greater. This provides empirical evidence for long-term asymmetric interspecific competition, which ultimately prompted the local extinction of two small species during the study period. During the assembly process stochastic predation by generalist carnivores further triggered community reorganizations and global decays in population synchrony, which disrupted the pattern of interspecific interactions. These results suggest that the major patterns detected in complex food webs can hold as well for simpler sub-modules of these networks involving non-trophic interactions, and highlight the shifting ecological processes impacting on assembling vs. asymptotic communities.","[Almaraz, Pablo] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante 33012, Spain; [Almaraz, Pablo] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Stable Isotope Biogeochem Lab, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [Almaraz, Pablo] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Oro, Daniel] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Populat Ecol Grp, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain","Almaraz, P (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Carretera Beniel,Km 3-2, Alicante 33012, Spain.",palmaraz@gmail.com,"Almaraz, Pablo/A-3683-2014; Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012","Almaraz, Pablo/0000-0003-1416-2695; Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007",Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya; ICONA (Spanish Ministry of the Environment); Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2009-08298],"We are grateful to all the people participating in the seabird monitoring at the Ebro Delta over the years, particularly to Albert Martinez-Vilalta, Meritxell Genovart, Albert Bertolero, Julia Piccardo, Jose Manuel Igual, and Antoni Curco, who contributed to organizing and executing the censuses.

The effects of trahira density (treatment groups: addition, removal, and reference) in two habitat categories (open and macrophyte-covered areas) on attributes of the fish assemblage structure were evaluated (using rm-ANOVA) over 120 days. Reductions in species richness were recorded in all assemblages and were more pronounced at the end of the experiment within macrophyte-covered areas of the lakes where H. aff. malabaricus was removed. In these lakes, the number of fish was also significantly smaller and evenness was significantly higher than in those in which trahira were added or maintained at natural densities. The increase of the relative abundance of all size classes over the first 60 days on the assemblages where trahira was present, and the decrease of the small-sized fish where trahira was absent contributed to the lack of pronounced alterations in total biomass. The absence of the predator from its preferred habitat was found to negatively affect the less abundant species, which seemed to be highly sensitive to the effects of interspecific competition among prey species. In addition to the well-known effects of hydrological seasonality, the role played by native predators might be important in determining the persistence of local species in the fish assemblages of Neotropical floodplains.","[Petry, Ana Cristina] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-27910970 Macae, RJ, Brazil; [Gomes, Luiz Carlos; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio] Univ Estadual Maringa, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Piana, Pitagoras Augusto] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, R Fac, BR-85903000 Toledo, PR, Brazil","Petry, AC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, R Rotary Club Sn,CP 119331, BR-27910970 Macae, RJ, Brazil.",ac_petry@yahoo.com.br; lcgomes@nupelia.uem.br; pitapiana@yahoo.com.br; agostinhoaa@nupelia.uem.br,"Agostini, Angelo/D-5888-2013; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Petry, Ana/J-6851-2012; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/S-1538-2019; Inau, Inct/J-9853-2013","Agostini, Angelo/0000-0002-4707-9444; Petry, Ana/0000-0001-9039-2738; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444; gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; Piana, Pitagoras Augusto/0000-0002-4666-6663",National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [142220/2001-9],"This study is part of the PhD dissertation of ACP, in the Program of Environmental Sciences, of the Maringa State University, in the long-term program PELD Site-6.

Interactions between species in different trophic levels can mediate interspecific competition; e.g. predators are known to reduce competition between prey species by suppressing their population sizes. A parallel phenomenon may take place in host-parasite systems, with host defence mediating competition between parasite species. We experimentally investigated the impact of host defence (preening) on competitive interactions between two species of feather-feeding lice: 'wing' lice Columbicola columbae and 'body' lice Campanulotes compar. Both species are host-specific parasites that co-occur on rock pigeons Columba livia. We show that wing lice and body lice compete and that host defence mediates the magnitude of this competitive interaction. Competition is asymmetrical; wing louse populations are negatively impacted by body lice, but not vice versa. This competitive asymmetry is consistent with the fact that body lice predominate in microhabitats on the host's body that offer the most food and the most space. Our results indicate that host-defence-mediated competition can influence the structure of parasite communities and may play a part in the evolution of parasite diversity.","[Bush, Sarah E.; Malenke, Jael R.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Bush, SE (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",sbush@ku.edu,,"Bush, Sarah/0000-0002-2913-4876",,,,47,52,53,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

This may happen via differential individual properties of prey animals (e.g. vigilance, escape) or via habitat effects making hunting by a predator easier and more rewarding in some habitats, or both. Furthermore, community dynamics may be influenced by predator mediated apparent competition, in which an increase in one prey type has negative effects on another prey type indirectly via the shared predator. We summarize the current knowledge from the field in a model predator-prey system consisting of sympatric boreal vole species and their common specialist predator and review field studies using predator manipulation and studies on the responses of individuals in the laboratory and in outdoor enclosures. The vole species studied represent different prey types that are thought to have different vulnerabilities. Our observations on the main resident specialist predator, the least weasel (Mustela nivalis nivalis L.), show that it hunts according to prey availability and suitability of the hunting habitat. Prey voles respond to the presence of the predator behaviorally in various ways to avoid predation. We conclude that even if the least weasel is a specialized predator of small rodents it acts like a generalist predator within the small rodent guild and may facilitate the coexistence of prey species via predator switching. This may lead to interspecific synchrony between prey populations, which has often been observed. We suggest that the processes determining the community impact of predator-prey interactions are driven by the behavioral arms race between the predator and the prey, together with the habitat-dependent density of prey and net gain for the predator.","[Sundell, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland","Sundell, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",janne.sundell@helsinki.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [52045, 44887, 208478]","We are grateful to the Academy of Finland (projects 52045, 44887 and 208478) for funding our research.

Multiple regressions with data collected on 11 occasions on fixed back-reef and fore-reef sites suggested that the densities of the congener, other crevice-dwellers, and predators did not significantly affect the density of P. argus in either reef zone, or of P. guttatus on the back-reef, where coexistence of both lobster species was greatest. In contrast, there was a significant negative relationship between predators and the density of P. guttatus on the fore-reef, where this species was dominant. Congeneric cohabitation in dens was less than expected by chance, but this pattern may reflect a differential use of shelter resources rather than interspecific competition. P. guttatus was more prevalent in dens over the middle and upper third of the reef profile, and P. argus over the lower and middle third of the reef profile. Whether individuals cohabited with conspecifics, congeners, or resided solitarily, P. guttatus was more prevalent at the walls and/or ceiling and P. argus on the floor of dens. This differential use of shelter resources may be related to the differential vulnerability to predators, which may have promoted local coexistence of these congeners in reef habitats.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Cancun 77500, Mexico","Lozano-Alvarez, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, PO Box 1152, Cancun 77500, Mexico.",elozano@mar.icmyl.unam.mx,"Fourzan, Patricia Briones/AAD-4736-2020","Briones-Fourzan, Patricia/0000-0003-4096-1415",,,,69,19,19,2,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,JUN,2007,26,2,,,,,361,373,,10.1007/s00338-007-0207-0,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,179RF,WOS:000247307100019,,,,,2021-09-24,

The field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the sibling vole (M. rossiaemeridionalis) are sympatric close relatives which compete for similar resources. Previous non-experimental studies suggest that the smaller sibling vole is a superior competitor, yet more vulnerable to predation than the larger field vole. We studied the effects of coexistence on population densities, reproductive parameters, and survival in these two species by means of experimentation in large, predator-free outdoor enclosures. While populations of both species reached higher densities in the absence of the other, field voles appeared to suffer more from interspecific competition than sibling voles. The proportion of young individuals in the population was higher in the sibling vole than in the field vole at the end of the experiment. The presence of a coexisting species reduced the survival of field voles. Sibling voles, on the other hand, appeared to suffer more from intraspecific competition than interspecific competition. On a population level, the sibling vole seems to be a superior competitor in the absence of predators due to better survival and possibly a higher reproductive capacity. However, predation probably has a profound influence on the interspecific dynamics of these two species indicating that in natural surroundings apparent competition (i.e. competition via shared predators) is stronger than direct competition.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Koivisto, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",elanko@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509",,,,46,10,11,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2007,116,1,,,,,156,162,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15254.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,125AJ,WOS:000243413600015,,,,,2021-09-24,

In particular, in those cases where a competitive hierarchy exists among prey species, the presence of certain keystone predators can result in enhanced diversity in the prey community. However, little is known regarding the influence of keystone predator presence on invaded prey communities. Given the widespread occurrence of invasive species and substantial concern regarding their ecological impacts, studies on this topic are needed. In this study I used naturalistic replications of an experimental tadpole assemblage to assess the influence of predatory eastern newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, on the outcome of interspecific competition among native and nonindigenous tadpoles. When newts were absent, the presence of the tadpoles of one invasive species, the Cuban treefrog, Osteopilus septentrionalis, resulted in decreased survival and growth rate of the dominant native species, Bufo terrestris, and dominance of the tadpole assemblage by O. septentrionalis. However, the presence of one adult newt generally reduced or eliminated the negative impacts of O. septentrionalis tadpoles, resulting in comparable survival and performance of native species in invaded and noninvaded treatments.

While immature individuals and large-sized adults of H. tridens occurred over the intertidal areas, the young adults of H. tridens were found only in the upper part of the intertidal area. This difference in the pattern of distribution between the young adults and the immature individuals of H. tridens seemed to be derived from interspecific competition or intraguild predation between H. tridens and H. japonica and/or intraspecific interactions within each species. These two species have the same of detritivore and carnivore food habits, and conspecific predation within and/or intraguild reciprocal predation between them were frequently observed in the field. In the present study, we performed field caging experiments to examine the dependence of predation ability on size between the two species. When individuals were <= 7.0 mm carapace width (CW), H. japonica had a higher ability to prey on members of H. tridens of the same size than H. tridens had on those of H. japonica. When individuals were >= 8.0 mm CW, there was no difference between the two species in terms of predatory ability, and the predation rate itself decreased. Therefore, H. japonica can exclude H. tridens from the lower habitats. However, the large sized individuals of H. tridens may intrude into the lower part of the intertidal area from the upper part. They can be against H. japonica, and can prey on the small sized individuals of H. japonica. However, thick sediment set in the cages increased the survival rate of the small individuals of H. japonica, because burrows dug in the sediment could be refuges for those of H. japonica from the intraguild predation by the large sized individuals of H. tridens. These refuges for the small individuals of H. japonica can be refuges also for those of H. tridens. However, burrows cannot be refuges from intraguild predation between similar-sized individuals of two species of the genus Helice. We can conclude that intraguild predation by H. japonica excluded the immature individuals of H. tridens in the lower habitat and restricted the young adults of H. tridens to the upper habitats in the estuary.","Ehime Univ, Ctr Marine Environm Studies, Matsuyama, Ehime 790, Japan","Omori, K (corresponding author), Ehime Univ, Ctr Marine Environm Studies, 2-5 Bunkyo Cho, Matsuyama, Ehime 790, Japan.",ohmori@mserv.sci.ehime-u.ac.jp,,,,,,37,3,4,0,5,CRUSTACEAN SOC,SAN ANTONIO,"840 EAST MULBERRY, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78212 USA",0278-0372,,,J CRUSTACEAN BIOL,J.

The arctic fox in mainland Europe is endangered, while the red fox is increasing its range in the north. It has been suggested that the southern distribution limit of the arctic fox is determined by interspecific competition with the red fox. This has been criticised, on the basis that the species co-exist on a regional scale. However, if the larger red fox is superior and interspecific competition important, the arctic fox should avoid close contact, especially during the breeding season. Consequently, the distribution of breeding dens for the two species would be segregated on a much smaller spatial and temporal scale, in areas where they are sympatric. We tested this hypothesis by analysing den use of reproducing arctic and red foxes over 9 years in Sweden. High quality dens were inhabited by reproducing arctic foxes more often when no red foxes bred in the vicinity. Furthermore, in two out of three cases when arctic foxes did reproduce near red foxes, juveniles were killed by red foxes. We also found that breeding arctic foxes occupied dens at higher altitudes than red foxes did. in a large-scale field experiment, red foxes were removed, but the results were not conclusive. However, we conclude that on the scale of individual territories, arctic foxes avoid areas with red foxes. Through interspecific interference competition, the red fox might thus be excluding the arctic fox from breeding in low altitude habitat, which is most important in years when food abundance is limited and competition is most fierce. With high altitude refuges being less suitable, even small-scale behavioural effects could scale up to significant effects at the population level.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Tannerfeldt, M (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",tanner@zoologi.su.se,"Angerbjorn, Anders/AAX-3670-2021; Angerbjorn, Anders/A-5982-2013; Elmhagen, Bodil/M-4444-2014","Angerbjorn, Anders/0000-0001-5535-9086; Elmhagen, Bodil/0000-0001-5496-4727",,,,52,141,144,0,185,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2002,132,2,,,,,213,220,,10.1007/s00442-002-0967-8,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,580PL,WOS:000177242900008,28547354,,,,2021-09-24,

The experiment was repeated two times on mature compound leaves in the held in the autumn of 1997 and summer of 1998 and once in a greenhouse, on young seedlings with simple leaves. Our results suggest that interspecific competition was variable and asymmetric; in both the Summer 98 experiment and the greenhouse experiment, reproduction of M. crynaefoliae was significantly reduced in the mixed species treatments relative to the single species treatment, while M. caryella reproduction was significantly reduced only in the Summer 98 experiment. No evidence of an effect of competition on reproduction was found in the Autumn 97 experiment. M. caryella body size was reduced in one of the mixed species treatments in the Autumn 97 experiment. Body size of both aphid species was reduced in the mixed species treatments of the greenhouse experiment. The introduction of green lacewing larvae reduced the reproduction of aphids in two of the three experiments in comparison to controls. However, a significant interaction between aphid and predator treatment (M. caryella in the greenhouse experiment) was found in only one experiment. Variation in the outcome of competition was more likely to be due to aspects of plant quality, including leaf age and previous aphid feeding.","Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Petersen, MK (corresponding author), Dept Ecol, Zool Sect, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",,"Hunter, Martha/AAF-5288-2020; Hunter, Martha/B-7307-2012","Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X; Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X",,,,50,14,14,1,12,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2001,92,1,,,,,107,118,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920113.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,403NV,WOS:000167050100013,,,,,2021-09-24,

In these areas populations of the native mud snail, Cerithidea californica, have declined precipitously. Since both species feed on epipelic diatoms, I hypothesized that the decline in Cerithidea was a result of exploitative competition with Batillaria. To test this hypothesis I manipulated snail densities in Bolinas Lagoon, California, to estimate their effects on, and responses to, food resources. For two size classes of each snail species I quantified (1) the effect of intraspecific density on food availability, and (2) the growth response of each size class to different food levels. These relationships were used to generate predictions of the exploitative competitive effect of each snail on the other species. These predictions were tested against direct measurements of the effect of interspecific competition on snail tissue growth using field experiments. The observed values of snail growth matched well the predicted relationships, suggesting that exploitative competition does occur. Although the two snails did not differ in their effect on resource levels at any experimental snail density, the introduced snail was always more efficient at converting limited resources to tissue growth. Similar results were obtained in three different experimental periods. Batillaria's enhanced resource conversion efficiency provides a sufficient explanation for its successful invasion and subsequent exclusion of Cerithidea. Theoretically, conversion efficiency of resources should be just as important as resource suppression and uptake to exploitative competitive ability, but it is rarely examined experimentally. By separating exploitative competition into its component parts, the protocol used here allowed identification of a seldom implicated mechanism that can affect invasion success.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Friday Harbor Marine Lab, 620 Univ Rd, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,104,220,227,1,92,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2000,81,5,,,,,1225,1239,,10.2307/177203,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,309XQ,WOS:000086795100004,,,,,2021-09-24,

I examined the competitive ability of larval common frogs (Rana temporaria) and common toads (Bufo bufo) in a laboratory experiment by manipulating the number and size of Rana and the number of Bufo. 2. Bufo was the most active tadpole type, whereas small Rana was more active than large Rana. 3. Especially at high food availability, the growth rate of large Rana at metamorphosis was reduced in the presence of small Rana, whereas that of small Rana was not affected by larger conspecifics. 4. Both size classes of Rana were negatively affected by the presence of Bufo. Size at metamorphosis of Bufo was greater when large Rana was present. These results suggest that activity level is important in determining competitive ability. 5. To study competition in the field, tadpoles of Bufo were introduced to small rock-pools that did not support Bufo naturally, but were with or without Rana. 6. In the experimental pools, there were no interspecific effects on the growth rate of either species. However, the growth rate of Bufo was lower in the experimental pools than in pools inhabited naturally. Futher, survival of Bufo was low in small pools. Lower food availability or physical factors associated with small pools, rather than interspecific competition, may be the reason why Bufo avoids breeding in small rock-pools.","Univ Helsinki, Div Populat Biol, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Integrat Ecol Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Laurila, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Populat Biol, Norbyvagen 18 D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,60,31,35,0,21,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Larvae near the front of the ant lion aggregation grew faster due to greater food availability but suffered greater mortality in the pupal stage. Although food and space were limiting, neither species was excluded because (1) intra-and interspecific effects were similar; (2) third-instar larvae could not suppress the recruitment of first-instar larvae; and (3) recruitment was patchy in time and space.

Typhlodromus pyri, more of a generalist predator, showed higher rates of predation and cannibalism on phytoseiid immatures at most prey densities and ratios.

I studied the role of competition in structuring the benthic community of hard substrates in a coldwater stream dominated by mobile insects that grazed upon periphyton and by relatively sessile filter-feeding insects. I expected competitive interactions among periphyton grazers to be significant and chronic because the community was not subject to frequent flow-related disturbances and grazer densities were high despite consistently low periphyton availability. Laboratory and field experiments were performed to determine: (1) the potential for, and relative strengths of, competition within and between two common, widely distributed grazers, the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior and the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus, (2) the role of Glossosoma in affecting the organization of the community, and (3) the mechanisms of competition. Strong intraspecific effects on Baetis survivorship were observed in laboratory enclosures within the range of natural densities, but interspecific effects were not detected. Glossosoma survivorship was not affected by competition with itself or with Baetis. Individuals of both species experienced significant intra- and interspecific effects on growth, but the relative strengths of these effects differed between species. The effects of Baetis on Glossosoma growth were stronger than the effects of Glossosoma on itself. In contrast, Baetis growth was much less affected by the presence of Glossosoma than by conspecifics. Both species strongly depressed periphyton abundance, indicating that observed competitive effects resulted, in part, from exploitation. Exclusion of Glossosoma from habitats in the field resulted in a marked increase in periphyton biomass throughout a 10-mo study in which the movements of other taxa were not restricted. Most periphyton grazers responded to this increase in resource availability with increased densities in the Glossosoma exclusion treatment relative to the control. The size distributions of several chironomid grazers suggested that larval growth rates were greater in the absence of Glossosoma than with Glossosoma present. The larvae of two relatively small-bodied filter-feeders (Simulium, Rheotanytarsus) responded positively to the removal of Glossosoma, but larger bodied species (Hydropsyche, Brachycentrus) were not affected. There was not strong evidence for seasonal variation in the intensity of competition. Effects of Glossosoma on filter-feeders appeared to result from a form of interference competition, but there was no evidence for the operation of interference among grazers. Glossosoma had no effect on the colonization of habitats by grazers, and the feeding rates of Baetis and Glossosoma were not affected by the presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics. Contrasting patterns in periphyton abundance between the laboratory and field experiments suggest that, when their movements are unrestricted, Baetis departs periphyton patches at higher food densities than does Glossosoma to search for food elsewhere. Thus, strong competitive effects of Baetis on Glossosoma in the laboratory experiments resulted, in part, from limited Baetis dispersal in the enclosures. Baetis and Glossosoma appear to exhibit trade-offs in feeding efficiency and the costs of exploiting food patches that should help to ensure their coexistence on a spatially variable food resource. Results of this study suggest that the structure of benthic communities in coldwater streams composed largely of mobile taxa may often be strongly influenced by Glossosoma. A similar role has been observed for sessile, territorial grazers in other systems. Glossosoma's dominance does not result from aggressive behavior, but from physiological, behavioral, and life cycle attributes that allow it to regulate periphyton biomass throughout the year.",,"KOHLER, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, 607 E PEABODY DR, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,,,,,,89,139,144,0,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Muller). Two different predator profiles were used, one simulating a gape-limited (vertebrate) predator, and the other simulating a size-dependent (invertebrate) predator sensu Zaret (1980). Predation was executed by manually removing fixed percentages of populations in susceptible size-classes in accordance with the profiles, irrespective of species. Thirty-six two-species and seven one-species experiments were performed with predation rates from 0 to 90% per 8 days. (2) Under gape-limited (vertebrate) predation, the time to extinction of the larger D. magna decreased with increasing predation rates. In the size-dependent (invertebrate) predation experiments, coexistence of both species was common up to c. 75% predation per 8 days, and then D. longispina became extinct at higher predation rates. Extinctions of the sub-dominant species did not occur when it was reared alone under high predation rates. Both interspecific competition and predation appeared to be important for the exclusion of the species most susceptible to predation. (3) The results support the idea that vertebrate predation can be important in regulating prey size distribution and species composition in rockpool and pond zooplankton communities. They also suggest that low rates of invertebrate predation may have little effect on zooplankton composition in rockpools and ponds. (4) Predation and competition interacted to produce differences in species composition between different predation rates and profiles. Interspecific competition was still of importance under high predation rates. It is therefore suggested that the view that either one or the other of these processes operates in a particular community may be too simplistic.",,"MILBRINK, G (corresponding author), UNIV UPPSALA, DEPT ZOOL, BOX 561, S-75122 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,"Bengtsson, Jan/AAF-2325-2021",,,,,78,19,19,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Because wrens did not consume the egg contents, the behavior is not predation. Wrens attacked nests only within their own territories but often in vegetation not used as nesting substrate. Hence, the behavior probably does not represent attempts at cuckoldry or mate displacement, or competition for nest sites. Nest destruction may represent intraspecific or interspecific competition for (1) food or (2) predator-free nesting space. Evidence supporting these nonexclusive hypotheses are that food limits reproductive success in this population of wrens, and nest predation was density dependent in this population (natural nests surrounded by experimental nests showed higher predation rates than controls). Major predators included snakes, especially whipsnakes (Masticophis spp.), which are able to access Cactus Wren nests despite cholla (Opuntia spp.) spines.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA",,,"simons, Lee/AAR-6686-2020",,,,,22,10,12,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,NOV,1990,92,4,,,,,855,860,,10.2307/1368721,,,6,Ornithology,Zoology,EP836,WOS:A1990EP83600005,,,,,2021-09-24,

Several species of predatory mites are important biocontrol agents and the species Phytoseiulus macropilis and Neoseiulus californicus are used to control the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, an important pest in agriculture worldwide. We investigated their compatibility showing that the two predators do not avoid plants on which the other species is present together with their common prey, and demonstrated that their oviposition rates are not affected by the presence of the other species. However, the distribution of the eggs on leaf discs was affected by the presence of the heterospecific predator. This behaviour might weaken possible interference between these two biocontrol agents, which, in turn, may enable their persistence on plants and favour pest suppression. The increased joint use of several natural enemies for biological control highlights the importance of studies on predator-predator interactions.","[Fonseca, Morgana Maria; Pallini, Angelo; Marques, Pedro Hermano; Lima, Eraldo; Janssen, Arne] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, Evolutionary & Populat Biol, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.; Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Evolutionary & Populat Biol, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",morganamaria.fonseca@gmail.com; pallini@ufv.br; pdrohermano@gmail.com; eraldo.lima@ufv.br; arne.janssen@uva.nl,"Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/Z-3908-2019","Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/0000-0002-2135-8488","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Foundation for Research Support of the State of Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88887.145883/2017-00, 88887.314241/2019-00]; FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); National Institute of Science and Technology Semiochemicals in Agriculture (INCT/CNPq)","We thank Ecotrix Biodefensivos Pesquisa & Consultoria Ltda for support with the rearing of arthropods and the colleagues from the Laboratory of Acarology of the Federal University of Vicosa for suggestions on experimental design and discussions.

However, there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of various factors on interspecific competition. In this study, both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches were employed to investigate how various combinations of the initial cell densities of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella vulgaris and copper exposure levels affect interspecific competition between these species. In the simulation results, C. vulgaris appeared to be superior to P. subcapitata in the absence of copper exposure. However, in the copper-exposed groups, the competitive positions of both algal species varied with the initial cell density and the copper exposure level. In particular, at the highest copper concentration (10 mu g/L), C. vulgaris became less competitive than P. subcapitata in most initial cell density combinations, resulting in a shift in competitive dominance. This study clearly showed that the dominant species in the interspecific competition could be altered by the two factors studied herein. The developed model provided a more detailed and intuitive understanding of the effects of the two factors on the interspecific competition by simulating the competition at various combinations of initial algal density and copper exposure levels. In this study, the initial algal density and copper exposure levels were selected as the factors influencing the interspecific competition between P. subcapitata and C. vulgaris, but the proposed model could be used to study the effects of other toxicants on the interspecific competition between other algal species.","[Kim, Yongeun] Korea Univ, OJERI, Inst Environm & Ecol, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Son, Jino; Lee, Yun-Sik] Korea Univ, Ojeong Ecoresilience Inst, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Mo, Hyoung-Ho] Anim & Plant Quarantine Agcy, Jungbu Reg Off, Incheon 22133, South Korea; [Cho, Kijong] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea","Cho, K (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",kjcho@korea.ac.kr,,,Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as The Chemical Accident Prevention Technology Development Project [2016001970003]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2017R1A6A3A11035451],This subject is supported by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as The Chemical Accident Prevention Technology Development Project.

We investigated the recent successful invasion of the Pacific crabs Hemigrapsus takanoi and H. sanguineus to the southeastern North Sea coast with respect to their recruitment patterns, as well as interactions of juvenile with sub-adult individuals among the Pacific crabs and with native shore crabs Carcinus maenas. A field survey of juvenile native and introduced crab abundances (carapace width 1.4-10 mm) was conducted in the northern Wadden Sea, spanning 24 months from 2014 to 2016. The survey revealed different seasonal recruitment patterns of native C maenas and both introduced Hemigrapsus species. Native shore crabs showed a single recruitment peak from June to July, while Hemigrapsus spp. mainly recruited from August to early September, but recruits occurred in low densities throughout the winter until the end of the following spring season. Field experiments on the effects of larger crabs on the recruitment intensity showed that recruitment of H. takanoi was enhanced by the presence of larger congeners, but remained unaffected by larger C. maenas. Recruitment of juvenile C maenas, by contrast, was reduced by the presence of larger Hemigrapsus spp. Additional laboratory experiments revealed high rates of cannibalism on newly recruited C. maenas by subadult conspecifics as well as strong predation by larger Hemigrapsus spp. In contrast, newly recruited Hemigrapsus spp. had a much lower risk of being preyed on by subadult conspecifics and native shore crabs. Our results suggest that the timing of recruitment in combination with low intraspecific competition and reduced predation pressure by native shore crabs are crucial for the rapid and ongoing establishment of Hemigrapsus spp. in the Wadden Sea.

In syntopic populations of competing species common predators can play a mediator role thus influence the interaction out-come of prey-species in an indirect way. We studied differences in antipredator response in two competing lizards in syntopy in a multi-predator environment. Studied prey species, Iberolacerta horvathi and Podarcis muralis, are likely to compete in syntopic populations limited in size and have similar morphology and ecology but exhibit fine-scale ecophysiological differences. Taking into account interspecific differences in ecophysiology we expected that!. horvathi as a more precise thermoregulator would be less prone to use refuges that represent a thermal cost (are colder than outside). The pattern we found was the opposite of our expectations; I. horvathi escaped at greater distances and remained in the refuge for longer before re-emerging than P. muralis. Second part of the study revealed that both species were able to recognize chemical cues of predator snakes (represented as higher tongue flick rates in the presence of scents of predator snakes in comparison to control). Behavioral responses, which are linked with stressful situations connected to saurophagous snakes, were more frequent and variable in L horvathi. Overall, antipredator responses seem to be more pronounced in L horvathi than in P. muralis. While this more cautious attitude of!. horvathi should provide higher short-term benefits (higher survival rates), this would hold true only in populations where predation pressure is high. Otherwise it carries substantial time and thermoregulatory costs. For I. horvathi, costs of refuge use should be even higher due to narrower dimensions of their ecophysiological fundamental niche. Such divergences in antipredator behavior are expected to shape the relationships between both species in syntopic populations modulated by common predation pressure and habitat structure.

The presence of filamentous cyanobacteria can reduce the competitive superiority of large-bodied cladocerans, because they are less resistant than small-bodied ones to interference with food collection by filaments. The viscosity of water decreases with increasing temperature which may alter the filtering mechanisms of cladocerans, making the large-bodied species even more susceptible to interference by cyanobacterial filaments. The aims of this study were (1) to test if the presence of the filamentous non-toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii shifts competitive dominance from a large-bodied cladoceran species towards a small-bodied one and (2) to determine whether the competitive superiority of a small-bodied species in the presence of cyanobacterial filaments is temperature-dependent. A laboratory competition experiment was conducted with large-bodied Daphnia pulicaria and small-bodied D. longispina, in the presence or absence of cyanobacteria in two different thermal regimes -18 and 25 degrees C. Unexpectedly, D. pulicaria was dominant over D. longispina, irrespective of the food and thermal treatments applied. The large-bodied Daphnia species was competitively superior even in the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria and at an elevated temperature.","[Sikora, Anna; Dawidowicz, Piotr] Univ Warsaw, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, Fac Biol, Dept Hydrobiol, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland","Sikora, A (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, Fac Biol, Dept Hydrobiol, Zwirki & Wigury 101, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland.",a.b.sikora@uw.edu.pl; p.dawidowicz@uw.edu.pl,"Dawidowicz, Piotr/N-7405-2018","Dawidowicz, Piotr/0000-0001-8385-6215; , Anna/0000-0001-6277-3621","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [N N305 134440]","We are grateful to Pawel Koperski for his great help and valuable comments on the manuscript, and Tomasz Karasek for his assistance in the laboratory.

Results were interpreted by using a competing risk analysis model, which uniquely enabled us to estimate the intrinsic patch-leaving decisions independently of external interruptions of foraging bouts by aggression. The experiment was conducted in two 1-ha field enclosures completely surrounded by rodent-proof fences and included allopatric (only Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) and sympatric (G. a. allenbyi and G. pyramidum) treatments. We predicted that increased food patch quality (i.e., habitat quality) should decrease intrinsic patch-leaving rates and increase rates of aggressive interactions involving the forager feeding in the patch (i.e., the occupant individual). We also anticipated that increasing population density should result in an increase in the rate of aggressive interactions involving the occupant individual. Our results supported the first two predictions, indicating a trade-off between foraging and aggression. However, the third prediction was realized only for G. a. allenbyi in allopatry. Furthermore, in allopatry, occupant G. a. allenbyi individuals with high competitive ranks were involved in aggressive interactions at lower rates than those with low competitive ranks. However, in sympatry, patch-use behavior of occupant G. a. allenbyi individuals was mainly influenced by aggressive behavior of G. pyramidum, which did not respond to their competitive rank. Thus, it should pay less for G. a. allenbyi to be aggressive in sympatric populations. The observed reduction in intraspecific aggression among individual G. a. allenbyi in the presence of G. pyramidum supports this assertion. We suggest that this reduction likely weakens the negative effect of intra- and interspecific density on the per capita growth rate of G. a. allenbyi. Because this would change the slope of the isocline of G. a. allenbyi, it could be an important mechanism promoting coexistence when habitat selection is constrained.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Ovadia, O (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",ofer.ovadia@yale.edu,"Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012","Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,34,26,26,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of spatially and temporally separating the feed for red hybrid tilapia and redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatirs) as a means of decreasing interspecific competition and increasing the performance of each species in communal culture. The effects of the spatial and temporal separation of feed (i.e., feeding with sinking and floating pellets vs. sinking pellets only, and by day and night vs. day only, respectively) were tested in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Two 6-week experiments were conducted involving inverse fish-crayfish size relationships. Monocultures of each species were included as controls. No effects of the spatial and temporal separation of feed on the survival and growth of tilapia were found. However, tilapia grew better in duoculture than in monoculture. The performance of redclaw was generally better in monoculture than in duoculture with tilapia. The magnitude of the deleterious effect of tilapia on redclaw was size-dependent, as reflected in reduced survival, growth and foraging of small redclaw in the presence of relatively larger tilapia. There was a significant effect of the temporal separation of feed on the growth of small crayfish; feeding them at night increased their growth by 32%. The temporal separation of feed, in which redclaw were fed at night and tilapia during the day, proved to be an appropriate feeding strategy in their communal culture. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Some ecologists believe that at least some and possibly most, of the interpretation of this work may be subject to dispute because of potential artefacts associated with the confinement itself. Simulations suggested that moderate or even severe artefacts may arise from using enclosures that are 'too small', which could produce inferential nonsense in some circumstances (Mac Nally, 1997). Here, the influence of differential mobility is explicitly considered in a simulated environment, with organisms confined in enclosures of a variety of sizes. Some simulations involve single populations, while others pit together competitors differing only in mobility. Three foraging strategies based on simple movement principles are simulated. Results indicate that the relationships between resource consumption and mobility will depend upon foraging strategy, often in unexpected ways compared with the implications of spatial averaging. Outcomes of interactions among pairs of populations having the same foraging strategy but with different mobilities also are complex, indicating that the results of confinement experiments may involve non-intuitive interactions between mobility and foraging method. There needs to be a refocusing on basic biology of organisms used in confinement experiments (e.g. movement distributions) and, particularly, constructing defensible statements on why the selected scales were used.

Both species have persisted in the lake for decades, but their water-column densities are negatively correlated. The larger Daphnia pulicaria dominates in some years, the smaller D. galeata mendotae in others, and in some years one species replaces the other seasonally. Although this pattern results in part from annual variation in vertebrate predation pressure, predation alone cannot explain the irregular daphnid dynamics. In 1992-1995, I examined the water-column abundances, birth and death rates of both species. D. pulicaria dominated in two years, D. galeata mendotae was replaced by D. pulicaria in one year and in 1994, both species persisted in low numbers. To test the effect of temporal changes on the strength of intra- and interspecific competition on both juvenile and adult daphnids, I manipulated a series of field enclosures in 1994 and 1995. The outcome of competition varied within and between years, and its effects were most evident at the highest densities and lowest resource levels. For adults of both species, the effects of interspecific competition were detected more often than those of intraspecific competition. Lipid reserves (a metric of fitness) among juveniles were generally low, with those of D. galeata mendotae often being less than those of D. pulicaria. Contrary to the results of other studies examining competition in daphnids, spatial segregation and predictable within year reversals in competitive dominance most likely do not play a large role in fostering coexistence of the Oneida Lake daphnids. Instead, coexistence of these competitors is promoted by interannual variation and long-lived diapausing eggs.","Cornell Univ, Ecol & Systemat Sect, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Caceres, CE (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",caceres@mail.inhs.uiuc.edu,,,,,,69,44,45,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,233,244,,10.1007/s004420050512,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700029,28308457,,,,2021-09-24,

Notwithstanding a general improvement in the sophistication of experimental work, there remains a major problem when manipulations involve the forced confinement of mobile organisms in enclosures (or 'cages'). Some evidence suggests that outcomes of field experiments depend upon the size of the enclosure used. Simulated field experiments are conducted here to explore some of the implications of the effects of enclosure size on experiments involving consumers engaged in exploitative competition for food resources. The simulations employ calibration data from rocky intertidal systems of South-Eastern Australia, but they are not designed to imitate a specific system but rather to illustrate some potentially general problems associated with confinement experiments. The simulations indicate that there will be enclosure size-dependent effects on consumption rates of individuals, with the severity of effects being inversely related to the enclosure size used (i.e., worse artefacts for smaller enclosures). The mechanism underlying the effect appears to be the more concentrated harvesting of resources by consumers confined to small enclosures, which prevent the food resource from 'escaping' predation as frequently as occurs under unconstrained conditions. The simulations are extended to investigate how the interpretation of interspecific competition may be influenced by the size of enclosure used and, if the results reflect natural conditions, then misleading interpretations are likely to emerge if enclosure sizes are too small relative to natural scales of movement.

I manipulated levels of simulated folivory on branches within eight trees of Quercus emoryi in a complete randomized block design. Survival and causes of mortality, including attack by natural enemies, of a dominant leafminer, Cameraria sp. nov., were monitored over two growing seasons. Survival varied significantly among trees but not among treatments. Causes of mortality also varied significantly among trees. Death from premature leaf abscission increased significantly with increasing levels of branch damage, while mortality from other causes, including death from bacterial and fungal attack, declined significantly with increasing levels of damage. However, neither of these changes in mortality was sufficient to cause changes in overall survival. Leaf damage did not influence attack by macroscopic natural enemies (hymenopteran parasitoids or vertebrate and invertebrate predators). By far, the most important factor affecting survival and causes of mortality within trees was the presence of co-occurring larvae on leaves (i.e., intraspecific competition). Simulated folivory in the first growing season did not affect folivory by Cameraria or other folivorous arthropods in the next season. Colonization, survival, rate of attack by natural enemies, and amount of herbivory by other arthropods in the second growing season were not affected by levels of leaf damage in the first one. Neither survival nor causes of mortality of Cameraria in the second growing season were associated with folivory by endemic leafchewing arthropods. Simulated folivory in the first growing season did, however, reduce leaf production in the second season. These results do not support the hypothesis that insect species compete interspecifically via induced plant responses and their effects on the third trophic level (natural enemies of the herbivores). The effects of simulated (first growing season) and insect (second growing season) folivory via induced plant responses on the Cameraria population was negligible relative to intraspecific interactions. Further, my results do not support the notion that folivore-induced responses are defensive and that plants have evolved these responses to manipulate the third trophic level. In natural settings, other factors that influence population dynamics of phytophagous insects, such as intraspecific competition and interactions with microparasites, may obscure any negative effects of herbivore-induced plant responses on interactions among herbivore species and their macroscopic natural enemies.",,"FAETH, SH (corresponding author), ARIZONA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA.",,,,,,,62,46,47,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1992,73,5,,,,,1802,1813,,10.2307/1940031,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP740,WOS:A1992JP74000028,,,,,2021-09-24,

However, only a small fraction of pesticides really hit their target organisms, with the remaining fraction reaching the environment by several phenomena such as leaching, and ending up in aquatic ecosystems: the final receptor of micropollutants. Chemical stressors induce changes in taxonomic composition of fauna and flora which are now the focus of many biomonitoring studies. Interspecific competition and predation are structuring factors of community composition. But the combined effects of biotic relationships (competition, predation) and pesticides are rarely accounted for. We tested four factors (Predation, Competition, Diuron (Herbicide) and Imidacloprid (insecticide)) separately on three distinct morphotypes of two diatoms species: Planothidium lanceolatum and Gomphonema gracile (normal and teratogen forms), to quantify the daily growth kinetics of each under varied pressures. The predator used was a nematode, cosmopolitan in soils and aquatic ecosystems (Aphelenchoides bicaudatus). We reproduced experiments combining the factors in binary and ternary combinations. Diuron had lower toxicity than expected, while imidacloprid affected the growth of non-target diatoms. Interalgal competition had marked negative effects on diatom growth kinetics, which increased as supplementary pressures (nematodes and/or pesticides) were added. These results demonstrate that ecological relationships in freshwater biofilms (competition, predation) have a non negligible effect on community composition, population behavior and impacts usually observed. Multistress conditions including the presence of pesticides in freshwaters are expected to affect biodiversity in ways that are hard to predict from simple toxicity assays.","[Neury-Ormanni, Julie; Vedrenne, Jacky; Morin, Soizic] UR EABX, INRAE, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France","Neury-Ormanni, J (corresponding author), UR EABX, INRAE, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France.",julie.neury@laposte.net; jacky.vedrenne@inrae.fr; soizic.morin@inrae.fr,"Morin, Soizic/J-1204-2019","Morin, Soizic/0000-0003-0360-9383; Vedrenne, Jacky/0000-0001-9313-4283; Neury-Ormanni, Julie/0000-0003-4711-4593",Adour Garonne Water Agency,We are grateful to Emilie Saulnier-Talbot for checking English grammar and spelling.

Generalist predator interactions, such as intraguild predation (IGP) and competition, can alleviate predation pressure and weaken top-down control that predators have on lower trophic levels. Centipedes (Chilopoda) and carabid beetles (Coleoptera) are common deciduous forest floor generalist predators that may interact by competing for resources beneath rocks and logs on the forest floor, especially during dry periods when prey become confined to such microhabitats. We used laboratory and field studies to determine whether the carabid beetle, Pterostichus stygicus (Say), and the centipede, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus (Say) co-occur under artificial cover. Additionally, a laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions in intra- and interspecific trials. There was significant negative co-occurrence of beetles and centipedes beneath cover objects in the field and laboratory. Pairings of S. sexspinosus and P. stygicus within mesocosms resulted in high mortality of P. stygicus, and reciprocal but asymmetric IGP. Centipedes maintained weight within solitary, intra- and interspecific mesocosm treatments, however, beetles lost mass in all treatments. Scolopocryptops sexspinosus responded more favorably to intra- and interspecific competition than did P. stygicus. Analysis of the leaf litter mesofauna indicated that these predators consumed similar prey in laboratory mesocosms. Our results suggest that species with very different trophic morphology have the potential to compete for shared microhabitat and prey.","[Julian, Michele E.; Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA; [Julian, Michele E.] Front Range Community Coll, Dept Sci, 2190 Miller Dr, Longmont, CO 80501 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,"John Carroll University, University Heights, Ohio; Faculty Summer Research Fellowship","We would like to thank Harry Lee for helping with beetle identification and for being a valuable resource for information about ground beetles.

When several species of parasitoids oviposit within the same individual host, a complex phenomenon of larval competitive interaction occurs. Within the same guild there is a specialization in competitive strategies, sometimes multiparasitism is avoided, but some species are facultative hyperparasitoids/predators of their competitors. As these interactions occur within a very small host and during a brief period of time, and that direct observation is very difficult to achieve, we used an alternative methodological approach. We analyzed intraguild host competition mechanisms via the combination of a series of competitive behavioral and functional response models, thurstonian competition model and set theory. These models were fitted via a reversible-jump bayesian model selection procedure to a series of competition experiments data using larvae of three species of Gonatocerus spp. (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), egg parasitoids of the sharpshooter Tapajosa rubromarginata (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) as a case-of-study. This study tests the influence of intrinsic interspecific competition between inmature stages within on an individual host, and parasitoid arrival order among the three parasitoid species. The results showed that the species differed in competitive behavior, some species were better competitors than others. Individuals arriving earlier had a competitive advantage, the weaker species were able to out compete the stronger ones if the time advantage was longer than 18 h. All the species avoided already parasitized hosts, but in different degrees. The functional response was also different, with the best competitors having shorter estimated handling times. Using this analytical approach on a conventional experimental setup, we gained insights in the mechanism of competition, both on interference and exploitation, and in terms of host selection, all in a single analysis.","[Bruzzone, Octavio A.] INTA, Estn Expt Agr Bariloche, CC 277 Ave Modesta Victoria 4450, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Bruzzone, Octavio A.; Aguirre, Maria B.; Virla, Eduardo G.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Logarzo, Guillermo A.; Aguirre, Maria B.] FuEDEI, Simon Bolivar 1559,Hurlingham T4001MVB, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Virla, Eduardo G.] Fdn M Lillo, PROIMI Biotecnol, M Lillo 251, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Virla, Eduardo G.] Fdn M Lillo, Inst Entomol, M Lillo 251, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina","Bruzzone, OA (corresponding author), INTA, Estn Expt Agr Bariloche, CC 277 Ave Modesta Victoria 4450, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",bruzzone.octavio@inta.gob.ar; glogarzo@fuedei.org; mbaguirre@conicet.gov.ar; egvirla@lillo.org.ar,"Virla, Eduardo Gabriel/L-5546-2016","Virla, Eduardo Gabriel/0000-0002-9512-4254",Argentina Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology [0607],This research was funded in part by by the Argentina Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology (Project PICT 2014 no 0607).

Intraguild predation and competition often occur simultaneously, and ontogenetic shifts in competitive strength can dictate the magnitude and direction of species interactions. The recent introduction of the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus to the Atlantic coast of North America has resulted in the potential for considerable intraguild interactions with juvenile American lobsters Homarus americanus, with which it now co-occupies rocky intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. We present data from 5 yr of monthly (May-October) field sampling revealing a significant decline in lobster density as H. sanguineus density increased in the low intertidal. To investigate potential mechanisms behind this pattern, we conducted three mesocosm experiments designed to examine whether competitive interactions between H. americanus and H. sanguineus are size- or density-dependent. Larger early benthic phase lobsters (16-34 mm CL) outcompeted H. sanguineus for both food and shelter resources. These lobsters fed faster and more in the presence of H. sanguineus, effectively defended shelter, were responsible for the majority of agonistic interactions, and, in multiple instances, killed and consumed H. sanguineus. Effects on sheltering and agonstic interactions by these lobsters were independent of H. sanguineus density; however, prior shelter residency increased lobster agonistic behavior towards crabs. In contrast, H. sanguineus outcompeted smaller, early benthic phase lobsters (7.2-11.2 mm CL) for shelter, and these interactions were density dependent. Displacement of lobsters from shelter by crabs and cumulative agonistic interactions instigated by crabs towards lobsters scaled positively with H. sanguineus density. Given the similarity of the invasion documented here and others occurring globally, these experiments demonstrate the importance of considering how factors such as ontogeny, density-dependence, and primacy influence the outcomes of interactions between intraguild predators. Disentangling how these factors structure intraguild interactions between invasive and endemic species will both advance our fundamental understanding of community ecology and enhance efforts to conserve and manage natural resources.","[Baillie, Christopher J.; Grabowski, Jonathan H.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA","Baillie, CJ (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.",baillie.c@husky.neu.edu,,"Grabowski, Jonathan/0000-0003-4711-5481",,,,95,2,2,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2018,99,9,,,,,2067,2079,,10.1002/ecy.2432,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GS3WV,WOS:000443558200015,29920682,,,,2021-09-24,

Despite the recognition that salamanders have the potential to strongly affect ecosystem function through both direct and indirect pathways, little is known regarding the nature of interactions between small vertebrates and the large, predatory arthropods with which they share both microhabitat and prey. Our study was designed to explore interactions between Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, and spiders in the genus Wadotes in an eastern North American temperate forest ecosystem. We were particularly interested in teasing apart behaviors such as territoriality and intraguild predation in an attempt to determine specifically which interaction is most likely responsible for the observed negative relationship between salamander and spider abundance at our field site. Field data indicate that P. cinereus and large syntopic spiders exhibit negative spatial associations in the microhabitat beneath cover objects, a possible indication of interspecific territoriality. In our laboratory experiments, resident salamanders displayed agonistic postures similarly toward both intruding conspecifics and spiders, suggesting that salamanders may perceive large intruding spiders as competitors. Finally, we observed no injuries to individual P. cinereus or adult spiders even though occasional chases and bites by both were recorded during the behavioral trials. We found no evidence that adults or juveniles of P. cinereus were envenomated by adult Wadotes spp., and there were no instances of intraguild predation in this study. Multiple lines of evidence from this study, and others, suggest that the primary interaction between individuals of P. cinereus and large spiders is competitive in nature rather than predatory. We suggest that the cost associated with intraguild predation on salamanders with noxious skin secretions may preclude them from being preyed upon by spiders.","[Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.; Figura, Anna M.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0608239]; John Carroll University,This work was supported by The National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant [grant number DEB-0608239] to Cari-Ann M.

In the first experiment, combined effects of chlorpyrifos and different levels of intraspecific and interspecific interaction were assessed on Gammarus pulex survival using Asellus aquaticus as an interacting species. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions increased the time to extinction of G. pulex up to a factor of 2, most likely because of the cannibalistic nature of G. pulex and its intraguild predation on A. aquaticus under stress conditions. In the second experiment, combined effects of chlorpyrifos and intraspecific and interspecific interaction were assessed on Daphnia pulex abundance using Brachionus calyciflorus as a competing species and Chaoborus sp. larvae as a predator. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions significantly affected the D. pulex population structure, but they did not influence the total population size. Predation decimated D. pulex abundance; however, interacting effects of predation and chlorpyrifos exposure were less noticeable at high exposure concentrations because of the reduced predatory efficiency of Chaoborus sp. larvae. The present study shows that species interactions do not always increase the vulnerability of aquatic populations to chemical stress and that some interactions (e.g., cannibalism and intraguild predation) or reduced predator grazing pressure can alleviate competition and predation stress on population-level insecticide effects under food-limiting conditions.

Morphology and swimming performance are two important fitness-related traits in fishes. Both traits are essential in acquiring and defending resources as well as avoiding predation. Here, we examined if interspecific competition could induce changes in morphology and affect the swimming performance of two strains of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We imposed competitive scenarios on the fish using artificial streams containing different combinations of four interspecific competitors. Exposure to interspecific competitors induced morphological changes over time, through the development of deeper bodies, whereas controls free of interspecific competitors developed more fusiform body shapes. Furthermore, swimming performance was correlated to fusiform morphologies and was weaker for Atlantic salmon in competitive scenarios vs. controls. This implies that interspecific competition has direct effects on these fitness-related traits in Atlantic salmon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that morphology, an important fitness-related trait linked to swimming performance, has been shown to be negatively impacted through interactions with an interspecific competitor.","[Smith, A.

The species was detected in the north-eastern Baltic Sea in 2003 and has rapidly expanded its distribution ever since. This invasive amphipod has been notably successful in shallow, soft and mixed bottom habitats becoming one of the most abundant gammarid colonizing such environments. This study carried out two experiments: (1) an outdoor aquarium experiment to assess interspecific competition among the invasive G. tigrinus and the native Gammarus duebeni and compare their reproductive potential, and (2) an in situ meshbag experiment to determine the effect of adult G. tigrinus and native gammarids on juvenile gammarid amphipods. These demonstrated that the adult G. tigrinus had no effects on the adult G. duebeni; however, the invasive amphipod had higher reproductive potential compared to the native species such as G. duebeni. Moreover, almost all adult gammarids exerted a significant predation pressure on juvenile amphipods. Thus, the combined effect of predation on juvenile amphipods and large brood production of G. tigrinus could be plausible explanations describing increased abundance of G. tigrinus and decrease of local gammarid populations in the north-eastern Baltic Sea but plausibly in similar shallow water habitats in other seas.

The invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridisPallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is implicated in declines of native ladybirds with intraguild predation identified as an underlying mechanism, however, less studied are the effects on non-coccinellid predators. Intraguild predation between Anthocoris nemoralisFabricius (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) and H. axyridis and the relative effects of inter- and intraspecific competition on predators on potted Tilia cordata Mill. was investigated, at two aphid densities. 2. Intraguild predation was unidirectional in favour of H. axyridis in Petri dishes although a low level of ladybird egg predation by A. nemoralis occurred. However, on trees intraguild predation was rare. 3. A positive effect of aphid density on H. axyridis weight gain, and increased survival when reared with A. nemoralis on potted trees indicated stronger effects of intraspecific competition on H. axyridis. Consistent suppression of aphids by ladybirds revealed their superior competition for aphids. 4. Anthocoris nemoralis weight gain was reduced when reared with H. axyridis on potted trees, indicating a potential for a sublethal effect through interspecific competition. Survivorship of A. nemoralis did not differ between con- and heterospecific treatments, but high aphid density enhanced A. nemoralis survival. Overall, high mortality among nymphs across treatments suggested effects related to both inter- and intraspecific competition for resources. 5. Results provide evidence of a sublethal effect by invasive H. axyridis through resource competition, suggesting that where these predators co-occur, competitive interactions for shared prey are more likely to affect A. nemoralis populations than intraguild predation by H. axyridis.","[Howe, Andy G.; Ravn, Hans P.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Ransijn, Johannes] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Disturbance Ecol, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany","Howe, AG (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",andy@ign.ku.dk,"Howe, Andy G./A-8259-2015","Howe, Andy G./0000-0002-7460-5227",University of Copenhagen; Villum Fonden,"We thank four anonymous reviewers for their insightful suggestions to improve an earlier version.

A potential mechanism is intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly competitive, it should include threat and display features associated with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack these features and be associated with feeding. In the first of two captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the aggressive response of ship rats towards mice lacked threat and display features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles predatory behaviour. Our findings provide a better understanding of the interactions between ship rats and house mice, which hinder their management where they coexist as damaging invaders.

The intrinsic size-structure of fish provides the necessary prerequisites to test whether the above mechanisms are general features of species interactions in fish communities where IGP is common. We first experimentally tested whether Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) were more efficient as a cannibal than as an interspecific predator on the prey fish ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) and whether ninespine stickleback were a more efficient competitor on the shared zooplankton prey than its predator, Arctic char. Secondly, we performed a literature survey to evaluate if piscivores in general are more efficient as cannibals than as interspecific predators and whether piscivores are inferior competitors on shared resources compared to their prey fish species. Both controlled pool experiments and outdoor pond experiments showed that char imposed a higher mortality on YOY char than on ninespine sticklebacks, suggesting that piscivorous char is a more efficient cannibal than interspecific predator. Estimates of size dependent attack rates on zooplankton further showed a consistently higher attack rate of ninespine sticklebacks compared to similar sized char on zooplankton, suggesting that ninespine stickleback is a more efficient competitor than char on zooplankton resources. The literature survey showed that piscivorous top consumers generally selected conspecifics over interspecific prey, and that prey species are competitively superior compared to juvenile piscivorous species in the zooplankton niche. We suggest that the observed selectivity for cannibal prey over interspecific prey and the competitive advantage of prey species over juvenile piscivores are common features in fish communities and that the observed selectivity for cannibalism over interspecific prey has the potential to mediate coexistence in size structured intraguild predation systems.","[Bystrom, Par; Ask, Per; Andersson, Jens; Persson, Lennart] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden.",par.bystrom@emg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,Swedish Reseach Council FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Research Council VrSwedish Research Council,"Financial support was provided by the Swedish Reseach Council FORMAS, to Par Bystrom and the Swedish Research Council Vr to Lennart Persson.

While its occurrence is predicted to increase in the future, we have little understanding of mechanisms that underlie changes in the fish community associated with coral degradation. The present study uses a field-based experiment to examine how the intensity of interference competition between juveniles of two species of damselfish changes as healthy corals degrade through thermal bleaching. The mortality of a damselfish that is a live coral specialist (Pomacentrus moluccensis) increased on bleached and dead coral in the presence of the habitat generalist (Pomacentrus amboinensis). Increased mortality of the specialist was indirectly owing to enhanced aggression by the generalist forcing the specialist higher up and further away from shelter on bleached and dead coral. Evidence from this study stresses the importance of changing interspecific interactions to community dynamics as habitats change.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council [CE0561432],"We are grateful to the many people who assisted with various aspects of field and laboratory logistics: M.

I examined the effects of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), an omnivorous fish, on the reproductive success of the red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena), an avian gape-limited predator, along a fish size gradient created by stocking distinct age-cohorts in seminatural ponds. Young-of-the-year (0+) carp were an essential food source for young grebes. Only adult birds were able to consume 1-year-old (1+) fish, while 2-year-old (2+) fish attained a size refuge from grebes. Amphibian larvae were the principal alternative prey to fish, followed by macroinvertebrates, but the abundance of both dramatically decreased along the carp size gradient. Fledging success was 2.8 times greater in ponds with 0+ versus 1+ carp; in ponds with 1+ carp, chicks received on average 2.6-3 times less prey biomass from their parents, and over 1/3 of broods suffered total failure. Breeding birds avoided settling on 2+ ponds. These results show that changes in prey fish size structure can account for shifts from positive trophic effects on the avian predator to a negative impact on the predator's alternative resources. However, competition did not fully explain the decrease in grebe food resources in the presence of large fish, as carp and grebes overlapped little in diet. In experimental cages, 1+ carp totally eliminated young larvae of amphibians palatable to fish. In field conditions, breeding adults of palatable taxa avoided ponds with 1+ and older carp. Non-trophic interactions such as habitat selection by amphibians or macroinvertebrates to avoid large fish may provide an indirect mechanism strengthening the adverse bottom-up effects of fish on birds.","Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland","Kloskowski, J (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, Akad 19, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland.",januszkl@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,"Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421","State Committee for Scientific ResearchPolish State Committee for Scientific Research [KBN 6 PO4F06620, 3 PO4F03623]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [MNiSW 2 P04G05030]","Thanks to J.

Non-consumptive predator effects are an important driver in predator-prey interactions. While indirect effects of predation risk shape interspecific species interactions, e.g. in fuelling trophic cascades, knowledge about non-consumptive predator effects on intraspecific interactions among intimidated prey is scarce. 2. In laboratory experiments, we tested whether predation by male and female green crabs (Carcinus maenas) is stronger on small than on larger specimens of the periwinkle Littorina littorea, an important herbivore species in intertidal habitats of the temperate zone. Moreover, we asked whether size-specific differences in predation-induced mortality reflect as a stronger effect of predation risk (caused by nearby consuming crabs) on the foraging behaviour of more threatened periwinkles and ultimately on the recruitment success of the brown seaweed Fucus serratus. Furthermore, predator activity and prey abundance was measured in the field and the efficacy of predation risk on the survival of seaweed recruits was assessed in three field experiments with two different set-ups (open plots and crab exclosures). 3. Male crabs consumed smaller periwinkles more often than larger conspecifics, while females refused periwinkles as food. In summer, 80-90% of periwinkles in the field attained a size at which crab predation was minimal in laboratory assays. The observed up to 15-fold decrease in the consumption of seaweed recruits by periwinkles in the presence of nearby consuming crabs in laboratory assays was, however, independent of the size of periwinkles. Predation risk effects from the laboratory were only confirmed in field experiments using crab exclosures but not with open plots, suggesting an artefact due to trespassing by wild crabs in the open plot set-up. 4. Synthesis. Predation risk may not change intraspecific competition for food in L. littorea. Yet, risk effects on foraging behaviour of periwinkles that experience a low threat of real predation indicate that non-consumptive predator effects may affect prey population dynamics more strongly than consumptive predator effects. Thus predation risk effects may be indirectly beneficial for the survival of basal species like perennial seaweeds, as experimental evidence from field and laboratory experiments indicates.","[Molis, Markus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Funct Ecol, Marine Stn, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany; [Preuss, Inken] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainable Sci, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Firmenich, Annika] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Dept Marine Biol, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Ellrich, Julius] Univ Marburg, Dept Morphol & Evolut Anim, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Molis, M (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Funct Ecol, Marine Stn, Kurpromenade 201, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany.",markus.molis@awi.de,,"Ellrich, Julius/0000-0003-0884-3726",,,,49,15,15,2,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

We manipulated breeding pool size in order to demonstrate experimentally that breeding habitat selection strategy has evolved in concert with changes in parental care and mating system. We also manipulated intra- and interspecific larval interactions to demonstrate that larval adaptation to the use of very small pools for breeding affected the evolution of larval competition and cannibalism.

We demonstrated that interspecific competition with the exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) significantly increases the daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. The effect of intraspecific competition on the daytime activity of salmon was half that of interspecific competition. This indicates that the effect of rainbow trout was a combination of increasing density and the identity of the competitor. We also demonstrated that the effect of rainbow trout was probably the result of territorial interference between species. Moreover, we showed that water temperature simultaneously played an important role in explaining daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. During twilight, we observed no effect of competition on salmon activity, but environmental cues other than temperature (e.g., invertebrate drift, cloud cover) became significant predictors of activity. Feeding and growth rates of Atlantic salmon were not affected by the different levels of competition. Nevertheless, the exotic species may have a major impact by exposing the native species to increased risks of daytime predation.","[Blanchet, Simon; Bernatchez, Louis; Dodson, Julian J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, CIRSA, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Blanchet, Simon; Bernatchez, Louis; Dodson, Julian J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, QC Ocean, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Loot, Geraldine] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France","Blanchet, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, CIRSA, Pavillon Vachon, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",blanchet@cict.fr; julian.dodson@bio.ulaval.ca,"Blanchet, Simon/AAA-5871-2019; Blanchet, Simon/D-4850-2013; Loot, Geraldine/A-6365-2011; Blanchet, Simon/A-2313-2010","Blanchet, Simon/0000-0002-3843-589X; Blanchet, Simon/0000-0002-3843-589X; Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We sincerely thank J.F.

Previous studies have demonstrated the important role that predators play in this process but not the impact of competitors on selective predation. We use a combination of lab and field studies to evaluate the effect of the presence of adult competitor damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus moluccensis; family Pomacentridae) on the selective mortality of newly-arrived (settled) lemon damselfish (P. moluccensis) by resident predator fishes (Pseudochromis fuscus Pseudochromidae and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus Apogonidae). Lab trials consisted of mesocosm experiments in which the behaviour, mortality, and physiological condition (measured as lipid content) of surviving P. moluccensis settlers from each of three treatments: (1) predators absent, (2) predators present, and (3) predators and competitors present, were compared. The field study involved stocking newly settled P. moluccensis on natural bommies (patch reefs) which had either been subject to a partial removal of resident fish (predators and competitors) or left alone. Results indicated there was very strong condition-based selective mortality in both the lab and field trials. In both cases there was a strong positive relationship between mortality and the lipid content of surviving fish; implying low-condition fish were selectively removed. The mesocosm trials indicated that the strength of mortality as well as condition selectivity was higher when competitors were present than when they were absent. Behavioural observations in the mesocosm study suggest that attention by juvenile P. moluccensis to the movements and occasional chases of the competitors (especially D. aruanus) reduced their vigilance to the predators. These results suggest the important and interactive roles which condition of newly settled reef fish and interspecific competition can play in the outcomes of post-settlement predation.","[Figueira, Will F.; Booth, David J.; Gregson, Marcus A.] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environ Resource Management, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Figueira, WF (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environ Resource Management, Dept Environm Sci, POB 123,Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",william.figueira@uts.edu.au,"Figueira, Will/A-5163-2009","Figueira, Will/0000-0001-9472-8710; Booth, David/0000-0002-8256-1412",,,,57,15,15,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2008,156,1,,,,,215,226,,10.1007/s00442-008-0985-2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,289DD,WOS:000255034300021,18305966,,,,2021-09-24,

We conducted two experiments to examine priority effects of the Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) on the Upland Chorus Frog (Pseudacris feyiarum). Wood frogs hatch before upland chorus frogs and could potentially function both as intraguild predators and competitors of the latter. In a laboratory experiment, R. sylvatica did not prey on P. feriarum hatchlings that were greater than 1-day old. In a mesocosm experiment in which food level and the density of X sylvatica hatchlings were manipulated, R. sylvatica engaged in stage-structured intraguild predation on egg masses of P. feriarum The number of P. feriarum embryos surviving to hatching was inversely related to the initial density of R. sylvatica, but was independent of food level. Growth rates of P.feriarum hatchlings were inversely related to P, sylvatica density, suggesting strong interspecific competition. Collectively, these results illustrate that the density of an intraguild predator may mediate the strength of both stage-specific intraguild predation and interspecific competition. Our findings suggest that food webs in many seasonal pond communities are more complex than previously thought and need to be revised to incorporate intraguild predation by anurans.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Petranka, JW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Hts, Asheville, NC 28804 USA.",petranka@unca.edu,,,,,,46,8,9,0,21,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 28,2007,,1,,,,,131,139,,10.1643/0045-8511(2007)7[131:IPACMS]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Zoology,Zoology,141YK,WOS:000244614900011,,,,,2021-09-24,

I conducted a series of observational and manipulative experiments to further elucidate the mechanisms of competition, as well as coexistence, in these two groups in an archipelago of small Bahamian islands. Diel baiting trials demonstrated a significant temporal difference in foraging activity between the land hermit crab, Coenobita clypeatus (Herbst), and ant Brachymyonex obscurior Forel, suggesting this is one mechanism underlying their coexistence on small oceanic islands. Reciprocal manipulative baiting experiments, in which one of a pair of species was removed from baits, documented that aggressive interspecific interactions underlie patterns of complementary distribution and temporal turnover at rich food resources. This was true for competition between hermit crabs and B. obscurior, and between B. obscurior and a second ant species, Dorymyrmex pyramicus Roger. Negative species associations at baits were found to be common throughout an archipelago of 69 small islands. A trade-off in exploitative and interference abilities may be a second mechanism allowing species coexistence on these small islands.

Interspecific competition is a potential mechanism of negative impact of invasive species, but few studies have conclusively demonstrated competition between native and nonindigenous taxa. In this study I used experimental manipulations to examine the competitive effects of the larvae of two widely introduced anurans, the cane toad, Bufo marinus, and the Cuban treefrog, Osteopilus septentrionalis, on the growth and development of the larvae of two native anurans (the southern toad, Bufo terrestris, and the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea). The presence of O. septentrionalis larvae consistently impacted growth and development of native larvae, resulting in reduced growth rates and delayed metamorphosis of both native species and smaller mass at metamorphosis of B. terrestris. Hyla cinerea larvae transformed at greater body masses when reared with the rapidly transforming nonindigenous species as a result of competitive release. The negative effects of O. septentrionalis on native larvae were generally significant whether native tadpoles were exposed to O. septentrionalis alone or in combination with B. marinus. In contrast, B. marinus tadpoles did not significantly impact the growth or development of either native species. Neither nonindigenous species significantly decreased the survivorship of native larvae, although a trend toward decreased survivorship was evident for H. cinerea. These results suggest that nonindigenous larval anurans may adversely impact native tadpole communities as a result of interspecific competition.

Interactions among predators may influence the total efficiency of a predator complex. The effect of intra- and interspecific interactions of the generalist predators Orthotylus marginalis (Heteroptera: Miridae) and Anthocoris nemorum (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) was investigated in a laboratory experiment. Outcomes of the interactions were determined by comparing predation rates on eggs and larvae of the blue willow beetle Phratora vulgatissima of single individuals with those of two individuals of the same or different species. 2. A non-additive, antagonistic effect on predation rates due to intraspecific interactions was found between individuals of A. nemorum. No such effect was found in O. marginalis. These results are as expected as a consequence of differences in behaviour of the two predator species: A. nemorum is a much more active and mobile predator than O. marginalis. 3. Contrary to expectation, interspecific interactions between A. nemorum and O. marginalis did not affect the total predation rate. 4. An observation from the field corroborated the results obtained in the laboratory study; there was no negative relationship between the densities of the two predator species, indicating that the two species do not interact negatively in the field at their natural densities. 5. It is concluded that the additive effect of multiple predator species is of potential value in biological control.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Bjorkman, C (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, POB 7044, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",christer.bjorkman@entom.slu.se,,,,,,22,13,13,1,21,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

We conducted an outdoor artificial pool experiment to assess the individual and interactive effects of a predator (Anax imperator) and controphic species (primarily Daphnia magna) on larval populations of two common mosquitoes, Culex pipiens and Culiseta longiareolata. Controphic species did not significantly affect survival to pupation of C. pipiens but did increase time to metamorphosis and reduce size at metamorphosis. Culex pipiens and D. magna, both primarily filter feeders, probably compete for food resources. Controphic species caused a small reduction (21.9%) in C. longiareolata survival, an unexpected result given that C. longiareolata larvae are thought to be primarily periphyton grazers while D. magna is a filter feeder. Controphic species did not affect C. longareolata time to, or size at, pupation. Anax imperator reduced C. longiareolata survival to pupation (78%) and size at pupation (11.5%) while increasing development time in males only (11.3%). Anax imperator caused a smaller (32.4%), but statistically significant, reduction in the number of C. pipiens surviving to the pupal stage but did not significantly affect size at or time to pupation. The predator did not reduce controphic species densities, and controphic species did not result in increased predator growth. We predicted that controphic species, by serving as competitors, would result in fewer C. pipiens surviving to pupation in the absence of predators. In the presence of the predator, the negative competitive effect of controphic species would be attenuated by the positive effect of serving as alternative prey. Our results followed this pattern although the predator X controphic species interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.157). Because previous studies showed that D. magna did not affect predation rates by A. imperator on C. longiareolata larvae, and because controphic species did not have a strong competitive effect, we did not predict and did not find a predator X controphic species interactive effect.","Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biol, Ctr Biol Control, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Fac Sci, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",leon@research.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,76,44,47,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We conducted two mesocosm experiments to determine whether breeding phenology and presence of Rana affect the growth, time to metamorphosis, and survival of Ambystoma (Experiment 1) and whether Rana density and access to Ambystoma embryos affect the growth, duration of larval period, and survival of both species (Experiment 2). Rana did not affect Ambystoma embryonic survival in either experiment. In Experiment 1, seasonal time of oviposition did not affect the overall response of Ambystoma larvae; however, Rana presence decreased larval survival and prolonged time to metamorphosis. In Experiment 2, relatively high tadpole density significantly reduced Ambystoma survival and decreased Rana survival, growth, and development. The results of this and other studies suggest that R. sylvatica may adversely affect A. maculatum through an array of context-dependent interactions, including indirect food web alteration, direct competition for benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton, and consumption of embryos.

A 2-factor laboratory experiment was conducted, where juveniles (0+) and adults (1+) were kept in experimental jars for 2 mo at densities of 2000, 4000 and 8000 ind. m(-2), which corresponds to natural abundances in the Baltic Sea. The amphipods were fed on a mixture of naturally occurring algae at 3 food levels: zero, medium (representing a diatom spring-bloom) and high (representing a 2 x diatom spring-bloom). The level of food added to the experimental jars determined whether food competition occurred, both within and between the 2 age classes. Growth of juveniles was riot density-dependent, at any food level, in the absence of adults, but clearly dependent on presence or absence of fresh algal material. In presence of high adult densities, the growth of juveniles was significantly reduced at food levels that corresponded to a single and twice a diatom spring-bloom, while such reduction was not found in jars without added algae. Growth of adults was both density- and food-dependent. Juveniles did not affect the survival and growth of adults. As high densities of amphipods in jars without added food affected neither growth nor mortality, we conclude that crowding effects such as predation or directly damaging interference are not important regulating mechanisms. The results indicate that exploitative intraspecific competition for food occurs both between and within year classes, but depends on the resource levels and is likely to be most intense under a regime of low to medium input of phytodetritus. The experiment lends support to the hypothesis that intraspecific competition for food acts as an important process causing fluctuations in the Baltic Sea populations of M. affinis.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Wenngren, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.wenngren@zoologi.su.se,"Olafsson, Emil/D-4916-2012",,,,,56,15,15,0,2,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Local guilds have historically been a major focus of community ecology; however, studies of local guilds rarely measure consequences of coexistence for fitness-related traits or test predictions of alternative hypotheses for how species may interact. We studied consequences of coexistence for Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata) and Virginia's Warblers (V. virginiae), which have overlapping breeding territories in central Arizona. We used reciprocal removal experiments to examine (1) whether coexistence results in ecological consequences with respect to access to nest sites, access to food resources, nest predation, and adult female predation, and (2) whether ecological consequences result in fitness consequences with respect to reproductive success (clutch size, number of young fledged per nest), or adult female survival (within a breeding season). When we removed Virginia's Warblers, Orange-crowned Warblers experienced reduced nest predation rates compared with control plots where Virginia's Warblers were present. When we removed Orange-crowned Warblers, Virginia's Warblers (1) shifted their nest sites to sites indistinguishable from Orange-crowned Warbler nest sites, (2) increased feeding rates during both the incubation and nest:ling periods, and (3) suffered reduced nest predation rates, compared with control plots where Orange-crowned Warblers were present. When the two species coexist, increased nest predation rates for both species appear to result from density-dependent functional shifts in nest predator behavior (short-term apparent competition). Reduced access to preferred nest sites for Virginia's Warblers coexisting with Orange-crowned Warblers appears to result from both Orange-crowned Warbler interference during nest site selection and building periods, and from Orange-crowned Warbler preemption of nest sites preferred by both species. The mechanisms whereby Orange-crowned Warblers may reduce access to food resources for coexisting Virginia's Warblers, however, are not yet fully understood. Both. Orange-crowned and Virginia's Warblers fledged between 78% and 129% more young per nest on plots where the opposite species had been removed, indicating that both species suffer substantial fitness costs of coexistence. Overall, results illustrate that (I) Orange-crowned and Virginia's Warblers do not coexist independently of each other, (2) interactions between the two species are complex and asymmetrical, (3) interactions between the two species result in substantial fitness costs of coexistence for both species, and (4) ecological interactions between the two species extend far beyond competition for food resources which has dominated studies of terrestrial vertebrate communities.","Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Avian Studies Program, US Geol Survey,Biol Resources Div, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Avian Studies Program, US Geol Survey,Biol Resources Div, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867",,,,89,121,128,0,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2001,82,1,,,,,189,206,,10.2307/2680096,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393UN,WOS:000166488200016,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

Water-filled tree holes in a lowland forest in Panama harbour an assemblage of large predators consisting of the larvae of five common species of Odonata, the mosquito Toxorhynchites theobaldi, and tadpoles of Dendrobates auratus. Odonate females oviposit in both large and small tree holes. However, the three largest species emerge from larger tree holes, on average, than do the two smallest species. Can assembly rules explain this and other patterns of predator distribution? 2. Past experiments suggested that fast growth of the largest, but later-colonizing odonates enabled them to out-compete the smaller, slower-growing Mecistogaster in large holes. In small holes, however, the first predator, regardless of species, should presumably kill any later arrivals. Priority effects in small holes were tested for their consistency across predator species. Two alternative explanations for differential odonate survivorship were also tested: abiotic conditions and the effect of non-odonate predators. 3. Diurnal fluctuations in oxygen content, pH, and temperature within holes were as great as the variation found between large and small tree holes; abiotic conditions were poor predictors of species occupancy. 4. Exchanging the largest and smallest odonate species from their original holes did not affect survivorship, suggesting that the observed patterns of emergence are unlikely to result from differential tolerance to abiotic factors that were not measured. 5. When larger and smaller predators were paired in 400-ml pots and provided with alternative prey, typically only the larger predator survived, regardless of species. The exception was T. theobaldi, which was often killed by odonates and tadpoles smaller than itself. 6. Between May and July, the occurrence of Mecistogaster in large tree holes declined, before larvae could have emerged. Neither abiotic effects nor differential predation by non-odonates could explain this habitat-specific decrease in survivorship. This temporal pattern is most consistent with the previous conclusion that in large holes, Mecistogaster suffer intraguild predation from later-colonizing, but faster-growing Megaloprepus and aeshnids. Whereas Mecistogaster can pre-empt guild members from small tree holes, they cannot do so in large holes where predators with fast initial growth realize a competitive advantage.","Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Fincke, OM (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,37,63,69,0,19,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

These two species co-occur over much of northern North America and exhibit changing patterns of between-habitat distribution and abundance in western Canada. In our experiments, adult survival of P. adstrictus was ca. 35% lower in the presence of the larger-bodied P. melanarius. Because starvation of individually isolated beetles did not elevate mortality for either species, we conclude that predation, and not interspecific competition for food, was responsible for reduced survival of P. adstrictus in the mixed-species trials. Although beetle survival was not affected by reduced food, gravid P. melanarius lost mass when food was limited and showed potential increased egg production with increased food. Larvae of both species had high survivorship when held alone, but predation by both conspecific and heterospecific adults significantly reduced larval survival. All of these effects occurred in the presence of suitable alternative food but many were exacerbated when food levels were lowered experimentally. We conclude that intraguild predation and interspecific competition for food could reduce survival and reproductive potential, thus affecting the population dynamics of these two species in nature.","UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT BIOL SCI, EDMONTON, AB T6G 2E9, CANADA",,,,,,,,47,43,47,0,23,COLEOPTERISTS SOC,ATHENS,"UNIV GEORGIA, 413 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES BUILDING, ATHENS, GA 30602-2603 USA",0010-065X,1938-4394,,COLEOPTS BULL,Coleopt.

We analyzed the effects of competition on the biomass of organisms belonging to 93 species in a wide variety of habitats. Competition had a large effect overall, with a great deal of heterogeneity in that effect among organisms. There were large differences among trophic levels in competitive effects, but the relative magnitude of competition at different trophic levels was contrary to the predictions of ecological theory. Primary producers and carnivores displayed small to medium effects. In these two groups, interspecific effects did not differ from intraspecific effects, nor did effects differ in terrestrial versus aquatic habitats. The effects of competition on herbivores ranged from large effects on anurans and lotic arthropods, to medium effects on marine mollusks and echinoderms, to effects that were not statistically distinguishable from zero for terrestrial arthropods. Interspecific competitive effects among these herbivore groups were generally less than intraspecific effects. Among primary producers, the effects of competition were not different in high- and low-productivity habitats. Across all taxa, large organisms did not experience greater competitive effects than small organisms, and competitive effects did not depend on the size attained in the absence of competitors.

In a replicated pond experiment, B. calamita tadpoles treated with the faeces of R. temporaria tadpoles displayed growth inhibition. A unicellular organism was identified in tadpole faeces which is known to cause inhibition in laboratory cultures. (2) Overlap in the development periods of R. temporaria and B. calamita tadpoles is reduced when R. temporaria metamorphose before B. calamita. This subjects natterjacks to a steadily declining level of interspecific competition. Under such conditions, B. calamita tadpoles may be released from an initial period of growth inhibition, and metamorphose the same size as controls raised without R. temporaria. However, even with growth retrieval, time to metamorphosis and mortality are both increased relative to controls. (3) The effects of large R. temporaria tadpoles on B. calamita were not significantly different from those of small R. temporaria tadpoles. Large R. temporaria tadpoles metamorphosed before small R. temporaria tadpoles, thereby providing a longer retrieval period for inhibited B. calamita tadpoles. (4) When the breeding periods of R. temporaria and B. calamita are well-separated, temporal niche overlap between the tadpole stages will be reduced and growth inhibition ameliorated. However, such conditions may still prolong B. calamita development. Tadpoles may therefore be exposed to aquatic predators for longer, and incur a greater risk of dying as a result of pond desiccation.","NE SURREY COLL TECHNOL,SCH APPL PHYSIOL,EWELL KT17 TDS,SURREY,ENGLAND; UNIV SUSSEX,SCH BIOL,BRIGHTON BN1 9QG,E SUSSEX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,35,48,49,0,17,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Increases in stress hormones in vertebrates may be associated with these processes and contribute to the decline in survival or reproduction of the native species. Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) have gone extinct across much of the British Isles and parts of Northern Italy following the introduction of North American invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We extracted glucocorticoid metabolites from faecal samples to measure whether the presence of the invasive species causes an increase in physiological stress in individuals of the native species. We show that native red squirrels in seven sites where they co-occurred with invasive grey squirrels had glucocorticoid concentrations that were three times higher than those in five sites without the invasive species. Moreover, in a longitudinal study, stress hormones in native red squirrels increased after colonisation by grey squirrels. When we experimentally reduced the abundance of the invasive grey squirrels, the concentration of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in co-occurring red squirrels decreased significantly between pre- and postremoval periods. Hence, we found that the invasive species acts as a stressor which significantly increases the concentrations of glucocorticoids in the native species. Given that sustained elevations in glucocorticoids could reduce body growth and reproductive rate, our results are consistent with previous studies where the co-occurrence of the invasive grey squirrel was associated with smaller size and lower reproductive output in red squirrels.","[Santicchia, Francesca; Martinoli, Adriano; Wauters, Lucas Armand] Univ Insubria, Guido Tosi Res Grp, Environ Anal & Management Unit, Varese, Italy; [Dantzer, Ben; van Kesteren, Freya] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Dantzer, Ben] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Unit Physiol Pathophysiol & Expt Endocrinol, Dept Biomed Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Dept Vet Sci & Publ Hlth, Milan, Italy; [Wauters, Lucas Armand] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Antwerp, Belgium","Santicchia, F (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Via JH Dunant 3, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",f.santicchia@uninsubria.it,"Santicchia, Francesca/L-2591-2019; Dantzer, Ben/E-9779-2011; Ferrari, Nicola/E-6331-2013; Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008; Martinoli, Adriano/L-4924-2016","Santicchia, Francesca/0000-0003-4814-9632; Dantzer, Ben/0000-0002-3058-265X; Ferrari, Nicola/0000-0001-8959-3495; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Martinoli, Adriano/0000-0003-0298-0869; Wauters, Lucas Armand/0000-0002-7012-9200; van Kesteren, Freya/0000-0002-3034-9022; Wauters, Lucas/0000-0002-4871-5035",ESI (European Squirrel Initiative),ESI (European Squirrel Initiative),,69,20,20,2,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Breeding site selection may be based on previous experience, or on social information from the density and success of competitors with an earlier phenology. Variation in animal breeding phenology is often correlated with variation in habitat quality. Generally, animals breed earlier in high-quality habitats that allow them to reach a nutritional threshold required for breeding earlier or avoid nest predation. In addition, habitat quality may affect phenological overlap between species and thereby interspecific competition. Therefore, we hypothesized that competitor breeding phenology can be used as social cue by settling migrants to locate high-quality breeding sites. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally advanced and delayed hatching phenology of two resident tit species on the level of study plots and studied male and female settlement patterns of migratory pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca. The manipulations were assigned at random in two consecutive years, and treatments were swapped between years in sites that were used in both years. In both years, males settled in equal numbers across treatments, but later arriving females avoided pairing with males in delayed phenology plots. Moreover, male pairing probability declined strongly with arrival date on the breeding grounds. Our results demonstrate that competitor phenology may be used to assess habitat quality by settling migrants, but we cannot pinpoint the exact mechanism (e.g. resource quality, predation pressure or competition) that has given rise to this pattern. In addition, we show that opposing selection pressures for arrival timing may give rise to different social information availabilities between sexes. We discuss our findings in the context of climate warming, social information use and the evolution of protandry in migratory animals.","[Samplonius, Jelmer M.; Both, Christiaan] Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","Samplonius, JM (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands.",jelmersamplonius@gmail.com,"Both, Christiaan/E-6459-2011; Samplonius, Jelmer M./H-6689-2019","Both, Christiaan/0000-0001-7099-9831; Samplonius, Jelmer Menno/0000-0002-8700-4041",University of Groningen,"This project was supported by the University of Groningen.

Alternatively, they may represent the end product of historical processes acting over long time frames (fundamental niche partitioning). Niche partitioning is often detected by analysing patterns of resource use within communities, but experiments are rarely conducted to test whether patterns of non-overlapping resource use reflect realized or fundamental niche partitioning. We studied a community of restio leafhoppers from the genus Cephalelus and their host plants, the Restionaceae (restios). We used network and experimental approaches to determine whether network modularity (a measure of niche partitioning within local communities) reflects fundamental or realized niche partitioning. Using a weighted modularity index for two party networks (e.g. insect-plant), we determined whether the network of this community is modular (i.e. consists of groups of species interacting strongly, with weak interactions between groups). We also aimed to identify specific Cephalelus - restio modules (groups). Using knowledge of module membership to design experiments, we tested whether Cephalelus species from two different modules, Cephalelusuncinatus and Cephaleluspickeri, prefer and perform better on restios from their own modules vs. restios from other modules. These experiments were performed under controlled conditions, eliminating the influences of competition and predation on host choices. The Cephalelus - restio community was modular, implying niche partitioning. Cephalelus also preferred and performed better on restios from their own modules in the absence of local contemporary factors. Most niche partitioning in the investigated Cephalelus community is not caused by local interactions, and thus, host use patterns represent fundamental niches. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding local community structure in the light of processes extrinsic to the local community context.","[Augustyn, Willem J.; Anderson, Bruce; Ellis, Allan G.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Augustyn, WJ; Ellis, AG (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",wjaugustyn@gmail.com; agettis@sun.ac.za,"Ellis, Allan/H-1105-2011","Ellis, Allan/0000-0001-6310-2870; Anderson, Bruce/0000-0002-7264-4505",NRF South African Biosystematics Initiative [74458]; Stellenbosch University,"We acknowledge Genevieve Theron, Andre Vermeulen and Caroli de Waal for field assistance and several anonymous reviewers for useful comments on the manuscript.

However, few studies have rigorously tested predictions of IFD models in situations involving multiple species and trophic levels. We fully parameterized and tested predictions of a general interference IFD model for both predators and prey in a tritrophic system: seven-spotted lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Hemiptera: Aphididae), and tic bean plants (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae). We used habitat selection treatments having both predators and prey in the presence and absence of one another. We also performed experiments to quantify the strength of interspecific competition, the functional response of predators and several measures of fitness for the prey. Our results show that whether prey were present or not, predators followed IFD predictions and aggregated most strongly in the patch with the highest-quality resource. Prey in the presence of predators followed the predicted IFD, which was similar to a uniform distribution. However, prey in the absence of predators moved infrequently and were far from ideal free, suggesting that predators instigated habitat selection behaviour. Our results underscore the importance of considering trophic interactions and multiple measures of patch quality in studies of habitat selection. The observed departures from theoretical predictions also usefully suggest promising extensions for future theory and experiments. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We investigated intraguild interactions among three opportunistic predators (dog (Canis lupus familiaris L., 1758), cat (Felis catus L., 1758)), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes (L., 1758)) co-occurring in the extensive farmlands of central Poland. Their space use was monitored using tracking stations distributed in field and forest plots along a distance gradient from buildings and analyzed using the occupancy-modeling framework. For all three species occupancy decreased with increased distance from buildings, although for the fox the pattern was relatively weak. The occurrence of cats at the stations was higher in the forest than in the field; for fox and dog, there was a strong variation between study plots. For all three predators, the probability of detection was higher during the night than during the day and varied between the seasons; however, the exact patterns were species-specific. The presence of one predator was also linked to the presence of the other two species generally, a given species was detected more frequently in the absence of the other two species. We recorded spatiotemporal niche segregation among the three species. We conclude that interspecific antagonistic interactions and differences in foraging ecology are the main drivers shaping co-occurrence of the three species in the agriculture landscape.","[Krauze-Gryz, D.; Goszczynski, J.] Warsaw Univ Life Sci WULS SGGW, Dept Forest Zool & Game Management, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Gryz, J.

We used a series of experiments to investigate competition between walleye (WAE) and smallmouth bass (SMB) at different life stages and light conditions, identified behaviors that allowed one fish to outcompete another, and evaluated whether prey switching mitigated competitive interactions. Juvenile and adult SMB appeared to outcompete WAE when fed during the daytime; neither species dominated when fed near dusk. Attack rates and capture efficiencies of both species were similar with an intra-or interspecific competitor, but SMB often exploited prey before the competitor had a chance to feed (exploitative competition) or displayed agonistic behaviors toward a potential competitor (interference competition). Prey selectivity of WAE or SMB did not differ when by themselves or with a potential competitor. These results indicate that SMB could outcompete WAE under limiting prey conditions due to the aggressive nature of SMB, but resources may be partitioned at least along a temporal scale.","[Wuellner, Melissa R.; Graeb, Brian D.

Effects of predators can be complex, and mechanisms by which predators affect invasion success and impact are understood for only a few well-studied communities. We tested experimentally whether a native predator limits an invasive species' success and impact on a native competitor for a community of aquatic insect larvae in water-filled containers. The native mosquito Aedes triseriatus alone had no significant effect on abundance of the invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus. The native predatory midge Corethrella appendiculata, at low or high density, significantly reduced A. albopictus abundance. This effect was not caused by trait-mediated oviposition avoidance of containers with predators, but instead was a density-mediated effect caused by predator-induced mortality. The presence of this predator significantly reduced survivorship of the native species, but high predator density also significantly increased development rate of the native species when the invader was present, consistent with predator-mediated release from interspecific competition with the invader. Thus, a native predator can indirectly benefit its native prey when a superior competitor invades. This shows the importance of native predators as a component of biodiversity for both biotic resistance to invasion and resilience of a community perturbed by successful invasion.","[Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Lounibos, L.

In laboratory experiments, we determined if intraguild predation occurs between Typhlodromalus manihoti and Eusehis fustis, two phytoseiid mite predators of the cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa on cassava in Africa, and if the level of intraguild predation is affected by the availability of the primary prey, M. tanajoa, and maize pollen as alternative non-prey food. In the laboratory, the two predators attacked and killed heterospecific larvae but they did so only when prey mites and alternative food (maize pollen) were absent or scarce. On a diet of intraguild prey alone, the two predator species survived for several days but failed to reproduce. Addition of abundant levels of M. tanajoa and maize pollen increased survival and reproduction of the two predator species and reduced intraguild predation to very low levels. We then determined, on whole plants in pot experiments in a screenhouse, the effect of maize pollen (an alternative food) on the interactions between the two predator species and the impact of predator predator interactions on suppression of M tanajoa population densities. In single predator species treatments, both E fustis and T manihoti significantly reduced ill. tanajoa densities; but surprisingly, E fustis appeared to be superior to T manihoti. The co-presence of the two predators on the same cassava plant resulted in similar suppression of M tanajoa population densities, but greater suppression of M. tanajoa compared with T manihoti alone, regardless of presence or absence of maize pollen. The presence of the two predator species together reduced their respective abundance compared with single predator species treatments. Addition of maize pollen, however, significantly increased densities of the generalist predator E fustis, in both single and two predator species treatments; and tilted the balance of the interactions between the two predator species in favour of E fustis. The findings of our research underscore the role of generalist predators like E fustis in the suppression of M. tanajoa populations on cassava, and the potential role of alternative nonprey food in altering the interactions between co-occurring predators sharing the same primary prey (by favouring the generalist predators), and the effect of these interactions on suppression of population densities of the shared primary prey.

The Jonah crab, Cancer borealis (Stimpson), was chosen as the interspecific competitor because it shares resources with C. irroratus. Four treatments were tested for their effect on foraging: the presence or absence of a competitor and two types of prey odor; body odor (living mussel) and tissue extract (dead mussel tissue). The presence of Jonah crabs did not influence location time, search time, prey size selected, or handling time of the rock crabs. However, rock crabs responded differently to the presence of body odor and tissue extract cues. The presence of extract odor decreased the time to locate prey while increasing the number of prey manipulated and prey size selected. When prey body odor was present, rock crabs displayed less investigative behaviors than in the presence of extract odor, illustrated by reduced location time. Extract odor provided a stronger and more attractive cue than body odor, but increased prey manipulation and search time. Extract odor induced increases in manipulation and searching for prey but canceled out the benefits of decreased location time, resulting in crabs from both treatments displaying similar search times. These elevated behaviors may be associated with foraging for injured and cracked prey or may indicate an area of conspecific feeding. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the laboratory, we determined the feeding and oviposition responses of a ladybird predator to its conspecific and heterospecific competitors in an aphidophagous guild. Gravid females of Menochilus sexmaculatus ( Fabricius) ( Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) reduced oviposition, but not feeding, when exposed to immobilised conspecific or Coccinella transversalis ( Fabricius) ( Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) individuals in the short-term ( 3 h) and long-term ( 24 h). Feeding and oviposition responses were not affected when M. sexmaculatus females were exposed to larvae or adults of Scymnus pyrocheilus Mulsant ( Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) beetles or larvae of the syrphid fly Ischiodon scutellaris ( Fabricius) ( Diptera: Syrphidae). The ratio of eggs laid to numbers of aphids consumed by M. sexmaculatus females was also affected by the presence of conspecific or C. transversalis larvae. The results suggest that fecundity of this predator may be affected by both conspecific and heterospecific competitors in a patchy resource.","Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Tsuruoka 9778555, Japan; Tripura Univ, Dept Life Sci, Agartala 799004, India","Yasuda, H (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Tsuruoka 9778555, Japan.",,,"Agarwala, Basant/0000-0002-7282-8849",,,,51,30,32,0,15,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Considerable disagreement exists over the relative contribution of each process to patterns of abundance. Using multifactorial experiments, I assessed the effects of resident conspecifics, potential interspecific competitors, predators, and reef location on patterns of recruitment of two temperate reef fishes. Recruitment of bluebanded gobies (Lythrypnus dalli) and blackeye gobies (Coryphopterus nicholsii) consistently increased with distance from a nearby large reef. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was enhanced by the presence of older resident conspecifics. I found no strong evidence of any competitive effects between the two species. Predators had a variety of important effects on the density of recruits. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was halved by predators; this was the result of direct and indirect effects of predators: in addition to directly reducing recruit density, predators also reduced recruitment indirectly by reducing the density of older residents to which recruits responded. I developed two related methods for quantifying the contributions of the direct and indirect components of the predator effect. The effect of predation was spatially variable for both species: the net effect of this variability was the elimination of recruitment patterns related to reef location. Hence, the effects of spatially variable input of recruits was dependent upon the presence of predators, and thereby, predation altered the relative importance of the other factors that affected recruitment of the gobies. I argue that a much broader understanding of the ''relative importance'' of multiple causal processes will be gained by striving to understand how the contribution of each process is modified by other processes than by attempting to quantify the ''importance'' of each process.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA",,,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917",,,,56,57,57,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1997,78,1,,,,,129,145,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0129:TRIOPA]2.0.CO;2,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD345,WOS:A1997WD34500010,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

We examined how these factors and their interactions affected mass at metamorphosis, length of larval period, growth rate, and survival. These experiments demonstrated the effect of body size on predator-prey interactions by manipulating time of introduction of size-structured prey in a system with a gape-limited predator. Microhabitat differences in primary productivity, sources of predation other than salamanders, and abiotic factors were important determinants of community structure. High levels of salamander predation negatively affected tadpole survival, but affected no other response variable. We detected no density-dependent effects in either taxon. Tadpoles in the early treatment had longer larval periods and lower survival rates than those in the late treatment. Interactions of factors, including time of introduction, were common. Biotic and abiotic factors differentially affecting growth of predator or prey appear to be responsible for these differences. Priority effects in arrival to breeding sites, or climatic events affecting the growth rate of predator, prey, or both, play a role in determining community structure. Interactions of factors complicate the predator-prey relationship. In our experiment, the effects of time of introduction are highly correlated with body size in the two temporal treatments. Our results indicate that more realistic models of predator-prey systems, or population dynamics, should incorporate size structure of predator and prey.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287; ARIZONA GAME & FISH DEPT,NONGAME BRANCH,2221 W GREENWAY RD,PHOENIX,AZ 85023",,,,,,,,45,22,24,0,15,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1991,72,6,,,,,2232,2239,,10.2307/1941573,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV769,WOS:A1991GV76900029,,,,,2021-09-24,

Along the subtropical Coast of Brazil, sessile communities from artificial habitats are mostly dominated by the NIS ascidian Didemnum perlucidum and the bryozoan Schizoporella errata, which show contrasting life-history traits. To understand the dynamics between these species and better predict the identity of the dominant NIS in the sessile community, we conducted an experiment where colonies of S. errata, D. perlucidum and the cryptogenic ascidian Botrylloides niger were submitted to the following three interaction scenarios: colonies growing without competition, under intraspecific competition and under interspecific competition. All competition treatments were crossed with the following two predation treatments: exposed or protected to predators. The experiment was repeated in two different seasons (Winter and Summer). When released from predation and competition, the three species grew at least 10 times faster in the Summer than in the Winter, and S. errata always grew slower than the ascidian species. Predation reduced D. perlucidum survival in the Winter but not during the Summer, when the fast colony growth seemed to buffer partial colony removal by predation. Colonial growth of B. niger was affected by competition only in treatments without predators, growing almost 50% more without competition than when competing, regardless of the competitors' identity. When exposed to predation, D. perlucidum was more limited by interspecific than intraspecific competition. S. errata growth was not affected by biotic interactions and was linked to intrinsic seasonal variation. Mineralized clonal organisms, such as bryozoans, were less predated than most of the ascidians species but they grew slower. Ascidians were more often predated but were also strong competitors that were able to overgrow several taxa. The contrasting growth strategies resulted in different successes of NIS and cryptogenic species at the studied locality. Ascidians were favored under low predation pressure while bryozoans were survivors when predation was intense.","[Oricchio, Felipe Theocharides; Dias, Gustavo Muniz] Univ Fed ABC, UFABC, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Humanas, Rua Arcturus 03, BR-09606070 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil","Oricchio, FT (corresponding author), Univ Fed ABC, UFABC, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Humanas, Rua Arcturus 03, BR-09606070 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil.",felipe.oricchio@ufabc.edu.br,"Dias, Gustavo Muniz/M-9169-2019","Dias, Gustavo Muniz/0000-0003-2180-6399","FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2016/17647-5, 2019/23276-8]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)","This work was supported by FAPESP (2016/17647-5 and 2019/23276-8) to G.M.D., and a CAPES grant to F.T.O.

We conducted a field experiment to evaluate Culex oviposition behavior in response to the interspecific competitor Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae, and resources in the form of quantity of plant detritus, and dissolved nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) derived from that detritus. We tested a set of specific predictions: 1) As a poorer competitor, Culex will avoid ovipositing in containers with superior interspecific competitors; 2) Culex choose oviposition habitats that contain greater amount of resources for the microbial food of their offspring; 3) Sufficiently high resource abundance can override avoidance of oviposition in containers with interspecific competitors. Culex restuans Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was the only species ovipositing, and the oviposition responses changed over time. The effect of resources was more important in driving oviposition decisions at the beginning and end of the experiment. The amount of resources, as manifest by TN and TP concentrations, had differential effects on oviposition. At the beginning females laid more eggs in containers with low detritus, which had the highest TN. After that, females preferred those containers with high detritus, which had low TN and high TP. The effect of competitors was important only during the middle of the experiment. Paradoxically, even as a poorer competitor Cx. restuans preferentially oviposited in containers with late-instar Ae. triseriatus, suggesting that the presence of successful heterospecifics indicates a good quality larval habitat.","[Grech, Marta G.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Grech, Marta G.] UNPSJB, Fac Ciencias Nat, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Grech, MG (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Roca 780, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina.",mgrech@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322-01A1]; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We wish to thank G.

We found no significant density-dependent effects on either the predator or prey species, likely due to meiofaunal prey oversupply; however, the diet composition of the prey species Sillago spp. changed significantly in the presence of their potential predator. We conclude that lower consumption of meiofaunal amphipods in the presence of gobies suggests that whiting perhaps maintain their gut fullness by preferentially targeting larger amphipods.","[Gilby, B.

We examined intraguild predation (IGP) of adult females of the specialist P. persimilis and the generalist T. bagdasarjani on a daily basis. This was completed in experimental conditions of 25 degrees C, 75% RH and a photoperiod of 16h light: 8h dark. The results showed that both adult female predators were able to discriminate between immature stages of conspecifics and heterospecifics. In T. bagdasarjani, IGP was common and they preferred conspecifics. But in P. persimilis, there was more cannibalism and preference for conspecifics. Immatures of both predators were able to reach adulthood when provided with either con- or heterospecifics. Both phytoseiid species have higher predation rates and oviposition on the larvae of two phytoseiid species compared to eggs and protonymphs. Typhlodromus bagdasarjani females were able to sustain oviposition when feeding on P. persimilis. Females of P. persimilis sustained oviposition when provided with conspecific larvae and protonymphs. Survival time of P. persimilis was increased when feeding on eggs and protonymphs vs. larvae. Different behavioural patterns in intra- and interspecific predation are considered in regard to their feeding types (generalist against specialist).","[Ghasemloo, Zahra; Pakyari, Hajar; Arbab, Abbas] Islamic Azad Univ, Takestan Branch, Dept Entomol, Takestan, Iran","Pakyari, H (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Takestan Branch, Dept Entomol, Takestan, Iran.",Pakyari@tiau.ac.ir,"arbab, abbas/A-9798-2009; Pakyari, Hajar/AAN-5928-2021","Pakyari, Hajar/0000-0001-5488-1323",,,,35,3,5,0,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0164-7954,1945-3892,,INT J ACAROL,Int.

However, other factors also contribute to these patterns. For example, theoretical studies as well as two survey-based studies have all suggested that dispersal may also impact these patterns. While natural communities commonly have nonrandom patterns of negative co-occurrence, understanding how different processes drive these patterns requires further research. We tested the influence of dispersal on co-occurrence patterns using a zooplankton mesocosm experiment with four different dispersal treatments varying in the number of dispersers delivered into mesocosms on regular intervals. Our dispersal treatments were intended to adjust the relative importance of dispersal and competition experienced within mesocosms (i.e., high dispersal results in a relatively low influence of competition on species composition and vice versa). Higher dispersal translated into increased zooplankton species richness and inter-mesocosm compositional similarity, and also changed species occupancy patterns such that species occurrences were more even across mesocosms in higher-dispersal treatments. Dispersal treatments also differed markedly in species co-occurrence patterns. Negative co-occurrence patterns were significant for all but the lowest-dispersal treatment, peaked in the intermediate-dispersal treatments, and declined in the highest-dispersal treatment. Stability analyses illustrate that co-occurrence differences are robust to the exclusion of any single mesocosm in null model analyses. Dispersal treatments did not significantly differ with respect to abiotic variation, which has been recognized as a potential driver of negative co-occurrence patterns. These results suggest that not only can dispersal influence patterns of negative co-occurrence via changes to species richness and distribution (occupancy patterns among mesocosms), but the degree to which they do so varies nonlinearly with the strength of dispersal. Critically, because negative co-occurrence patterns were nonsignificant when the contribution of dispersal was lowest, it is possible that dispersal contributes strongly to many observed patterns of negative co-occurrence. Consequently, great care should be taken prior to interpreting significant co-occurrence tests as a product of species interactions.","[Schamp, Brandon S.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, PQ P6A 2G4, Canada; [Arnott, Shelley E.; Joslin, Katelyn L.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Schamp, BS (corresponding author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, PQ P6A 2G4, Canada.",brandon.schamp@algomau.ca,,"Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We thank D.

Such movement is often influenced by biotic interactions, but the abiotic environment can also be important, affecting the strength of species' interactions and even changing their outcome. Here, we focused on two biotic interactions and examined their effect on movement of the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator: intraspecific interactions (specifically, the effect of conspecific density) and interspecific interactions with a competitor-predator, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta (=Nassarius obsoletus). We assessed the magnitude of the temporal variation and examined the influence of pertinent abiotic variables (lunar cycle, presence of tide pools). Despite substantial temporal variation in movement levels, density of conspecifics did not influence emigration or immigration rates of C. volutator. Mud snails negatively affected immigration of C. volutator, and this was consistent across all lunar phases. However, mud snails influenced mortality and emigration of C. volutator in a contrasting way relative to lunar phases; sometimes amphipods evaded snails and survived, but at other times did not emigrate and were killed. The presence of tide pools did not change the nature or strength of the snail-amphipod interaction. Our results further clarify the complex interactions between C. volutator and I. obsoleta and suggest that resources on the mudflat are sufficient to sustain high densities of amphipods in a density-independent manner. Further, they highlight the importance of considering multiple environmental variables when examining interspecific interactions.","[Drolet, David; Hamilton, Diana J.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada; [Drolet, David; Coffin, Michael R.

By manipulating prey species richness and identity in experimental mesocosms, we sought to explore the effects of interspecific prey interactions between pinfish Lagodon rhomboides and pigfish Orthopristis chrysoptera, and between blue crabs Callinectes sapidus and common mud crabs Panopeus herbstii on the consumption rates of a shared predator species, gulf toadfish Opsanus beta. We also determined the effects of these interactions on the survivorship of the prey species as mediated by the predator. In both fish and crab prey trials, interspecific interactions between multiple prey increased the overall consumption rate of O. beta, and in each case, one prey species was harmed (decreased survivorship) while the other prey species was not significantly affected by these interactions (all relative to single-prey treatments). In trials run with fish prey, behavioral observations revealed that L rhomboides aggressively chased O. chrysoptera out of a seagrass refuge and into a surrounding sand matrix where O. beta foraged, thus increasing O. chrysoptera vulnerability to predation. In trials run with crab prey, C. sapidus failed to reduce their activity in the presence of O. beta. In addition, P. herbstii displaced C. sapidus from the seagrass refuge in mixed prey treatments, and so these conspicuous behaviors primarily occurred in the unstructured sand habitat where C. sapidus were more vulnerable to predation. We conclude that multiple prey effects, including those involving risk-enhancing, agonistic interactions between prey, can be important determinants of predator-prey outcomes. This may be especially true when refuge space is limited. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Toscano, Benjamin J.; Fodrie, F.

In this study, we compared the sensory physiology and behavior of three native species-slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus, spoonhead sculpin C. ricei. and logperch Percina caprodes-with those of the round goby to determine the mechanisms that allow the round goby to dominate native fish. The reaction and strike distances of the four species were examined during predator-prey trials using natural amphipod prey Gammarus spp. under varying light intensities (0-130 lx) to compare input from the mechanosensory lateral line and Visual systems. Trials in the dark (0 lx) indicated that the sculpins and the round goby had similar lateral line sensitivity. However, all three native species had a significant advantage in reaction and strike distance over the round goby at higher light intensities, Interspecific resource competition was assessed by pairing a round goby with a native fish in an artificial stream. Round gobies gained significantly more weight than the native fishes during all trials. Slimy sculpins were able to maintain their weight in the presence of the round goby: however. spoonhead sculpins and logperch lost a significant amount of Weight during the trials. These experiments indicate that although the round goby does not possess an inherent sensory advantage. it can dominate resources and outcompete native fish. Thus, round gobies may pose risks for a wide variety of native benthic fishes.","[Bergstrom, Margot A.; Mensinger, Allen F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, Duluth, MN 55812 USA","Mensinger, AF (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, 1035 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",amensing@d.umn.edu,"Schwalbe, Margot/AAV-5431-2020; Goforth, Reuben/B-1646-2010","Goforth, Reuben/0000-0001-6891-3146",Visualization and Digital Image Laboratory; Minnesota Sea Grant College U.S. Department of Commerce,"We thank Toni Hrabik, Michael Lynch, and Jamie Sloan for insightful comments on the manuscript.

The field experiments required to test this hypothesis are complex to implement, but the recent revival of regression methods offers a viable alternative. Here we use the dynamic and static regression methods to determine the importance of D. aurita as a competitor and intraguild predator. Capture-recapture data from two localities in the Rio de Janeiro State were used, Garrafao (municipality of Guapimirim), a coastal forest of the Serra do Mar, and Barra de Marica, a costal sand dune vegetation. Population and microhabitat variables were monitored from April 1997 to April 2003 in Garrafao, and from January 1986 to July 1990 in Barra de Marica. Microhabitat variables were related to Canopy, Plant, Litter and Rock covers, Obstruction from 0 to 1.5 m, and Number of logs. Exploitation competition was tested by the dynamic method, which models the effects of D. aurita on the per capita growth rate of a species. Interference by predation or competition was tested by the static method, where the abundance of D. aurita at trap stations was regressed against the abundance of other small mammals, after removal of any variation associated with microhabitat factors. Exploitation competition was not detected, but the interference of D. aurita was pervasive, affecting all small mammals studied in the two localities. The clear avoidance of D. aurita by all small mammals tested in two localities of different physiognomies indicates that it functions as an intraguild predator, even if actual predation by D. aurita is an occasional event.","[Vieira, Marcus V.; Cerqueira, Rui] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Vertebrados, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Vieira, MV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Vertebrados, CP 68020, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mvvieira@biologia.ufrj.br,"Vieira, Marcus/U-5314-2019; Vieira, Marcus/D-2540-2011; Cerqueira, Rui/E-5321-2011","Vieira, Marcus/0000-0002-4472-5447; ",IBAMA/MMA; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPERJFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ); FUJB; PIBIC/CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"Many colleagues and partners assisted in the fieldwork, particularly Joana Macedo, Diogo Loretto, Rosana Gentile and Simone Freitas.

It is harder to predict what happens when both processes operate simultaneously. We describe an experiment that attempted to explore how shared natural enemies and resource competition structured a simple experimental insect community. Replicated communities were assembled in population cages consisting of the aphid species Acyrthosiphon pisum and Megoura viciae either alone or competing for a resource, their shared host plant Vicia faba. Each combination was set up with and without the parasitoid Praon dorsale which attacked both species of aphid. Population dynamic data show that interspecific resource competition was the dominant process structuring the community. Though juvenile parasitoids could develop successfully inside hosts of both species, they failed to suppress either aphid below their carrying capacities and were unable to persist on one species. We suggest that intense resource competition may reduce the value of individual aphids as hosts for parasitoids such that their population growth rate is less than zero and discuss whether this phenomenon occurs in natural and agricultural communities.","[Jones, Thomas S.; Godfray, H.

In many systems this separation is experimentally impossible without interfering with the natural behavior of the animals. Consequently, these studies can only demonstrate the combined effect of interference and exploitation on the forager's feeding rate, namely, it usually decreases in a decelerating rate as a function of density. We suggest here a simple experimental and statistical procedure that facilitates the separation of the effects of interference from those of exploitation. This procedure includes manipulation of both predator density and the foraging experiment duration. The statistical analysis is based on multiple linear regression. The working assumption is that exploitation can be neglected at the beginning of the foraging experiment because, initially, predators do not experience diminishing returns in prey capture rates.

As predators can influence habitat use in rodents, Pearl Island was selected because no mammalian predators of rodents are present. Rats were trapped in two other habitats to clarify rat distribution on the island and to obtain samples for stable isotope investigation of food partitioning within habitats. The experimental removal of ship rats failed, as Pacific rats were found to share forest and shrubland with ship rats. This result contrasted with the restricted distribution of Pacific rats on Stewart Island. Ship rats were ubiquitous, and appear to have been the dominant species in podocarp-broadleaf forest oil Pearl Island. The largest species, the Norway rat, was trapped only oil the foreshore of Pearl Island, but on Stewart Island it is more widespread. Ship rats and Norway rats were partitioning the coastal habitat by exploiting different food sources. Stable isotopic ratios (delta N-15 and delta C-13) in muscle samples from Norway rats revealed a strong marine signature, Suggesting intensive foraging in the intertidal zone. Ship rats trapped in the same habitat exhibited mixed terrestrial and marine sources in their diet. There was little obvious partitioning between ship rats and Pacific rats in forest, except a possible delay in breeding in Pacific rats relative to ship rats. Whether Norway rats select the intertidal zone to forage, or were excluded from forest by ship rats is unknown, but competitive exclusion is likely. Estimated densities of rats were low (2.1 - 5.1 rats ha(-1) in forest, 1.42 rats ha(-1) in shrubland) and similar to other New Zealand sites with low soil fertility. Further research will be required to elucidate the roles of food quality, habitat structure and predation in facilitating habitat selection in these species.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Harper, GA (corresponding author), Dept Conservat, POB 743, Invercargill, New Zealand.",gharper@doc.govt.nz,,,,,,68,25,26,0,24,NEW ZEALAND ECOL SOC,CHRISTCHURCH,"PO BOX 25178, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",0110-6465,,,NEW ZEAL J ECOL,N.

Models predict that predation should mitigate species responses to environmental change, and that interspecific competition should aggravate species responses to environmental change. To test this prediction, we studied how predation and competition affected the responses of two ciliates, Colpidiumstriatum and Parameciumtetraurelia, to temperature change in laboratory microcosms. We found that neither predation nor competition altered the responses of Colpidiumstriatum to temperature change, and that competition but not predation altered the responses of Paramecium tetraurelia to temperature change. Asymmetric interactions and temperature-dependent interactions may have contributed to the disparity between model predictions and experimental results. Our results suggest that models ignoring inherent complexities in ecological communities may be inadequate in forecasting species responses to environmental change.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Jiang, L (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",ljiang@imcs.rutgers.edu,,,,,,59,22,23,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2004,106,2,,,,,217,224,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13056.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,834QC,WOS:000222424600002,,,,,2021-09-24,

We analysed data collected during a 3-year predator reduction experiment to find out the effects of predators on population structure, reproductive parameters, and individual quality of Microtus voles (the field vole M. agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis) in western Finland. Voles were collected by snap trapping in April, June, August, and October during 1997-1999. The yearly reduction of predators from April to October had a clear positive effect on the abundance of sibling voles but did not significantly affect the densities of field voles. Predator reduction apparently also affected the age ratio and mean body size in late summer, as well as pancreatic weights of voles. However, all observed differences between predator reduction and control areas, except those in abundance, were small and may mainly reflect a generally higher survival leading to higher densities of voles in predator reduction areas. Our results also indicated a relative lack of high quality food at population peaks but not because of reduced foraging activity in the presence of predators. We conclude that the indirect effects of vole-eating predators on the population growth of main prey are small compared to the detrimental direct effects on prey survival. In the case of less preferred prey, indirect effects of predation through reduced interspecific competition may play a role at high densities.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Norrdahl, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",kainor@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X",,,,63,20,20,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2004,105,2,,,,,312,324,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12684.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,805RJ,WOS:000220383100011,,,,,2021-09-24,

The relative importance of each type of interaction is usually a function of the relative size of the organisms involved. This study used field experiments to assess potential size-dependent interactions among small juvenile killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and larger adult killifish. Density, species combinations, and predation risk were manipulated within field enclosures on an intertidal salt marsh on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects between small juveniles (larval killifish and postlarval grass shrimp) were examined in the absence and presence of predators (larger adult killifish) to determine interactions and modifications of interactions due to predators. In the absence of predators both negative intraspecific and interspecific effects occurred in the form of reduced growth of juvenile grass shrimp. Survival of juvenile shrimp was the same in the presence or absence of juvenile killifish. However, when larger adult killifish were present, the interspecific competitive effect of reduced growth in juvenile grass shrimp was not significantly different from controls. Growth and survival of juvenile fish were unaffected by increased density of conspecific juveniles and the presence of juvenile grass shrimp and adult fish predators. These results provide field evidence for interspecific competitive interactions between juveniles of two of the most abundant species of nekton utilizing salt marsh habitat along the eastern coast of North America. However, when larger adult killifish predators were present these interspecific competitive effects among similar sized juvenile killifish and grass shrimp disappeared. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We studied the effects of a pathogenic water mold, Saprolegnia ferax, on competitive interactions between the Cascades frog Rana cascadae and the Pacific treefrog Hyla regilla. Previous studies have shown that outbreaks of Saprolegnia infection in the Cascade mountains of Oregon, USA, result in high embryonic mortality for Rana but not for Hyla. Thus, we examined how infections of Saprolegnia during amphibian embryonic development could influence larval recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Rana and Hyla. We manipulated the presence of Saprolegnia and embryonic Hyla and Rana in replicated artificial ponds and determined mean survivorship to hatching per pool from daily observations during embryonic development. Pools were then followed throughout larval development, and we recorded mean mass of tadpoles at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis per pool. The presence of Saprolegnia differentially affected larval recruitment of the two species; larval recruitment of Rana was reduced by 46.2% in the presence of Saprolegnia, whereas Hyla survival was not affected. However, larval Rana that survived Saprolegnia infection developed faster and were larger at metamorphosis compared to individuals not exposed to Saprolegnia. In the absence of Saprolegnia, Rana had strong negative effects on the growth, development, and survival of Hyla. However, in the presence of Saprolegnia, the outcome of competitive interactions between the two species was reversed. Saprolegnia may have positive indirect effects on both Hyla and Rana by regulating both intra- and interspecific competition. These results suggest that pathogens can have strong effects on species interactions and may ultimately influence community structure.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kiesecker, JM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",,,,,,,48,78,82,1,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1999,80,7,,,,,2442,2448,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2442:PRCBLA]2.0.CO;2,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,243QU,WOS:000083009400027,,,,,2021-09-24,

Although many species of voles usually coexist and are in severe competition for food and breeding space, the role of interspecific competition in vole cycles has never been evaluated statistically After studying community effects on the population dynamics of the gray-sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in the subarctic birch forest at Kilpisjarvi, Finland, we report statistical results showing that both interspecific and intraspecific effects are important in the direct year-to-year density dependence, However, interspecific effects are-not detectable in the 2-year delayed density dependence that is crucial for generating the characteristic cycles. Furthermore, we show that most of the competition takes place during the winter. The results are evaluated against two models of community dynamics. One assumes that the delayed effects are caused by an interaction with a specialist predator, and the other assumes that they are caused by overgrazing food plants. These statistical results show that vole cycles may be generated by a species-specific trophic interaction. The results also suggest that the gray-sided vole may be the focal species in the birch-forest community, as field voles may be in the taiga and as lemmings may be on the tundra.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Finnish Forest Res Inst, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Stenseth, NC (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, POB 1050, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",n.c.stenseth@bio.uio.no,"Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; Hansen, Thomas F/B-9021-2009","Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; ",,,,46,79,82,0,40,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Disturbance, interspecific competition between seedlings and between seedlings and adults, and access for potential predators were manipulated in the field after a fire to identify mechanisms to explain between- and within-habitat species coexistence. When soil surfaces are disturbed or seeds are buried, dry-heath species can establish in the wet heath. Under natural conditions, however, wet heath is rarely disturbed by animal foragers and lack of safe sites may preclude establishment of dry-heath species. In contrast, dry heath is often disturbed by ground foragers such as bandicoots and safe sites are plentiful for establishment of all heath species. Nevertheless, while wet-heath species can establish in dry heath, their seedlings are apparently unable to survive there due to the drier conditions. No evidence for competition among species was detected in either type of habitat during the first 3 years of the experiment, even at elevated seedling densities. Lack of early competition and unsaturated seed-banks may promote coexistence of species. Seedling predation from vertebrates was low and did not appear to influence patterns of coexistence within or between habitats. In terms of community theory we suggest that several interacting mechanisms are responsible for community structure in heaths after a fire. Chance and microsite disturbance are important during dispersal, while resources are critical during establishment and early survival of seedling populations. In these heath systems where fires burn extensive areas, seed-banks may be more important in temporal storage of species than patch or spatial storage as a mechanism for maintaining coexistence and plant diversity.","UNIV SYDNEY,SCH BIOL SCI,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA; UNIV SYDNEY,INST WILDLIFE RES A12,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA",,,"Clarke, Peter/D-6403-2012",,,,,23,9,9,0,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

The two predators were functionally equivalent, eliminating Bufo and Hyla, while leaving Pseudacris to numerically dominate ponds with salamanders. Effects of both predators also cascaded down to algal primary producers, which became more abundant where predators reduced the abundance of herbivorous tadpoles. Combined impacts of the two predator species on the survival of Pseudacris were less than that predicted by an additive model of the effects of each predator measured in the absence of the other, but greater than predicted by a multiplicative model of joint predator effects. Reduced growth of Ambystoma with Notophthalmus provides one possible mechanism for the observed shift to less than additive per capita predator effects.

Feeding rates of the two species were significantly different, with fathead minnow feeding at a greater rate than brook stickleback in the absence of a predator. In the presence of a predator the feeding rate of fathead minnow declined significantly whereas that of brook stickleback was unaffected. This resulted in similar feeding rates for the two species in the presence of a predator.

We conclude that the dual risks of predation and intrasexual competition for mates have been significant selective factors in shaping the evolution of courtship decisions in Desmognathus ochrophaeus.","WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,PULLMAN,WA 99164; UNIV CHICAGO,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT,CHICAGO,IL 60637; HOPE COLL,HOLLAND,MI 49423",,,,,,,,52,20,20,0,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

We added hatchlings of two sympatric anuran species (Hyla [= Pseudacris] crucifer and Bufo woodhousii) to artificial ponds on three different dates to manipulate the order and temporal separation of their arrival. Measurement of the growth and survival of each species in ponds where the second species arrived simultaneously (day 0), or after a delay of 7 or 14 d, indicated whether differences in the history of introductions affected interspecific competition. Other ponds contained H. crucifer alone, introduced on the same three dates, or B. woodhousii alone, introduced on the first or second date. These provided controls for seasonal differences in performance in the absence of competition from the other anuran species. Introductions of tadpoles at different times produced small differences in growth rates and larval periods when each anuran species occurred alone. In ponds containing both species, differences in the order and temporal separation of introductions had complex effects on the intensity of interspecific competition. When Bufo preceded Hyla, Hyla had prolonged larval periods and reduced mass and growth. When Hyla preceded Bufo, it was unaffected by Bufo. Hyla had no effects on Bufo, whether its introduction preceded or followed the introduction of Bufo. Asymmetric priority effects were not easily explained as a simple size-dependent competitive advantage of earlier arrivals. Early arrival increased the competitive impact of Bufo on Hyla, but failed to generate a competitive effect of Hyla on Bufo. Bufo tadpoles are more active than Hyla, and so may consume resources at higher rates that cannot be offset by a temporal advantage. Competition from Bufo was strongest when Hyla arrived 7 d later, suggesting that Hyla arriving 14 d after Bufo benefited from a longer period of reduced competition after Bufo metamorphosed from the ponds. The natural pattern, where Hyla breeds before or simultaneously with Bufo, permits Hyla to minimize competition from Bufo, while Bufo suffers no measurable cost from the size advantage obtained by competitively weaker Hyla tadpoles. Bufo may be prevented from breeding any earlier in the season by physiological constraints acting on eggs or breeding adults.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,BUR BIOL RES,NELSON LABS,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855","LAWLER, SP (corresponding author), RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855, USA.",,,,,,,34,124,126,0,30,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,174,182,,10.2307/1939512,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500018,,,,,2021-09-24,

Parasitoids and predators can provide sustainable long-term solutions to pest problems (biological control), reducing the need for expensive and sometimes polluting pesticide applications. When several species of beneficial insects are present, their pest control actions may be additive, synergistic, or disruptive. One form of disruptive interaction between parasitoids and predators is direct interspecific contest for access to individual pests (the resource to be exploited). This study evaluated behavioural interactions between brood-guarding wasps, Goniozus nephantidis (Muesebeck) (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), which are known to engage in intra-specific contests, and a predatory bug, Cardiastethus exiguus (Poppius) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), which attack the same pest species, Opisina arenosella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae), a major pest in coconut production systems. Dyadic parasitoid-predator and predator-predator contests were staged to determine the factors that influence the behaviours within, and outcomes of, such interactions. Parasitoids were aggressive towards predators, sometimes killing them, but predators were not aggressive towards parasitoids. Biting and stinging only occurred when there was a host larva present. In the absence of the parasitoid that had oviposited onto a host, predators often consumed the parasitoid's eggs. Egg consumption sometimes occurred when the parasitoid was present. Intra-specific competition between pairs of predators was also evaluated: adults were aggressive towards each other, but interactions were not fatal. Biting was more common when there was no prey larva present. When a larva was present, predators were observed feeding simultaneously. We conclude that direct parasitoid-predator interactions are likely to influence pest population dynamics, possibly reducing the overall suppression of O. arenosella by its natural enemies.","[Velasco-Hernandez, Maria C.; Hardy, Ian C.

Antlion larvae usually occur in clusters with a high density of individuals; therefore, competition can be intense. We observed two abundant antlion species, E. nostras and M. formicarius, which co-occur in some habitats. In a simple habitat choice experiment where substrates differed according to sand particle size, we found that E. nostras exhibited dominance over M. formicarius. Most E. nostras larvae remained in the more suitable substrate and constructed pits, while all the M. formicarius larvae moved out of the suitable area, and did not build pits. In the second experiment, we observed the characteristics of the pit-fall traps and scored the occurrence of larval relocation in relation to interactions and in the control group, where larvae were kept in containers separately. In interactions, the larvae of E. nostras constructed smaller pits, but pit enlargement was greater in comparison to the control group. M. formicarius larvae constructed similar sized pits in both groups; however, enlargement was greater in the control group. Relocation of larvae occurred only during interactions. In direct interactions, we found 15 behavioural patterns, which are described in detail for the first time. In the presence of a competitor, larvae showed intense territorial behaviour. We recorded several behavioural patterns during larval confrontation, and interestingly, intraguild predation rarely occurred. In most cases, E. nostras larvae outcompete M. formicarius, which was evident from the larger pits and the rate of pit-construction.","[Klokocovnik, Vesna; Veler, Eva; Devetak, Dusan] Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Koroska Cesta 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia","Klokocovnik, V (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Koroska Cesta 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",vesna.klokocovnik@um.si,,,Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia; Research Programme Computationally Intensive Complex Systems [P1-0403],This research was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency and the Research Programme Computationally Intensive Complex Systems (Grant No. P1-0403).,,50,2,2,1,1,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

These antagonistic interactions have been scarcely studied in coccinellids. Through a laboratory study we assessed aphid consumption, weight gain and reproduction when the invasive Harmonia axyridis, the alien Hippodamia variegata and the native Eriopis chilensis were alone, in conspecific and heterospecific groups, at low and high aphid densities. Under intraspecific competition, coccinellids were more voracious than when they were alone, particularly H. axyridis and H. variegata at high aphid density; H. axyridis and H. variegata gained more weight than E. chilensis, and H. axyridis barely reproduced at low aphid densities, even when alone, while in the other two species reproduction was not affected by the presence of conspecifics. Under interspecific competition, weight gain and reproduction results suggest that H. axyridis was responsible for most aphid consumption; H. variegata gained less weight and barely reproduced in heterospecific groups, but its reproduction was not affected. Eriopis chilensis weight gain and reproduction was low but not affected by the presence of the other species. The lack of negative effects of intraspecific competition on H. axyridis and its better performance in heterospecific groups suggests that this species is the stronger competitor, negatively affecting H. variegata, but not E. chilensis. Thus, exploitative interspecific competition is an important mechanism explaining the dominance of H. axyridis and the decline of some species following its invasion. Therefore, this interaction deserves more attention than what has been paid up to now.","[Zaviezo, Tania] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Casilla 306-22, Santiago, Chile; [Soares, Antonio Onofre] Univ Azores, Dept Biol, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal; [Grez, Audrey A.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Casilla 2-15, Santiago, Chile","Grez, AA (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Casilla 2-15, Santiago, Chile.",agrez@uchile.cl,"Zaviezo, Tania/F-3099-2014; Zaviezo, Tania/AAM-5707-2020; Soares, Antonio Onofre/M-4207-2013","Zaviezo, Tania/0000-0002-4993-0386; Zaviezo, Tania/0000-0002-4993-0386; Soares, Antonio Onofre/0000-0001-7922-6296","FONDECYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140662, 1180533]","Special thanks to Elizabeth Gazzano for her invaluable help with field collections, insect colonies and assistance during the laboratory experiments.

This study assesses the possible direct and indirect impact of the mass occurrence on native fish species in the lake. Laboratory foraging experiments showed that larvae of roach Rutilus rutilus L., perch Perca fluviatilis L. and whitefish Coregonus lavaretus L are accessible to sticklebacks as food. However, distinct species effects were apparent, with whitefish showing no effective predator avoidance strategy and therefore experiencing drastically increased mortality risk compared to the other predator adapted prey species. Furthermore, in absence of larval prey, sticklebacks were shown to feed predominantly on Daphnia in the field, indicating a strong interspecific food competition with whitefish. The results suggest that sticklebacks, acting as both an invasive species and a predator in the pelagic zone where prior no predator or neozoon existed, create a unique challenge to the unadapted autochthonous fish, and thus threaten the ecological resilience of the lake. Impacts on recruitment, e.g. through larval predation and interspecific competition for zooplankton could explain recent drastic declines in fishing yields.","[Roch, S.; von Ammon, L.; Brinker, A.] Fisheries Res Stn Baden Wurttemberg, Argenweg 50-1, D-88085 Langenargen, Germany; [Geist, J.] Tech Univ Munich, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Muehlenweg 22, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Brinker, A.] Univ Konstanz, Mainaustr 252, D-78464 Constance, Germany","Roch, S (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Stn Baden Wurttemberg, Argenweg 50-1, D-88085 Langenargen, Germany.",samuel.roch@lazbw.bwl.de,"Geist, Juergen/C-4933-2008; Brinker, Alexander/ABF-4644-2020","Geist, Juergen/0000-0001-7698-3443; Brinker, Alexander/0000-0002-2433-5652",,,,78,12,12,3,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-7836,1872-6763,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,AUG,2018,204,,,,,,172,180,,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.014,,,9,Fisheries,Fisheries,GG5XB,WOS:000432768000019,,,,,2021-09-24,

During daylight hours they remain in an akinetic state inside their shelters, whereas at dusk they become active and move outside. When they are outside their shelters during the photophase, triatomines are vulnerable to diurnal predators and the period just before dawn is critical to their survival. This work analyses the existence of competitive interactions involved in the occupancy of shelters by triatomines. Behavioural assays were performed in which nymphs of different stages, nutritional status or species were released in an experimental arena containing a space-limited artificial shelter. The proportions of individuals occupying the shelter during the photophase were quantified to estimate the competitive abilities of each stage and species. Intraspecific comparisons showed higher levels of shelter occupancy for fourth over fifth instars and fed over unfed nymphs of Triatoma infestans. Interspecific comparisons showed higher rates of shelter occupancy for Triatoma sordida in comparison with T. infestans, and for T. infestans over Rhodnius prolixus. Arrival order was also relevant to determining shelter occupancy levels: early arrival was advantageous in comparison with later arrival. The study of intra-and interspecific competitive interactions for shelter occupancy provides relevant information about colonization and recolonization processes in the natural environments of triatomines.","[Zacharias, C.

We carried out a mesocosm experiment manipulating the identity and richness of predators and habitat heterogeneity to test their influence on resource use effectiveness, competition among predators, and trophic cascades in a model estuarine system with 3 trophic levels (microalgae, mysids, and the predators blue crab Callinectes sapidus, sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa, and grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio). We hypothesized that increasing predator species richness would increase mysid suppression because of complementarity among predators, that complementarity would be better expressed in more heterogeneous habitats, and that higher mysid suppression would increase algae biomass through cascading effects. Assemblages with multiple predators were more effective at suppressing prey than the average single predator, but not in comparison to the most effective predator (i.e. no transgressive overyielding). Predator diversity effects increased with habitat heterogeneity, possibly because it allowed interspecific complementarity among predators to be expressed. Moreover, habitat heterogeneity dampened intraspecific predation and/or negative behavioral interactions between predators. A trophic cascade was not observed because of the low mysid grazing impact on microalgae, probably related to the omnivorous feeding of mysids. Our findings indicate that the loss of both biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity should alter the energy flux in marine food webs; therefore, both must be considered for the proper management of natural ecosystems.","[Miyashita, Leonardo K.; Richardson, J.

Exploitative competition is an indirect effect that occurs through use of a shared resource and depends on resource availability. Interference competition occurs by obstructing access to a resource and may not depend on resource availability. Our study tested whether the strength of interference competition changes with protozoa population density. We grew experimental microcosms of protozoa and bacteria under different combinations of protozoan density and basal resource availability. We then solved a dynamic predator-prey model for parameters of the functional response using population growth rates measured in our experiment. As population density increased, competition shifted from exploitation to interference, and competition was less dependent on resource levels. Surprisingly, the effect of resources was weakest when competition was the most intense. We found that at low population densities, competition was largely exploitative and resource availability had a large effect on population growth rates, but the effect of resources was much weaker at high densities. This shift in competitive mechanism could have implications for interspecific competition, trophic interactions, community diversity, and natural selection. We also tested whether this shift in the mechanism of competition with protozoa density affected the structure of the bacterial prey community.

However, these plastic responses may also have an interaction cost, which is assessed by the strength of interspecific interactions such as increased vulnerability to other predators or a reduction in competitive ability. This study assesses experimentally the effects of induced morphological defenses triggered by the carnivorous rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli, on the competitive ability of two herbivorous populations, and the reciprocal dominance between the rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Brachionus havanaensis. Our results support the existence of a trade-off between the expression of induced morphological defenses and competitive ability in aquatic animals. Specifically, we show that: (i) a consumer which reduces its vulnerability to predation via induced defenses increases its resource requirement to maintain zero population growth; and (ii) the expression of induced defenses promotes a qualitative shift in the relative competitive performance of the two herbivores over a single resource gradient. These results reinforce the general idea of functional community consequences of phenotypic plasticity, in particular the expression of inducible defenses of prey.","[Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo] Fdn Univ Chile, Ctr Nacl Medio Ambiente, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Bustamante, Ramiro O.] Inst Ecol & Biodivers IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo; Bustamante, Ramiro O.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ecol & Recursos Nat, Santiago, Chile","Aranguiz-Acuna, A (corresponding author), Fdn Univ Chile, Ctr Nacl Medio Ambiente, Av Larrain 9975, Santiago, Chile.",a.aranguiz@cenma.cl,"BUSTAMANTE, RAMIRO/I-7353-2019; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo/F-3160-2013","Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana/0000-0002-9409-1147",CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [ICM-P05-002]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1090132],A.A.-A. acknowledges the support of a CONICYT doctoral scholarship and grant ICM-P05-002 to Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity.

Henry Wilbur's model of population regulation in amphibians serves as a framework for the arguments. Much of the discussion is based on studies of eastern North American plethodontids that have been the focus of most of the research. Ensembles of plethodontids in this region include species with complex fife cycles (i.e., larval development) and simple life cycles (i.e., direct development). Interactions between members of these two life-history categories appear to be weaker than those within categories. Whereas there is no definitive evidence of factors that regulate populations of plethodontid salamanders, interspecific competition and intraguild predation do appear to contribute in some ensembles. Food and space have been identified as limiting resources in interspecific competition. Although predation of larger on smaller salamanders may be relatively rare in nature, the threat of predation appears to promote behavioral responses in members of the smaller species that reduce risks but may lower fitness through other effects. The role of extralimital predators and competitors in regulation of these salamanders is largely untested. ideally, future research should involve manipulative experiments on unenclosed field plots that examine effects of resources, intraguild competitors and predators, and extralimital predators on populations of key species of plethodontids.","Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA","Bruce, RC (corresponding author), Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA.",ebruce1563@aol.com,,,Highlands Biological Station; Western Carolina University,"I benefited immensely front insightful discussions of plethodontid ecology, over many years with the late Nelson G Hairston, Sr. (1917-2008), I dedicate this paper to his memory.

Predation by the spider on the three ladybird species differed. All the larvae of C. septempunctata, none of H. axyridis, and an intermediate number of P. japonica were attacked and eaten by the spider. All the larvae of H. axyridis suffered mortality due to cannibalism or starvation in the treatments with and without a spider. In case of C. septempunctata, however, mortality in the early instars was significantly greater in the treatment with a spider than without a spider and no larvae developed into pupae due to predation. In the treatment without a spider, the majority of the larvae in the former treatment suffered mortality due to cannibalism or starvation, and only 13.3% of larvae developed into the adult stage. In the case of P. japonica, mortality was mainly attributed to predation in the treatment with a spider and only 26.7% became adult. In comparison, 86.7% of larvae survived to the adult stage in the treatment without a spider. In addition, in both H. axyridis and C. septempunctata, the development of young larvae was significantly slower in the presence of a spider, but this was not the case with the older larvae of H. axyridis, which indicates that the effect of the spider on larval development changed with the developmental stage of the larvae in this species. However, the spider had no significant effect on the developmental time of P. japonica larvae. Although both the spider and the ladybirds significantly affected the number of aphids. they did not have an additive effect on aphid abundance. The interactions between the spider and the ladybirds, such as intraguild predation or competition, caused them to reduce aphid population density less than the ladybirds did on their own. The effect of the spider on the larval performance of three predatory ladybirds was found to be unequal in terms of their vulnerability to predation and rats of larval development and it depended on the species and developmental stage of the ladybird.","Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan","Yasuda, H (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.",,,,,,,38,23,28,0,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

I tested predictions from the shelter bottleneck hypothesis, which proposes that shelter (or refuge) limitation can control population size structure and density by acting strongly on only one size class. I manipulated shelter for stone crabs in four haphazardly chosen bays in the northeast Gulf of Mexico to examine the shelter bottleneck hypothesis in a mixed-model design. I also examined four biotic factors (habitat structure, food, predation, and interspecific competition) that may contribute to population-level differences among bays. I found differences among bays in stone crab size structure and density and in crab responses to size-specific shelter supplementation. These differences in stone crabs among bays included: (1) natural median crab size differed by 5.5-fold, (2) size at maturity changed by 33%, (3) adult density varied 10-fold, (4) the density response of molting individuals and gravid females to supplemental shelter differed by more than 7-fold, and (5) the shelter preferred by crabs changed from 25 to 100 mm diameter pipes. The shelter bottleneck hypothesis and differences in habitat structure best account for these differences in stone crabs among bays. There appeared to be bottlenecks in three of the four bays, and the location of the bottleneck was predictable from measures of habitat structure. There were demographic consequences of shelter limitation on stone crab growth and fecundity at the individual level, and these effects appeared to explain population-level differences among bays. However, the bottleneck effects may be mediated by differences in food quantity and competition among bays. The experiments suggest that shelter bottlenecks have important effects on stone crabs across a wide region in the northeast Gulf of Mexico, and illustrate the benefits of using random factors in experimental designs to examine the generality of ecological effects.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA",,,"Beck, Michael W./AAB-2844-2019","Beck, Michael W./0000-0002-5107-9973",,,,107,59,59,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1997,78,8,,,,,2487,2503,,,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YK726,WOS:A1997YK72600017,,,,,2021-09-24,

Generally, within a host species, large hosts (i. e. older instars) are considered of higher quality for parasitoid development. Studies of interspecific competition between parasitoids have considered the effect of host instar on indirect competition but its effect on interference competition remains unknown. Here, we report the first results on whether the quality of host instars might dictate the outcome of interference competition between sympatric parasitoids of the genus Aphytis (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) when they attack low-quality (second) and high-quality (third) instars of their common host Aonidiella aurantii (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). Oviposition behaviour (host acceptance and clutch size) in low-and high-quality host instars was similar for both Aphytis species in the absence of competition. When they found heterospecific parasitized hosts of high quality, Aphytis melinus laid more eggs and accepted significantly more hosts than Aphytis chrysomphali, whereas there were no significant differences in the low-quality instar. This result suggests that interference competition is mediated by host quality. However, the progeny proportion of both parasitoids in multiparasitized hosts (outcome of competition) was independent of host quality and A. melinus always emerged at higher rates. Therefore, the result of interference competition between these sympatric parasitoids was not affected by host quality and this competition will contribute to the displacement of the native A. chrysomphali by the introduced A. melinus, which has been observed in some areas of the Mediterranean basin.

Ecological theory predicts the trait that determines the resource holding potential (RHP), and hence the winner of encounter competition, is most often body size or mass. The difficulties of observing encounter competition in complex organisms in natural environments, however, has limited opportunities to test this theory across diverse species. We studied the outcome of encounter competition contests among mesocarnivores at deer carcasses in California to determine the most important variables for winning these contests. We found some support for current theory in that body mass is important in determining the winner of encounter competition, but we found that other factors including hunger and species-specific traits were also important. In particular, our top models were strength and hunger and size and hunger, with models emphasizing the complexity of variables influencing - outcomes of encounter competition. In addition, our wins above predicted (WAP) statistic suggests that an important aspect that determines the winner of encounter competition is species-specific advantages that increase their RHP, as bobcats (Lynx rufus) and spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) won more often than predicted based on mass. In complex - organisms, such as mesocarnivores, species-specific adaptations, including strategic behaviors, aggressiveness, and weapons, contribute to competitive advantages and may allow certain - species to take control or defend resources better than others. Our results help explain how interspecific competition shapes the occurrence patterns of species in ecological communities.","[Allen, Maximilian L.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Allen, Maximilian L.; Wittmer, Heiko U.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Allen, Maximilian L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Elbroch, L.

This study compared the relative and interacting effects of competition and predation on two competing species of coral reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. moluccensis (Pomacentridae), using a multifactorial experiment. Fish were subjected to the sight and smell of a known predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), the presence of the heterospecific competitor (i.e., P. amboinensis vs. P. moluccensis), or a combination of the two for a period of 19 days. The sub-lethal effects of predator/competitor treatments were compared with controls; a combination of otolith microstructure analysis and observations were used to determine otolith growth patterns and behaviour. We predicted that the stress of competition and/or predation would result in strong sub-lethal impacts, and act synergistically on growth and behavioural patterns. We found strong evidence to support this prediction, but only for P. amboinensis, which suffered reductions in growth in both predator and competitor treatments, with the largest reductions occurring when subjected to both predation and competition concurrently. There was strong evidence of asymmetrical competition between the two damselfish species, with P. moluccensis as the dominant competitor, displaying strong aggressive behaviour towards P. amboinensis. Growth reductions for P. amboinensis in predator/competitor treatments appeared to come about primarily due to increases in shelter seeking behaviour, which significantly reduced the foraging rates of individuals compared with controls. These data highlight the importance of predator/competitor synergisms in influencing key behaviours and demographic parameters for juvenile coral reef fishes.","[Hall, April] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Hall, A (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",april.hall3110@gmail.com,"Kingsford, Michael J/C-2015-2008","Kingsford, Michael J/0000-0003-1704-6198; Hall, April/0000-0003-3672-2761",ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies grantAustralian Research Council,All funding was from an ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies grant to Michael Kingsford.,,71,6,6,0,23,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 18,2016,11,3,,,,,,,e0151778,10.1371/journal.pone.0151778,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,DH1ZE,WOS:000372582800101,26992169,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-24,

However, research into the behavioral mechanism underlying competition between co-cultured species is lacking. For the first time in co-cultured fish and crustaceans, this study explored experimentally the behavioral interaction between red tilapia and red-claw crayfish in the context of food competion. The effects of the presence of heterospecifics (absent or present), the size of fish relative to crayfish (larger or smaller) and the number of food patches available for the fish (one- versus two-patch conditions) on the foraging decisions and aggression of fish and crayfish were tested. Time spent by fish in the bottom food patch (accessible for fish and crayfish) was shorter in the presence of crayfish, for small but not large fish and when there was an alternative patch for the fish (accessible only for fish). Time spent by crayfish in the bottom food patch was reduced in the presence of large, but not small, fish and when there was no alternative food patch for the fish. Fish were most aggressive towards conspecifics whereas interspecific aggression was exhibited only by crayfish. At the individual level, the dominant fish and crayfish spent more time in the bottom patch and performed more aggressive actions than the other conspecifics. In fish, this was not altered in the presence of crayfish. In crayfish, the overall reduction in foraging duration and aggression was due to an effect of large fish on the dominant individual. The implication of these findings for fish-crayfish communal culture is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping diel activity patterns of animals is poorly understood. We conducted controlled experiments in a little-studied area (Hulunbuir meadow steppe, China) to explore the effects of presence of a larger species, Spermophilus dauricus, and ambient temperature in shaping diel activity patterns of Microtus gregalis. Our results suggest that although interference competition existed between S. dauricus and M. gregalis, the presence of S. dauricus did not significantly affect the diel activity patterns of M. gregalis (P > 0.05).

As winter approached, ambient temperature appeared to be a major factor in shaping activity patterns of M. gregalis.

The ability of a species to respond appropriately to risk cues may determine the outcome of interspecific competition. We investigated whether two invasive mussel species, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and the quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, differ in their behavioural responses to risk cues released from round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, and rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus. In response to risk cues, both species increased their attachment strength, aggregated more, increased the use of a refuge habitat and decreased clearance rates. Although attachment strength, aggregation rate and refuge habitat use was greater for zebra than for quagga mussels, the strength of predator-induced responses was similar in the two mussel species for all behaviours except for filtering activity. Zebra mussels decreased clearance rates more when exposed to predator risk cues than quagga mussels. Both mussels decreased clearance rates the most with rusty crayfish risk cues present. Since these responses have a fitness cost associated with lower growth rates, the stronger response of zebra mussels may make this species competitively inferior to quagga mussels in an initial low-predation environment when few native predators are feeding on these mussels. This advantage may shift to zebra mussels over time if native predators learn or adapt to feed on the dreissenids. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Closely related species often differ greatly in the quality and breadth of resources exploited, but the actual mechanisms causing these differences are poorly understood. Because in the laboratory specialized species often survive and perform as well or better on host species that are never utilized in nature, negative ecological interactions restricting host range must exist. Here, we focused on reproductive interference, which has been theoretically predicted to drive niche separation between closely related species with overlapping mating signals. 2. We examined the interspecific sexual interactions in relation to ecological specialization and generalization in two sibling ladybird species, Harmonia yedoensis and Harmonia axyridis. Harmonia yedoensis is a specialist predator that preys only on pine aphids, which are highly elusive prey for ladybird hatchlings, whereas H.similar to axyridis is a generalist predator with a broad prey and habitat range. 3. We experimentally showed that conspecific sperm fertilized the vast majority of eggs regardless of mating order (i.e. conspecific sperm precedence) when a female of H.similar to yedoensis or H.similar to axyridis mated with both a conspecific and a heterospecific male. Moreover, we demonstrated that mating opportunities of H.similar to yedoensis females strongly decreased as heterospecific density increased relative to conspecific density. In contrast, in H.similar to axyridis, female mating success was high regardless of conspecific or heterospecific density. 4. Our results suggest that the generalist H.similar to axyridis should be dominant to the specialist H.similar to yedoensis in terms of reproductive interference. Our results support the hypothesis that asymmetric reproductive interference from the dominant species may force the non-dominant species to become a specialist predator that exclusively utilizes less preferred prey in nature.","[Noriyuki, Suzuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Osawa, Naoya] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Forest Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Nishida, Takayoshi] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Ecosyst Studies, Hikone 5228533, Japan","Noriyuki, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",nsuzuki@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Osawa, Naoya/ABG-1684-2020; Suzuki, Noriyuki/I-4882-2015","Suzuki, Noriyuki/0000-0002-7483-0758; Osawa, Naoya/0000-0002-6355-1948","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20405047, 20657005]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [20405047] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Dr Peter Mayhew for valuable discussions and Sarah Seiter for helpful comments on the manuscript.

The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a damaging pest and tospovirus vector that has invaded most of the world, and competitive superiority is considered one of the main reasons for this species' success. 3. However, a recent study demonstrated that competition between larval F. occidentalis and a native thrips species may be limiting F. occidentalis abundance in much of the eastern United States. Frankliniella occidentalis also has a limited abundance in central and southern Florida, which is dominated by the endemic F. bispinosa (Morgan). The potential for interspecific competition to limit F. occidentalis abundance in Florida was assessed. 4. The effects of competition between F. occidentalis and F. bispinosa on adult reproduction on a common host (Capsicum annuum L.) were quantified, using a response surface experimental design and a combination of linear and non-linear competition models. 5. Evidence of symmetric competition between these thrips species was found, but contrary to expectations, F. occidentalis reproduced more in dense interspecific populations than F. bispinosa. These results suggest that, unlike most of the eastern US, interspecific competition is not important in limiting F. occidentalis abundance in central and southern Florida.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Funderburk, Joe E.] Univ Florida, N Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Quincy, FL USA; [Paini, Dean R.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Acton Act, Australia; [Reitz, Stuart R.] USDA ARS CMAVE, Tallahassee, FL USA","Northfield, TD (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99163 USA.",tnorthfield@wsu.edu,"Paini, Dean R/C-2341-2009; Reitz, Stuart/B-7667-2008; Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019; Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X",University of FloridaUniversity of Florida; USDA-ARSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service,"Brian Inouye and Ben Bolker assisted greatly with R code.

We tested whether a subsidy of allochthonous prey enhanced an asymmetric competition between invasive bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and two native cyprinid fish, that is, stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva) and tamoroko (Gnathopogon elongatus elongatus). A field experiment was conducted using enclosures wherein the strength of interspecific competition and the presence/absence of allochthonous prey were manipulated. The experiment revealed that allochthonous prey alleviated the limitation of fish growths caused by a severe competition for aquatic prey resources. However, the importance of allochthonous prey differed considerably between invasive bluegill and the two native cyprinids. Individual bluegills grew faster when the allochthonous prey was supplied, whereas no difference in growth was observed in the two cyprinids whether or not allochthonous prey was supplied. Interestingly, the importance of allochthonous prey on the total amount of bluegill growth varied depending on the numerical abundance of native cyprinid competitors, and this importance increased when the native cyprinids were abundant. These findings indicated that allochthonous prey provides an asymmetric growth benefit to invasive bluegills over the two native cyprinids by alleviating asymmetrically the competition strength in a Japanese pond, especially under the conditions of severe interspecific resource competition and a limitation in the utilization of in situ prey resources.","[Yonekura, Ryuji] Gifu Prefectural Res Inst Freshwater Fish & Aquat, Gifu 5016021, Japan; [Yonekura, Ryuji; Yamanaka, Hiroki; Ushimaru, Atushi; Matsui, Kazuaki; Uchii, Kimiko; Maruyama, Atsushi] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Yonekura, R (corresponding author), Gifu Prefectural Res Inst Freshwater Fish & Aquat, Gifu 5016021, Japan.",yonekura@fish.rd.pref.gifu.jp,"Yamanaka, Hiroki/D-4221-2012; Uchii, Kimiko/J-8236-2019; Ushimaru, Atushi/D-7036-2013; Matsui, Kazuaki/S-1473-2019","Uchii, Kimiko/0000-0002-1375-3875; Ushimaru, Atushi/0000-0002-2051-1233; Matsui, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1563-3308",Nippon Life Insurance FoundationNippon Life Insurance Foundation,"We express our thanks to I.

We conducted preliminary field experiments to determine whether Orconectes eupunctus were displaced from their former range and whether interspecific competition with O. neglectus chaenodactylus was responsible for the displacement. To determine whether Orconectes eupunctus were displaced from their former range by negative biotic interactions with other species we placed single adult male O. eupunctus in cages at two sites: an upstream site where O. eupunctus was formerly abundant and a downstream site where it is currently abundant. Orconectes neglectus chaenodactylus were additionally paired alongside O. eupunctus at the upstream site. We also conducted a field competition experiment with treatments consisting of (1) 3 O. eupunctus, (2) 6 O. eupunctus, and (3) 3 O. eupunctus and 3 O. neglectus chaenodactylus at a site where both species occur. In the first experiment, O. eupunctus gained significantly more weight at the downstream site than the upstream site during 2003, but not during 2002. At the upstream site, O. eupunctus showed significantly greater growth rates than O. neglectus chaenodactylus during 2002, but not during 2003. In the competition experiment, O. neglectus chaenodactylus did not significantly reduce the growth or survival of O. eupunctus. These results suggest that O. eupunctus have been displaced from their former range by biotic interactions, but interspecific competition between adult male O. eupunctus and O. neglectus chaenodactylus does not appear to be the mechanism responsible for this displacement. Further study is needed to investigate the disappearance of O. eupunctus.","Univ Arkansas, US Geol Survey, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Magoulick, DD (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, US Geol Survey, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",danmag@uark.edu,"Magoulick, Daniel/AAG-1556-2020","Magoulick, Daniel/0000-0001-9665-5957",,,,48,13,13,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

The field experiment followed a two-factorial design, with Glossosoma densities (natural vs reduced) and sculpin presence (present vs absent) as treatments. Diet analysis revealed that all four prey species were eaten under the natural condition and the sculpin preferred mayfly grazers to Glossosoma. Our experiment showed that although mayfly densities in the presence of either sculpin or Glossosoma were lower than in the no-sculpin plus reduced-Glossosoma treatment, no difference in mayfly densities was found between the following three treatments: sculpin plus natural-Glossosoma, no-sculpin plus natural-Glossosoma, and sculpin plus reduced-Glossosoma. These results indicated that fish predator produced no effects additive to the competitive operation on the mayfly density, and also that competitive operation of Glossosoma on the mayfly densities produced no additional effects to fish predators. In addition, although the competitive effect of the mayflies on Glossosoma could not be manipulated in isolation, the density of Glossosoma in the presence of sculpin was greater than that in the absence of sculpin in the natural-Glossosoma treatment. Thus, the densities of these competing grazers either stayed the same or increased in the presence of the fish predator relative to predator-free treatments. A theoretical model, developed to explain the experimental results here, predicted that the densities of the two competing prey under predation pressure could be simultaneously greater than those under predator absent conditions when the behaviorally-mediated effects of the predator were strongly operative. Although we were unable to distinguish experimentally the two different effects of predator on the prey competition, the behaviorally- and density-mediated effects, the reality of the behaviorally-mediated effects in the experiment was discussed.","Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600019, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; Chitose Board Educ, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan","Miyasaka, H (corresponding author), Res Inst Human & Nat, Kamigyo Ku, 335 Takashima Cho, Kyoto 6020878, Japan.",,,,,,,44,15,15,0,23,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2003,101,3,,,,,511,520,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12001.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,680PH,WOS:000182986200008,,,,,2021-09-24,

We investigated lethal intraspecific and interspecific interference competition in Eretmocerus eremicus and Encarsia sophia, parasitoids of the whitefly pest, Bemisia tabaci. Our first experiments evaluated whether one or both species could suppress the progeny production of the other species through two mechanisms of lethal interference competition: (1) usurpation of hosts in cases of multiparasitism, and (2) host feeding on and killing parasitised hosts. We found that both species could suppress the progeny production of the other. E. eremicus' effect on E. sophia appeared to reflect multiparasitism. E. sophia's effect on E. eremicus appeared to reflect a combination of multiparasitism and host feeding on parasitised hosts. Second, we investigated the effects of lethal intraspecific interference on conspecific progeny production in both species. E. sophia interfered intraspecifically by host feeding on parasitised hosts. E. eremicus also apparently host fed on parasitised hosts, however the effect of host feeding on conspecific progeny production was slight. Third, host dissections and behavioral observations confirmed the mechanisms inferred from the progeny production experiments.

A behavioral experiment demonstrated that an individual of either species was less likely to feed on a recently grazed patch when the prior forager was T. aureotincta. Both snails responded only to the amount of food available on a patch, and, except at very low food levels, the likelihood that a snail would remain to feed was identical for the two species across microalgal densities. Where food was scarce, T. eiseni was more likely than T. aureotincta to feed in that patch. Density-dependent effects on microalgal standing stock differed between the snails; at low grazer densities, T. aureotincta depressed food levels to a comparatively greater degree, whereas at high grazer densities, T. eiseni had a relatively greater effect. The relative growth performance of the snails differed as a function of available food: T. aureotincta had superior body growth at high resource densities, while T. eiseni grew comparatively better at low microalgal densities. Differences in effects on and growth responses to microalgae arose from dissimilar foraging characteristics of the snails. Compared with T. eiseni, T. aureotincta moved more rapidly while feeding, harvested twice as great an area per unit time, but was unable to crop microalgae as close to rock surfaces. While T. eiseni grazed a smaller area per unit time, it removed relatively more microalgae per area grazed. These differing suites of foraging attributes may represent a trade-off to harvest food at different densities: cropping closer to the substratum (area intensive grazing) yields more food when microalgae are scarce, but precludes grazing a larger area per unit time (area extensive grazing) through fast movement, which provides a greater food intake when microalgae are abundant. If an area extensive (moves faster)-intensive (digs deeper) trade-off is a common feature of benthic grazer systems, knowledge of this aspect could provide great predictive insight into the patterns and causes of density dependence arising from exploitation.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, INST MARINE SCI,COASTAL RES CTR, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA","Schmitt, RJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,104,49,50,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1996,77,2,,,,,408,425,,10.2307/2265618,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TY198,WOS:A1996TY19800006,,,,,2021-09-24,

The results of 990 interspecific interactions among the 13 dominant species are presented in the form of a matrix, with significance of the interactions tested using the Chi-square contingency test. The hierarchical order followed the sequence ascidians > sponges > bryozoans > brown algae > barnacles > polychaetes > green algae. The main type of interaction observed during the study was overgrowth of one species by another (71.58 %), while standoffs accounted for the rest. The competitive dominance followed a hierarchical order with numerous back-loops. According to the Chi-square results, the colonial ascidian Diplosoma mitsukurii was ranked as the most dominant species.

Where competition interacts with anthropogenic habitat modification, this natural ecosystem process can become a threatening process. Understanding the mechanisms behind competition in such cases is essential for the formulation of cost-effective management responses for biodiversity conservation. According to the resource availability hypothesis of competition, interference competition limits access to resources by species vulnerable to such aggression and wastes energy in evasive responses. Studying competition is notoriously difficult, however, empirical evidence of the resource availability theory is limited, and there are few published experimental studies showing such an effect at larger scales. We present the results of a controlled and replicated empirical study of interference competition at a landscape scale. We removed an aggressive, overabundant native bird, Manorina melanocephala (noisy miner), whose interference competition is a threatening process for small woodland birds in the highly modified agricultural landscapes of eastern Australia. We monitored foraging and harassment rates of small woodland birds before and after removal to indicate if levels of interference competition changed. Due to unexpected immediate recolonisation, abundance of M. melanocephala in treatment sites declined by only 34% relative to control sites. Twenty-four bird species displayed aggressive behaviour towards other birds and 41 bird species were victims of aggression. Manorina melanocephala was responsible for 66% of all aggressive interactions. After removal, we recorded a doubling in foraging rate of small woodland birds in treatment compared to control sites. This appears to confirm the resource availability hypothesis of competition. Paradoxically, however, increased foraging was not accompanied by a decline in harassment. Low detection rates of harassment of small woodland birds, combined with the modest reduction in abundance of M. melanocephala, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between rates of harassment and rates of foraging.","[Beggs, Richard; Pierson, Jennifer; Tulloch, Ayesha I.

This study assessed the predator-prey relationship between two non-native crayfish species (Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus) and three native (Anodonta anatina, Potomida littoralis and Unio delphinus) and one non-native (Corbicula fluminea) freshwater bivalve species through experiments in laboratory and validation under natural conditions (Sabor River basin, Portugal). All native bivalve species were preyed both in laboratory and in the field: however, both crayfish species were unable to prey C. fluminea. Predation was dependent on crayfish and bivalve species but was not affected neither by crayfish nor bivalve sizes. In the laboratory, the most preyed species by both crayfishes was A. anatina. On average, this species was preyed at least 12% more than other species, when crayfishes had a choice. Similar results were found in the field. We also found signs of competition between both crayfishes, being P. clarkii more dominant and aggressive as this species, on average, manipulated the bivalves 63.6% more times and 24:33 min longer than P. leniusculus, and initiated 55.8% more agnostic bouts. Our results support the idea that P. clarkii and P. leniusculus can affect native freshwater bivalves, but clear interspecific differences were detected. Both crayfishes may have direct and indirect impacts on bivalve populations by increasing mortality or by reducing their fitness. In addition, since both crayfishes do not prey C. fluminea, they offer this IAS another advantage over native bivalves. Given the widespread distribution of both P. clarkii and P. leniusculus and the threatened status of many freshwater bivalves, the dynamics and impacts of this relationship should be taken in account in the implementation of management measures devoted to the conservation of native freshwater bivalves.

We present here an experiment that tests the way the same indirect cues of predation risk are interpreted by bank voles, Myodes glareolus, as the game changes through exposure to a caged weasel. Using optimal patch use, we asked wild-caught voles to rank the risk they perceived. We measured their response to olfactory cues in the form of weasel bedding, a sham control in the form of rabbit bedding, and an odor-free control. We repeated the interviews in a chronological order to test the change in response, i.e., the changes in the value of the information. We found that the voles did not differentiate strongly between treatments pre-exposure to the weasel. During the exposure, vole foraging activity was reduced in all treatments, but proportionally increased in the vicinity to the rabbit odor. Post-exposure, the voles focused their foraging in the control, while the value of exposure to the predator explained the majority of variation in response. Our data also suggested a sex bias in interpretation of the cues. Given how the foragers changed their interpretation of the same cues based on external information, we suggest that applying predator olfactory cues as a simulation of predation risk needs further testing. For instance, what are the possible effective compounds and how they change fear response over time. The major conclusion is that however effective olfactory cues may be, the presence of live predators overwhelmingly affects the information voles gained from these cues.Significance statementIn ecology, fear is the strategic response to cues of risk an animal senses in its environment. The cues suggesting the existence of a predator in the vicinity are weighed by an individual against the probability of encounter with the predator and the perceived lethality of an encounter with the predator. The best documented such response is variation in foraging tenacity as measured by a giving-up density. In this paper, we show that an olfactory predator cue and the smell of an interspecific competitor result in different responses based on experience with a live-caged predator. This work provides a cautionary example of the risk in making assumptions regarding olfactory cues devoid of environmental context.","[Bleicher, Sonny S.] George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.; Yloenen, Hannu; Kaepylae, Teemu; Haapakoski, Marko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.; Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",bleicherss@gmail.com,"Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo/AAE-6272-2020","Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901",Finnish Academy research grant [288990],"The experiment was financially supported by the Finnish Academy research grant 2015-2019 for HY, No. 288990, 11.5.2015.",,78,9,9,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

We conducted an experiment to examine the extent to which the nonconsumptive and overall effect of predatory water bugs on snail and tadpole traits (performance and morphology) depended on whether tadpoles and snails cooccurred. Tadpoles and snails differed in their relative susceptibility to intraspecific and interspecific competition, and predators affected both prey species via consumptive and nonconsumptive mechanisms. Furthermore, the overall effect of predators often depended on whether another prey species was present. The reasoning for why the overall effect of predators depended on whether prey species cooccurred, however, differed for each of the response variables. Predators affected snail body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the change in the overall effect of predators on snail body growth was attributable to how snails responded to competition in the absence of predators, rather than a change in how snails responded to the threat of predation. Predators did not affect tadpole body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater vulnerability of competitively superior prey (snails) to predators increased the strength of consumptive mechanisms (and hence the overall effect) through which predators affected tadpole growth. Predators affected tadpole morphology via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater propensity for predators to kill competitively superior prey (snails) enhanced the ability of tadpoles to alter their morphology in response to the threat of predation by creating an environment where tadpoles had a higher per capita supply of food available to invest in the development of morphological defenses. Our work indicates that the mechanisms through which predators affect prey depends on the other members of the community.","[Ruehl, Clifton B.; Vance-Chalcraft, Heather; Chalcraft, David R.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC USA","Ruehl, CB (corresponding author), Columbus State Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC USA.",ruehl_clifton@columbusstate.edu,,,Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0716558],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/ Award Number: 0716558",,64,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Significantly more tit pairs failed to raise young in nest boxes that House Sparrows were able to enter during their breeding period compared to those that were not able to do so, because House Sparrows usurped 77.8% of the Great Tit nests. Great Tits also increased the duration of nest defense in the presence of House Sparrows. As the outcome of interference competition may lead to breeding failure, birds should necessarily evolve ways to avoid nest competitors either by selecting nests that restrict access to their larger competitors and/or by initiating breeding earlier. Conservation efforts should be directed toward attaching a metal restrictor plate around the entrance of nest boxes to prevent woodpeckers from enlarging the entrance and larger species from entering nests.","[Goldshtein, Aya; Leshem, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Markman, Shai; Puchinsky, Maya] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, Fac Nat Sci, Oranim, Tivon, Israel; [Charter, Motti] Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, Katzrin, Israel","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, Katzrin, Israel.",chartermotti@gmail.com,"Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021","Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356",Tel Aviv University; Jewish National Fund; Smollar-Winnikov Scholarship Fund,"Special thanks to Jonathan Chazan who took an active part throughout the entire study; to Shaul Aviel, Kobi Meyrom, and Shai Halevi for their advice and technical assistance; to Ori Peleg, Avi Koplovich, Mary Weber, Shir Asher, and Nati Wein for field assistance; to Israel Goldshtein and Sergio Chazan for help in building the nest boxes; and to Naomi Paz for editorial assistance.

Interspecific competition, predation, increased disturbance, organochlorine poisoning and food shortages were suggested as main reasons for the overall decrease. Here we contribute to a better understanding of population declines by comparing foraging movements of satellite tracked adult gulls in three geographical areas of Finland (West, South, and East) that differ in their population trends. Our analysis examines potential differences and preferences in the feeding site behaviour of adult gulls. Our comparison of the three geographical areas showed that nLBBGs preferred feeding at fur farms in West Finland, waste dumps in South Finland, and lakes and fields in East Finland. We found individual gulls of this purportedly generalist species to be highly specialised in their foraging behaviour, particularly those that might be associated with their survival probabilities. We hypothesise that differences in foraging behaviour and food availability during the breeding season are partially responsible for differences in demographic trends between populations. Specifically, we identify potential local conservation problems such as shooting in birds visiting fur farms. Our data suggest that the effective conservation and management of endangered nLBBGs could be aided by simple actions in the breeding areas in addition to better protection throughout the annual movement cycle.

Predator diversity alterations have been observed in most ecosystems as a result of the loss and/or addition of species. This has implications for predator-prey dynamics as non-trophic interactions among predators, so-called multiple predator effects (MPE), are known to influence predation success. In addition, there is often a density-dependent relationship between prey availability and prey consumption (functional response). While MPE investigations are common in the literature, functional responses have rarely been incorporated into this field of predation ecology. 2. Here, we outline an experimental procedure that incorporates functional responses into multiple predator effect studies. Using three fish species with different functional traits as model predators (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, southern mouthbrooder Pseudocrenilabrus philander and banded tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii), we assess intra-and interspecific predator interaction outcomes on predator-prey dynamics. This was done by contrasting observed functional responses of heterospecific and conspecific combinations of predators with expected responses based on those of individual predators. 3. Multipredator combinations produced variable results. Bluegill were the only species in which observed conspecific multipredator functional responses matched those of expected based on individual performance (prey risk neutral effects). In contrast, prey risk reduction was observed for both mouthbrooder and tilapia conspecific multipredator trials. Heterospecific combinations revealed strong prey risk reduction effects for mouthbrooder-tilapia and bluegill-tilapia trials, while mouthbrooder-bluegill multipredator functional responses combined additively. These results are discussed within the context of behavioural traits of the species and the development of a trait-based predictive framework. 4. Using a functional response approach allowed for the assessment of multiple predator effects across a range of prey densities. We propose that the incorporation of within-guild predator combinations into classic functional response investigations will enhance predictive capacity development in competition and predation ecology.","[Wasserman, Ryan J.; Ellender, Bruce R.; Weyl, Olaf L.

Invasive crayfish alter invaded habitats causing community and population level impacts due to competition, predation and transmission of diseases. We experimentally evaluated the potential impacts of invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis) on native Piedmont crayfish (Cambarus sp. C) using size-matched pairs. We tested 1) species-specific aggressive behavior with aggression assays, and 2) survival in sympatry with survival analysis. Both invasive crayfish species tended to express higher levels of aggression compared to the native counterpart. However, we failed to detect any statistically significant differences. During survival experiments, the proportional survival of native Cambarus sp. C in sympatry with invasive O. virilis was significantly lower than that of invasive O. virilis. However, we did not find a significant difference in the proportional survival between invasive P. clarkii and native Cambarus sp. C. These experiments demonstrate inconsistent and limited negative impacts of two invasive crayfish species on a native species, when size-matched. Therefore, in order to make novel and effective decisions in managing these invasive species, it is critical to understand species-specific invasion dynamics and size-dependent potential impacts of invasive crayfish on native taxa.","[Hale, Patricia; Wilson, James; Henkanaththegedara, Sujan] Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA; [Loughman, Zachary] West Liberty Univ, Dept Nat Sci & Math, West Liberty, WV USA","Henkanaththegedara, S (corresponding author), Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",Henkanaththegedarasm@longwood.edu,,,Virginia Academy of Science Small Project Research Grant; Longwood University Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences; Longwood University Faculty Research Grant; Longwood University Perspectives on Research In Mathematics & Science (LU-PRISM) Summer Undergraduate Research Program,"We thank Bryan Ditursi and Jackson Wagstaff for helping with preliminary experiments which led to these experiments; Johnny Leder, Eric Salamon, Nicole Sadecky, Zachary Dillard and Samuel Hull for assistance in field sampling, setting up the experiments and crayfish care; Shawn Goodchild, Christoph Chucholl, Kit Magellan and two anonymous reviewers for reviewing an earlier draft of the manuscript; Virginia Academy of Science Small Project Research Grant, the Longwood University Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences, Longwood University Faculty Research Grant and Longwood University Perspectives on Research In Mathematics & Science (LU-PRISM) Summer Undergraduate Research Program for research funding.

As a consequence, interactions between species that occur in ecosystems are not taken into account. To investigate the effects of contaminants on interacting species dynamics, our study describes the functioning of a 2-L laboratory microcosm with two species, the duckweed Lemna minor and the microalgae Pseudo-kirchneriella subcapitata, exposed to cadmium contamination. We modelled the dynamics of both species and their interactions using a mechanistic model based on coupled ordinary differential equations. The main processes occurring in this two-species microcosm were thus formalised, including growth and settling of algae, growth of duckweeds, interspecific competition between the two species and cadmium effects. We estimated model parameters by Bayesian inference, using simultaneously all the data issued from multiple laboratory experiments specifically conducted for this study. Cadmium concentrations ranged between 0 and 50 mu g.L-1. For all parameters of our model, we obtained biologically realistic values and reasonable uncertainties. Only duckweed dynamics was affected by interspecific competition, while algal dynamics was not impaired. Growth rate of both species decreased with cadmium concentration, as well as competition intensity showing that the interspecific competition pressure on duckweed decreased with cadmium concentration. This innovative combination of mechanistic modelling and model guided experiments was successful to understand the algae-duckweed microcosm functioning without and with contaminant. This approach appears promising to include interactions between species when studying contaminant effects on ecosystem functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Because obligate mutualists are more reliant than facultative mutualists on the resources that their partners provide, they are expected to compete more strongly for those resources. Here, I examined interference competition in two goby fishes: Nes longus (an obligate mutualist) and Ctenogobius saepepallens (a facultative mutualist). Both gobies associate with the shrimp, Alpheus floridanus. Shrimp provide gobies with refuge from predators (a burrow in the sand), and gobies provide shrimp with a warning signal when predators are near. Using an aquarium experiment, I examined the behavior of a pair of gobies with access to a single shrimp burrow. I used four different goby pairings: large N. longus and small N. longus, large N. longus and small C. saepepallens, large C. saepepallens and small N. longus, and large C. saepepallens and small C. saepepallens. When paired with large N. longus individuals, small gobies of both species were less likely to occupy the single burrow than when paired with large C. saepepallens individuals. In addition, large N. longus individuals were less likely to co-occupy the single burrow with smaller gobies than were large C. saepepallens individuals. These results seem to indicate that large N. longus individuals exclude smaller gobies from burrows, while large C. saepepallens individuals do not. This study adds evidence to the supposition that obligate mutualists in general compete more strongly for mutualist partners than do facultative mutualists.","[Lyons, Patrick J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Lyons, PJ (corresponding author), CIEE Res Stn Bonaire, Kaya Gobernador N Debrot 26, Kralendijk, Bonaire, Netherlands.",patrick.lyons5@gmail.com,,,W.

Predator environments (i.e., isolated predators, conspecific pairs, and interspecific pair) were used to identify multiple predator effects on prey by comparing observed predation to that predicted from the multiplicative risk model. Behavioural data and per capita consumption rates provided insight into mechanisms underlying observed multiple predator effects on prey. Experiments were conducted at various spatial scales in the laboratory and field. In all experiments, dogwhelks reduced or ceased feeding when a green crab was present compared to isolated dogwhelks, although overall predation was not influenced. Independent multiple predator effects on prey, where observed and predicted consumption did not differ, were usually maintained because crabs and whelks forage on dissimilar time scales. Contrary to other studies, interference competition through aggressive encounters was not observed for dogwhelk and green crab conspecifics, or the interspecific pair, and non-independent multiple predator effects on prey in the form of risk reduction did not result. Spatial scale appeared to influence some outcomes of predator interactions. In large tanks, green crab conspecifics and the interspecific pair caused risk enhancement for prey. This resulted from increased search time, increased per capita consumption rate, and decreased handling time per prey of crabs, and was likely induced by longer residence time of water in the large tanks compared to smaller tanks. In small tanks, dogwhelks with a conspecific had higher per capita consumption rates than isolated dogwhelks, suggesting risk enhancement for prey. However, dogwhelks were unable to consume enough prey over the experiment to allow detection of a non-independent multiple predator effect on prey by comparing observed to predicted consumption. Predator species that operate on different time scales of predation may have independent multiple predator effects on prey even when changes to individual predator behaviours or per capita consumption rates occur. Examination of predator behaviours and per capita consumption rates, in addition to the full suite of predator environments, is essential to fully understand dynamics among multiple conspecific and interspecific predators, particularly when predator species forage on dissimilar time scales.

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that perch play a controlling role in small, oligotrophic, acidic, and poorly vegetated boreal lakes, affecting both invertebrate numbers and community structure. In addition, we predicted that perch impact lake usage by goldeneye. In the observational part of our study, we first explored the association between perch, invertebrates and goldeneye (pairs and broods per shore km) in 18 boreal, poorly vegetated lakes. Perch densities were associated negatively with invertebrate abundance and lake usage by goldeneye broods. In the experimental part in three fish-free lakes, we found that upon successful perch introductions, the number and biomass of invertebrates, the proportion of large dytiscids, and lake usage by goldeneye broods significantly decreased. We conclude that perch apparently plays a key role as a predator of invertebrates in boreal lakes with few aquatic macrophytes. It is evident that perch can strongly affect their prey populations and communities, and this predation may have an indirect effect on species, e.g. goldeneye, that consume the same prey.","[Nummi, Petri; Vaananen, Veli-Matti; Taskinen, Keijo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Rask, Martti] Evo Game & Fisheries Res, Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Evo 16970, Finland; [Nyberg, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Nummi, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petri.nummi@helsinki.fi,"Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021","Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633",,,,62,19,21,0,28,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1015-1621,,,AQUAT SCI,Aquat.

Larvae of the latter can prey on other maggots, including that of their own species as facultative food. This facultative characteristic of C. rufifacies may enhance its competitive advantage over other maggots and could also change the situation of other coexisting colonies. In this study, these two species were colonized in the laboratory, and the main objective was to try to understand the effect of competition on larval development. According to our results, intraspecific competition mostly occurred as competition for food; when the rearing density was increased, larvae pupated earlier, resulting in a lighter adult dry weight. The tendencies were similar in both species, but C megacephala developed smaller viable adults and had higher survivorship at high densities. Although C. rufifacies could use the food resource of cannibalism, its survivorship was still low. Our results also showed there were significant interactions between intraspecific competition and the density factor. However, with interspecific competition, the first-instar larvae of C. rufifacies invaded maggot masses of C. megacephala to feed together. The third instars of C. rufifacies were able to expel C. megacephala larvae from food by using a fleshy protrusion on their body surface; C. megacephala was usually forced to pupate earlier by shortening its larval stages. The results indicated that a temporary competitive advantage could only be obtained by C. rufifacies under a proper larval density. In addition, the effects on different larval stages, the responses to different competition intensities, and the temperature-dependent effects on interspecific competition are also discussed. In general, under mixed-species rearing at different temperatures and densities, larval duration, adult dry weight, and survivorship, of both species decreased. However, our results did not completely agree with previous studies, and we suspect that the difference was partially caused by different experimental designs and different biological characters of different blow fly colonies. Our results also suggest that both the predation ability and defense or escape activity should be taken into account when evaluating larval competitive advantages. The durations of larval stages of these two species could be decreased by approximate to 54 h when a single species was reared alone and food was limited; the largest reduction in larval duration, approximate to 25 h in C. megacephala and 34 h in C. rufifacies, caused by interspecific competition was under a high larval density. In conclusion, competition decreased the larval duration of these two species by up to 2 d; this also draws attention to justifying the postmortem interval estimation of using larval developmental data when larval competition exists.","[Shiao, Shiuh-Feng; Yeh, Ta-Chuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Shiao, SF (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",sfshiao@ntu.edu.tw,,"SHIAO, SHIUH-FENG/0000-0002-4213-0423",,,,33,36,37,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2585,1938-2928,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Faster growing, larger and/or more aggressive crayfish species are predicted to dominate permanent waterbodies. We tested this prediction using a 9 year dataset for two species of crayfish (Procambarus alleni and Procambarus fallax) co-existing in a sub-tropical flowing slough in southern Florida. Using a series of laboratory and mesocosm experiments we also compared life history traits and performance of the respective species to test mechanisms that could explain dominance shifts in the local crayfish assemblages. 2. Over the 9-year period, P. alleni densities were the greatest in shallower, shorter-hydroperiod areas bordering the slough, while P. fallax densities were higher in deeper, longer-hydroperiod central areas. These areas were separated by 0.8-2 km of continuous wetland with no apparent barriers to movement between them. 3. Density of P. fallax was not strongly affected by any measures of hydrological variation, while P. alleni density increased with more severe drought conditions. Following the strongest droughts, P. alleni colonized areas in the centre of the slough where they had been absent or scarce in wetter years. 4. We conducted experiments to compare growth rates, drought tolerance, and competitive dominance of these species. P. alleni survived drought conditions better, had higher growth rates, and was the dominant competitor for space and food. While drought probably limits P. fallax in the drier slough habitats, neither drought sensitivity nor interspecific competition with P. fallax can explain decreases of P. alleni with wetter conditions. 5. Our results indicate that a competition-colonization tradeoff cannot explain the crayfish compositional dynamics in this wetland because P. alleni is both the best competitor and the best at surviving in and colonizing areas with the strongest droughts. Future attention should focus on the potential for selective effects of predators that co-vary with hydrology. 6. The traits (large size, fast growth, competitive dominance) exhibited by P. alleni, which is absent in long-hydroperiod wetlands, are those exhibited by dominant crayfish in permanent lakes and streams containing fish. Although these traits make crayfish less vulnerable to fish in some lakes and streams, life-history models of community structure across permanence gradients suggest the opposite traits should be favoured for co-existence with fish.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Dorn, NJ (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA.",ndorn1@fau.edu,"Trexler, Joel C/I-5265-2012",,,,,37,40,42,0,43,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Facultative predation is a frequent behaviour in C. albiceps and C. rufifacies that occurs as an alternative food source during the larval stage. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of intraguild predation by C. albiceps on other fly species in order to analyse interspecific and intraspecific survival in C. albiceps, C. megacephala and C macellaria Fabricius. The experimental design of the study allowed us to evaluate how factors such as species, density and abundance of food influenced the survival of the calliphorid species. When C albiceps was confined with C megacephala or C macellaria, only adults of C albiceps survived at different larval densities and abundance of food. In addition, the survival of C albiceps was higher in two-species experiments when compared to single species experiments. The implications of these results for the dynamics of C albiceps were discussed.","Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Parasitol, Inst Biociencias, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Bioestatist, Inst Biociencias, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; Univ Estadual Campinas, Univ Zeferino Vaz, Inst Biol, Dept Parasitol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Rosa, GS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Parasitol, Inst Biociencias, Rubiao Jr, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",,"Carvalho, L.R./C-2973-2013; Godoy, Wesley AC/B-9787-2012","Carvalho, L.R./0000-0003-0575-2263; ",,,,32,18,20,0,8,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY BRASIL,"LONDRINA,","C POSTAL 481, 86001-970 LONDRINA,, PR, BRAZIL",1519-566X,,,NEOTROP ENTOMOL,Neotrop.

Two species of freshwater invertebrate predator, Notonecta maculata and N. obliqua, showed a negative association in a series of small, man-made ponds in the Peak National Park, Derbyshire, U.K. The present study examines the potential role of interspecific interactions among nymphs on this regional distribution pattern. 2. The survival, development and feeding efficiency of nymphs were examined in laboratory and field mesocosm experiments with intra- and interspecific competition and contrasting environmental complexity. 3. Survival to adulthood and mean lifespan varied significantly in interspecific competition treatments in both laboratory and field experiments, with N. maculata showing higher survival in the simple environment and N. obliqua higher survival in the complex environment. 4. Variations in feeding efficiency were consistent with the survival trends: N. maculata had a higher efficiency in the simple environment, whereas N. obliqua had greater efficiency in the complex environment. There was evidence of a developmental response in feeding efficiency, with differences between species increasing with age. 5. These results suggest that the relative competitive abilities of the two species are affected by habitat complexity, and that competition between species may modify the species distribution where they co-occur.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Briers, RA (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,"Briers, Robert/B-5810-2014","Briers, Robert/0000-0003-0341-1203",,,,29,8,9,1,9,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The Menge and Sutherland (MS) model of community regulation and its refinements were developed for hard-bottom habitats, but can be modified for soft-sediment systems. This 'consumer stress model' posits that mobile consumers feed ineffectively in harsh environments, and that the relative importance of physical disturbance, interspecific competition and predation varies predictably with the magnitude of recruitment, environmental conditions, productivity and trophic position. The MS model predicts that interspecific competition for a resource depends directly upon the level of recruitment, though it does not explicitly address the joint effects of recruitment and resource availability, which are important in soft-sediment communities. The model is here revised to incorporate hard-bottom and soft-sediment systems by changing the recruitment axis to a 'recruitment:resource ratio', whereby the effect of a given level of recruitment depends on resource availability. The potential utility of the revised model is illustrated in a hypothetical contrast of the effect of recruitment:resource ratios on community regulation for a mussel-dominated assemblage in hard-bottom habitats and an infaunal clam-dominated system in soft sediments.","Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","Seitz, RD (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Sch Marine Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",seitz@vims.edu,,,,,,110,10,10,1,4,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

Inducible defenses are flexible responses in which predator (or competitor)-released substances stimulate potential prey organisms to transform into predator-resistant phenotypes. Induced defenses may be highly protective. Benefits however are often balanced by fitness costs such as decreased growth rates or reduced reproductive potential. Here I discuss inducible defenses in ciliates with particular attention to the hypotrich genera: Aspidisca, Euplotes, Onychodromus, Sterkiella, and an undescribed hypotrich genus. I isolated Sterkiella sp. and the undescribed genus from vernal woodland pools on Saint Anselm College campus. Experimental evidence shows that a signal-induced defensive transformation occurs in these ciliates within hours after exposure to a predator cue and results in a significant decrease in susceptibility to predation. Deployment of ciliate antipredator structures such as spines, keels, ridges and other protuberances requires a large investment of cytoskeletal elements, primarily microtubules, and incurs an evolutionary cost in the form of significantly reduced growth rates. Onychodromus quadricornutus exhibits an extraordinary degree of phenotypic plasticity. In response to different environmental conditions individuals within a clone may express one of three general phenotypes: basic, lanceolate, or giant cells. The predacious giant phenotype releases a morphogenetically active signal substance, Onychodromus-factor, that triggers defensive phenotypic transformation in both intraspecific and interspecific prey. Enzyme degradation and ultrafiltration experiments indicate that Onychodromus-factor is a peptide with a molecular weight below 10,000 Da. Conspecifics develop hypertrophied dorsal spines when exposed to Onychodromus-factor. Sterkiella cells develop two defensive dorsal keels and transform to an enlarged ovoid cell in response to Onychodromus-factor as well as inducing signals released by Stylonychia, Urostyla, and Lembadion. Field studies of two vernal pools show that defensive phenotypic transformation in Sterkiella cells coincides with the appearance of Lembadion magnum during vernal pool succession. An undescribed hypotrich genus also expresses its defended phenotype when Lembadion is present in these pools. Aspidisca turrita (Ehrenberg, 1838) Claparede and Lachmann 1858, closely resembles Aspidisca lynceus (Muller, 1773) except for the possession of a dorsal thorn-like structure. Experimental evidence shows that the dorsal thorn is a defensive structure induced by signals released by the predacious ciliates Urostyla grandis and Lembadion magnum. Thus, A. turrita and A. lynceus are alternate phenotypes of the same species. I speculate that inducing signals function in predacious ciliates as lectin-like, carbohydrate-binding adhesion proteins during prey recognition and that prey species have evolved specialized cell surface receptors that allow detection of different predator proteins. I consider consequences for both predator and prey.",,"Wicklow, BJ (corresponding author), ST ANSELM COLL,DEPT BIOL,100 ST ANSELMS DR,MANCHESTER,NH 03102, USA.",,,,,,,65,33,34,0,20,SOC PROTOZOOLOGISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",1066-5234,,,J EUKARYOT MICROBIOL,J.

The spatial distributions of these beetles at the microhabitat scale were negatively correlated. We performed a removal experiment, progressively removing first 25% and then a further 25% of the population of the most abundant species, P. globosa, under the trees where most of the preferred food of both species is concentrated. There was no response of O. rugatipennis to this removal in the tree habitat. In the open, barely-vegetated habitat where most O. rugatipennis are found, the number of this species caught in pitfall traps increased following both removals and decreased following P. globosa replacement under the trees. It appears that intraspecific competition forces some P. globosa to occupy the open habitat. Interspecific competition between P. globosa and O. rugatipennis in the open habitat reduces the number of O. rugatipennis that can co-exist with P. globosa there. Removal of P. globosa under the trees allows conspecifics in the open habitat to move under the trees, releasing O. rugatipennis in the open habitat from competition. This then results in an increase in the numbers of O. rugatipennis in the open habitat as a result of immigration from neighbouring areas. We found that differences in foraging efficiency, measured as giving-up times in artificial food patches, create a likely mechanism of co-existence that explains the distinct preferences of these two species for tree and open habitats.","DESERT ECOL RES UNIT NAMIBIA,SWAKOPMUND 9000,NAMIBIA",,,"Seely, Mary Kathryn/AAI-1072-2019; Ward, David/E-9814-2010",,,,,64,14,14,0,14,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

These aspects were also investigated by releasing T. pyri, A. andersoni and Amblyseius aberrans (Oudemans) on some of the above varieties. Tn most of the experimental years (1989-1992), selective pesticides were used in order to allow a successful release of phytoseiids, in particular A. aberrans. The use of non-selective insecticides was re-established during 1993 in order to test its effect on the new mite communities originating from 1989 onwards. In the first years of the experiments an apparent relationship between grape variety and phytoseiid species was observed: in the control plots, A. andersoni occurred on Merlot where T. pyri was rare, while the latter species was largely dominant over A. andersoni on Trebbiano and Garganega. Panonychus ulmi populations reached moderate levels only on Merlot and in the first part of experiments. The variety-phytoseiid species relationship was temporary as, at the end of experiments, T. pyri was completely dominant on all varieties. This new situation started when prey occurrence and interspecific competition decreased in importance. The moderate success of the T. pyri release on Merlot contrasts with the results of previous experiments. Two factors could be involved in this phenomenon: low interspecific competition by phytoseiids and predation by macropredators. Amblyseius aberrans was able to displace A. andersoni and T. pyri on grape varieties where the two species were more abundant and reached higher population densities on varieties with pubescent leaf undersurfaces. In the first experimental year, spider mite densities were reduced more effectively in A. aberrans release plots than in the control or in T. pyri release plots. One year later, P. ulmi reached lower levels in the release treatments than in the control. Typhlodromus pyri and A. aberrans persisted in conditions of prey scarcity. The high competitivity of A. aberrans over the remaining two phytoseiid species constitutes a major factor in selecting predatory species for inoculative releases in vineyards.",,"Camporese, P (corresponding author), UNIV PADUA,INST AGR ENTOMOL,VIA GRADENIGO 6,I-35100 PADUA,ITALY.",,"duso, carlo/AAG-8435-2020","Duso, Carlo/0000-0002-2600-2536",,,,33,45,47,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

The experiments were conducted using oyster shell habitats constructed in the intertidal zone. First we tested whether crab losses from intertidal shell habitat constructed in the intertidal zone. First we tested whether crab losses from intertidal shell habitat were due to density-dependent emigration, density-dependent predation, or both. Our results show that although both processes account for crab losses, predation is not density-dependent, and most crabs had emigrated rather than being eaten at high crab density. Field experiments were also conducted to test the effect of crab density, food availability and conspecific physical contact on crab emigration. Treatments were different densities of free crabs to allow physical contact between them or individually caged crabs to prevent physical contact, with or without enhanced food (small clams). Emigration of crabs from experimental shell habitat increased with density of free crabs, irrespective of whether food was enhanced or risk of predation increased. Our results suggest that physical interactions regulate density because: (1) the per capita consumption rate of clams in the artificial shell plots was significantly lower at high crab density; and (2) density of enclosed crabs did not affect the immigration rate of conspecifics. Although the ultimate cause may be competition for food or avoidance of cannibalism, we suggest that when crab recruitment to epibenthic shell substratum has been successful, crab density over the short term is regulated primarily by space competition mediated by physical interactions.",,"IRIBARNE, O (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH FISHERIES,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.",,,,,,,43,38,38,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Crabs, lobsters and predatory fish (Tautoga onitis Linnaeus) were placed in large circular tanks, each containing three habitats: cobble, featureless sand, and sand with shelter boxes. Two treatments of shelter availability were used: one shelter for every two decapods (limited) or two shelters per decapod (excess). Three size-classes of crabs (encompassing 65-158 mm carapace width) were tested with lobsters 49-59 mm carapace length. When excess shelter was available, crabs and lobsters occupied shelters significantly more frequently than the other habitats. When shelter availability was limited, crabs were displaced to other areas. The alternative habitat selected by crabs and the way in which they used it depended on crab size. Most small and medium crabs chose cobble, while large crabs were found equally in cobble and sand. Small crabs burrowed more deeply than large crabs, and burrowed more deeply in sand than in cobble. Interspecific aggressive interactions increased in intensity with crab size. T. onitis readily kill and consume Jonah crabs in tanks with no substratum or shelter. Based on the literature and my qualitative observations, I predicted that smaller crabs would be more vulnerable to predation than large crabs. However in my habitat choice experiments, crab mortality due to predation was low and was not related to crab size or habitat type. I hypothesize that size-dependent patterns of crab habitat use and behavior compensated for the greater vulnerability of smaller crabs.","UNIV RHODE ISL,DEPT ZOOL,KINGSTON,RI 02881",,,,,,,,32,42,44,0,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

In Little Chucky Creek, a tributary to the Nolichucky River in Tennessee, the severe population decline of Chucky Madtoms Noturus crypticus has been partially attributed to an increase in the abundance of cavity-dwelling crayfish after the establishment of two nonnative species. Although it has been suggested that the crayfish exclude the cavity-dwelling fish from shelter, we are not aware of studies that have been conducted to demonstrate that crayfish directly outcompete madtoms in this regard. Our objective was to experimentally test the hypothesis that shelter competition between crayfish and Mountain Madtoms Noturus eleutherus, a surrogate species for Chucky Madtoms, is a function of relative size. We conducted behavioral trials in which shelter was the limited resource for the two potential competitors. We recorded the madtoms' success at occupying the provided cover object for 5 d as well as health condition at the end of the competition phase. Both madtom occupancy and health condition were positively correlated with increasing relative size. As the size differential increased between madtoms and crayfish, madtoms were more successful at occupying the cover object, and overall condition was greater at the end of the trial. Conversely, when madtoms were smaller than crayfish, individuals were more commonly excluded from the cover object or even killed. Juvenile madtoms experienced 100% mortality. We concluded that crayfish exhibit a size-specific competitive advantage over Mountain Madtoms when shelter is limited, and that crayfishes may catalyze fish population declines at least partially through shelter exclusion and predation on juveniles.","[Harris, Meredith H.] Tennessee Aquarium Conservat Inst, 175 Baylor Sch Rd, Chattanooga, TN 37405 USA; [Womble, Kristin, I] Tennessee Technol Univ, Tennessee Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Box 5114, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Alford, J.

Throughout Caribbean reefs, fairy basslets Gramma loreto and blackcap basslets G. melacara are segregated by depth with a narrow zone of overlap. Local populations of these planktivores are found under isolated reef ledges, where fairy basslets compete with conspecifics for access to prime feeding positions at the outer edges. I investigated the existence, mechanisms, and effects of interspecific competition on the local distribution and demography of basslets. I documented aggression and feeding rates of both species and conducted a reciprocal removal experiment comparing the re sponse of each basslet in competitor-removal versus unmanipulated populations of both species. Positioning of both basslets under ledges was consistent with an overall size hierarchy, with larger fish progressively closer to the outer edges of ledges. Fairy basslets were more aggressive, yet competition had symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species. Interference between species drove juveniles further back under ledges, where feeding and growth rates of individuals were reduced. Competition had no effect on the density of basslets during this 8 wk experiment. Aggression occurred between larger basslets, but with no consequential effects on any parameters measured. This study demonstrates sym metrical effects of interspecific competition on juvenile coral-reef fishes, a phenomenon that has rarely been documented previously.","[Kindinger, Tye L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",kindingt@science.oregonstate.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-08-51162, OCE-12-33027]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This study was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants to M.

It has been suggested that C. septempunctata negatively impacted C. novemnotata through a combination of mechanisms. We investigated the effects of scramble competition and intraguild predation between groups of C. septempunctata and C. novemnotata. A novel aspect of these experiments for this species combination was that we provided beetles the option to cannibalize conspecifics or predate on heterospecifics (i.e. intraguild predation); thus, we were able to compare interspecific versus intraspecific competition. Increasing prey density resulted in significantly lower rates of intraguild predation on C. novemnotata by C. septempunctata. Percentage survival of C. novemnotata grouped with C. septempunctata at low and high aphid densities was 6 and 61%, respectively. For our second study, we increased the spatial complexity and volume of the assay system, and provided prey ad libitum. C. novemnotata survival from first-instar to adult was significantly lower than C. septempunctata survival when grouped heterospecifically (43 vs 61% survival, respectively). Finally, we conducted a study to determine if hungry larvae discriminate conspecific versus heterospecific larvae by testing whether they predated selectively on the basis of species, which they did not appear to do. We conclude that C. novemnotata larvae suffer greater rates of intraguild predation from C. septempunctata compared with cannibalism, that this difference appears to be due to size asymmetry between the two species, and that local conditions impact the severity of intraguild predation by C. septempunctata.","[Tumminello, Giuseppe; Ugine, Todd A.; Losey, John E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Tumminello, G (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",gt95@cornell.edu,,,Informal Science Education Program of the National Science Foundation [DRL-0741738],"We would like to thank the Lost Ladybug Project for helping us to collect lady beetles to start our colonies.

This is particularly the case in urban habitats where the disturbed environment can alter natural behavior from that in undisturbed habitats. The rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), is an increasingly common invasive species, predominantly associated with large urban centers. Using an experimental approach, we tested the behavioral responses of native garden birds in response to the presence of a rose-ringed parakeet versus the presence of a similarly sized and dominant native bird, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). Parakeet presence significantly reduced feeding rates and increased vigilance among native birds compared with our control treatments. Of visits made by native birds in the presence of a parakeet, feeding was more likely to occur in sites within the parakeet range compared with sites outside, suggesting some habituation of native birds has occurred following prior exposure to parakeets but overall foraging behavior is still disrupted. The results of our study suggest that nonnative species can have complex and subtle impacts on native fauna and show that a nonnative competitor can impact native species simply through their presence near resources.","[Peck, Hannah L.; Marshall, Harry H.; Owens, Ian P.

Previous studies revealed that A. macrophthalmus is able to host-shift to several mimosoid species. Here, we aim to test the host-shift potential to other mimosoid and non-mimosoid plants and possible roles of interspecific competition, genetic background, and plant chemistry in host-shift. First, we found that A. macrophthalmus predator completed development on two new hosts: pigeon pea Cajanus cajan and Cajanus scarabaeoides (Faboideae), by rearing from seeds collected in South/Southeast Asia and Hawaii. In contrast, in most regions, both Cajanus species were infested only by other beetle species. Second, we performed no-choice tests using 11 leguminous plants, covering all three subfamilies as potential hosts, including the two new hosts. A Taiwanese A. macrophthalmus population reared in the laboratory on Leucaena did not deposit eggs on any of the seeds of each tested species. To compare host-shift responses between populations, we also used a Hawaiian A. macrophthalmus population that had completed its development on freshly collected Leucaena seeds from the field. This population deposited eggs onto and hatching larvae burrowed into C. cajan seeds, although none developed beyond the larval stage. Third, the surface chemical composition of seed-pods of L. leucocephala and the two Cajanus species was dissimilar, although that of seeds was highly similar. Finally, all of the host-shifting A. macrophthalmus populations shared the same haplotypic group.","[Tuda, M.] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Inst Biol Control, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wu, L. -H.; Wu, W. -J.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Yamada, N.; Kagoshima, K.] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wang, C. -P.] Council Agr, Taiwan Forestry Res Inst, Silviculture Div, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Buranapanichpan, S.] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Chen, Z. -Q.] Yunnan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Teramoto, K.

We have studied the seasonal expression of these two interaction types within a two-species, boreal small mammal system. Seasons differ by resource availability, individual breeding state and intraspecific social system. Live-trapping methods were used to monitor space use and reproduction in 14 experimental populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in large outdoor enclosures with and without a dominant competitor, the field vole Microtus agrestis. We further compared vole behaviour using staged dyadic encounters in neutral arenas in both seasons. Survival of the non-breeding overwintering bank voles was not affected by competition. In the spring, the numbers of male bank voles, but not of females, were reduced significantly in the competition populations. Bank vole home ranges expanded with vole density in the presence of competitors, indicating food limitation. A comparison of behaviour between seasons based on an analysis of similarity revealed an avoidance of costly aggression against opponents, independent of species. Interactions were more aggressive during the summer than during the winter, and heterospecific encounters were more aggressive than conspecific encounters. Based on these results, we suggest that interaction types and their respective mechanisms are not either-or categories and may change over the seasons. During the winter, energy constraints and thermoregulatory needs decrease direct aggression, but food constraints increase indirect resource competition. Direct interference appears in the summer, probably triggered by each individual's reproductive and hormonal state and the defence of offspring against conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Both interaction forms overlap in the spring, possibly contributing to spring declines in the numbers of subordinate species.","[Eccard, Jana A.] Univ Potsdam, Unit Anim Ecol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Fey, Karen] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Caspers, Barbara A.] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Behav Biol, Res Grp Mol Ecol & Behav, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Ylonen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Konnevesi Res Stn, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Unit Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",eccard@uni-potsdam.de,"Caspers, Barbara/C-5573-2011","Caspers, Barbara/0000-0002-4380-0476",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank the staff of the Konnevesi Research Station for maintaining the facilities and caring for animals, as well as researchers and field helpers.

The larval stages of both species encyst within the tissue of the bivalve's muscular foot, with a preference for the tip of the foot. As more individuals accumulate at that site, they impair the burrowing behaviour of cockles and increase the probability of the parasites' transmission to a bird definitive host. However, individuals at the foot tip are also vulnerable to non-host predators in the form of foot-cropping fish which selectively bite off the foot tip of exposed cockles. Parasites encysted at the foot base are safe from such predators although they do not contribute to altering host behaviour, but nevertheless benefit from host manipulation as all parasites within the cockle are transmitted if it is ingested by a bird. Experimental infection revealed that Acanthoparyphium sp. and C. australis have different encystment patterns within the host, with proportionally fewer Acanthoparyphium metacercariae encysting at the foot tip than C attstralis. This indicates that Acanthoparyphium may benefit indirectly from C. australis and incur a lower risk of non-host predation. However, in co-infections, not only did C australis have higher infectivity than Acanthoparyphium, it also severely affected the latter's infection success. The asymmetrical strategies and interactions between the two species suggest that the advantages obtained from exploiting the host manipulation efforts of another parasite might be offset by traits such as reduced competitiveness in co-infections.

Theoretically, invasive species could have negligible or even positive effects if they sufficiently reduce the intensity of processes regulating native populations. Understanding such mechanisms is crucial to predicting ultimate ecological impacts. We used a mesocosm experiment to quantify the impact of eggs and larvae of the introduced cane toad (Bufo marinus) on fitness-related traits (number, size and time of emergence of metamorphs) of a native Australian frog species (Opisthodon ornatus). The results depended upon the timing of oviposition of the two taxa, and hence the life-history stages that came into contact. Growth and survival of O. ornatus tadpoles were enhanced when they preceded B. marinus tadpoles into ponds, and reduced when they followed B. marinus tadpoles into ponds, relative to when tadpoles of both species were added to ponds simultaneously. The dominant tadpole-tadpole interaction is competition, and the results are consistent with competitive priority effects. However, these priority effects were reduced or reversed when O. ornatus tadpoles encountered B. marinus eggs. Predation on toxic toad eggs reduced the survival of O. ornatus and B. marinus. The consequent reduction in tadpole densities allowed the remaining O. ornatus tadpoles to grow more rapidly and to metamorphose at larger body sizes (> 60% disparity in mean mass). Thus, exposure to B. marinus eggs reduced the number of O. ornatus metamorphs, but increased their body sizes. If the increased size at metamorphosis more than compensates for the reduced survival, the effective reproductive output of native anurans may be increased rather than decreased by the invasive toad. Minor interspecific differences in the seasonal timing of oviposition thus have the potential to massively alter the impact of invasive cane toads on native anurans.","[Crossland, Michael R.; Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Alford, Ross A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Shine, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rics@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Alford, Ross A/H-1577-2011; Crossland, Michael R/G-1091-2012","Alford, Ross A/0000-0002-3010-6768; Crossland, Michael R/0000-0001-9967-7158",CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and the Australian Research Council,"We thank Kay Bradfield for assistance with experimental work, the members of TeamBufo for encouragement and discussion, and the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and the Australian Research Council for financial support.

Social learning is usually studied as an intraspecific phenomenon (but see [5-7]). However, other species with some overlap in ecology can be more than merely potential competitors: prior settlement and longer residence can render them preferable sources of information [8]. Socially induced acquisition of choices or preferences capitalizes upon the knowledge of presumably better-informed individuals [9] and should be adaptive under many natural circumstances [10, 11]. Here we show with a field experiment that females of two migrant flycatcher species can acquire a novel, arbitrary preference of competing resident tits for a symbol attached to the nest sites. The experiment demonstrates that such blind acquisition of heterospecific traits can occur in the wild. Even though genetic variation for habitat preferences exists in many taxa [12] and overlap between bird species likely induces costs [13], this result shows that interspecific social learning can cause increased overlap in nest-site preferences. Conventional, negative species interactions push ecological niches of species apart, but the use of competing species as a source of information counters that force and may lead to convergence.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Anim Ecol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Seppanen, JT (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",janseppa@jyu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-5132-6268; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X",,,,39,81,81,1,59,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0960-9822,1879-0445,,CURR BIOL,Curr.

Using a response surface design and a press manipulation of densities, we tested effects of competition within and between two species of coral reef fishes (Coryphopterus glaucofraneum and Gnatholepis thompsoni). By tracking individually tagged fishes, we showed that the per-capita effect of intraspecific competitors on individual growth was at least twice as great as the effect of interspecific competitors. Growth rate was better predicted by measures of density that incorporated body size, rather than numerical density, suggesting interference competition. Individuals of both species interacted aggressively with conspecifics at least twice as often as with heterospecifics. Individuals of both species also covered more area while foraging and spent less time in shelter when crowded than when at lower densities. In combination, these behaviours suggest that increased metabolic costs at high density contribute to competitive effects on growth. These competitive interactions occurred among adult fishes, so reduced growth may translate to reduced fecundity as well as reduced survival, and so contribute to population regulation.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93103 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Forrester, GE (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",gforrester@uri.edu,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",,,,40,48,48,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,632,640,,10.1007/s00442-006-0397-0,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,056OG,WOS:000238533400010,16518631,,,,2021-09-24,

Typhlodromips montdorensis is a candidate for introduction into the UK as a glasshouse biological control agent. The ability of T. montdorensis to feed on the widely used N. californicus was investigated to identify possible intraguild predation, which might influence the effectiveness of either or both species as predators of Tetranychus urticae. Both N. californicus and T. pyri consumed larval stages of each other, but in choice experiments both showed a preference for T. urticae. Both N. californicus and T. montdorensis also fed on each other, but whereas N. californicus again showed a preference for T. urticae, T. montdorensis fed equally on T. urticae and N. californicus. Interactions between N. californicus and T. pyri and N. californicus and T. montdorensis are discussed in relation to their effectiveness as biological control agents in the glasshouse and the natural control of spider mite in the field.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; Cent Sci Lab, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England","Hatherly, IS (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",i.s.hatherly@bham.ac.uk,"Walters, Keith/AAK-3562-2020",,,,,49,26,28,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

We tested the hypothesis that Gerbillus henleyi (de Winton 1903), the smallest species (10 g) of a pssamophilic guild in Israel, is scarce on relatively productive dunes of the Israeli desert, due to negative interactions from the common G. allenbyi (Thomas 1918) and G. pyramidum (Geoffroy 1825). 2. The alternative hypothesis was that scarcity on sand resulted from the size of its naked hind feet, that do not allow efficient locomotion on sand. 3. Despite their naked soles the weight-bearing surface of G. henleyi feet carry less mass/area than those of any other species. 4. We measured interaction coefficients with the two common species using field-manipulation experiments in two enclosures. 5. Habitat usage of G. henleyi changed from significantly preferring the stabilized sand, when alone, to significantly using the semistabilized dune, when G. allenbyi was also present. 6. We also estimated the interaction coefficients and calculated the G. henleyi's isoclines competing with the two common gerbil species using a technique we developed elsewhere. 7. The stability analysis of the isoclines of G. henleyi competing with either G. allenbyi or with G. pyramidum suggests that stable coexistence occurs when G. henleyi is relatively scarce while the competitors are common. 8. Interspecific competition from either G. allenbyi or G. pyramidum accounts for 90.3% reduction in G. henleyi density, relative to when it is alone. 9. We concluded that the negative interactions from congeners was the major cause for the scarcity of G. henleyi on the relatively rich sand dunes of the Israeli desert.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zvika@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012","Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,31,7,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Competition between two species in a metapopulation involves each inhibiting the other's ability firstly to colonize an already occupied area and then to persist in it. Models for regional competition of this kind have 3-D dynamics, from which it has proved difficult to extract useful predictions except for special conditions. We introduce a 2-D general model for species that are equally vigorous at inhibiting the ability of others to remain in an occupied patch as to arrive there. The model covers the full spectrum of competitive interactions, from weak to strong and symmetrical to asymmetrical. Its Lotka-Volterra dynamics extend the general theory of competitive coexistence by generating clear predictions for community structure, amenable to cross-system comparisons and experimental manipulations. 2. Previous 2-D models of interactions between dominant and fugitive species are special cases of the 2-D general model. Moderately asymmetrical competition has two outcomes distinctly different from dominant-fugitive interactions, at both the scale of metapopulation and population: (i) slow growing and weak competitors coexist with faster growing superior competitors, albeit at reduced densities; and (b) habitat removal always yields relative gains in abundance for species with higher growth capacity, but the gains are absolute only for species subjected to competitive impacts that exceed within-species impacts. Extinctions of slow growing and weak competitors provide the most sensitive indication of habitat degradation, and their losses also have the least effect on community structure. 3. The 2-D general model further predicts that highly productive communities will tolerate differences between species in their capacity for population growth, whereas less productive communities will tolerate stronger competitive interactions between species. This prediction applies equally to a population of resource consumers as to a metapopulation of colonists. The model explicitly links local and regional population dynamics to r-K selection in community structure by predicting a prevalence of growth-orientated species in resource-poor habitats and competition-orientated species in resource-rich habitats.","Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Dept Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Doncaster, CP (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Bassett Crescent E, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England.",cpd@soton.ac.uk,"Doncaster, C.

Shared enemies can also mediate non-reciprocal (-,0) indirect effects, i.e. indirect amensalism. whenever one prey species is not affected by the presence of alternative prey. We review 34 studies on terrestrial and freshwater systems to evaluate the extent to which apparent competition has been perceived as a reciprocal (-. -) or non-reciprocal (-,0) interaction. We found only three studies showing reciprocal effects between apparent competitors. Indirect amensalism was documented in 10 studies and could be inferred For 16 other cases (76% in total). The remaining five studies provided insufficient data to determine the form of indirect interaction. The apparent prevalence of non-reciprocal enemy-mediated interactions resembles that observed for resource-based interspecific competition. Amensal indirect effects via shared predation may result from differences in population size, nutritional value, susceptibility to attack, or asynchronous dynamics of alternative prey, or the predator's Feeding preferences. Moreover, experimental protocols may confound the actual form of apparent competition through short-term observations, incomplete designs, or biased consideration of conspicuous interactions, leading to reciprocal effects being overlooked. We conclude that. at present. it is still difficult to determine the relative role of apparent competition vs indirect amensalism in natural food webs because most published studies have failed to document in full interactions via shared enemies.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Chaneton, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Ecol, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,"Bonsall, Michael/0000-0003-0250-0423",,,,78,186,190,0,69,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2000,88,2,,,,,380,394,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880217.x,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,287QV,WOS:000085518000017,,,,,2021-09-24,

In both vineyards native phytoseiids were present: Amblyseius andersoni in one vineyard, and Phytoseius finitimus in the other. The economically important predators Kampimodromus aberrans and Typhlodromus pyri were released in both vineyards in order to study their efficacy in controlling tetranychids and eriophyids and their persistence during periods of prey scarcity. In both vineyards, relative abundances of the mite species, especially phytoseiids, were found to differ on different varieties in the same vineyard. In the first experiment, A. andersoni reached higher densities and was more persistent on the variety with slightly pubescent leaf under-surface (Merlot). Typhlodromus pyri and K. aberrans releases were successful and the mites became more abundant on the variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Verduzzo). In the second experiment, P. finitimus was more abundant on a variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Prosecco) than with glabrous leaf under-surface (Riesling). The most interesting results of the present study concerned the interactions between native and released predators. In the first vineyard, different results were obtained when releasing T. pyri on the two varieties. On the variety with pubescent leaves, A. andersoni was rapidly displaced by T. pyri, whereas the former species persisted on the other variety throughout the three-year study, apparently becoming dominant during the last season. In contrast to T. pyri, interactions between K. aberrans and A. andersoni in this vineyard did not depend on variety. The results of the experiments carried out in the second vineyard stressed the importance of interspecific competition for phytoseiid releases. Typhlodromus pyri colonization failed on both varieties. Kampimodromus aberrans releases appeared to be more successful on Riesling than on Prosecco, where P. finitimus was more abundant. At the end of the experiments, K. aberrans displaced P. finitimus on both varieties.","Univ Padua, Inst Agr Entomol, I-35020 Padua, Italy","Duso, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Inst Agr Entomol, Via Romea 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy.",,"duso, carlo/AAG-8435-2020","Duso, Carlo/0000-0002-2600-2536",,,,31,82,85,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Yearly population estimates of the green oak leaf roller moth, Tortrix viridana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and the winter moth, Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), were taken from the pedunculate oak, Quercus robur, from 1951 to 1966 in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, U.K. Larval mortality from parasitoids was recorded for both species over the same period. 2. Operophtera brumata population density fluctuated around a constant mean, whereas I viridana population density exhibited a linear decline over the sampling period. Population counts were subjected to time-series analysis after the linear decline was removed from the T. viridana data by detrending. Multiple regression models were built so that variation in the per capita rate of increase of each population could be partitioned among (a) current and previous population density, (b) current and previous population density of the second moth species, and (c) rates of larval parasitism. 3. Multiple regression analysis suggested that variation in the per capita rate of increase of O. brumata could be explained by negative feedback from O. brumata density at T-2 (32%), a negative relationship with I viridana density at T-l (18%), and a positive relationship with parasitism suffered by I viridana at T-l (24%). 4. The I viridana population time-series was dominated by a rapid feedback process such that per capita rate of increase at time T was negatively related to population density at time T-l, explaining 53% of variance in population growth rate. Per capita rate of increase was unrelated to larval parasitism or densities of O. brumata. 5. In light of previous life-table and experimental studies on O. brumata and I viridana, the current analyses suggest that pupal predation (data not presented) and interspecific competition are significant determinants of O. brumata population growth rates in Wytham Woods. In contrast, T. viridana population growth rates appear to be dominated by rapid negative feedback consistent with intraspecific competition.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Hunter, MD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",mhunter@sparc.ecology.uga.edu,,,,,,28,14,16,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

In St. Joseph Bay, FL, USA, pen shells [Atrina rigida (Sol.)] are preyed on by horse conchs [Pleuroploca gigantea (Kiener)]. The shells of dead Atrina are subsequently used as shelters and/or nest sites by a suite of benthic species, including crabs, octopi, and fish. By influencing the rate of new shelter availability, horse conchs may indirectly affect the distribution or reproduction of shell-occupant species. Feeding observations and an exclosure experiment indicate that Atrina are the primary prey of large horse conchs. The abundance of occupant species is strongly correlated to Atrina shell abundance, suggesting that shelter availability may influence population distributions. Experimental additions of new shelters mimicking freshly-killed pen shells caused an increase in the abundance of occupant species. Among these species, the blennies Hypsoblennius hentzi (Leseuer) and Chasmodes saburrae J. & G. and the clingfish Gobiesox strumosus Cope showed an increase in both abundance and frequency of egg-guarding, suggesting an important indirect effect of horse conchs on the distribution and reproductive output of these fish. Because the addition of new shells affected blennies and clingfish more strongly than other occupant species, community composition is influenced by shelter availability. In habitats where biogenic structures are prominent, such as mollusc shells in soft-sediment marine communities, this type of nontrophic indirect effect may be an important component of population and community regulation.",,"KUHLMANN, ML (corresponding author), FLORIDA STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI B142,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32306, USA.",,,,,,,47,13,13,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Many models have been proposed to explain the evolution of this suite of traits. In this paper I describe the first experimental test of the assumption that forms the foundation of all these models: that begging behaviour bears a direct cost. Miniature two-way radios hidden inside artificial nests were used to measure changes in predation rates with changes in begging. This showed that begging was costly for birds that nest on the ground, but there was no cost for those that nest in trees. Further, the cost of begging for ground-nesters was an increasing function of begging rate. For ground nests, these data suggest that nest predation could act both as a check on the evolutionary exaggeration of begging traits, and as a mechanism to enforce the honesty of begging signals. The marked variation in the predation cost of begging in different nesting sites suggests that this cost may form a good framework for investigations of the interspecific diversity of begging calls.",,"HASKELL, D (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT, CORSON HALL, ITHACA, NY 14850 USA.",,,"Haskell, David G./0000-0003-1580-9438",,,,16,197,202,1,46,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

By allowing coevolution both within and between trophic levels the model breaks the traditional dichotomy between coevolution among competitors and coevolution between a prey and its predator. By allowing the diversity of prey and predator species to emerge as a property of the evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), the model breaks another constraint of most approaches to coevolution that consider as fixed the number of coevolving species. The number of species comprising the ESS is influenced by a parameter that determines the predator's niche breadth. Depending upon the parameter's value the ESS may contain: 1) one prey and one predator species, 2) two prey and one predator, 3) two prey and two predators, 4) three prey and two predators, 5) three prey and three predators, etc. Evolutionarily, these different ESSs all emerge from the same model. Ecologically, however, these ESSs result in very different patterns of community organization. In some communities the predator species are ecologically keystone in that their removal results in extinctions among the prey species. In others, the removal of a predator species has no significant impact on the prey community. These varied ecological roles for the predator species contrasts sharply with the essential evolutionary role of the predators in promoting prey species diversity. The ghost of predation past in which a predator's insignificant ecological role obscures its essential evolutionary role may be a frequent property of communities of predator and prey.","UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT AEROSP & MECH ENGN,TUCSON,AZ 85721","BROWN, JS (corresponding author), UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,BOX 4348,CHICAGO,IL 60680, USA.",,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012",,,,,50,140,146,1,53,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,OCT,1992,46,5,,,,,1269,1283,,10.2307/2409936,,,15,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,JV371,WOS:A1992JV37100002,28569003,Bronze,,,2021-09-24,

The model overcomes the unrealistic theoretical basis and over-simplified intraspecific and interspecific competition processes of classical Lotka-Volterra competition equations and has more complex competition behaviors such as non-linear intraspecific and interspecific functional responses of competition. Under two specific conditions, which are that available resources (nutrients or foods) are in extremely short supply or are readily available, the new interspecific model reduces to classical Lotka-Volterra competition equations and Malthus equations without intraspecific interspecific competitions, respectively. Although the new model has the same qualitative behaviors with Lotka-Volterra competition equations, by the index of competition capacity of population proposed in this paper, to some extent the new model gives the outcomes of interspecific competition a better explanation of nutrition kinetics which conforms to the basic principles of biology or ecology. The data fittings of Gause's protozoan interspecific competition experiment with Paramecium caudatum and Stylonychia mytilus demonstrate that the new competition model fits the experimental data well; on the contrary, the Lotka-Volterra competition equations fit the data badly.",,"SUN, GW (corresponding author), ACAD SINICA, INST APPL ECOL, 72 WENHUA RD, SHENYANG 110015, PEOPLES R CHINA.",,,,,,,33,4,4,1,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

This is surprising not because competition is rare but because for a biogeographic pattern caused by species interactions to be detectable, it must be strong enough to override the many physical and historical differences that exist among real islands. Moreover, the direct pairwise links between species, once embedded in the complicated network of species interactions in entire communities, may become diluted and confused by the indirect interactions of still other species, particularly predators. Nevertheless, if competition is strong and if communities are simple (as they are on many species-poor islands), competition leaves its fingerprint on the ecological and evolutionary trajectories taken by island lizards.",,"CASE, TJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,DEPT BIOL C016,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.",,,,,,,46,46,47,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0169-5347,,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

Individual risk tolerance, or boldness, was measured as the time to resume movement after a simulated predation strike. Fish that resumed movement faster were categorized as bold, fish that took more time to resume movement were categorized as shy and those that fell in between these two categories were determined to have intermediate boldness. Competitive impacts of boldness in N. melanostomus were determined in a laboratory foraging experiment in which interspecific (juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua Linnaeus 1758) and intraspecific (intermediate N. melanostomus) individuals were exposed to either bold or shy N. melanostomus competitors. G. morhua consumed fewer prey when competing with bold N. melanostomus than when competing with shy N. melanostomus, whereas intermediately bold N. melanostomus foraging was not affected by competitor boldness. Bold and shy N. melanostomus consumed similar amounts of prey, and the number of interactions between paired fish did not vary depending on the personality of N. melanostomus individuals. Therefore, intraspecific foraging competition was not found to be personality dependent. This study provides evidence that individual differences in boldness can mediate competitive interactions in N. melanostomus; nonetheless, results also show that competition is also governed by other mechanisms that require further study.","[Ericsson, Philip; Persson, Anders; von Friesen, Lisa W.; Nilsson, P.

This species was first found in Pequenos Libombos Reservoir in Maputo Province, Southern Mozambique in the late 2009 and is linked to reduction in tilapia fisheries. This study, conducted in 2015 under controlled conditions, aimed to assess the interspecific relationships between the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) and the alien crayfish. For both species, no significant differences in growth and survival rates were found between animals reared in the presence versus the absence of heterospecifics, indicating no direct deleterious interspecific effects. Behavioural observations revealed that fish and crayfish competed for shelter and food. Both species reduced the foraging in the presence of heterospecifics during feeding period, in the daytime. Crayfish seemed to have an advantage in competition for shelter, suggesting that they may interfere with tilapia sheltering activity and make tilapia vulnerable to predators in natural habitats.","[Chivambo, S.] Golder Associados Mocamb Ltd, Millennium Pk Bldg,Vladimir Lenine Ave 174, Maputo 174, Mozambique; [Mussagy, A.] Eduardo Mondlane Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Main Campus 3453,POB 257, Maputo 3453, Mozambique; [Barki, A.] Agr Res Org, Inst Anim Sci, Dept Poultry & Aquaculture, Volcani Ctr, 68 HaMaccab Rd,POB 15159, IL-7505101 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel","Chivambo, S (corresponding author), Golder Associados Mocamb Ltd, Millennium Pk Bldg,Vladimir Lenine Ave 174, Maputo 174, Mozambique.",simpliciochivambo@gmail.com,,,Eduardo Mondlane University; Golder Associates Africa,"The authors acknowledge the grant provided to SC by Eduardo Mondlane University and the funding provided by Golder Associates Africa, which enabled SC to run the experiment.

Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the structural complexity of habitats, leading to homogenization. High abundances of common, generalist species in disturbed habitats may be driven by reduced competition from specialists in similar habitats. We quantified habitat availability for and utilization of three co-occurring arboreal geckos (Australian native house geckos [Gehyra dubia], northern velvet geckos [Oedura castelnaui] and eastern spiny-tailed geckos [Strophurus williamsi]) in four replicated grazing regimes in an experimental grazing trial in north-east Queensland, Australia. Native house geckos were most abundant in heavily grazed habitats, whereas the two other species rarely co-occurred (either with each other or with native house geckos). Geckos displayed resource partitioning of habitat features, such as tree species and structural characteristics. We found evidence of interspecific competition among gecko species, in which native house geckos shifted their habitat selection in the presence of velvet geckos. In the absence of other geckos, native house geckos preferred rough, peeling bark and dead trees, yet in the presence of velvet geckos, native house geckos shifted away from dead trees, and used more structurally complex trees, probably due to high niche overlap with velvet geckos. Native house geckos were more resistant to the negative effects of livestock grazing than either velvet or spiny-tailed geckos. In the absence of other species, native house geckos used a wider range of microhabitats. Synthesis and applications. Species assemblages are often the results of multiple or complex factors, including predation pressure, habitat availability or competitive interactions. The homogenizing effects on habitat structure caused by livestock grazing reduce diversity and suitability for microhabitat specialists. Reduced competition can therefore promote the abundance of microhabitat generalist species, such as Australian native house geckos, suggesting that livestock grazing leads to homogenization and simplification of habitat structure, which ultimately leads to changes in species composition through reduced competition. Understanding species' responses to disturbance, and more broadly, habitat complexity, is crucial for maintaining or increasing biological diversity in anthropogenically modified landscapes.","[Nordberg, Eric J.; Schwarzkopf, Lin] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Nordberg, EJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",ericjnordberg@gmail.com,"Schwarzkopf, Lin/C-1242-2012","Schwarzkopf, Lin/0000-0002-1009-670X; Nordberg, Eric/0000-0002-1333-622X",Meat and Livestock AustraliaMeat and Livestock Australia [B.ERM.0088],"Meat and Livestock Australia, Grant/Award Number: B.ERM.0088",,74,11,11,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

There is a shortage of studies investigating how different size classes of a single species interact with one another to generate multiple predator effects. Here, we used a comprehensive experimental design, consisting of calculation of per capita consumption rates, to examine multiple predator effects on prey when swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) of multiple sizes foraged on manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) using a video recording analysis system in the laboratory. We identified multiple predator effects on prey by comparing observed predation rate to that predicted from the multiple risk model. The observed predation rate of crab was significantly lower than predicted value when a conspecific competitor appeared. Swimming crab significantly decreased foraging time budgets when a conspecific competitor appeared. The proportion of time medium-sized crabs spent searching for and handling clam decreased in the presence of competitors. The encounter rate between crabs and clam decreased while the probability of capture upon encounter and the probability of consumption upon capture increased when a conspecific competitor appeared. The handling time per clam significantly decreased when a conspecific competitor appeared. Most encounters between crabs were fighting (2.31-4.14 times/h), secondly chasing (1.02-3.07 times/h), and threatening (1.24-2.09 times/h), and the fewest encounters were non-aggression (0.13-0.49 times/h). The results indicated that swimming crab foraging behavior was affected by the chasing, threatening and fighting behavior of a conspecific competitor and this affected the predation rate on prey, which led to non-independent multiple predator effects in the swimming crab-Manila clam system.","[Sun, Yunfei; Wang, Fang; Liu, Dapeng; Wang, Xin; Su, Xianpeng] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yunfei; Wang, Fang; Liu, Dapeng; Wang, Xin; Su, Xianpeng] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Prod Proc, Funct Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food, 1 Wenhai Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Chao] Ocean Univ China, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, F (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mariculture, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wangfang249@ouc.edu.cn,,,Project of National Basic Research Priorities Program of China [2015FY110600]; Project of Shandong Key Research & Development Plan [2016ZDJS11A06],"We thank Heinrich Dircksen and Nick West for providing language help and writing assistance.

In the Florida Keys (USA), anecdotal observations have long pointed to an inverse relationship in abundance of two large decapod crustaceans found co-occurring in hard-bottom habitat, the stone crab Menippe mercenaria and the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. We used them to explicitly test whether competition for a renewable resource (shelter) can drive the abundance and distribution of the inferior competitor. We first explored this relationship in shelter competition mesocosm experiments to determine the competitively dominant species. Results showed that stone crabs are clearly the dominant competitors regardless of the number of lobsters present, the presence of co-sheltering species such as the spider crab, Damithrax spinosissimus, or the order of introduction of competitors into the mesocosm. We also found that lobsters use chemical cues from stone crabs to detect and avoid them. We then tested the ramifications of this competitive dominance in the field by manipulating stone crab abundance and then tracking the abundance and distribution of spiny lobsters through time. Increased stone crab abundance immediately resulted in decreased lobster abundance and increased aggregation. The opposite occurred on sites where stone crabs were removed. When we stopped removing stone crabs from these sites, they soon returned and lobster abundance decreased. This study explicitly demonstrated that interspecific competition can drive population dynamics between these species, and ultimately, community composition in these shallow water habitats.","[Behringer, Donald C.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Behringer, Donald C.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Behringer, Donald C.; Hart, John E.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Behringer, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",behringer@ufl.edu,,,University of Florida School of Natural Resources and EnvironmentUniversity of Florida; NOAA Florida Sea Grant College Program [R/LR-B-65]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0928398],"We thank D.

The large size is genetically determined, as ascertained by clutch exchange experiments between island and mainland nests. We conclude that the increased size of P. ater in places where it is geographically isolated from its larger congeners is the result of evolutionary adaptation, due ultimately to relaxed interspecific competition. On the islands, P. ater has evolved into a medium-sized generalist, with selection pressures likely governed by the following causal relationships. When competitors are lacking, P. ater takes over the foraging space of the absentees. The enlarged food base allows higher population densities, which intensifies intraspecific interference competition. This, in turn, selects for increased body size. When P. ater coexists with its larger congeners, it occupies peripheral foraging sites in trees, which requires excellent manoeuvrability and energy-expensive locomotion modes. Reduction of body size increases locomotor capacity for mechanical and aerodynamic reasons and lowers energy consumption, so small size is favoured in sympatry. But in geographic isolation, P. ater exploits the tree periphery less and the inner tree regions more, and it also adopts the easier locomotion modes of the absent species. Therefore, selection for manoeuvrability and a small body size is relaxed. The new selection regime shifts the balance between opposing selection forces towards a larger body size. We were able to test 11 alternative hypotheses and available evidence conclusively eliminates them all. As a result, here, evolution could be predicted regarding both direction and amount of change.","[Norberg, R. Ake; Norberg, Ulla M.

Few studies have assessed the importance of biological interactions in structuring these communities. In the present study, benthic diatom community structure in relation to manipulated food webs was assessed using in situ mesocosms, whereby predator-free environments and environments comprising two different fish species were assessed. Zooplankton abundance, settled algal biomass and the diatom community were monitored over a 12-day period across each of the three trophic scenarios. Differences among treatments over time were observed in zooplankton abundances, particularly copepods. Similarly, the benthic diatom community structure changed significantly over time across the three trophic treatments. However, no differences in total algal biomass were found among treatments. This was likely the result of non-diatom phytoplankton contributions. We propose that the benthic diatom community structure within the mesocosms was influenced by trophic cascades and potentially through direct consumption by the fish. The study highlights that not only are organisms at the base of the food web affected by predators at the top of the food web, but that predator identity is potentially an important consideration for predator-prey interaction outcomes with consequences for multiple trophic levels.","[Wasserman, R.

We investigated this hypothesis in Allenby's gerbils, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi, by comparing foraging behaviors of single vs. pairs of gerbils. We recorded strong interference competition within the foraging pairs. Competition reduced the amount of time the gerbils spent foraging, as well as foraging efficiency since part of the foragers' attention was directed toward detecting competitors (apparent predation risk). Single gerbils harvested significantly more food than the combined efforts of two gerbils foraging together. Competition reduced the success of both individuals within a pair by more than 50%, making this a case of the tragedy of the commons where each individual's investment in competition reduces the success of all individuals within the group, including its own. Despite their great costs, competitive behaviors will be selected for as long as one individual achieves higher fitness than the other. In nature, interspecific interactions, such as predation risk, may act to reduce and regulate the deleterious effects of intraspecific competition.","[Berger-Tal, Oded; Embar, Keren; Kotler, Burt P.; Saltz, David] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Berger-Tal, O (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",oded.berger.tal@gmail.com,"Saltz, David/AAC-7054-2019; Berger-Tal, Oded/P-9189-2014; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Berger-Tal, Oded/P-1670-2019","Saltz, David/0000-0002-7437-0472; Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X; Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X",Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities; ISFIsrael Science Foundation [1397/10],"We wish to dedicate this paper to Dr. Keren Embar, forever bright and cheerful, who passed away doing what she loved-science.

However, it is not clear if the nonindigenous clam is the one directly responsible for these predominance patterns. Within this context, the main goal of the present study was to analyze the competitive interaction between the nonindigenous Manila clam and the native carpet shell clam to determine whether this interaction could impact directly growth and mortality of the native clam populations. The effect of exposure to predators on both species was also examined. For this purpose, between May 2010 and May 2011 a field experiment was conducted on an intertidal area in the Bay of Santander (N Spain) where both species coexist without an extreme predominance of the introduced species. Relative density of clam species was manipulated in a randomized block experimental design. The results obtained show that (i) the increased density of Manila clam simulating species expansion scenario does not affect growth or mortality of the native clam; and (ii) for densities of Manila clam substantially higher than observed in the field, predation plays an essential role in regulating both species populations, limiting their density increase. Moreover, Manila clam appears to be more negatively impacted by predation compared to the native clam. Overall, our results indicate that predation has a more significant effect on both populations when compared to competitive interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Great Tits occupied nest boxes regardless of the number of House Sparrows breeding in the vicinity. During the second part of the breeding season, the percentage of successful Great Tit pairs was negatively correlated with the occupation of nest boxes by the House Sparrows, in both the large- and small-entrance nest boxes. More Great Tit pairs bred and more young were fledged in the small- than large-entrance nest boxes. Great Tits occupied more large-entrance nest boxes during the first than the second part of the breeding season. This difference was probably due to House Sparrows occupying more large-entrance nest boxes during the second than first part of the breeding season. 74 % of the large-entrance nest boxes in which Great Tits built nests in both the first and second parts of the season were later occupied by House Sparrows. Great Tits preferred large-entrance nest boxes in the fall, when House Sparrows use only a few boxes for roosting, but not for breeding. The findings indicate that Great Tits are subject to interspecific competition with House Sparrows for nesting cavities, the intensity of which varies during the breeding season and is higher during the second part when more House Sparrows breed.","[Charter, Motti; Leshem, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Charter, Motti] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",charterm@post.tau.ac.il,"Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021; Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356; Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",,,,41,9,10,1,44,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Interspecific larval competition studies have shown Ae. albopictus to be a superior competitor over many species. A laboratory experiment was conducted in artificial containers to evaluate the effects of malathion on larval interactions between Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus. The survivorship of Ae. albopictus increased with increasing Ae. atropalpus densities in control but decreased with increasing Ae. atropalpus densities in the presence of malathion. Alternatively, Ae. atropalpus survivorship did not differ between control and malathion treatments. Developmental times were not affected by interspecific competition in both treatments for either species. These results show that malathion could facilitate coexistence between Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus. This demonstrates how sublethal concentrations of malathion (and perhaps other pesticides with similar modes of action) can enable an inferior competitor to coexist in the same habitat with a superior competitor. This is the first report of synergistic survival of a weaker mosquito competitor in the presence of a pesticide due to condition-specific competition.","[Kesavaraju, Banugopan; Brey, Christopher W.; Farajollahi, Ary; Evans, Heather L.; Gaugler, Randy] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Vector Biol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Brey, Christopher W.] Marywood Univ, Dept Sci, Scranton, PA 18505 USA; [Farajollahi, Ary] Mercer Cty Mosquito Control, W Trenton, NJ 08628 USA","Kesavaraju, B (corresponding author), Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District, 2020 N Redwood Rd, Salt Lake City, UT 84116 USA.",banu@slcmad.org,"Gaugler, Randy/K-3898-2013",,New Jersey Agriculture Experiment Station [D-08-08193-03-11],"Many thanks to Linda McCuiston for supplying Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus eggs and Kavitha Damal and Richard Marin for technical assistance.

In Moorea, French Polynesia, we conducted a factorial field experiment to quantify the independent and combined effects of priority effects and habitat complexity on the strength of intraspecific competitive interactions among recently settled individuals of a coral reef fish (Thalassoma quinquevittatum: Labridae). Simultaneous arrival of focal individuals with competitors resulted in a 2.89-fold increase in survival relative to reefs where focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors (i.e., a priority effect). Increasing habitat complexity resulted in a 1.55-fold increase in survivorship when focal individuals arrived simultaneously with or before competitors. However, increasing habitat complexity did not affect the survivorship of focal individuals arriving 5 days later than competitors. Behavior observations showed that survivorship was negatively correlated with aggression. Aggression by prior residents towards focal individuals was significantly greater when focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors than when they arrived simultaneously. Increasing habitat complexity did not reduce aggression. Our results suggest that, when competitors arrive simultaneously, competitive interactions are weak and subordinates are not displaced from complex habitat; increasing habitat complexity increases survival by disrupting predation. Conversely, when competitors arrive at different times, aggression intensifies and increasing habitat complexity does not disrupt predation because competitive subordinates are excluded from habitat resources. This study demonstrates that the strength of competition can be context-dependent and may vary with the timing of competitive interactions and habitat complexity.","[Geange, Shane Wallace] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",shane.geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272; Stier, Adrian/0000-0002-4704-4145","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; VUW; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology; New Zealand Post Graduate Study Abroad Award; Three Seas Fellowship; French American Cultural Exchange Grant; National Geographic International Ecostations Fellowships","C.

When an individual's persistence in a community depends upon the strength of competitive interactions, changes in the timing of arrival relative to the arrival of a competitor can modify competitive strength and, ultimately, establishment in the community. We investigated whether the strength of intracohort competitive interactions between recent settlers of the reef fishes Thalassoma hardwicke and T. quinquevittatum are dependent on the sequence and temporal separation of their arrival into communities. To achieve this, we manipulated the sequence and timing of arrival of each species onto experimental patch reefs by simulating settlement pulses and monitoring survival and aggressive interactions. Both species survived best in the absence of competitors, but when competitors were present, they did best when they arrived at the same time. Survival declined as each species entered the community progressively later than its competitor and as aggression by its competitor increased. Intraspecific effects of resident T. hardwicke were similar to interspecific effects. This study shows that the strength of competition depends not only on the identity of competitors, but also on the sequence and timing of their interactions, suggesting that when examining interaction strengths, it is important to identify temporal variability in the direction and magnitude of their effects. Furthermore, our findings provide empirical evidence for the importance of competitive lotteries in the maintenance of species diversity in demographically open marine systems.","[Geange, Shane W.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",Shane.Geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Stier, Adrian/0000-0002-4704-4145; Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology","Craig Osenberg, Jeff Shima, Jada-Simone White, Ben Bolker, Todd Palmer, and two anonymous reviewers provided many helpful comments on versions of this manuscript.

In particular, competition with older and larger conspecifics and heterospecifics may influence the number and characteristics of individuals successfully making the transition. We investigated whether the availability of enemy-free space mediated the interaction between adult goldspot gobies (Gnatholepis thompsoni), a common tropical reef fish, and juvenile conspecifics that had recently settled from the plankton. We added rocks, which provide refuge from predators, to one-half of each of five entire coral reefs in the Bahamas and measured the survival and growth of recent settlers in relation to adult goby densities. We also evaluated whether mortality was selective with respect to three larval traits (age at settlement, size at settlement, and presettlement growth rate) and measured the influence of refuge availability and adult goby density on selection intensity. Selective mortality was measured by comparing larval traits of newly settled gobies (<= 5 d postsettlement) with those of survivors (2-3 week postsettlement juveniles). We detected a negative relationship between juvenile survival and adult goby density in both low- and high-refuge habitats, though experimental refuge addition reduced the intensity of this density dependence. Juvenile growth also declined with increasing adult goby density, but this effect was similar in both low- and high-refuge habitats. Refuge availability had no consistent effect on selective mortality, but adult goby density was significantly related to the intensity of size-selective mortality: bigger juveniles were favored where adults were abundant, and smaller juveniles were favored where adults were rare. Given the typically large difference in sizes of juveniles and adults, similar stage-structured interactions may be common but underappreciated in many marine species.","[Samhouri, Jameal F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Steele, Mark A.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Forrester, Graham E.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Samhouri, JF (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",jameal.samhouri@noaa.gov,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X; Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0222087]; American Museum of Natural History; American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists; International Women's Fishing Association; Sigma Xi; UC Regents; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; NOAA-NURPNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [CMRC-05-PRRV-01-05A, CMRC-01-NRME-010-3C, CMRC-03-NRME-01-04A, CMRC-03-NRME-01-05C]","Many thanks to those who helped us with field work, including R.

The outcome of interspecific competition for food resources depends both on the competitors' sensory abilities and on environmental conditions. In laboratory experiments we tested the influence of daylight and darkness on feeding behaviour and specific growth rate (SGR) of two species with different sensory abilities. 2. We used perch (Perca fluviatilis) as a visually orientated, and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) as a mechano-sensory oriented predator and tested their growth rates and behaviour under conditions of interspecific and intraspecific competition. Three different foraging conditions were used: food supplied (i) only during the day, (ii) only during the night or (iii) during both day and night. 3. In perch neither SGR nor feeding behaviour were influenced substantially by interspecific competition during daylight. During darkness their foraging behaviour changed markedly and their access to the food source as well as their SGR were negatively affected by the presence of ruffe. 4. Ruffe's foraging behaviour did not change during either day or night with interspecific competition. During the night ruffe's SGR was higher with interspecific competition, probably because of a release from intraspecific competition and the competitive inferiority of perch during the night. 5. Because of its seonsory abilities ruffe feeds predominantly at night, thereby reducing competitive interference from perch.","Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Schleuter, D (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",diana.schleuter@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,32,42,43,0,15,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Graham & Lambin (2002) have reported on a weasel-reduction experiment, concluding that the impact of weasel predation on field vole survival was neither sufficient nor necessary to initiate and drive the cyclic decline of field vole populations in Kielder Forest, northern England. They also stated that their findings contradict conclusively the specialist predator hypothesis put forward to explain population cycles of voles in North Europe. 2. Straightforward inferences from Kielder Forest to the northern boreal zone are misleading, because the population cycles of voles in Kielder Forest differ essentially from North European vole cycles. The low amplitude of the vole cycles in Kielder Forest, their restricted spatial synchrony in comparison to northern Europe and the virtual lack of interspecific synchrony in Kielder Forest suggest that there are essential differences between the mechanisms responsible for the two types of cyclic fluctuations of voles. 3. The weasel-reduction experiment may provide a misleading picture on the role of predators, even in the Kielder Forest cycle. The experimental reduction of weasels alone may not stop the population decline of voles, because competing larger predators are expected to increase their hunting in the weasel-reduction areas. The small spatial scale of the experiment, which produced only slight, short-term differences in weasel densities between reduction and control areas, also suggests that other predators could have compensated easily for the weasels that were removed. 4. We propose a new version of the predation hypothesis to explain low-amplitude population cycles of voles in temperate Europe, including the Kielder Forest. The interaction between generalist predators and vole populations might account for these cycles because generalists can have a functional response that is destabilizing in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium point. As most generalists are orders of magnitude larger than weasels, and thus need much more food for survival, generalist-driven cycles should be characterized by high prey minima, as observed in Kielder Forest.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia","Korpimaki, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",ekorpi@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X; Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495",,,,89,63,64,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Field samples revealed that shells of the gastropod Cerithium atratum were the main resource used by both hermit crab species and that Pagurus used eroded or damaged shells in higher frequency than Clibanarius. The exploitative ability of each species was compared between species in the laboratory using dead gastropod (Cerithium) baits to simulate predation events and signalize newly available shells to hermit crabs. Pagurus reached the baits more rapidly than Clibanarius, but this higher exploitative ability did not explain shell utilization patterns in nature. Another experiment evaluated the dominance hierarchy between these two hermit crab species and revealed that Clibanarius was able to outcompete Pagurus for higher quality shells in agonistic encounters. This higher interference competitive ability of Clibanarius in relation to Pagurus may explain field observations. Nevertheless, Pagurus may be responsible to enhance shell availability to other hermit crab species that have lower ability to find and use newly available shells. Differently, the poorer condition of shells used by Pagurus, the higher ability of this species to attend gastropod predation events and its higher consumption rate by shell-breaking crabs (Menippe nodifrons) may increase its predation risks, thus revealing the disadvantages of such an exploitative competitive strategy for hermit crabs.

However, pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are numerous and have an alternating-year pattern of abundance that provides a natural experimental control to test for interspecific competition in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Since a number of studies have recently examined pink salmon interactions with other salmon, we reviewed them in an effort to describe patterns of interaction over broad regions of the ocean. Research consistently indicated that pink salmon significantly altered prey abundance of other salmon species (e.g., zooplankton, squid), leading to altered diet, reduced total prey consumption and growth, delayed maturation, and reduced survival, depending on species and locale. Reduced survival was observed in chum salmon (O. keta) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) originating from Puget Sound and in Bristol Bay sockeye salmon (O. nerka). Growth of pink salmon was not measurably affected by other salmon species, but their growth was sometimes inversely related to their own abundance. In all marine studies, pink salmon affected other species through exploitation of prey resources rather than interference. Interspecific competition was observed in nearshore and offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, and one study documented competition between species originating from different continents. Climate change had variable effects on competition. In the North Pacific Ocean, competition was observed before and after the ocean regime shift in 1977 that significantly altered abundances of many marine species, whereas a study in the Pacific Northwest reported a shift from predation- to competition-based mortality in response to the 1982/1983 El Nino. Key traits of pink salmon that influenced competition with other salmonids included great abundance, high consumption rates and rapid growth, degree of diet overlap or consumption of lower trophic level prey, and early migration timing into the ocean. The consistent pattern of findings from multiple regions of the ocean provides evidence that interspecific competition can significantly influence salmon population dynamics and that pink salmon may be the dominant competitor among salmon in marine waters.","Nat Resources Consultants Inc, Seattle, WA 98119 USA; US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Biol Sci Off, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA","Ruggerone, GT (corresponding author), Nat Resources Consultants Inc, Seattle, WA 98119 USA.",GRuggerone@nrccorp.com; jennifer_niel-sen@usgs.gov,,,,,,83,77,83,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,1573-5184,,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

(Diptera: Culicidae) may affect the resulting adult densities and, hence, the risk of malaria. We investigated the impact of the presence of a fourth-instar larva (An. gambiae Giles s.s. or An. arabiensis Patton), the quantity of food, and the available space on the survival and development of freshly hatched larvae of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis. To analyse the results, two proportional hazard models were constructed. The first estimated the effects of all covariates on mortality rate and the second estimated the effects of the covariates on development rate into the third larval instar (L3). A time-dependent covariate for density, which changed during the experiment as a result of death or development to L3, was included in both models. In the presence of a fourth-instar larva (L4), survival of the experimental larvae was significantly reduced, but no difference was detected between the presence of L4 An. gambiae and L4 An. arabiensis. The observation that the majority of dead larvae were not recovered in trays with an L4 present suggested that cannibalism and predation occurred readily. Limitation in space significantly increased mortality of larvae, whereas a limitation of food reduced larval development rate, but did not cause mortality per se. From this, we concluded that both cannibalism and predation were enhanced as a result of more frequent interactions within smaller environments, but did not occur for reasons of food shortage. This study shows that inter- and intraspecific interactions among larvae of the An. gambiae complex strongly affect survival and development, and that the quantity of food and the available space are important determinants of the outcome of these interactions. Implications of the results are discussed with respect to the population dynamics of both malaria vectors in the field.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands","Koenraadt, CJM (corresponding author), AFRIMS Entomol Lab, 2 Soi 15,Rachdamnoen Rd 1, Kamphaeng Phet 62000, Thailand.",cjmkoenraadt@ucdavis.edu,,"Koenraadt, Constantianus/0000-0001-7861-8781; Hemerik, Lia/0000-0002-6892-2840",,,,47,39,40,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

The species is sometimes seen in primary rainforest, although at a curiously low density compared with that of other monkey species. We conducted a 24-month field study in the tropical rainforest of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast, and found that putty-nosed monkeys require an ecological niche almost identical to that of the Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana. Moreover, the niche breadth of putty-nosed monkeys was significantly decreased in the presence of Diana monkeys, suggesting that feeding competition with Diana monkeys kept putty-nosed monkeys from successfully colonizing a rainforest habitat. However, contrary to the interspecies competition hypothesis, groups of both species almost completely overlapped in home ranges and formed near-permanent mixed-species associations, rather than avoiding each other. We hypothesized that Diana monkeys tolerated immigrating putty-nosed monkeys and formed mixed-species groups with them, despite high levels of competition, because of their merit in predation defense. Direct observations and a series of field experiments confirmed that male putty-nosed monkeys play a vital role in defense against crowned eagles, suggesting that putty-nosed monkeys obtain access to feeding trees by offering antipredation benefits to Diana monkeys. We discuss these findings in light of biological market theory.","Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire; Univ Leipzig, Fak Biowissensch Pharm & Psychol, Abt Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews KY16 9JP, Fife, Scotland","Zuberbuhler, K (corresponding author), Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, BP 1303, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire.",kz3@st-and.ac.uk,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X",,,,44,72,78,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The balance of predation between closely related invasive and native species can be an important determinant of the success or failure of biological invasions. In Irish freshwaters, the introduced amphipod Gammarus pulex has replaced the native G. duebeni celticus, possibly through differential mutual intraguild predation (IGP). Theoretically, parasitism could mediate such predation and hence the invasion outcome. However, this idea remains poorly studied. 2. In a field survey, we show that the acanthocephalan parasite Echinorynchus truttae is present in more G. pulex populations than G. d. celticus populations. In addition, within parasitised populations, E. truttae is more prevalent in the invader than in the native. 3. We show for the first time that an acanthocephalan parasite mediates predation between its intermediate macroinvertebrate hosts. In a field experiment, E. truttae parasitism of the invader lowered IGP upon the unparasitised native. In laboratory experiments, parasitism of G. pulex significantly reduced their predatory impact on recently moulted female G. d. celticus. Parasitism also appeared to cause reduction in predatory behaviour, such as attacks per contact on precopula guarded female natives. 4. We conclude that higher parasite prevalence in invaders as compared with natives, by mediation of interspecific interactions, could promote species coexistence, or at least slow species replacements, in this particular biological invasion.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","MacNeil, C (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Ctr Med Biol, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",,"Briffa, Mark/M-9041-2013","Briffa, Mark/0000-0003-2520-0538; Dunn, Alison/0000-0002-4855-1077",,,,55,35,36,1,27,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Larvae and adult ladybirds were individually put into petri dishes at 25 degreesC with 20 eggs of the selected target species. The tests included three treatments: (a) only coccinellid eggs, (b) coccinellid eggs and 5 aphids, and (c) coccinellid eggs and 40 aphids. Intra-guild predation (IGP) by H. axyridis of eggs of the native species, A. bipunctata, was lower in comparison with egg cannibalism (CANN) by H. axyridis, for both adults and larvae. No differences were detected for larvae at the density of 5 aphids. IGP of exotic against the native species was never higher than CANN of native species. IGP of native species was never higher in comparison with CANN. A. bipunctata adult CANN was significantly higher than IGP at densities of 0 and 40 aphids. In the set of experiments on CANN and IGP an inverse correlation was observed between egg consumption by adults and larvae and aphid density. Our bioassays indicate that H. axyridis does not demonstrate IGP vs. native species at a higher level than CANN of native species. It appears that H. axyridis does show a high potential for CANN and therefore seems unlikely this species will to have a negative impact on native species by IGP of eggs.

Behavioural-scale measurements on a guild of five species of freshwater pond snails (Mollusca: Pulmonata) indicate a trade-off between the ability to utilize a patch's resource and the ability to quickly find new resource patches. Community-level experiments demonstrate that both species richness and composition are affected by the patchiness of the environment. In particular, treatments with low patchiness are dominated by species best at exploiting local resources (diggers) whereas treatments with high patchiness are dominated by species best at finding new patches (grazers). Results from a controlled mesocosm experiment with two of the most common of these species, Helisoma trivolvis (a relative digger) and Physella gyrina (Physidae) (a relative grazer) show that the patchiness of the environment strongly influences the outcomes of interspecific competition among these two species: the digger performed much better in less patchy habitats, whereas the grazer performed better in more patchy habitats. A two-species model of diggers and grazers modified to incorporate behavioural aspects of patchiness produces this same pattern of competitive outcomes.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Amsterdam, Populat Biol Sect, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Chase, JM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jchase@pitt.edu,,"Richards, Shane/0000-0002-9638-5827",,,,40,46,47,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

In this set of field experiments, we evaluated the interactive, dynamic effects of limited food supply and predation from wolf spiders (Lycosidae) on mortality in Ageneotettix deorum, a common grasshopper (Acrididae) from North American sandhills grasslands. We attempted to determine whether the combined effects of food availability and spider predation on mortality were (1) noncompensatory, with the effects of each factor summing to determine ultimate population size, or (2) compensatory, where the effect of one mortality factor alters the impact of subsequent factors so that the ultimate population size changes little, despite variation in specific sources of mortality. We also investigated whether changes in nutritional quality encountered by grasshoppers would result in different dynamic responses to predation in the context of noncompensatory vs. compensatory responses. Both food availability and predation risk contributed to mortality rates. Individuals of A. deorum were food limited. Survival of grasshoppers feeding on fertilized plants was 50% higher than that of grasshoppers feeding on unfertilized plants over a 31-d period. Most of the mortality due to limited food occurred 12-14 d into the experiment. Predation from lycosid spiders decreased the numbers of individuals by 49% in the first 10-15 days of the experiment. Either noncompensatory or compensatory responses resulted from the combined effects of food availability and predation on population size, depending upon the nutritional status of host plants. At ambient-level food quality (no fertilizer), spider predation and food limitation were compensatory; the same numbers of grasshoppers were recovered in treatments with and without spider-predation risk after 31 d. However, with higher food quality (N fertilizer), spider predation reduced the numbers of surviving individuals as compared with the no-spider-predation treatment, a noncompensatory response. In separate, preplanned experiments, individuals surviving spider-predation treatments lived longer than did individuals protected from spider predation when they were caged individually over vegetation of ambient quality. Combined, these experiments emphasize the importance of food quality as a determinant of how this predator-prey system responds, and the results suggest a mechanism underlying the response. After predation, survivors are likely to encounter more food per capita and to exhibit higher individual quality, which promotes longevity, presumably from reduced competition. This leads to a compensatory response. Under high food quality regimes, predation and food probably act in a noncompensatory fashion because grasshoppers are less food limited, and the release of additional food on a per capita basis by predation has less effect on the subsequent number of survivors.","Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Joern, A (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,101,46,50,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2000,81,1,,,,,66,77,,10.2307/177134,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,277BT,WOS:000084913400007,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

During the experiment, the seedlings developed natural infestations by Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and powdery mildew. Several weeks after the start of the experiment a condition of diminishing prey availability was created by use of hexythiazox treatments. Without heterospecific competitors, T. pyri attained a higher population level than E. finlandicus or K. aberrans when similar amounts of food (spider mites) were available to each. Population growth of ir: pyri was decisively favoured by the presence of T. urticae. In the single-species systems each predatory species persisted to the end of the experiment in spite of diminishing prey. In two-species systems with T. pyri/E. finlandicus and T. pyri/K. aberrans that were started with the same number of individuals of each species, only T. pyri was left at the end of the experiment. Typhlodromus pyri became more numerous than the other species when prey was abundant (which was in accordance with the results of the single-species groups) and finally displaced E. finlandicus and K. aberrans towards the end of the experiment. The following factors may have contributed to the dominance of T. pyri: (1) the ability of adult females to survive longer without food than those of E. finlandicus and K. aberrans, (2) the ability to complete juvenile development and to sustain reproduction with phytoseiid prey and (3) an advantage in foraging behaviour over K. aberrans and E. finlandicus at low spider mite levels.

In laboratory experiments cores containing no macrofauna had significantly higher densities of diatoms than cores with C. volutator and cores with N. diversicolor after 8 d. In field experiments the densities of diatoms increased where C. volulator were removed, by spraying with insecticide, and where N. diversicolor were prevented from surface deposit feeding, by the insertion of porous mats under the surface. The mean daily rates of consumption of diatoms by individual C, volutator and N. diversicolor in the field were estimated to be 2150 to 3767 and 5476 to 12 184 cells respectively. In the laboratory the effects of C, volutator and N, diversicolor on the species composition of the diatom assemblage were similar. In the field the assemblages that developed where predation was reduced were different because of initial differences in diatom assemblage structure in the 2 experimental areas. The laboratory results showed that C. volutator and N, diversicolor may feed on the same species of diatoms when presented with the same diatom assemblage, indicating that interspecific competition for food may be important under some natural conditions.","UNIV LONDON QUEEN MARY & WESTFIELD COLL, SCH BIOL SCI, LONDON E1 4NS, ENGLAND; NAT HIST MUSEUM, DEPT BOT, LONDON SW7 5BD, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,35,46,47,0,11,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

All species are food limited and there is considerable overlap in the diets of these triclads and leeches. This paper investigates interactions between the two groups using field and laboratory experiments to try to identify the mechanism of their co-existence. Triclad and leech numbers were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic English lake. Increasing the numbers of P. tenuis and D. polychroa prior to the reproductive season in spring resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers and body size of G. complanata and H. stagnalis compared with control populations in the summer months, and vice versa. However, increases and decreases were temporary with a readjustment of numbers and body size to control levels in the autumn after reproduction had ceased. It is suggested that increasing the numbers of either group elevated the severity of both intra- and interspecific competition for food. The ''condition'' of prey may, in part, determine the strength of competition, and this was examined in laboratory experiments in which different densities and ratios of P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were offered either live of recently crushed Asellus aquaticus. In monospecific controls, growth rates of P. tenuis were greater when fed on crushed than live Asellus, but there was no significant difference in the growth of H. stagnalis fed either live or crushed prey. In mixed cultures of predators, P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were the superior competitors when fed on crushed and live Asellus, respectively. However, when competitive pressure was low, at low densities of predators, the presence of H. stagnalis in mixed cultures fed on live prey was beneficial to the growth of P. tenuis. These results are explained in terms of the greater ability of triclads to detect damaged prey, leaking body fluids, due to their sophisticated chemosensory system, and the ability of leeches to capture live prey due to the presence of suckers. It is concluded that co-existence of the two groups in British lakes is assisted by the partitioning of food on a live or damaged basis.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,MERSEYSIDE,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,21,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1996,106,4,,,,,544,550,,10.1007/BF00329714,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UT331,WOS:A1996UT33100019,28307456,,,,2021-09-24,

Following introductions in the 1950s, Gammarus pulex has replaced the native Irish freshwater amphipod G. duebeni celticus in several river systems. We show that G. pulex has eliminated and replaced G. d. celticus in lower sections of the River Lagan system, N. Ireland, although G. d. celticus maintains pure populations upstream-from G. pulex. More rarely, the two species may be found together. 2. We investigate the potential roles of cannibalism and mutual predation in explaining these replacement patterns. G. d. celticus was significantly more cannibalistic on moulted conspecifics than G. pulex. Mutual predation by intermoult individuals on moulted congenerics was observed in all combinations of adult males and females, including those in the precopulatory mate-guarding phase, and juveniles. In general, predation between species exceeded cannibalism within species, particularly predation by G. pulex on G. d. celticus. Predation was differentially in favour of G. pulex in most combinations. These differences in predation frequencies were not dependent on body size. 3. A model is presented incorporating resource exploitation competition, cannibalism and mutual predation. The behaviour of the model agrees with our intuitive predictions and our conclusions based on empirical findings. Cannibalism in the absence of predation promotes coexistence, whereas mutual but differential predation in the absence of cannibalism may lead to elimination, depending on relative resource competitive ability. When cannibalism and predation occur together, predation of equal magnitude or greater than cannibalism leads to rapid elimination. Predation in favour of species 1 may overcome a competitive advantage for species 2, leading to elimination of species 2. 4. We conclude that the superior abilities of G. pulex to resist predatory attacks and to prey on moulted G. d. celticus may be major features of the elimination and replacement of the latter species by the former. 5. We encourage examination of replacements involving other crustaceans in terms of predatory behaviour and, more generally, urge adoption of approaches at the individual level to elucidate mechanisms underlying interspecific relationships.",,"DICK, JTA (corresponding author), QUEENS UNIV BELFAST,SCH BIOL & BIOCHEM,MED BIOL CTR,DIV ENVIRONM & EVOLUT BIOL,BELFAST BT9 7BL,ANTRIM,NORTH IRELAND.",,,,,,,44,108,111,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

As a strong test of the prevailing generalization that competition plays a relatively trivial role among suspension-feeding invertebrates in the soft sediments on the estuarine seafloor, we manipulated local densities of bivalves, two species of Katelysia, in a Western Australia lagoon, characterized by exceptionally high bivalve abundances (averaging 157 m-2). 2. Competition appeared weakly and sporadically, evident in only one of five intervals, when survivorship was 20-30% lower, production of undamaged empty shells 3-5 times higher, and average growth of survivors 50% lower for both Katelysia scalarina Lamarck and Katelysia rhytiphora Lamarck in the highest density treatment (320 m-2) than in the others (20-160 m-2). 3. Surprisingly, during both winter-spring intervals survivorship was also 25% lower at the lowest density for both species. The type of mortality was one that resulted in disappearance of the empty shell. Addition of sufficient numbers of sham clams, dead shells filled with sand and implanted in living position in the sediments, acted to prevent the enhancement of mortality at low density. This demonstration of the importance of a structural barrier implies that the agent of mortality at low density is a predator. Sampling error, emigration and post-mortem transport by scavengers can be ruled out by results of direct tests. 4. In a caging experiment, the predatory seastar Coscinasterias calamaria (Gray) replicated the pattern of enhanced predation rate on Katelysia of both species at low density. This represents a candidate for the unknown predator that was deterred by the structural barrier created by crowding of shells. A demersal fish is an alternative candidate. 5. Contrary to previous data for suspension feeders in estuarine soft sediments, which commonly show negative effects of adults on local recruitment of young, recruitment of K. scalarina was greater around higher densities of adult bivalves in one of two tests. Survivorship of recruits did not vary with adult density, suggesting that the recruitment pattern may have resulted from gregarious larval settlement around adults rather than from differences in early post-settlement survivorship. 6. Evolution and expression of gregarious settlement may be a reasonable expectation, given the sporadic and small penalties of competition, and the large and repeated benefits of mutual defences at high density. More broadly, positive interactions such as commensalism, mutualism and facilitation might be expected to be more prevalent in systems like the soft-sediment benthos where competition is so ineffective and relatively unimportant.","UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA, DEPT ZOOL, NEDLANDS, WA 6009, AUSTRALIA","PETERSON, CH (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012; Black, Robert/F-5312-2013","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Black, William/0000-0001-6839-8674",,,,64,57,59,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size structure, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored over a 2-mo summer period. Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively during the whole experiment, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates. The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex interactions between the omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics of littoral than of pelagic communities.",,"DIEHL, S (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,102,357,369,1,224,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1992,73,5,,,,,1646,1661,,10.2307/1940017,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP740,WOS:A1992JP74000014,,,,,2021-09-24,

Both snails and tadpoles feed on periphytic algae and, thus, there should be a large potential for competitive interactions to occur between these two distantly related taxa. In a field experiment we examined the relative strength of competition between two closely related snail species, Lymnaea stagnalis and L. peregra, and between L. stagnalis and tadpoles of the common frog, Rana temporaria. Snail growth and egg production and tadpole size at and time to metamorphosis were determined. Effects on the common food source, periphyton, were monitored with the aid of artificial substrates. Periphyton dry weight was dramatically reduced in the presence of snails and/or tadpoles. There were no competitive effects on growth or egg production of the two snail species when they were coexisting. Mortality of L. peregra was high (95%) after reproduction, but independent of treatment. Growth of L. stagnalis was reduced only at the highest tadpole densities, whereas egg production was reduced both by intraspecific competition and by competition with tadpoles. Differences in egg production were retained after tadpole metamorphosis. Tadpole larval period increased, weight of metamorphosing frogs decreased and growth rate was reduced as a function of increasing tadpole density. However, contrary to expectation, snails had a positive effect on tadpole larval period, weight and growth rate. Further, in experimental containers without snails there was a dense growth of the filamentous green alga Cladophora sp. We suggest that the facilitative effects of snails on tadpoles are due to an indirect mutualistic mechanism, involving competition between food sources of different quality (microalgae and Cladophora sp.) and tadpoles being competitively dominant over snails for the preferred food source (microalgae). In the presence of tadpoles snails will be forced to feed on low-quality Cladophora, increasing nutrient turnover rates, which results in enhanced productivity of microalgae, increasing tadpole food resources. Thus, tadpoles have a negative effect on snails through resource depression, while snails facilitate tadpole growth through an indirect enhancement of food availability.",,"BRONMARK, C (corresponding author), UNIV LUND,DEPT ECOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,78,77,80,1,48,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,87,1,,,,,8,18,,10.1007/BF00323774,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR962,WOS:A1991FR96200002,28313346,,,,2021-09-24,

Focal individuals were observed alone and in pairs with conspecifics and allospecifics at four prey (Baetis bicaudatus, Baetidae, Ephemeroptera) densities to determine whether competitors and prey resource levels affected prey capture rates. Presence of conspecific or allospecific competitors reduced stonefly prey capture rates, especially for Kogotus, the smaller of the two species, due to a significant decline in predator-prey encounter rates with competitors present. This competitive effect was not observed at the lowest and highest prey densities due to very low or very high predator-prey encounter rates, respectively. Thus, interference affected feeding rates only at intermediate prey densities. Competitors had no effect on the probability of attacks per prey encounter or capture success per attack. Within each stonefly species the effects of intra- and interspecific interference on feeding rates were similar, even though behavioral responses by both stoneflies to interspecific encounters were more frequent than to encounters with conspecifics. Kogotus showed the highest levels of response to encounters with other stone-flies, maintaining those high levels of response to Megarcys over all prey densities. Further, male Kogotus, which are the smaller sex, responded more frequently to competitive interactions than did females. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that interspecific interference was asymmetrical with Megarcys, the larger species, being the superior competitor.","ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA","PECKARSKY, BL (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,51,49,50,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,85,4,,,,,521,529,,10.1007/BF00323764,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY036,WOS:A1991EY03600009,28312499,,,,2021-09-24,

Given inherent fecundity advantages, why don't small-seeded species dominate communities? In perennial grasslands, we evaluated whether small-seeded species are less tolerant of competition from the community dominant bunchgrass than large-seeded species, but also less vulnerable to seed predation by mice. We also explored whether trade-offs involving competitive tolerance include two other functional traits, height and leaf mass per area (LMA). We added seeds of 17 forb species to plots where bunchgrass competition and rodent seed predation were manipulated across sites varying in bunchgrass productivity and thus competitive intensity. Seeds were added at densities mimicking interspecific variation in fecundity among target species. Standardizing for differences in fecundity (i.e. seed input, which enabled us to evaluate inherent interspecific differences in susceptibility to biotic interactions), bunchgrass competition more greatly reduced recruitment and establishment of small- versus large-seeded species, whereas rodent seed predation more greatly reduced the recruitment of large- versus small-seeded species. Plant height and LMA were unrelated to the competition effect size. Small-seeded species abundance decreased across sites increasing in bunchgrass productivity, whereas this was not the case for large-seeded species. For adult plants but not seedlings, community-weighted functional trait means (CWM) for seed size, height and LMA increased in plots with versus without bunchgrass competition and the CWM for seed size and height also increased at sites with greater bunchgrass productivity (for adults only). In contrast, rodent seed predation had no significant effects on CWM seed size. At the end of the experiment, adult abundance positively correlated with plant fecundity in plots lacking bunchgrass, indicating the inherent advantages accrued to high fecundity small-seeded species. However, with bunchgrass competition, abundances were equalized across species due to reduced competitive tolerance of high fecundity small-seeded species. Synthesis. Our results suggest that coexistence among subordinate forb species varying in seed size and fecundity is in-part due to a trade-off involving competitive tolerance and fecundity, mediated by seed size and associated functional traits.","[Maron, John L.; Hajek, Karyn L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hahn, Philip G.] Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,"Hahn, Philip/0000-0001-9717-9489",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518],"U.S. National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518",,77,1,1,9,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We investigate potential benefits and costs of a common and varied morphological trait, cuticular spines, for foraging behavior, interspecific competition, and predator-prey interactions in naturally co-occurring spiny ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Polyrhachis) in an experimental setting. We expect that a defensive trait like spines might be associated with more conspicuous foraging, a greater number of workers sent out to forage, and potentially increased competitive ability. Alternatively, consistent with the ecological trade-off hypothesis, we expect that investment in spines for antipredator defense might be negatively correlated with these other ecological traits. We find little evidence for any costs to ecological traits, instead finding that species with longer spines either outperform or do not differ from species with shorter spines for all tested metrics, including resource discovery rate and foraging effort as well as competitive ability and antipredator defense. Spines appear to confer broad antipredator benefits and serve as a form of defense with undetectable costs to key ecological abilities like resource foraging and competitive ability, providing an explanation for both the ecological success of the study genus and the large number of evolutionary origins of this trait across all ants.

For this purpose, we used single-species and two-species occupancy models using records of D. albiventris, considered the dominant species, and D. aurita from a cameratrap survey conducted in an agricultural and conservation landscape in the Atlantic Forest of Argentina. We evaluated which factors determined the probability of species occurrence: habitat preferences or interspecific relationships. We also estimated the overlap in daily activity patterns between species, and evaluated changes in D. aurita activity in response to the occupancy probability of D. albiventris. Didelphis aurita had higher occupancy probabilities in the continuous native forest, whereas D. albiventris had higher occupancy probabilities in fragmented forests with less complex and more open vegetation structure, and greater proximity to buildings. Both opossums were almost absent in pine plantations. Results of the co-occurrence models and the overlap in diel activity suggest that D. aurita is not avoiding D. albiventris. Occurrences of these two opossums most probably reflect different adaptations by each species to different habitats, and competitive interactions seem to play a minor role in shaping their current distributions. Didelphis albiventris may be replacing D. aurita mainly as a result of changing environmental conditions, which become unfavorable to the latter but promote the creation of new habitat for the former.","[Cruz, Paula; Eugenia Iezzi, Maria; De Angelo, Carlos; Varela, Diego; Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, CONICET, Inst Biol Subtrop, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [Cruz, Paula; Eugenia Iezzi, Maria; De Angelo, Carlos; Varela, Diego; Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Asociac Civil Ctr Invest Bosque Atlantico, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Bertoni 124, RA-3380 Eldorado, Misiones, Argentina","Cruz, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, CONICET, Inst Biol Subtrop, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina.; Cruz, P (corresponding author), Asociac Civil Ctr Invest Bosque Atlantico, Bertoni 85, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina.",policruz@hotmail.com,,"Varela, Diego/0000-0003-3123-6756","Ministry of Ecology of Misiones Province; Fundacion Vida Silvestre Argentina; National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), Cataratas del Iguazu International Airport, Argentine Army; Department of Forestry and Renewable Forest Resources; ESRI Conservation Program; Society for Conservation GIS - UCAR (Unidad para el Cambio Rural); Ministerio de Agroindustria, Argentina [10102]; ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Argentina) through PICTANPCyT [1904]; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 2012-2014.112-201101-00616]; Project UE IBS [22920160100130CO]; Ministerio de Ecologia de Misiones through Proyecto de Implementacion del Plan de Manejo del Parque Provincial Uruguai [256/09]","We are grateful to all the students and park rangers that helped us with the field activities, especially to J.

While both competition and predation can control the size of animal populations, changes in the relative importance of these two density-dependent processes remain poorly documented during ecological succession. Here, we combined habitat selection and optimal foraging theory to identify the processes that can explain the increase in red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) during post-logging forest succession in boreal ecosystems. Specifically, we assessed the extent to which changes in intra- and interspecific competition and in predation risk can explain variation in abundance and distribution of voles during post-harvest forest succession. We estimated the abundances of the red-backed vole and of its main competitor, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), in adjacent pairs of logged (5-66years old) forest stands and uncut stands (>120years old). We found that voles increased their preference for uncut stands with increasing conspecific density. Foraging experiments revealed that in early-seral forest stands, voles increased their feeding effort in the presence of deer mice, particularly in safer food patches. This behaviour is expected from foraging theory when interspecific competitors increase predation risk. Apparent competition would thus limit the density of red-backed voles, and changes in the relative strength of this process during forest succession would control patterns of distribution and abundance of the species.","[Le Borgne, Helene; Dupuch, Angelique; Fortin, Daniel] Univ Laval, Univ Laval Sylviculture & Faune, Dept Biol, Chaire Rech Ind CRSNG, Pavillon Alexandre Vachon,1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Le Borgne, Helene; Dupuch, Angelique] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada","Le Borgne, H (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Univ Laval Sylviculture & Faune, Dept Biol, Chaire Rech Ind CRSNG, Pavillon Alexandre Vachon,1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.; Le Borgne, H (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",helene.le.borgne.1@gmail.com,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)-Laval University Industrial Research Chair in Silviculture and WildlifeNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank Orphe Bichet, Andreanne Beardsell, Maxime Cotnoir, Pascal Royer-Boutin, Marie-Helene Chabot, Gabriel Emond, Adam Moreira and Jean-Pierre Michaud for their help at different stages of the study, and W.F.J.

The necrobiome is a unique microcosm in which various organisms interact and compete for access to an ephemeral resource, such as carrion, that ultimately determines the structure and composition of these assemblages. 2. Blowfly species exhibit different competitive abilities which, when associated with other types of behaviour, such as predation or cannibalism, influence coexistence. Knowledge of the effects of competition between native and invasive species on development and survival is essential to understanding the dynamics of insect communities and to assess biological invasions. 3. Laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of interspecific competition on the bionomics and survival of a native (Cochliomyia macellaria) and an invasive (Chrysomya rufifacies) blowfly species at different population densities. 4. The deleterious effect of competition on the larval parameters of C. macellaria increased proportionally with increases in the larval density of C. rufifacies. When exposed to increased densities of C. rufifacies, larvae of C. macellaria accelerated their development and, as a trade-off for this strategy, surviving adults were smaller and had reduced wing size, which were likely to reduce dispersal and reproductive capacity. 5. Larval competition-both as species-dependent and density-dependent phenomena-influences morphological and biological traits of surviving individuals. The impact of the invasive species has consequences at the population level, such as displacement or local population depletion of native species, a phenomenon likely to occur in other systems involving insects and ephemeral resources.","[Carmo, Rodrigo F.

Predator effects on competitively superior species is one possible mechanism. In this study, we tested whether the presence of size-selective predators (fishes) acts as a mechanism for the coexistence of two species of case-bearing caddisfly larvae, Perissoneura paradoxa and Psilotreta kisoensis (Odontoceridae, Trichoptera). The larvae of these two species have similar ecological and life history traits except their body size, and they have been found to coexist only in habitats shared with predatory fishes. Experiments on intra and interspecific competition revealed that the larger Pe. paradoxa always outcompeted the smaller Ps. kisoensis in the absence of predatory fishes, suggesting that Pe. paradoxa performed intra-guild predation on Ps. kisoensis. We also conducted experiments to examine how strongly each of these species responded in terms of case repair with/without a predator chemical cue after their cases were partly dismantled. Perissoneura paradoxa exhibited a stronger case repair response in the presence of a predator chemical cue than that exhibited by Ps. kisoensis, suggesting that Pe. paradoxa is more vulnerable to fish predation, probably because their body size is in the preferred prey range of fishes. We suggest that the presence of predators works in the favor of smaller, subordinate species through size-selective predator effects, enabling these two competitive species to coexist in the same habitat.","[Okano, Jun-ichi; Tayasu, Ichiro; Nakano, Shin-ichi; Okuda, Noboru] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Tayasu, Ichiro; Okuda, Noboru] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, 457-4 Motoyama, Kamigamo, Kyoto 6038047, Japan","Okano, J (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",j.oj.o55222@gmail.com,"Nakano, Shin-ichi/M-5483-2016; Tayasu, Ichiro/A-9924-2009","Nakano, Shin-ichi/0000-0001-5235-8547; Tayasu, Ichiro/0000-0002-3006-7973; Okano, Jun-ichi/0000-0002-1295-4114","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [12J01273, 26840146]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26840146] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (No. 12J01273 & No. 26840146).

Interactions between apex predators can have cascading effects through the entire natural community, which supports broadening the scope of conservation from single species to a much wider ecosystem perspective. However, competition between wild large carnivores can hardly be measured experimentally. In this study, we analyzed the expansion of the Scandinavian wolf (Canis lupus) population during its recovery from the early 1990s. We took into account wolf-, habitat-, human-and brown bear (Ursus arctos)-related factors, because wolf expansion occurred within an area partially sympatric with bears. Wolf pair establishment was positively related to previous wolf presence and was negatively related to road density, distance to other wolf territories, and bear density. These findings suggest that both human-related habitat modification and interspecific competition have been influential factors modulating the expansion of the wolf population. Interactions between large carnivores have the potential to affect overall biodiversity. Therefore, conservation-oriented management of such species should consider interspecific interactions, rather than focusing only on target populations of single species. Long-term monitoring data across large areas should also help quantify and predict the influence of biotic interactions on species assemblages and distributions elsewhere. This is important because interactive processes can be essential in the regulation, stability, and resilience of ecological communities.","[Ordiz, Andres; Mansson, Johan; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Milleret, Cyril; Wabakken, Petter] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, NO-2480 Evenstad, Koppang, Norway; [Kindberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway","Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",andres.ordiz@gmail.com,"Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019; Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020","Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457; Mansson, Johan/0000-0002-5189-2091; Milleret, Cyril/0000-0002-8563-981X",Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission; Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk; Hedmark University College; Office of Environmental Affairs in Hedmark County; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; Worldwide Fund for Nature (Sweden); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse,"A.

Gradients in competition and predation that regulate communities should guide biogenic habitat restoration, while restoration ecology provides opportunities to address fundamental questions regarding food web dynamics via large-scale field manipulations. 2. We restored oyster reefs across an aerial exposure gradient (shallow-subtidal-to-mid-intertidal) to explore how vertical gradients in natural settlement, growth and interspecific interactions affected the trajectory of man-made shellfish reefs. 3. We recorded nearly an order-of-magnitude higher oyster settlement on the deepest (subtidal) reefs, but within a year abundance patterns reversed, and oyster densities were ultimately highest on the shallowest (intertidal) reefs by over an order-of-magnitude. 4. This reversal was due to (i) significantly elevated survivorship on intertidal reefs and (ii) larger surviving oysters on intertidal reefs. These patterns are likely to have developed from greater levels of biofouling and predator abundance (e.g. stone crabs, gastropods) on deeper reefs where aerial exposure was <5% of the monthly tidal cycle. 5. Synthesis and applications. The success of restoration initiatives involving habitat-forming species can be enhanced by accounting for the biotic interactions that regulate population fitness. In littoral systems, vertical gradients in predation, competition and disturbance can be exploited to guide restoration of vegetated (e.g. mangrove, seagrass) or biogenic reef habitats. In particular, our results demonstrate that paradigms of vertical zonation learned from the rocky intertidal and saltmarshes also describe the fate of restored shellfish reefs. As with rocky shores, the lower vertical limit of adult oyster distribution in our study system was most likely driven by predatory and competitive (i.e. smothering) interactions, with a threshold depth at c. 5% daily aerial exposure. Below this depth, experimentally restored reefs failed completely. As with Spartina saltmarsh, accumulation of oyster biomass was greatest at an intermediate vertical position relative to mean sea level (i.e. mid-to-low intertidal). Our developing model proscribes a vertical 'hot spot' for restoration efforts to maximize biogenic reef fitness and production.","[Fodrie, F.

We examined interactions between an omnivorous shrimp and a grazing mayfly, two co-dominant taxa found in Puerto Rican headwater streams, to assess how predator presence may influence mayfly resource use and instantaneous growth in a tropical rainforest ecosystem. We conducted a series of behavioral and growth experiments to determine the effects of the freshwater shrimp, Xiphocaris elongata, on the growth rate and resource selection of mayfly nymphs in the family Leptophlebiidae. For resource choice assessments, we conducted a series of five day laboratory experiments where mayflies were given access to two resource substrate choices (cobble vs. leaves) in the presence or absence of shrimp. To assess for the effects of shrimp on mayfly fitness, we measured mayfly growth in laboratory aquaria after five days using four treatments (cobble, leaves, cobble + leaves, no resource) in the presence or absence of shrimp. In resource choice experiments, mayflies showed preference for cobble over leaf substrata (p<0.05) regardless of the presence of shrimps, however, the preference for cobble was significantly greater when shrimp were present in the leaf habitat.

However, we measured increased mayfly nymph growth in the absence of predators and when both cobble and leaves were available.

In simultaneous host exploitations, T. basalis females displayed an aggressive behavior against O. telenomicida females. The outcome of multiparasitism showed that interspecific larval competition was dominated by O. telenomicida regardless of the sequence in which oviposition occurred and which parasitoid was or was not simultaneously released in the patch. Finally, O. telenomicida can successfully develop in hosts already parasitized by T. basalis up to seven days earlier, acting as a facultative hyperparasitoid, so that intraguild predation (IGP) also occurred.

However, experimentally demonstrating this role of resource partitioning in diverse communities has been difficult. We used an experimental response-surface design, varying intra- and interspecific consumer densities, to compare patterns of resource exploitation between simple and diverse communities of aphid predators. With increasing density, each single consumer species rapidly plateaued in its ability to extract more resources. This suggests intraspecific competition for a subset of the resource pool, a hallmark of resource partitioning. In contrast, more diverse-predator communities achieved greater overall resource depletion. By statistically fitting mechanistic models to the data, we demonstrated that resource partitioning rather than facilitation provides the better explanation for the observed differences in resource use between simple and diverse communities. This model-fitting approach also allowed us to quantify overlap in resource use by different consumer species.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Snyder, Gretchen B.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Snyder, WE (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",wesnyder@wsu.edu,"Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X; Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523; Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",,,,45,59,60,1,86,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

What is not known is whether such coexistence would occur if organisms dispersed non-randomly, using cues such as density and habitat quality to gauge fitness differences between habitats. Here, I conduct a comparative analysis of random and non-random dispersal strategies in a foodweb with a basal resource, top predator, and two intermediate consumers that exhibit a trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility. I find a striking contrast between density- and habitat-dependent dispersal in their effects on spatial coexistence. Dispersal in response to competitor and predator density facilitates coexistence while dispersal in response to habitat quality (resource productivity and predator pressure) inhibits it. Moreover, density-dependent dispersal changes species' distribution patterns from interspecific segregation to interspecific aggregation, while habitat-dependent dispersal preserves the interspecific segregation observed in the absence of dispersal. Under density-dependent dispersal, widespread spatial coexistence results in an overall decline in the abundance of the inferior competitor that is less susceptible to predation and an overall increase in the abundance of the superior competitor that is more susceptible to predation. Under habitat-dependent dispersal, restricted spatial coexistence results in species' abundances being essentially unchanged from those observed in the absence of dispersal. A key outcome is that when the superior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the inferior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is possible in both resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. However, when the inferior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the superior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is precluded in resource-poor habitats and greatly reduced in resource-rich habitats. This suggests that species-specific differences may play an important role in driving spatial coexistence patterns. The comparative framework yields predictions that can be tested with experiments that manipulate the relative mobilities of interacting species, or observational data on relative abundances and distribution patterns.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",amarasek@ucla.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717350],This research was supported by NSF grant DEB-0717350.

We tested this hypothesis by studying a small teleost (nine-spined stickleback, Pungitius pungitius) from four marine and five lake (diverse fish community) and nine pond (impoverished fish community) populations. In line with theory, pond fish tended to be larger than their marine or lake conspecifics, sometimes reaching giant sizes. In two geographically independent cases when predatory fish had been introduced into ponds, fish were smaller than those in nearby ponds lacking predators. Pond fish were also smaller when found in sympatry with three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) than those in ponds lacking competitors. Size-at-age analyses demonstrated that larger size in ponds was achieved by both increased growth rates and extended longevity of pond fish. Results from a common garden experiment indicate that the growth differences had a genetic basis: pond fish developed two to three times higher body mass than marine fish during 36 weeks of growth under similar conditions. Hence, reduced risk of predation and interspecific competition appear to be chief forces driving insular body size evolution toward gigantism.","[Herczeg, Gabor; Gonda, Abigel; Merila, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Herczeg, G (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",gabor.herczeg@helsinki.fi; abigel.gonda@helsinki.fi; juha.merila@helsinki.fi,"Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Herczeg, Gabor/AAF-9978-2020","Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Ministry of Education and Centre for International Mobility (CIMO),"We thank Victor Berger, Goran Englund, Tuomas Leinonen, Daniel Lussetti, and Pirkko Siikamaki for their help in obtaining the samples.

We investigated the role of several factors in promoting coexistence among the aphids Aphis nerii, Aphis asclepiadis, and Myzocallis asclepiadis that all specialize on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). Competitive exclusion is thought to occur when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. Consequently, we investigated whether predators, mutualists, or resource quality affected the strength of intra- vs. interspecific competition among aphids in factorial manipulations of competition with exposure to predation, ants, and variable plant genotypes in three separate experiments. In the predation X competition experiment, predators reduced aphid per capita growth by 66%, but the strength of intra- and interspecific competition did not depend on predators. In the ants 3 competition experiment, ants reduced per capita growth of A. nerii and M. asclepiadis (neither of which were mutualists with ants) by approximately one-half. In so doing, ants ameliorated the negative effects of these competitors on ant-tended A. asclepiadis by two-thirds, representing a novel benefit of ant - aphid mutualism. Nevertheless, ants alone did not explain the persistence of competitively inferior A. asclepiadis as, even in the presence of ants, interspecific competition remained stronger than intraspecific competition. In the plant genotype 3 competition experiment, both A. asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis were competitively inferior to A. nerii, with the strength of interspeci. c competition exceeding that of intraspecific competition by 83% and 23%, respectively. Yet these effects differed among milkweed genotypes, and there were one or more plant genotypes for each aphid species where coexistence was predicted. A synthesis of our results shows that predators play little or no role in preferentially suppressing competitively dominant A. nerii. Nonetheless, A. asclepiadis benefits from ants, and A. asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis may escape competitive exclusion by A. nerii on select milkweed genotypes. Taken as a whole, the coexistence of three host-specific aphid species sharing the same resource was promoted by the dual action of ants as antagonists and mutualists and by genetic diversity in the plant population itself.","[Smith, R.

K. deyrolli nymphs and the predator Laccotrephes japonensis (Nepidae: Heteroptera) adults coexist in rice paddy fields. It was predicted that the difference in tadpole density may influence the K. deyrolli nymph survival rate. We first compared survival rates of the first instar nymphs of K. deyrolli in June (high tadpole density period) and July (low tadpole density period). Secondly, we investigated the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs at different tadpole densities and under the presence or absence of L. japonensis adults to examine whether higher tadpole density moderates predation pressure from L. japonensis adults to K. deyrolli nymphs, e.g., density-mediated indirect effects. As a result of the comparison, the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs in June was higher than that in July. For the field experiment, the slopes between the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs and tadpole density were positive under both predator presence and absence. However, the slope under the presence of a predator was steeper than that under absence of the predator (predator-by-tadpole density interaction was significant). These results suggest that a higher tadpole density in June provides an abundant food resource for K. deyrolli nymphs and also moderates predation pressure from L. japonensis.","Okayama Univ, Lab Insect Ecol, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Ohba, S (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Lab Insect Ecol, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",oobah8ag@yahoo.co.jp,"Ohba, Shin-ya/M-5406-2019","Ohba, Shin-ya/0000-0003-3854-0902",,,,33,6,8,0,10,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. I studied a system of marine reserves in the San-Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. I surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (Nuttallia obscurata, Mya arenaria, and Venerupis philippinarum). Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, V. philippinarum, was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in Venerupis biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (Protothaca staminea) did not differ between reserves and non-reserves. I followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high Venerupis densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial Protothaca, and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, Venerupis had no direct effect on itself or Protothaca; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of Venerupis, whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that Cancer productus, an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult Venerupis at least 1.7 times over Protothaca. Venerupis' high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to Protothaca can be explained by its shallower burial depth. By growing quickly and residing near the surface, Venerupis apparently absorbs the brunt of harvest pressure while Protothaca maintains high biomass even outside of reserves.","Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Zool, 46 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jebyers@unh.edu,,"Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,60,47,51,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2005,86,2,,,,,487,500,,10.1890/03-0580,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,906IM,WOS:000227634400024,,,,,2021-09-24,

Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus) patch use did not vary with treatment type. Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) used areas of natural woody vegetation more than patches with artificial perches and patches with no perches. Patch use by Loggerhead Shrikes was also influenced by the presence of complex woody vegetation and interspecific interactions, whereas American Kestrel use was limited by landscape matrix and ground cover density.

Accipiter gentilis and their effects on buzzard breeding success and brood defence with a two-year field experiment using dummies and playback calls. A priori I showed through an extensive nest site analysis that there is considerable nesting habitat overlap between the two species and hence potential for interspecific competition for prime nesting habitat, Buzzards had a significantly lower breeding success when presented with a goshawk dummy compared to control broods but there was no effect of buzzard dummies on reproductive success, Buzzards failing with their breeding attempt tended to select another nest site while successful buzzards more frequently used the same nest again. Buzzard pairs were less often attacked by common crows Corrus corone while exposed to goshawk dummies compared to buzzard dummies. The decision to desert a nest seems to be a trade-off between predation risk on the one hand and protection against crows on the other. Goshawks probed far more aggressive against an intraspecific dummy than buzzards. Buzzards adjusted their level of brood defence against both intra- and interspecific dummies according to the age of offspring but not offspring number, with an increasing brood defence level with increasing offspring age. Thus the behaviour of buzzards towards goshawks is a result of a complex system of trade-offs between predation risk. competition for prime nesting habitat and protection from crows on which brood value acts as a temporal modifier.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany","Kruger, O (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",ok212@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,72,45,48,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2002,96,3,,,,,441,452,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.960306.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543QG,WOS:000175112200006,,,,,2021-09-24,

The hypothesis of competition with Skylark (Alauda arvensis) was tested by analysis of territoriality and agonistic behaviour as well as foraging-sites behaviour. The possible indispensability of perches was investigated by an artificial perch experiment. Flight behaviour was tested in comparison with the Skylark. Woodlark and Skylark showed neither interspecific territoriality nor a high level of interspecific agonistic interactions. Even though some perches were used frequently, Woodlarks did not change territories in grassland areas because of the artificial perches. On closer examination of anti-predation-strategies it became clear that forest edge is not a factor of woodlark-territories but the habitat of that species. As Skylarks try to escape by overflying or hiding in grass, Woodlarks mostly flew to the forest. Together with morphological and singing aspects both nest type and flight-behaviour show obvious adaptations to field-forest ecotones.","Max Planck Gesell, Forschungsstelle Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell, Germany","Schaefer, T (corresponding author), Max Planck Gesell, Forschungsstelle Ornithol, Vogelwarte Radolfzell,Schlossallee 2, D-78315 Radolfzell, Germany.",,,,,,,48,15,15,0,13,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

In this study, we investigated predation rates on third instar larvae of C. macellaria, C. putoria and C. megacephala by third instar larvae of C. albiceps in no-choice, two-choice and three-choice situations. Most attacks by C. albiceps larvae occurred within the first hour of observation and the highest predation rate occurred on C. macellaria larvae, suggesting that C. albiceps was more dangerous to C. macellaria than to C. megacephala and C. putoria under these experimental conditions.

Tests were run in the presence and absence of a potential competitor, Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii). From tracks in the sand, we determined that, when alone, deer mice decreased total activity as moonlight increased and were more active in areas with cover than in open areas. However, deer mice did not vary proportions of activity allocated to open areas (ca. 20%) and cover/edge areas (ca. 80%) with variations in moonlight. Deer mice consumed more seeds in areas with cover but also did not vary the proportions of seeds eaten in the open (ca. 43%) or cover (ca. 57%) with variations in moonlight. Using infrared video filming, we determined that deer mice increased use of cover to nearly 100% in the presence of Ord's kangaroo rats. Aggression (active chasing and locking fights) by kangaroo rats towards deer mice caused this shift. Our experiments substantiate field observations of variable microhabitat use by deer mice in areas with and without kangaroo rats and identify behavioral interactions involved.","Univ No Colorado, Dept Sci Biol, Greeley, CO 80631 USA","Clarke, JA (corresponding author), Univ No Colorado, Dept Sci Biol, Greeley, CO 80631 USA.",,,,,,,40,45,50,0,17,AMER SOC MAMMALOGISTS,PROVO,"BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV, DEPT OF ZOOLOGY, PROVO, UT 84602 USA",0022-2372,,,J MAMMAL,J.

Five hypotheses were evaluated to explain why Z. mall had more impact on M. occidentalis in the field than on T. pyri. Given equal opportunity, Z. mall adult females did not consume more M. occidentalis eggs than T. pyri eggs nor did adult females of either phytoseiid inflict greater mortality on Z. mall eggs or larvae through attack or consumption. There was no difference in the within-tree association of Z. mall adult females with eggs of either phytoseiid species nor were there differences in the way prey mites (all life stages) were spatially partitioned between adult female Z. mall as compared with adults and deutonymphs (combined) of either phytoseiid. The foraging area of adult female Z. mali and the oviposition locations of the two phytoseiids from both field and laboratory data were compared using spatial statistics. Metaseiulus occidentalis laid significantly more eggs in the primary foraging area of adult female Z. mall than T. pyri.

In order to understand this pattern I performed experiments at two levels. First, at the community level, I evaluated the importance of competition, predation, and pond permanence for patterns of larval performance. Second, at the behavioral level, I asked whether a hypothesized trade-off between gain and risk underlies ecological interactions, and ultimately, patterns of performance and distribution of these species. I employed a field manipulation to assess the contributions of competition and predation within different ponds that varied in permanence. In order to examine the effect of interspecific competition, enclosures contained each tadpole species either alone or in the presence of an equal density of the other species; these enclosures were placed in two temporary ponds, two intermediate ponds, and two permanent ponds. Tadpole stocking densities reflected local natural densities. This competition treatment was crossed with a predator treatment manipulating the absence or presence of predators (with ''presence'' representing the naturally occurring density within each pond). Patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across the pond permanence gradient: chorus frogs performed best relative to spring peepers in temporary ponds while spring peepers performed best relative to chorus frogs in permanent ponds (performance was measured as survivorship and growth). The dominant sources of mortality were pond drying in temporary ponds and predation in more permanent ponds. In contrast to most previous experimental studies of larval anurans, competition had small effects on tadpole performance. Results from the held experiment suggest that pond drying and predation may be important determinants of performance, and that the two species are differentially susceptible to these mortality agents. In a set of laboratory experiments I evaluated the hypothesis that a trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk mediated through activity (proportion of time spent moving) might explain patterns of Pseudacris distribution. In both species, individuals facultatively reduced activity in the presence of a caged predator with a corresponding drop in growth rate. In general, larval chorus frogs also tend to be more active and faster growing and developing than spring peepers. These results provide support for the existence of the trade-off and suggest that interspecific differences in activity may contribute to patterns of larval performance and distribution among ponds. The general nature of this trade-off suggests that it may also be important in other systems.","UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",,,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,,,,57,142,144,0,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1995,76,1,,,,,150,164,,10.2307/1940638,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QC872,WOS:A1995QC87200013,,,,,2021-09-24,

This reduction occurs although no mortal injuries to workers can occur (conspecifics are separated by mesh), and despite ad libitum food availability. Thus, decreased brood biomass is a consequence of behavioural decision(s) rather than food limitations or reduced numbers of brood tenders. Despite lower brood biomass, such a response can theoretically maximize total colony biomass if it decreases forager mortality.","HARVARD UNIV, MUSEUM COMPARAT ZOOL, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA; TECH EDUC RES CTR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02140 USA",,,"Nonacs, Peter/A-3159-2008",,,,,30,7,7,0,10,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Additionally, sea urchins have lower respiration and food consumption rates, and at high biomass levels appear to reduce algal resources to levels lower than herbivorous fishes. A simple biomass-based energetic model was developed to help explain these patterns and to determine the energetic properties of organisms which affect their resource competitive ability and ability to sustain themselves under predation. Simulations of a hypothetical herbivore indicate that herbivore steady-state biomass increases with decreasing consumption rates, but a parabolic relationship was found between herbivore biomass and the level to which the herbivore reduces its food resource (i.e. R *). Simulations of competition between hypothetical herbivores indicate that only the level to which a herbivore reduces its resource (R *) was important in determining the superior resource competitor, although biomass dynamics differed depending on feeding, gross production rates, and initial conditions of competitors. High herbivore consumption and gross production increase rates of biomass recruitment. But, unless an herbivore can also keep resources below the level competitors can tolerate, a high rate of gross production does not insure the competitor superior resource competitive ability in the absence of predators. Yet the model also predicts that organisms with high gross production and consumption rates are able to persist better under high levels of harvesting by predators. The model suggests that sea urchins reach high biomass due to low algal consumption rates and out-compete herbivorous fishes, when their predators are reduced (i.e. often attributable to overfishing), by reducing algal biomass to low levels. Sea urchins appear to tolerate low algal biomass due to their low consumption and respiration rates which allows them to persist at low levels of net algal productivity. But, low sea urchin gross production makes them less likely to persist under high levels of harvesting or predation. The model suggests that organisms may frequently need to make energetic trade-offs between traits which will give them superior resource competitive ability and tolerance to predation or disturbance.","UNIV FLORIDA, CTR WETLANDS, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA; UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN SCI, SYST ECOL PROGRAM, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA",,,"McClanahan, Tim/K-4998-2019","McClanahan, Timothy/0000-0001-5821-3584",,,,69,68,72,1,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

In contrast, I found only minor effects of removing flea beetles, the most abundant herbivore with which A. varians colonies cohabit fireweed stems, and of supplementing water availability to fireweed host plants, in spite of a significant effect of watering frequency on aphid growth in the greenhouse. There was no evidence of significant two- or three-way interactions among factors.

Within northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) offshore habitats, higher abundance of tropically associated lane snapper Lutjanus synagris is correlated with rising temperatures. Increased presence of juvenile and adult lane snapper could result in important competitive interactions with nGOM reef fishes, such as economically important red snapper L. campechanus, at multiple life stages and cause shifts in resource utilization and species composition of offshore fish assemblages. We investigated interactions between adult and juvenile lane and red snapper within experimental mesocosms. Although no significant effects on prey consumption were observed, interspecific competition between adults and juveniles was strongest, as adult lane snapper utilized habitats at higher rates than single juvenile red snapper in interaction trials. Additionally, adult red snapper most strongly displaced single juvenile lane snapper and increased their swimming activities in the presence of heterospecific juveniles. Adult red snapper also aggressively chased juvenile lane snapper and displaced them from habitats. However, less pronounced effects were observed for grouped juveniles in the presence of adults, especially juvenile red snapper, while adult lane snapper swam less in the presence of grouped juvenile lane and red snapper. Additionally, single juvenile red snapper swimming activities and prey consumption in the presence of adult snappers did not significantly differ from control values. Therefore, at small scales adult lane snapper may partially displace single juvenile red snapper, but clusters of red and lane snapper juveniles may be resilient to competitive effects of adult lane snapper and exert partial competitive pressures on them. As expected, we found that elevated aggressiveness by larger individuals resulted in dominance in space occupancy in one-on-one interactions. These findings suggest that prior occupation of preferred hard bottom habitat may be a determining factor for grouped juvenile red snapper competing against similar sized or larger individuals. Overall, our results indicate varying competitive vulnerabilities of red snapper to climate-related range expansions of tropical congeners.","[Marshak, Anthony R.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Marshak, Anthony R.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Marshak, Anthony R.] ECS Fed LLC, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Sci & Technol, 1315 East West Highway,F-ST7, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","Marshak, AR (corresponding author), Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA.; Marshak, AR (corresponding author), Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA.; Marshak, AR (corresponding author), ECS Fed LLC, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Sci & Technol, 1315 East West Highway,F-ST7, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",tony.marshak@noaa.gov,,,Richard C.

Competition-defence trade-offs have long been thought to promote plant coexistence and increase species diversity. However, insights from modern coexistence theory clarify that such trade-offs alone cannot sustain coexistence. Coexistence also requires stabilising niche differences and the ability of competitor populations to persist under consumer pressure. Despite the breadth of potential consequences of competition-defence trade-offs, we have little mechanistic understanding of how they affect diversity in natural communities. 2. We investigated the effects of seed harvesting by ants on coexistence in an annual plant community. We parameterised a model of plant competitive population dynamics with data from two field experiments: (a) plant demographic rates and competition coefficients determined by growing plants alone and against intra- and interspecific competitor density gradients; (b) plant fitness losses to ant consumers determined by measuring seed removal from experimental depots. We tested for a trade-off between a plant species' demographic potential and its susceptibility to consumption and then determined the bounds of ant effects on pairwise and multispecies coexistence by comparing mod& projections with and without seed consumption. 3. Ants harvested seeds of all plant species, but they strongly preferred the competitively superior large seeded species, inducing a competition-defence trade-off. Unequal seed loss to ants changed competition-based fitness hierarchies, affecting both the number and identities of plant species pairs that were predicted to coexist compared to a scenario without ants. The trade-off most often prevented coexistence by severely disadvantaging the superior competitor or excluding species directly through overconsumption, and a simulated reduction in the overall consumption rate opened few additional opportunities for coexistence. Ant exacerbation of average fitness differences was particularly disruptive to multispecies coexistence, where niche differences were insufficient to stabilise the coexistence of plant triplets and quadruplets. 4. Synthesis. Our results show that the presence of a competition-defence trade-off in a community with stabilising niche differences does not always increase diversity. Instead, the full range of diversity outcomes-positive and negative changes in species number and changes in the identity of the dominant-are possible. Taken together, our results support the emerging paradigm that consumers have wide ranging impacts on plant diversity and suggest that variation in consumer pressure may be an important driver of large-scale diversity patterns.","[Petry, William K.; Levine, Jonathan M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kandlikar, Gaurav S.; Kraft, Nathan J.

In order to examine the relationships between the morphology of the prey-capture apparatus, its adhesive performance and the prey-capture success, we combined force measurements, morphological and behavioural investigations of representatives of 14 Central European species of this genus. The direct relationship between these traits was studied by using phylogenetic generalized least squares and a molecular phylogeny generated from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I partial sequences. Force measurements revealed strong interspecific differences in the adhesive forces generated during the predatory attack; these differences entail significant differences in the prey-capture success. The interspecific differences in adhesive performance were functionally correlated with the pad morphology and divergences in the compressive forces generated during the predatory strike. Allometric analyses revealed that the pad area scaled with positive allometry with respect to body size, whereas the adhesive forces scaled with negative allometry with respect to body size, that is, the pads' efficiency decreased with body size. Our experimental approach demonstrates a direct functional relationship between the morphology of the prey-capture device of Stenus beetles and its performance in a natural behavioural context.","[Koerner, Lars; Betz, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Dept Evolutionary Biol Invertebrates, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Morgenstelle 28, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Zsolt Garamszegi, Laszlo] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, C Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Heethoff, Michael] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany","Koerner, L (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Evolutionary Biol Invertebrates, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Morgenstelle 28, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",LarsKoerner3@hotmail.com,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015","Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183","German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [PAK 478: BE 2233/10-1]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) [CGL2015-70639-P]; National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) [K-115970]","We thank Karl-Heinz Hellmer and Monika Meinert for taking the scanning electron micrographs.

Playback experiments, currently limited to interactions involving group-living large carnivores, demonstrate that attending to cues indicative of the immediate presence of heterospecific competitors plays a substantial role in influencing competition among these species. Group-living species vocalize regularly to signal to one another, and competitors can readily eavesdrop on these acoustic cues. Solitary large carnivores also vocalize to conspecifics, but much less frequently, reducing the ease with which heterospecific competitors can eavesdrop. Eavesdropping could nonetheless play a substantive role in mediating competition among solitary large carnivores if the benefits of responding to the acoustic cues of heterospecific competitors (reducing risk or locating resources) are sufficiently large. Behavioral interactions between solitary large carnivore species are almost never observed, and there have been no experimental tests of their reactions to cues indicative of the immediate presence of other solitary large carnivores. We used an automated playback system to test the responses of a solitary large carnivore (black bear, Ursus americanus) to vocalizations of their similarly solitary competitor (cougar, Puma concolor), presenting both cougar and control vocalizations to free-living bears foraging along shorelines in British Columbia, Canada. Both mothers with cubs and solitary bears were significantly more likely to advance and vocalize toward cougar than control playbacks, mothers producing one or both of two distinct vocalizations and solitary bears producing just one. Cougars could either represent a potential risk to bears (particularly cubs), or a source of resources, as bears are known to regularly scavenge cougar kills. Our results are consistent with bears eavesdropping on cougars for both these reasons. As with group-living species, eavesdropping may be common among solitary large carnivores, and may be an important driver of competition between these species.","[Suraci, Justin P.; Clinchy, Michael; Roberts, Devin J.; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Suraci, Justin P.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC, Canada","Suraci, JP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",justin.suraci@gmail.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC),,40,1,1,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,SEP,2017,123,9,,,,,593,599,,10.1111/eth.12631,,,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FD9EB,WOS:000407824500002,,,,,2021-09-24,

In this paper we analysed the behavioural relationships between two species of crayfish, the native Astacus leptodactylus and the invasive Orconectes limosus in an ongoing invasion process in the Lower Danube, in Eastern Europe. We tested the species' ability to acquire shelter and food in laboratory experiments in both intra- and interspecific confrontations. The dominant behaviour of the invasive species is obvious even towards its own congeners, while the native species display a more tolerant conspecific behaviour. With respect to interspecific confrontation, the invasive crayfish males and females were inclined to sex-specific dominance regarding shelters. A roughly balanced behaviour was noted for intersexual confrontations. The results of this study also highlight that the occupancy of a shelter is more disputed than food resources, which appear to be opportunistically acquired. In the context of the current invasion process, we hypothesised that the effect caused by interference competition might lead to a decline of the native species. Further investigations may reveal if there is any hope for recovery of the native species.","[Lele, Sandra-Florina; Parvulescu, Lucian] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Biol Chem, Fac Chem Biol Geog, Timisoara 300115, Romania","Lele, SF (corresponding author), West Univ Timisoara, Dept Biol Chem, Fac Chem Biol Geog, Timisoara 300115, Romania.",sandra.lele@e-uvt.ro,"Lele, Sandra/M-1275-2015; Parvulescu, Lucian/A-1278-2012","Parvulescu, Lucian/0000-0002-1528-1429",Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation; CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0785],"This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0785.

Although these factors vary simultaneously in most systems, their interactive effects are poorly understood. Using artificial pond mesocosms and multiple prey types, we manipulated plant density (SHC: low, high) and inter-patch distance (FHC: short, long) in a full factorial design to test for potential interactive effects of these factors on competition and predation by a dragonfly larva (Anax junius) and fish predator (Lepomis cyanallus). When inter-patch distances (FHC) were short, A. junius consumed more amphipods (36% +/- 4.6%) compared with long treatments (19% +/- 4.8%). We detected no significant effects of plant density (SHC) on prey consumption by A. junius. There were significant interactive effects of FHC and SHC on Lepomis cyanellus consumption of amphipods and damselflies. The most counterintuitive of these effects was that sunfish consumed more larval damselflies at high plant density (64% +/- 6.0%) than at low plant density (38% +/- 8.6%) but only in short connection treatments. This interactive effect of SHC and FHC on damselfly predation by L. cyanellus was likely because damselflies exhibited riskier behavior at higher SHC. Prey consumption with both predators present was additive, but no significant effect of either SHC or FHC on interspecific predation was detected, suggesting compensatory foraging responses. Structural habitat complexity and FHC interactively influence predator foraging behavior in complex, non-intuitive ways that are highly dependent on the predator/prey combination in question. Structural habitat complexity and FHC are currently being influenced by anthropogenic factors in multiple ways (e.g., habitat loss, global climate change), and being able to predict the responses of biotic communities to these changes should be an important consideration in restoration and conservation efforts.","[Pitcher, Kristopher A.; Soluk, Daniel A.] Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA","Pitcher, KA (corresponding author), Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",kristopher.pitcher@usd.edu,,,University of South Dakota Foundation: Raymond D.

However, considerably more effort has been devoted into understanding the consequences of temporal rather than spatial variations in fruit crop for plant fitness. In order to simultaneously evaluate both components, we quantify fruit production and pre-dispersal damage by three arthropod species (mites, chalcid wasps and moths) in the Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) during 3 years in a spatially explicit context. Our aims were to assess (1) the interaction between fruit production and pre-dispersal fruit damage by arthropods, (2) the potential interference or competition between arthropods, and (3) the form of the phenotypic selection exerted by arthropods on fruit traits considering the spatial context. Arthropods damaged a substantial fraction of fruits produced by Spanish juniper with levels of damage showing sharp inter-annual variations. Fruit damage by mites was negatively related to yearly fruit crop and positively correlated at individual trees fruiting in consecutive years. Increased interspecific interference was an additional consequence of reduced fruit availability during small crop years. During a masting year, fruit damage by less mobile species such as mites was negatively affected by tree crop size, and no spatial structure was observed for mite damage. The incidence of chalcid wasps was low, so the spatial pattern of seed predation was unclear, and no preferences for fruit or seed traits were detected. Conversely, moths selected larger fruits and their incidence on trees was spatially aggregated up to 20 m, with predation levels being negatively affected by fruit abundance at the patch level, suggesting a positive density-dependent effect of neighbors on fruit output. These results highlight the importance of including the spatial component to understand complex species interactions at local scales.","[Mezquida, Eduardo T.] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Miguel Olano, Jose] Univ Valladolid, EU Ingn Agr, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Soria 42004, Spain","Mezquida, ET (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Darwin 2, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",eduardo.mezquida@uam.es,"Olano, Jose Miguel/K-7273-2014; Mendoza, Jose Miguel Olano/A-9250-2012","Olano, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-4526-5462; Mendoza, Jose Miguel Olano/0000-0002-4526-5462","Junta de Castilla y LeonJunta de Castilla y Leon [VA069A07, VA006A10-2]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of SpainSpanish Government [CGL2009-13190-C03-03]",We thank Cabrejas del Pinar Council for permission to work in its land and E.

Species may exhibit aggressive responses that are similar, or symmetrical, to each other, or one species may respond more aggressively than the other, exhibiting asymmetrical aggression. We examined aggressive symmetry in two territorial Caribbean damselfish species, the longfin damselfish (Stegastes diencaeous) and the dusky damselfish (S. adustus) because they exhibit qualities that make such relationships hard to predict. These two species show considerable habitat overlap, are closely related and are nearly identical in gross morphology, suggesting they would show the same intensity of aggressiveness to heterospecifics and conspecifics. However, longfins reach a larger adult size, which may cause these two species to instead aggress asymmetrically toward one another. We also tested residents' responses toward bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a common egg predator, to see if highly similar species respond similarly to a presumably equal threat not likely to be misidentified as a conspecific. We presented residents with either a single intruder or two simultaneous intruders to determine if context affected aggressive behavior. When presented with a single intruder, both resident species attacked conspecifics and congenerics with somewhat similar aggression, suggesting either a broad competitive overlap or misidentification. When residents were forced to divide their time between two simultaneous damselfish intruders, they clearly aggressed more intensely toward conspecifics. Additionally, longfins were more aggressive to bluehead wrasse than were dusky damselfish in single and paired presentations. We propose that the higher aggression toward wrasse by longfins is related to longfins having territories on which their eggs are naturally more exposed compared to a typical dusky territory in which eggs are more hidden.","[Little, K.; Itzkowitz, M.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Draud, M.] Long Isl Univ, Dept Biol, Brookville, NY 11548 USA","Little, K (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",kpl208@lehigh.edu,,,,,,48,6,6,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

Intraguild prey may evolve antipredator defenses, superior competitive ability on shared resources, or the ability to use an alternative resource, any of which may alter the structure of the food web. We tested for evolutionary responses by threespine stickleback to a benthic intraguild predator, prickly sculpin. We used a comparative morphometric analysis to show that stickleback sympatric with sculpin are more armored and have more limnetic-like body shapes than allopatric stickleback. To test the ecological implications of this shift, we conducted a mesocosm experiment that varied sculpin presence and stickleback population of origin (from one sympatric and one allopatric lake). Predation by sculpin greatly increased the mortality of allopatric stickleback. In contrast, sculpin presence did not affect the mortality of sympatric stickleback, although they did have lower growth rates suggesting increased nonpredatory effects of sculpin. Consistent with their morphology, sympatric stickleback included more pelagic prey in their diets, leading to depletion of zooplankton in the mesocosms. These findings suggest that intraguild prey evolution has altered food web structure by reducing both predation by the intraguild predator and diet overlap between species.","[Ingram, Travis; Svanbaeck, Richard; Kratina, Pavel; Southcott, Laura; Schluter, Dolph] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ingram, Travis; Svanbaeck, Richard; Kraft, Nathan J.

The barred owl (Strix varia), a species historically restricted to eastern North America, has recently expanded its range to completely overlap that of the northern spotted owl. Recent evidence suggests that barred owls may compete with northern spotted owls and may be one cause for recent declines in some northern spotted owl populations. Our focus was to examine whether barred owls have the potential to competitively exclude northern spotted owls from their territories through interference competition. We used a playback experiment to quantify aggressive vocal and physical behavior of barred and northern spotted owls during territorial defense. Experimental trials consisted of displaying northern spotted or barred owl taxidermy mounts, and broadcasting recorded vocalizations of the corresponding species, in both barred and northern spotted owl territories. The frequency of interspecific interactions was lower compared to intraspecific interactions between northern spotted owls alone. However, barred owls responded with higher levels of vocal and physical aggression than did northern spotted owls when agonistic interspecific interactions occurred. Our results suggest that barred owls are likely to assume the dominant role during interspecific interactions with northern spotted owls. Thus, interference competition is a plausible mechanism by which barred owls could contribute to observed population declines of northern spotted owls in areas where the species co-occur.

C. granosus dispersed slightly from aggregation when foraging whereas S. lessoni foraged in tight conspecific aggregations. Foraging excursions varied from over 60 cm in F. crassa to less than 7 cm in S. araucana. Homing behavior ranged from extreme fidelity in F. crassa to low fidelity in S. lessoni. Positive associations were observed between C. granosus and F. crassa during resting and foraging whereas negative associations were observed between these species and S. lessoni. These general patterns varied little between 2 sites separated by a few kilometers. Interspecific competition might be important in structuring this guild, but it may affect only some species pairs. Direct interference in the use of shelter or while foraging, rather than food exploitation, seems the most likely mechanism. The marked differences in individual behavior among species, despite ample diet overlap, might translate into different functional effects, which should be explored in future experiments.","[Aguilera, Moises A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Las Cruces, Chile; [Aguilera, Moises A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile; [Aguilera, Moises A.] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, CEAZA, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile","Aguilera, MA (corresponding author), Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Las Cruces, Chile.",moises.aguilera@ceaza.cl,"Aguilera, Moises/AAC-2981-2020; Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013","Aguilera, Moises/0000-0002-3517-6255; ",Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Andrew Mellon Foundation; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1070335]; Fondap FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYTCONICYT FONDAP [15001-001],"We greatly appreciate comments by B.

The leaf beetle, Chrysomela lapponica, originally uses the salicyl glucosides (SGs) of its host plants to sequester salicylaldehyde, which serves as a defence against generalist enemies but attracts specialist enemies. However, some populations of C. lapponica have shifted to SG-poor hosts, and their secretions do not contain salicylaldehyde. 2. In was suggested that beetles shift to SG-poor hosts to escape from specialist enemies. To test this hypothesis, we compared field mortality between two populations of C. lapponica that were associated with SG-rich willow, Salix myrsinifolia (Kola Peninsula and Finland) and two populations that fed on SG-poor willows, S. glauca (Ural) and S. caprea (Belarus). 3. Mortality from generalist enemies was significantly higher in Belarus than in three other populations, whereas mortality from specialists did not differ among populations. A specialist predator (syrphid fly larvae, Parasyrphus nigritarsis) and specialist parasitoids (phorid flies, Megaselia spp.) were attracted to the secretions of larvae reared on both SG-rich and SG-poor hosts. 4. Feeding on leaves of S. caprea and S. myrsinifolia both previously damaged by leaf puncturing and by the larvae of potentially competing species Chrysomela vigintipunctata, decreased the weight and prolonged the development of C. lapponica. 5. Thus, populations of C. lapponica that have shifted to SG-poor willow species did not obtain enemy-free space because specialist enemies have developed adaptations to herbivores that switched to a novel host plant. We suggest that in some populations host plant shift was favoured by interspecific competition with the early season SG-using specialist, C. vigintipunctata.","[Zvereva, Elena L.; Kozlov, Mikhail V.] Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Kruglova, Oksana Yu] Univ Belarus, Fac Biol, Minsk, BELARUS","Zvereva, EL (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",elezve@utu.fi,"Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013; Zvereva, Elena L./M-8490-2016","Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244; Zvereva, Elena L./0000-0003-2934-3421",Maj and Tor Nessling foundation; ECEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [EVK2-2002-00169]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [122133],"We thank V.

We studied how predatory fish affect subsurface sediment use by spiny- and smooth-shelled morphs of the mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, on New Zealand's South Island. Spines reduce consumption risk by small benthic fishes (e.g., bullies [Gobiomorphus spp.]). Thus, we predicted that spiny morphs would be more likely to use sediment surfaces with relatively high algal food supplies than the more vulnerable smooth morphs when exposed to fish predators. Epi- and endobenthic samples from 5 streams with fish showed that similar to 80% of snails typically were retrieved from subsurface sediments, whereas only 33% of snails from fishless Jackson's Creek occurred in subsurface sediments. A laboratory experiment revealed that significantly more snails used subsurface sediments when with common bullies (G. cotidianus) than when without. Subsurface sediment use in the presence of bullies was similar between shell morphs, a result suggesting that use of spatial refugia might be a more important predator defense than shell armature for Potamopyrgus. Regardless of fish presence, more spiny than smooth morphs burrowed into sand, but subsurface use did not differ between shell morphs in cobbles and gravel. Fewer snails were active on rock surfaces at night than during the day in a stream run, apparently to reduce encounters with nocturnally hunting bullies and shortfinned eels (Anguilla australis). Our results suggest that if fish predation pressure were reduced, then surface densities of Potamopyrgus would increase significantly. Given the snail's superior competitive abilities, this increase could alter top-down and bottom-up effects in food chains and threaten local biodiversity.","[Holomuzki, Joseph R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Mansfield, OH 44906 USA; [Lowe, Rex L.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Biggs, Barry J.

According to Elton's biodiversity and invasibility hypothesis, non-native species must be competitively superior to the resident species in order to successfully invade. An invader that is ecologically similar to a native species may cause intense interspecific competition as they both require the same resource. Furthermore, an increase in the density of an invading competitor may enhance the intensity of the competitive interaction, however, this may be reduced if the inferior competitor has a refuge that reduces the amount of time it is in direct contact with the superior competitor. In laboratory-based competition experiments between the non-native caprellid Caprella mutica and two ecologically similar native caprellids Caprella linearis and Pseudoprotella phasma, C. mutica successfully displaced both species from homogeneous artificial habitat patches after 48 hours. Patches that contained a refuge reduced the number of C. linearis being displaced but only when C. mutica was at a low density. Potentially aggressive interactions between C. mutica and the native C. linearis may have caused C. linearis to be displaced from the patches and could have caused significantly higher mortality of C. linearis compared to the controls. This is the first study to show that the non-native C. mutica has the ability to displace ecologically similar native species when the resource space is limited and when the density of C. mutica was significantly (10 times) lower than the density of C. linearis.","[Shucksmith, Richard; Cook, Elizabeth J.; Hughes, David J.; Burrows, Michael T.] Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland","Shucksmith, R (corresponding author), Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",rshucksmith@gmail.com,"Burrows, Michael/ABF-4844-2020","Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899; Cottier-Cook, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1466-6802",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Esmee Fairbarin Foundation Marine Aliens Programme,We would like to thank the anonymous referees for their comments that helped to improve the manuscript.

The propensity of the newly-established mosquito Aedes japonicus to inhabit rock pools throughout the eastern United States provides a natural setting for interspecific larval competition with the native Aedes atropalpus. A laboratory experiment conducted in simulated rock pools to evaluate larval interactions between and within these two species suggested that the performance of both species was more significantly impacted by intraspecific conditions than interspecific conditions of the same mosquito density. Aedes atropalpus was apparently more sensitive to larval densities than Ae. japonicus because it reproduces autogenously, requiring a lengthened period of larval development to obtain nutrient reserves for egg development, which may ultimately put Ae. atropalpus at a disadvantage under larval conditions of competition and limited resources. Excessively stressful experimental conditions, as evidenced by reduced body size, and thus fecundity and estimated finite rate of increase, may have obscured the effects of larval competition between these species. The impact of larval competition between these species in rock pool communities warrants further investigation under more ecologically realistic experimental conditions.

These studies provide a new theoretical framework for explaining resource partitioning patterns among African ungulates that coexist in spatially heterogeneous savanna grasslands. According to these studies, different-sized ungulates can coexist because larger species forage at a coarser scale but can tolerate lower quality food, whereas smaller species need higher quality food but forage at a finer scale. To test this hypothesis in an African savanna, we created an experimental mosaic with variation in grain ( spatial detail) and quality of short-grass patches and directly observed the visitation of naturally occurring grazers to this mosaic over a two-year period ( total of 903 observation hours). Of the seven species that visited our experiment, warthog, impala, zebra, and white rhino visited long enough to allow data analysis. We showed that warthog and impala avoided plots with a finer grain of short grass and that warthog preferred fertilized plots to unfertilized plots. Zebra and white rhino did not avoid the finer grain plots. Our results suggest that differences in grain and quality of a resource might indeed contribute to partitioning of this resource by savanna ungulates. Although four focal species is unusually high for an experimental study on resource partitioning among naturally occurring savanna ungulates, this number is too low to evaluate the allometric basis of our hypothesis. Our results, however, encourage wider experimental testing of the role of spatial heterogeneity in facilitating the coexistence of potentially competing savanna herbivores.","Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Cromsigt, JPGM (corresponding author), Van Speykstr 40, NL-9726 BN Groningen, Netherlands.",jcromsigt@hotmail.com,"Olff, Han/A-8516-2008","Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576; Cromsigt, Joris/0000-0002-8632-9469",,,,38,78,80,0,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2006,87,6,,,,,1532,1541,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1532:RPASGM]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,058IJ,WOS:000238658400022,16869429,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

The leeches, Erpobdella octoculata, Glossiphonia complattata and Helobdella stagnalis, and their prey were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic, English lake. 2. Five separate manipulations were performed: the addition of tubificid oligochaetes, the addition of snails, the increase in numbers of G. complanata and H. stagnalis, the increase in numbers of E. octoculata, and the reduction in numbers of all three leech species. All invertebrates were sampled, using trays buried in the substratum, in early March, prior to leech reproduction, in July and in late October/early November when breeding had ceased. Leech manipulations were executed immediately after the first sampling of invertebrates, when food addition, at fortnightly intervals, also commenced. 3. The addition of tubificids resulted in significantly greater numbers and biomasses of E. octoculata and H. stagnalis in the experimental compared to the control sites in the autumn sample, i.e. after breeding. The same was true for G. complanata when snails were added. When the numbers of leeches were either decreased or increased, no significant differences in numbers or biomass of the manipulated species were obtained in the autumn. 4. Elevation or readjustment of leech numbers appeared to be achieved through changes in juvenile mortality and to a lesser extent through fecundity. 5. Current results, together with previous findings, provide evidence for food limitation, with a high mortality of recruited young (up to 98%) which is linked to food supply. There is also some evidence for interspecific competition for food, though the occurrence of food refuges, the temporal separation of breeding peaks, and differences in feeding behaviour, involving body size and foraging strategies, between the glossiphoniids reduce the intensity of interactions.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

In Bolinas Lagoon, in central California, the site of this study, at least 15 species of trematodes infect snail populations. This study investigated patterns of interspecific association and interaction among members of this parasite guild. Seven to 19 host subpopulations were sampled annually at each of two sites in the lagoon from 1981 to 1988. Mixed-species infections constituted only 2.5% of the 5025 infections examined in the study. A Monte Carlo simulation procedure demonstrated that the numbers of such infections were often less than would be expected by chance, especially when the overall prevalence of infection was high. Patterns of association between particular pairs of species depended on whether the species' life histories include redial or only sporocyst larvae. Species that develop as rediae were predominantly negatively associated with other redial species and with most species that develop only as sporocysts. There was weak evidence of positive interspecific association between a few redial and sporocyst-only species, while members of other such pairs were distributed independently. Associations between sporocyst-only species were either weakly positive or neutral. Snails carrying known infections were marked, released, and recaptured at both study sites. During their exposure in the field, some initial infections were invaded by another parasite species that often excluded the first parasite. The vulnerability of a parasite species to invasion and replacement by another differed among the tested species. Infections of the largest redial species, Parorchis acanthus, were especially resistant to replacement, while those of the smallest redial species, Euhaplorchis californiensis, were the most frequently excluded. Four other species were invaded or replaced at intermediate rates. The two largest redial species, P. acanthus and Himasthla rhigedana, were responsible for >90% of the invasions or exclusions. Direct observations showed that the rediae of these species prey on the larval stages of other species, as do the rediae of Echinoparyphium sp. This direct form of interspecific antagonism is probably the primary mechanism by which such species exclude others from host snails, as has been widely demonstrated in similar freshwater snail-trematode systems. While hierarchical, negative interactions prevent the coexistence of species at the level of the individual host, the mark-recapture study showed that rates of exclusion are low for most subordinate species, with the exception of Euhaplorchis californiensis. At the level of the host subpopulation, the assemblage of larval trematodes is diverse, and its composition is temporally and spatially variable. There is no trend toward dominance of the assemblage by large redial species as the level of infection rises within aging cohorts or subpopulations of hosts. These patterns of guild structure within host cohorts and subpopulations are consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment processes rather than interspecific interactions primarily determine the composition and relative abundance of species at this regional level. Several characteristics of snail-trematode systems that may promote regional coexistence of such a large number of potentially interacting parasite species are the isolated and subdivided nature of the host resource, the aggregated distributions of larval stages, and the differential exploitation of different-sized hosts. Many features of this system are consistent with Price's (1980) non-equilibrial view of parasite communities.",,"SOUSA, WP (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,122,115,116,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

This was done to test the hypothesis that the effects of interspecific competition would decline along gradients as the amount of nutrients decreased and the degree of disturbance increased. Nutrients and disturbance, alone and in interaction, produced significant effects on percent cover of all species, and all species achieved maximum percent cover in the undisturbed regime. The experimental design permitted us to distinguish between percent cover reductions caused directly by nutrients and disturbance from those caused by interspecific competition. When grown in mixture, interspecific competition produced marked changes in the distribution patterns of percent cover that were in addition to the direct impacts of nutrients and disturbance. The absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was greatest in the undisturbed regime, and for many mixtures this competitive effect was significantly reduced or even eliminated in the highly disturbed areas. Along the nutrient gradient the responses were variable and neighbor dependent, but for all species, the absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was generally most severe where percent cover in pure stands was highest. When the data were standardized for differences in percent cover in pure stands and competition was assessed as the percent reduction in percent cover between pure and mixed stands, then the effect of interspecific competition on Trifolium declined along both gradients. The three grasses had a reasonably constant competitive effect across the disturbance gradient, but along the nutrient gradient the highest competitive effects were generally achieved where percent cover in pure stands was highest. We argue that this standardized index is less appropriate because it obscures the obvious differences in interspecific competition effects that are clearly operating within these communities.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT FOREST SCI, VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4, BC, CANADA","TURKINGTON, R (corresponding author), UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT BOT, VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4, BC, CANADA.",,,,,,,41,88,89,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1993,74,3,,,,,863,878,,10.2307/1940812,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KU399,WOS:A1993KU39900020,,,,,2021-09-24,

In this study, we analysed the alarm call system of lesser spot-nosed monkeys, a primate that spends most of its time in mixed-species groups while occupying the lowest and presumably most dangerous part of the forest canopy. In contrast to other primate species, we found no evidence for predator-specific alarm calls. Instead, males gave one general alarm call type ('kroo') to three main dangers (i.e., crowned eagles, leopards and falling trees) and a second call type ('tcha-kow') as a coordinated response to calls produced in non-predatory contexts ('boom') by associated male Campbell's monkeys. Production of 'kroo' calls was also strongly affected by the alarm calling behaviour of male Campbell's monkeys, suggesting that male lesser spot-nosed monkeys adjust their alarm call production to another species' vocal behaviour. We discuss different hypotheses for this unusual phenomenon and propose that high predation pressure can lead to reliance on other species vocal behaviour to minimise predation. Significance statement Predation can lead to the evolution of acoustically distinct, predator-specific alarm calls. However, there are occasional reports of species lacking such abilities, despite diverse predation pressure, suggesting that evolutionary mechanisms are more complex. We conducted field experiments to systematically describe the alarm calling behaviour of lesser spot-nosed monkeys, an arboreal primate living in the lower forest strata where pressure from different predators is high. We found evidence for two acoustically distinct calls but, contrary to other primates in the same habitat, no evidence for predator-specific alarms. Instead, callers produced one alarm call type ('kroo') to all predator classes and another call type ('tcha-kow') to non-predatory dangers, but only as a response to a specific vocalisation of Campbell's monkeys ('boom'). The production of both calls was affected by the calling behaviour of Campbell's monkeys, suggesting that lesser spot-nosed monkey vocal behaviour is dependent on the antipredator behaviour of other species. Our study advances the theory of interspecies interactions and evolution of alarm calls.","[Le Floch, Auriane; Bouchard, Alice; Gallot, Quentin; Zuberbuhler, Klaus] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Zuberbuhler, Klaus] Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol & Neurosci, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland","Le Floch, A (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Neuchatel, Switzerland.",aurianelefloch@me.com,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X","Universite de Neuchatel; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [310030_185324, 31003A_166458]; Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire; University of Neuchatel; `NCCR Evolving Language', Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [51NF40_180888]","Open Access funding provided by Universite de Neuchatel.

Larval amphibians are concurrently exposed to biological stressors, such as competition and predation, as they often co-occur in diverse, multi-species assemblages. Thus, to accurately predict species' response to climate change, we empirically tested the interaction between a biotic and abiotic driver. We focused on three amphibian species that overlap in distribution and phenology across high elevations of the Cascade Mountain Range of the U.S. Pacific Northwest: the Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla), Cascades frog (Rana cascadae), and Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas). Amphibians in this region are threatened by drought-induced habitat loss resulting from the shortened hydroperiod and, in some areas, complete elimination of seasonal wetlands. We conducted a fully factorial experiment to determine the interactive effects of competition and drying on amphibian growth, development, and survival. We found that the impact of drying on each species was largely dependent upon interspecific competition dynamics. Competitive interactions, particularly in the three-species competition treatment, exacerbated the effects of drying, with both competition- and context-dependent responses to these stressors. Through an analysis of species-level effects, as well as an examination of secondary productivity (i.e., total biomass across treatments), we determined that Cascades frogs are the dominant competitor in this system owing to their larger body size and relative ability to withstand the stress of a rapidly drying hydroperiod. Our results suggest that ignoring biotic interactions in predictions of species response to climate change factors may be misleading.","[Thurman, Lindsey L.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, 2327 Univ Way 2, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Thurman, Lindsey L.; Garcia, Tiffany S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97300 USA","Thurman, LL (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, 2327 Univ Way 2, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.; Thurman, LL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97300 USA.",lthurman@usgs.gov,"Thurman, Lindsey/AAF-7056-2020",,Department of the Interior Northwest Climate Science Center Graduate Fellowship,"We would like to thank S.

Determining the nature and strength of these interactions is integral to understanding why some aliens are suppressed and others become highly invasive pests. For introduced terrestrial plants, seed and seedling interactions with native biota are crucial, because most nascent populations start from seed. Herein, we explored interactions between native generalist rodent and bird consumers and seeds of the invasive wild cucumber Echinocystis lobata by conducting seed-offering experiments in Poland. We also evaluated how interspecific competition from native plants and intraspecific competition from clustering of E. lobata seed (clustering resembling consumer seed caching) affected survival of seedlings and young plants. Native consumers interacted strongly with E. lobata seeds, with rodents removing 98% of seeds from ground locations and birds removing 24% of elevated seeds. Camera and live traps indicated that striped field mice Apodemus agrarius were the predominant rodent removing seeds. Camera traps and visual observations indicated that great tits Parus major and European jays Garrulus glandarius were the primary bird species removing elevated seeds. While some level of seed removal was likely attributable to seed predation, as indicated by seed coat remains, we also observed evidence that rodents may cache E. lobata seeds and Garrulus glandarius are known to cache and disperse seeds. Monitoring of seedlings indicated that increasing cover of native plants and clustering of E. lobata seedlings both reduced survival of seedlings and young plants due to inter- and intraspecific competition, respectively. Hence, caching by generalist consumers may disperse E. lobata seeds, which are heavy and lack dispersal adaptations, but such caching may also reduce individual seedling survival rates. Fully understanding invasion success of the E. lobata will require evaluating the net effects of generalist consumers on its recruitment and dispersal.","[Dylewski, Lukasz; Myczko, Lukasz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Dylewski, Lukasz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Dylewski, L (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.; Dylewski, L (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",ldylewski@man.poznan.pl,"Dylewski, Lukasz/AAM-4073-2021","Dylewski, Lukasz/0000-0002-1370-7625; Myczko, Lukasz/0000-0002-9305-2306","National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2018/28/T/NZ8/00264]","We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Core processes operating at local scales, such as species-environment matching and species interactions, shape observed assemblages. Artificial habitats (simplified structure) are useful systems for assessing the main factors affecting community composition and disentangling their assembly rules. Drinking troughs (brickwork tanks for free-ranging cattle watering) are widespread in Italy and represent a suitable aquatic habitat for colonization by various aquatic organisms. Dragonflies larvae are usually found in drinking troughs and often exhibit strong species interactions and striking community assembly patterns. Our primary aim was to search for Odonata communities exhibiting non-random cooccurrence/segregation patterns in drinking troughs. We performed null-model analyses by measuring a co-occurrence index (C-score) on larval Odonata assemblages (13 species from 28 distinct troughs). Overall, we found a non-random structure for the studied dragonfly assemblages, which, given their fast generation time, must have been generated by short-term ecological processes (i.e. interspecific interactions). We thus analyzed potential competition/predation among and within ecological guilds. From the field data, we speculated that interactions within the sprawlers' guild is likely among the main drivers structuring the studied assemblages, especially the effect of intraguild predation between C. erythraea and Sympetrum spp larval stages. We then experimentally tested these interactions in laboratory and demonstrated that intraguild predation among larvae at different development stages may result in an effective exclusion/negative impact on density pattern, representing one of the processes to take into consideration when studying dragonfly assemblages.","[Cerini, Francesco; Bologna, Marco A.; Vignoli, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi, Rome, Italy","Vignoli, L (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi, Rome, Italy.",leonardo.vignoli@uniroma3.it,"Vignoli, Leonardo/F-2663-2011; Cerini, Francesco/AAO-8613-2020","Vignoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1599-092X; Cerini, Francesco/0000-0002-1367-1239","Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza) [COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016]","The Grant to the Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, ARTICOLO 1, COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016) is gratefully acknowledged.",,42,8,8,1,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 21,2019,14,6,,,,,,,e0214127,10.1371/journal.pone.0214127,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,IW3PT,WOS:000484894700003,31226119,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-24,

Due to the resource allocation to defence, decreased feeding and higher stress, the costs of predator NCEs can be considerable. Therefore, the resistance to NCEs may be crucial for population growth and interspecific competition. We tested the resistance of Ponto-Caspian gammarids Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides to NCEs imposed by their predator, the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus. As D. villosus is often avoided by predators in the presence of alternative food, we hypothesised that it would bear lower behavioural and physiological costs of anti-predator responses. We tested gammarid feeding in short-time experiments (2-4 h) with food (chironomid larvae) located at various distances from the stony shelter (to enforce food searching, Experiment I) or in the direct gammarid proximity (no searching needed, Experiment II). Moreover, we checked the predator effect on gammarid growth in a 2-week Experiment III. Both gammarids exposed to predators reduced feeding efficiency outside the shelter (Experiment I). Contrary to our expectations, the response of D. villosus was stronger. When food was provided in their direct proximity (Experiment II), the feeding of both species was unaffected by predators, indicating that a shelter supplied with food can reduce predator NCEs. The growth of P. robustoides was reduced in the presence of predators (Experiment III), whereas that of D. villosus was unaffected. Although D. villosus has a more effective defence strategy than P. robustoides, it bears similar or even higher behavioural costs of NCEs. However, it exhibits the higher resistance to the long-term predator presence, sustaining its growth rate under such conditions. This may be one of the factors contributing to the great invasion success of D. villosus, currently taking place in European fresh waters.","[Jermacz, Lukasz; Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland","Jermacz, L (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland.",lukasjermacz@gmail.com,"Jermacz, Lukasz/B-8728-2017; Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013","Jermacz, Lukasz/0000-0001-9182-116X; Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240","grant of the National Science Centre, Poland [2016/21/B/NZ8/00418]","Our study was supported by the grant of the National Science Centre, Poland No. 2016/21/B/NZ8/00418.",,64,12,12,4,31,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 3,2017,12,8,,,,,,,e0182481,10.1371/journal.pone.0182481,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,FC5AR,WOS:000406853600120,28771578,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-24,

Previous work on metacommunity dynamics of competing species has shown that sorting by habitat patch type and spatial patterning can be affected by disturbances. Microcosms offer a useful model system to test the effect of multi-trophic interactions and disturbance on metacommunity dynamics. Here, we investigated the potential role of predators in enhancing or disrupting sorting and spatial pattern among prey in experimental landscapes. We exposed multi-trophic protist microcosm landscapes with one predator, two competing prey, two patch resource types, and localized dispersal to three disturbance regimes (none, low, and high). Then, we used variation partitioning and spatial clustering analysis to analyse the results. In contrast with previous experiments that did not manipulate predators, we found that patch type did not structure prey communities very well. Instead, we found that it was the distribution of the predator that most strongly predicted the composition of the prey community. The predator impacted species sorting by (1) preferentially consuming one prey, thereby acting as a strong local environmental driver, and by (2) indirectly magnifying the impact of patch food resources on the less preferred prey. The predator also enhanced spatial signal in the prey community because of its limited dispersal. Our results indicate that predators can strongly influence prey species sorting and spatial patterning in metacommunities in ways that would otherwise be attributed to stochastic effects, such as dispersal limitation or demographic drift. Therefore, whenever possible, predators should be explicitly included as separate explanatory factors in variation partitioning analyses.","[Livingston, George; Fukumori, Kayoko; Kawachi, Masanobu; Takamura, Noriko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosystem Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Provete, Diogo B.] Univ Fed Goias, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, Dept Ecol, Inst Biol Sci, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Leibold, Mathew A.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Integrat Biol, 1 Univ Stn C0930, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Livingston, George] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Livingston, G (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosystem Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.; Livingston, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",glivingston@utexas.edu,"Provete, Diogo B./B-3704-2008","Provete, Diogo B./0000-0002-0097-0651","CAPES-DSCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CAPES-PDSECoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [18641-12-1]; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2016/13949-7]; NSF EAPSI FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSF DDIG (DEB) [1311032]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan [S-9]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16J40021] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Lin Jiang and T.

To determine how H. axyridis interacts with C. novemnotata via intraguild predation and competition for prey, we paired first-instar C. novemnotata with first-instar H. axyridis at low and high densities of pea aphid. Coccinella novemnotata survival when paired interspecifically was significantly lower than H. axyridis survival at both aphid densities. Both species had similar weights at eclosion across aphid densities; however, H. axyridis developed faster than C. novemnotata. To examine the effect of larval size on intraguild interactions, we conducted a second experiment where we varied the C. novemnotata and H. axyridis instar in our pairings. Coccinella novemnotata survival and final weight increased when paired with younger H. axyridis larvae.

T. absoluta is an important pest of tomato crops worldwide, and its management could be improved by understanding the competitive interactions and potential coexistence between these two parasitoids. Firstly, a 15-min fixed time laboratory test evaluated the host-searching ability of adult D. phthorimaeae and P. dignus wasps on T. absoluta larvae. Secondly, D. phthorimaeae host discrimination against endoparasitized and non-endoparasitized hosts by P. dignus, at different adult female ages, was experimentally examined. D. phthorimaeae wasps spent significantly more time in general searching in the presence of its competitor than in its absence, but, parasitism was only effective by P. dignus. Older D. phthorimaeae wasps discriminated significantly less than young wasps between T. absoluta larvae parasitized and unparasitized by P. dignus, and an interaction took place by non-concurrent host-feeding. Intra-guild predation of P. dignus larvae by D. phthorimaeae female feeding behaviour might have a minor effect in this system. Results are discussed in the context of literature supporting diverse evidence of coexistence in other parasitoid-host systems, with implications for T. absoluta biological control.","[Savino, V.; Coviella, C.

Nonetheless, most research has focused on the role of shared parasites as mediators of interspecific competition. Here, we explore the relative effects of Gyrodactylus specialist ectoparasites of Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata on competition between their host and juveniles of the killifish Rivulus hartii. In mesocosms that replicate natural streams, we exposed guppies to only competitors, to only parasites, to both parasites and competitors, or the absence of both. Consistent with previous studies, we found that female guppies grew significantly less where only Gyrodactylus were present, and this was regardless of infection status or parasite load. Surprisingly, this effect of Gyrodactylus on the growth of female guppies was greatly reduced when both parasites and competitors were present in the mesocosms. We conclude that guppies can mediate the effects of Gyrodactylus on competition with Rivulus, by adaptively fine-tuning their phenotype when simultaneously facing multiple enemies.","[Perez-Jvostov, Felipe; Scott, Marilyn E.] McGill Univ, Inst Parasitol, 21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Perez-Jvostov, Felipe; Scott, Marilyn E.] McGill Univ, Ctr Host Parasite Interact, 21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Hendry, Andrew P.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Fussmann, Gregor F.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Perez-Jvostov, F (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Inst Parasitol, 21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.; Perez-Jvostov, F (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Ctr Host Parasite Interact, 21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",felipe.perezjvostov@mail.mcgill.ca,,"Fussmann, Gregor/0000-0001-9576-0122",,,,58,5,5,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2016,125,6,,,,,790,796,,10.1111/oik.02499,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DN6UM,WOS:000377212000005,,,,,2021-09-24,

Most demonstrations of the impacts of size variation in trophic systems have focused on size variation in predator species, and the consequences of size variation in prey species are less well understood. We investigated how prey size structure shapes intra- and interspecific interactions in experiments with a gape-limited predator (larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus) and its heterospecific prey (frog tadpoles, Rana pirica). We found that large and small tadpole size groups each increased mortality in the other group by intensifying salamander predation; this type of indirect interactions is called apparent competition. The antagonistic impacts on the prey size groups were caused by different size-specific mechanisms. By consuming small tadpoles, the salamanders grew large enough to consume large tadpoles. The activity of large tadpoles, by increasing the activity of the small tadpoles, may increase the number of encounters with the predator and thus small tadpole mortality. These results suggest that the magnitude of a predator's ecological role, such as whether a top-down trophic cascade is initiated, depends on size variation in its heterospecific prey.","[Yamaguchi, Aya] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Aya; Kishida, Osamu] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan","Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.; Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.",cryamaguchi.514@gmail.com,"Kishida, Osamu/B-7970-2011",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24370004]","We are very grateful to Noboru Katayama, Kunio Takatsu, Megumi Nosaka, Tomoko Sato and Natsuko Sakai for outstanding support during our experiments.

However, the possibility of early piscivory is assumed to depend on the hatch timing of the prey and predator. Two species, bream (2006) and roach (2007), were tested as the prey fish. The bream (hatching 12days after perch) were preyed upon by the perch, leading to the predicted development of two sizes of cohorts as well as to cannibalism. With roach (hatching simultaneously with perch), however, no piscivory or cannibalism occurred and the perch population was unimodally distributed. The results of this experimental pond study underpin recent theoretical findings that size differences between predator and prey, determined through differences in the timing of hatching as well as differences in juvenile growth rates, foster the occurrence of early piscivory in YOY perch that may lead to bimodality and finally to intra-cohort cannibalism.","[Heermann, L.; Borcherding, J.] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-46459 Rees Grietherbusch, Germany","Heermann, L (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Gen Ecol & Limnol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-46459 Rees Grietherbusch, Germany.",lisa.heermann@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG BO 1507/5-1, DFG BO 1507/5-2]","Our thanks go to all helping hands in the field and to three anonymous referees for their suggestions that helped to improve the manuscript substantially.

Recent laboratory studies have reached opposite conclusions regarding the dominance relationship between these species, even documenting a reversal of roles as predator and prey. Interestingly, these contradicting results involved crab populations from different regions in Atlantic Canada (St. George's Bay in the Northumberland Strait and Passamaquoddy Bay in the Bay of Fundy), which are genetically different and presumed to be the result of different invasion events. In this study we housed juvenile lobsters and adult green crabs together in 3-m diameter flow-through tanks, and monitored their mortality, growth and behaviour from September through December 2009. The experiment involved five treatments, three experimental treatments with 2.5 lobsters/m(2) housed with an equal density of green crabs from one of three regions (Passamaquoddy Bay, St. George's Bay or Chedabucto Bay on the Scotian Shelf) and two control treatments with lobsters alone stocked at either 2.5 or 5 individuals/m(2). Chedabucto Bay was chosen as a third region as crabs there are genetically similar to conspecifics in St. George's Bay, but experience environmental conditions more similar to Passamaquoddy Bay. Green crabs had a significant and negative impact on lobster survival during the experiment, and the magnitude of this impact varied in relation to the green crabs' geographic origin, as mortality was significantly higher for lobsters paired with St. George's Bay and Chedabucto Bay crabs than Passamaquoddy Bay crabs. These differences in lobster mortality patterns lead to two important conclusions. First, the greater predatory impact of green crabs from St. George's Bay relative to Passamaquoddy Bay is consistent with the contrasting results recently reported in the literature, suggesting that these are of biological significance and not simply the result of procedural differences between studies. Second, the fact that the predatory impact of Chedabucto Bay green crabs was similar to that of conspecifics from St. Georges Bay, but greater than those from Passamaquoddy Bay, suggests that these differences in interspecific dominance patterns are correlated with genetic differences between green crab populations related to their invasion history in Atlantic Canada. The mechanisms underlying the effect of crab geographic origin on its interaction with juvenile lobster remain elusive, however, as no differences in crab behaviour or morphology were found that correlated with the pattern of lobster mortality.

This 'individual specialisation' is a widespread phenomenon in natural populations, but until recently few studies quantified the magnitude of individual specialisation and how this magnitude varies among populations or contexts. Such quantitative approaches are necessary for us to understand how ecological interactions influence the amount of among-individual variation, and how the amount of variation might affect ecological dynamics. Herein, we review recent studies of individual specialisation, emphasising the novel insights arising from quantitative measures of diet variation. Experimental and comparative studies have confirmed long-standing theoretical expectations that the magnitude of among-individual diet variation depends on the level of intra and interspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. In contrast, there is little empirical information as to how individual specialisation affects community dynamics. We discuss some emerging methodological issues as guidelines for researchers studying individual specialisation, and make specific recommendations regarding avenues for future research.","[Araujo, Marcio S.; Layman, Craig A.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Araujo, MS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Ecol, BR-199 Rio Claro, Brazil.",msaraujo@rc.unesp.br,"Araujo, Marcio Silva/G-9485-2011; Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015","Araujo, Marcio Silva/0000-0003-3533-744X; Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.

We tested the hypothesis that site-specific heterogeneity in the physico-chemical environment alters the dominance of two competing amphipods: Gammarus fasciatus, the dominant native species in the upper St. Lawrence River, and Echinogammarus ischnus, a euryhaline Ponto-Caspian species that invaded the river in the late 1990s. E. ischnus has replaced G. fasciatus as the dominant amphipod at some sites, while remaining inferior at other sites-even several years after invasion. We tested the effect of water chemistry (conductivity) on the outcome of interactions between these two species in the laboratory and in the river in 2006 and 2007. Field experiments involved transplanting both species to different sites along a gradient of conductivity within the river, whereas the laboratory experiments examined interspecific predation in water collected from these sites. The laboratory experiments revealed that these species are mutual predators and their rate of predation on each other varies with conductivity; E. ischnus is the dominant predator at higher conductivity, while G. fasciatus dominates at lower conductivity. The field experiments showed interannual variation, but supported the lab results at high conductivity in 2006 and at low conductivity in 2007. E. ischnus was more sensitive than G. fasciatus to variation in conductivity, which apparently mediates this invader's ability to replace or dominate the native species in a heterogeneous environment.","[Kestrup, Asa M.; Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Ricciardi, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",asa.kestrup@mcgill.ca; tony.ricciardi@mcgill.ca,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",,,,43,40,40,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Frankliniella occidentalis is significantly larger than F. bispinosa. Frankliniella bispinosa has greater mobility compared with F. occidentalis. When O. insidiosus was offered either F. bispinosa or F. occidentalis as prey in single species trials, there were no significant differences in the number of prey captured. However, O. insidiosus had significantly more encounters with F. bispinosa than with F. occidentalis. In arenas with equal numbers of both species, O. insidiosus encountered and captured F. occidentalis more than F. bispinosa. In large arenas with two pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.), O. insidiosus preyed on more F. occidentalis than on F. bispinosa. These results indicate that O. insidiosus can prey on both thrips species, but that it preferentially captures F. occidentalis. The greater locomotion and movement of F. bispinosa, perhaps combined with its smaller size, allow it to evade predation by O. insidiosus better than F. occidentalis. Consequently, the observed preference of O. insidiosus for F. occidentalis is not exclusively a function of active selection by the predator but also could arise from inherent differences among prey. We propose this differential predation as a mechanism contributing to observed differences in the temporal dynamics of these species in pepper fields.","USDA ARS, CMAVE, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA; Univ Florida, N Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Quincy, FL 32351 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Reitz, SR (corresponding author), USDA ARS, CMAVE, 6383 Mahan Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32308 USA.",sreitz@saa.ars.usda.gov,"Reitz, Stuart/B-7667-2008; Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019",,,,,57,35,45,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

The work was carried out in a montane mixed forest of central Spain with four Parus species, the long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) and the nuthatch (Sitta europaea). Experimental feeders, that varied in their risk of predation, were used to control the effect of natural variations in food availability and quality on the habitat use patterns of different species. Tree gleaning passerines avoided feeding on dark inner forest places far from edges, distant from protective cover, outside the inner tree canopy and near the ground; they preferred deciduous, relatively clear forest plots. These effects remained invariable across years and weather conditions. There was a common pattern of selection of foraging locations by the four Parus species: proximity to cover and height above ground and over the lowest branches of the tree canopy positively influenced the use of feeding places. According to these patterns, the vigilance proportion of species was significantly higher when feeding far from cover than when birds were feeding near pine foliage. This pattern was also common for the four studied Parus species. Nevertheless, the interspecific dominance hierarchy of the species was positively correlated with the use of the safest feeders (feeders farther the ground and nearer from protective cover within tree canopy), being the converse with the most exposed ones. Therefore, the results of this paper demonstrate that the selection of feeding locations within habitat follows a pattern minimizing predation risk. Interspecific dominance hierarchies can lead to the exploitation of unfavourable risky patches by subordinate species.","CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, ES-28006 Madrid, Spain","Carrascal, LM (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, ES-28006 Madrid, Spain.",mcnc152@mncn.csic.es,"Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016; Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008","Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531",,,,69,41,43,2,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2006,112,1,,,,,51,62,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.13787.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,003HG,WOS:000234671800006,,,,,2021-09-24,

However, surprisingly few tests of this idea exist, especially for metazoans feeding on a self-renewing resource. Here we examined the effect of density-independent mortality on the coexistence of four species of pond zooplankton (microcrustacean grazers) in a series of laboratory microcosms. Across the experimental mortality gradient, consumer biomass decreased and resource abundance increased with an increase in mortality. Thus, the treatments resulted in an increase in resource availability per consumer (one measure of reduced competitive intensity). There was no significant effect of mortality treatment on species relative abundances or species evenness, and the zooplankter Diaphanosoma dominated community biomass at all mortality levels. Mortality rate did have a marginally significant effect on species richness (p<0.07), but richness did not increase monotonically with mortality level. Instead, richness tended to be highest in the low- and no-mortality treatments.","Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI USA; Radford Univ, Dept Biol, Radford, VA 24142 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Mittelbach, GG (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",mittelbach@kbs.msu.edu,"Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013; Garcia, Erica/B-4142-2012","Mittelbach, Gary/0000-0001-6971-9273; Garcia, Erica/0000-0002-1186-9700",,,,43,7,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2004,107,2,,,,,415,421,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13182.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,853XE,WOS:000223863100020,,,,,2021-09-24,

Intra-guild predation between early larval instars of two co-existing dragonflies, Sympetrum fonscolombii and Trithemis kirbyi , was investigated with respect to temporal advantage and growth. Three situations were simulated experimentally: (1) Sympetrum fonscolombii began development 11 days before T. kirbyi . (2) Trithemis kirbyi began development 11 days before S. fonscolombii . (3) Both species began on the same day. 2. With a temporal advantage of 11 days to the second species, the resulting larval density of the respective first species was significantly higher than that of the second species. 3. Without a temporal advantage, the survival of S. fonscolombii was higher than that of T. kirbyi , and S. fonscolombii had a larger size due to faster growth than T. kirbyi . Hence, it is assumed that survival depended on early oviposition as well as on larval growth. 4. To test the relevance of the laboratory results, observations at artificial ponds in the Namibian semi-desert were conducted. Trithemis kirbyi was the first species colonising these ponds while S. fonscolombii arrived 15 days later. In field samples, many more Trithemis larvae than Sympetrum larvae were found, a pattern similar to the laboratory experiments in which T. kirbyi enjoyed a temporal advantage.","Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Zool, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany","Suhling, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Fasanenstr 3, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany.",f.suhling@tu-bs.de,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",,,,40,32,37,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Giving-up densities (GUD) of seeds were used to measure the foraging activity of the three most common small mammals at the site: degu (Octodon degus), Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), and the olivaceous field mouse (Akodon olivaceus), under shrubs (cover) and in the open on predator-excluded and competitor-excluded (Octodon) plots. Experiments were conducted during both new and full moons. Monthly small-mammal censuses using standard mark-recapture techniques provided data on movement, reproduction, and long-term fluctuations in density between 1989 and 1994. Diurnal Octodon foraged more (had lower GUD-) in the absence of predators (although this was confounded by a numerical, increase resulting from predator exclusion), and foraged more under shrubs than, in the open. However, the lack of a significant cover x predator exclusion interaction and thermoregulation studies suggest that physiological constraints play,a greater role than predation risk in determining micro-habitat selection by Octodon. Predation risk, as influenced by lunar light levels and predator exclusion, had only weak effects on micro-habitat selection by Phyllotis. The strong tendency of Octodon to forage under cover could depress food availability, forcing Phyllotis to feed more in the open. Concomitantly, Phyllotis exhibits several morphological characters that would favor detection and avoidance of predators. There is extensive evidence that interspecific competition is the primary constraint on Akodon foraging; predation risk appears to be relatively unimportant. Akodon is also a less efficient forager than the two other species, having significantly higher GUD, on average. This is partially offset by differences in reproductive biology; Akodon exhibits extremely rapid. demographic responses to favorable changes in the environment. A fourth species, Abrothrix longipilis, may coexist in the system because of its opportunistic nature, but no data are available on its foraging efficiency. These behavioral and biotic interactions occur within a background of periodic El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO), which may ultimately contribute to species coexistence.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Sci Biol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile","Yunger, JA (corresponding author), Governors State Univ, Environm Biol Program, University Pk, IL 60466 USA.",J-Yunger@govst.edu,,,,,,73,49,49,1,80,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Juvenile C. maenas utilize rocks, shell, and other cover, and their arrival on the west coast places them in potential competition for these resources with an abundant native grapsid, H. oregonensis, Similarly, H, sanguineus use intertidal shelter on the east coast, thus placing C. maenas in possible competition with grapsids both as an invader on the west coast and as 'resident' on the east coast, having been established there for more than 150 yr. Field sampling and laboratory experiments testing competition for space between C. maenas and Hemigrapsus spp. of equal carapace width were conducted on both coasts, as were videotaped feeding trials to examine and quantify agonistic interactions between species. When competing for food (a single damaged, anchored bivalve), C. maenas dominated over H. oregonensis, while H. sanguineus were overwhelmingly dominant over C. maenas. Within-quadrat, stratified sampling of rocks and sand revealed striking differences in habitat utilization by C. maenas living in the presence or absence of Hemigrapsus, Only similar to20% of juvenile C. maenas occurred under rocks in areas occupied by either Hemigrapsus species, while north of the present distribution of H. sanguineus (in Maine) >97% of the C. maenas were found beneath rocks. This pattern was reflected in laboratory trials as well, where both species of Hemigrapsus consistently dominated in contests for shelter. Given the importance of intertidal cover for small crabs, such competitive interactions will likely affect patterns of habitat use by C. maenas on the east coast and may have important implications for the ultimate distribution and impact of this species in the northeastern Pacific.","Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Jensen, GC (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",gjensen@u.washington.edu,,,,,,77,125,130,1,99,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We took an experimental approach to investigate whether absence of A. carolinensis and A. sagrei from these islands results from the inability of populations to become established and whether the presence of the other species has a negative effect on population density and probability of successful colonization. We introduced propagules of five lizards of each species, either in allopatry or sympatry, on five blocks of three islands each. Populations were censused yearly using mark-recapture methods. Anolis sagrei populations thrived on almost all islands, whereas within three years, many A. carolinensis populations had gone extinct, and most others were very small. We conclude that an inability to successfully establish populations on small islands might explain the absence of A. carolinensis from these islands, but not the absence of A. sagrei. Anolis carolinensis was not more likely to become extinct on islands containing A. sagrei, but population densities of A. carolinensis were lower on islands with both species (sympatric islands) compared to allopatric islands. In addition, A. carolinensis tended to perch higher, relative to available vegetation, on sympatric islands than they did on allopatric islands. conversely, the presence of A. carolinensis had little impact on A. sagrei populations. However, inspection of population changes through time suggest that A. carolinensis may have initially had an effect on A. sagrei, but this effect decreased as A. carolinensis populations declined. The observed absence of A. sagrei from these islands may indicate that its dispersal abilities are limited relative to the frequency of devastating hurricanes.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Losos, JB (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",Losos@biodec.wustl.edu,,,,,,27,43,50,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1999,80,1,,,,,252,258,,10.2307/176994,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,157DV,WOS:000078045600019,,,,,2021-09-24,

Therefore, herbivore densities will not only be determined by direct predator-prey interactions and direct and indirect defence of plants against herbivores, but also by other direct and indirect interactions such as apparent competition, intraguild predation, resource competition, etc. Although these interactions have received considerable attention in theory and experiments, little is known about their impact on biological control. In this paper, we first present a review of indirect food web interactions in biological control systems. We propose to distinguish between numerical indirect interactions, which are interactions where one species affects densities of another species through an effect on the numbers of an intermediate species and functional indirect interactions, defined as changes in the way that two species interact through the presence of a third species. It is argued that functional indirect interactions are important in food webs and deserve more attention. Subsequently, we discuss experimental results on interactions in an artificial food web consisting of pests and natural enemies on greenhouse cucumber. The two pest species are the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. Their natural enemies are the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, which is commonly used for spider mite control and the predatory mites Neoseiulus cucumeris and Iphiseius degenerans and the predatory bug Orius laevigatus, all natural enemies of thrips. First, we analyse the possible interactions between these seven species and we continue by discussing how functional indirect interactions, particularly the behaviour of arthropods, may change the significance and impact of direct interactions and numerical indirect interactions. It was found that a simple food web of only four species already gives rise to some quite complicated combinations of interactions. Spider mites and thrips interact indirectly through resource competition, but thrips larvae are intraguild predators of spider mites. Some of the natural enemies used for control of the two herbivore species are also intraguild predators. Moreover, spider mites produce a web that is subsequently used by thrips to hide from their predators. We discuss these and other results obtained so far and we conclude with a discussion of the potential impact of functional indirect and direct interactions on food webs and their significance for biological control.

In the Salt River, in western Kentucky, U. S. A., pulmonates were fairly common in headwater streams, and were replaced in larger order tributaries by prosobranch snails. The literature suggests that pulmonates have tolerance and capacity adaptations to variation in physicochemical variables like temperature or dissolved oxygen. Only one of the two pulmonates tested in the laboratory, however, had quicker righting responses and rates of movement, important in recolonizing ephemeral habitats. A competition experiment in an artificial stream indicated that the large-river prosobranch, Lithasia obovata (Say, 1829), suffered less reduction in growth than the pulmonate Helisoma trivolvis (Say, 1817). Both the literature and experiments we have performed suggest that prosobranchs are less vulnerable to predators. We interpret these results to suggest pulmonates are more common in temporary headwater streams, or shallow littoral margins of lotic systems, because of greater physiological adaptation, while prosobranchs are more common in larger rivers (or in spring-fed rivers) because of greater competitive ability, lower risk of predation, or less-variable physicochemical regimes.","Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Brown, KM (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",,,,,,,71,42,44,0,22,AMER MALACOLOGICAL UNION,WILMINGTON,"DELAWARE MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, BOX 3937, WILMINGTON, DE 19807-0937 USA",0740-2783,,,AM MALACOL BULL,Am.

Mortality of both R. temporaria and B. bufo larvae was high during the early stages of development, and interspecific competition was negligible in these ponds and in mesh cages suspended in them. However, growth of B. bufo larvae was reduced when they were raised with R. temporaria larvae at natural densities in plastic cages within the ponds. P. richardsi was positively associated with the plastic cage treatments, but was much less frequent in the ponds outside or in the mesh cage treatments.

Both juveniles and adults of these two species are closely associated in low elevation headwater streams in western Virginia. I explored the effects of competition between juveniles of the two species, and the effects of heterospecific adults on juvenile performance, in a controlled, replicated experiment in artificial streams. Effects of competition were determined for three measures of juvenile performance that can be potentially related to reproductive output, and hence, to population dynamics: survival, growth and relative condition. Juveniles of C. bairdi and E. flabellare competed at densities well within the range observed in their natal streams. Adult E. flabellare had a positive effect on the survival of juvenile C. bairdi, the origin of which is unknown. Adult C. bairdi had no effect on juvenile E. flabellare. The most interesting result was that competition between juveniles of the two species was characterized by a qualitative asymmetry; C. bairdi responded with a reduction in growth, both in total length and mass, while E. flabellare responded with a decrease in relative condition, but no decrease in growth. These differences in response were clearly reflected in mass/length regressions. Unless responding variables can be precisely translated into quantitative effects on population dynamics, such qualitative asymmetries in competitive interactions greatly complicate the determination of competitive symmetry and the possible prediction of competitive outcomes, especially in species where r is difficult to determine directly.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27708",,,,,,,,72,18,19,0,14,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,1997,78,3,,,,,429,439,,10.2307/3545605,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WU941,WOS:A1997WU94100003,,,,,2021-09-24,

Thus, we have no idea what types of interspecific interactions to expect if we randomly sample species from an environment. The probability that a unidirectional, non-zero interaction is negative (P--) or positive (P-+) has a direct effect on the expected types of reciprocal interspecific interactions. Analysis of field studies where strengths and signs of interactions between seven or more species were documented (large studies were selected to avoid bias from choosing species known to interact) suggests that P-+ = P-- = 0.5. Data also suggest that the proportion of non-zero interactions (C) is generally less than 0.6 when 10 or more interactions are considered. The proportion of expected reciprocal interspecific interactions can be calculated given the proportion of direct interactions that are not significantly different from zero and assuming that non-zero interactions are equally likely to be positive or negative. In general, this neutral model predicts that if species are chosen from an environment randomly, non-interaction (0/0), commensalism (+/-/0), or amensalism (-/0) will be most common when C<0.6. Predation and functionally similar interactions (+/-), competition (-/-), and mutualism (+/+) should be relatively rare when there are less than 10 species with C<0.6. Predation should be twice as common as competition or mutualism, and mutualism as common as competition.

We tested for the importance of priority effects on the interactions between immatures of the mosquito, Culiseta longiareolata, and immatures of the green toad, Bufo viridis, the two most abundant species of many temporary pools of the Negev Desert, Israel. Previously, we reported that when these two taxonomically distant species were placed together as early stage larvae, they competed strongly and when Culiseta larvae had the size advantage, they preyed on Bufo hatchlings. Here, we tested the interaction between these two species in artificial pools when Bufo enters first and develops prior to Culiseta entering. 2. We also tested for intra-specific competition and for the impact of both mosquito larva and tadpole on invading species. 3. We assessed these interactions by experimentally manipulating various combinations and densities of Bufo and Culiseta. We introduced early stage Bufo larvae 12 days prior to introducing first instar Culiseta larvae. 4. Bufo exhibited a strong intraspecific density-dependent effect: tadpoles were smaller and reached metamorphosis later at the higher density. We did not demonstrate an intraspecific density-dependent effect in Culiseta. 5. Culiseta larvae affected neither survival nor development rates of the larger Bufo. Early stage Culiseta larvae were vulnerable to predation by the larger Bufo but later instar Culiseta larval were no longer vulnerable. Bufo reduced larval development rate of Culiseta but did not affect pupal size. 6. Bufo tadpoles virtually eliminated, and Culiseta larvae strongly reduced, the number of individuals of an invading ceratopogonid midge species reaching the pupal stage. 7. The work here, combined with our previous work, demonstrates the importance of priority effects with respect to the outcome of competition and intraguild predation.","UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,LAB COMMUNITY ECOL,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,LAB BIOL CONTROL,POB 653,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,48,96,99,1,58,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Fences and netting selectively excluded from large, replicated grids. Small mammal populations were censused monthly over >4 yr, and effects of predator and degu exclusions on numbers and survival of small mammals were assessed with repeated measures ANOVAs. Marginally significant predator exclusion effects were detected on O. degus, and highly significant year x predation interactions in both wet and dry seasons; degu survival (= persistence) was also significantly longer on exclusion grids. Predation had significant effects on numbers of Phyllotis darwini, and a significant month X predator interaction existed in the wet season; survival was also significantly higher on predator exclusion grids. There was a marginally significant year x competitor interaction in the dry season for this species. Akodon olivaceus had significant month x predator and month x competitor interactions in the wet season only; survival was significantly longer on degu exclusion grids. An irruptive species, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, showed no significant predator or competitor effects in 1991-1992; however, survival was significantly longer on predator + competitor exclusion (vs. control) grids. An uncommon species, Abrothrix longipilis, had marginally nonsignificant time x competitor interactions but no treatment differences in survival. Finally, a second uncommon rodent, Abrocoma bennetti (not analyzed numerically) had significantly longer survival on predator exclusion grids with degus. Degus and P. darwini were significantly overrepresented (relative to availability) in diets of culpeo foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and three nocturnal owls, respectively, whereas A. bennetti was significantly overrepresented in predator diets generally, Vertebrate predation has pervasive effects on some species that, however, may be related to their intrinsic demographic characteristics. Competition may be mediated by subtle behavioral interactions among assemblage members. Long-term studies are necessary to elucidate the role of biotic and abiotic factors in semiarid environments.","UNIV LA SERENA,DEPT BIOL,LA SERENA,CHILE; PONTIFICIA UNIV CATOLICA CHILE,DEPT ECOL,SANTIAGO,CHILE","Meserve, PL (corresponding author), NO ILLINOIS UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,DE KALB,IL 60115, USA.",,"Jaksic, Fabian M/G-1705-2014","Jaksic, Fabian M/0000-0003-0098-0291",,,,131,82,84,1,40,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1996,77,1,,,,,133,148,,10.2307/2265662,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TR079,WOS:A1996TR07900015,,,,,2021-09-24,

American toads arrive at breeding ponds 4-10 wk after wood frogs and typically select breeding sites that lack wood frog tadpoles. In an experiment conducted in seminatural ponds, adult toads completely avoided ovipositing in ponds with wood frog tadpoles. Additional experiments strongly suggest that predation of wood frog tadpoles on toad eggs and larvae is the primary reason for the evolution of adult avoidance behavior in toads. In one set of experiments, toad eggs and hatchlings suffered complete mortality within two days after being placed in artificial ponds containing natural densities of wood frog tadpoles. Similar mortality occurred when eggs and hatchlings were introduced into natural breeding sites. In one experiment in which 2000 toad hatchlings were added to natural ponds, all were killed and consumed within 45 min by wood frog tadpoles. Although tadpoles of most anurans are considered to be microphagous suspension feeders that occupy lower trophic levels of food chains, a growing body of evidence indicates that many tadpoles can temporarily shift feeding modes to become upper level, macrophagous predators.

The lakes are characterized by a dominance of large zooplankton species. Small zooplankton species are scarce, whereas in nearby lakes with fish they are common. The importance of biotic and abiotic factors in preventing the successful invasion of small zooplankton species into these fishless lakes was determined using a series of field manipulations. The relative importance of competition with large herbivores (the cladoceran Daphnia pulex), predation by large invertebrates (the dipteran Chaoborus americanus and the copepod Diaptomus leptopus), and abiotic conditions including pH were examined experimentally. Abiotic and/or resource conditions suppressed the population growth rate of 70% of the small zooplankton species introduced into enclosures in the fishless lakes relative to those introduced into enclosures in their resident lake (a lake with fish). Fewer small zooplankton species were suppressed in a similar experiment when pH was experimentally raised to 7, suggesting that pH is one factor that inhibits the successful invasion of small zooplankton into these lakes. Manipulations of large herbivores and invertebrate predators showed that predation was more important than competition in restricting the distribution of small species. Predation by Chaoborus primarily reduced the densities of crustaceans while predation by Diaptomus reduced the densities of rotifers. Competitive suppression of small zooplankton by Daphnia was not detected. The results suggest that both predation by Chaoborus and Diaptomus and abiotic conditions, including pH, are important factors determining zooplankton community structure in these fishless bog lakes.","MIAMI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,OXFORD,OH 45054",,,,"Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",,,,86,101,109,0,42,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1993,74,8,,,,,2361,2380,,10.2307/1939588,,,20,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MJ575,WOS:A1993MJ57500017,,,,,2021-09-24,

FC and FS abilities to survive were determined by field sampling and experimental treatments of laboratory stream models. The effects of interspecific competition, antagonism, and predation on FC and FS survivals were determined using recirculating models that contained either untreated drain water and sediment, cycloheximide-treated drain sediment, or autoclaved drain water and sediment seeded with drain isolates of FC and FS. Storm drain sediment FC and FS counts were stable at 10(5)/100 ml during dry weather (4-6 days), with little or no bacterial supplementation from the water (10(1)-10(2)/100 ml). Untreated (control) model FC and FS populations stabilized at 10(3)/100 ml for 7-9 days. In cycloheximide-treated models, FS and FC survived at 10(4) and 10(5)/100 ml, respectively. In autoclaved-seeded models, FS and FC initial counts of 10(4)/100 ml increased to and stabilized at 10(7)-10(9)/100 ml. Separate storm drain sediments serve as reservoirs of high concentrations of FC and FS during warm, dry weather periods. FC exhibited some ability to multiply in drain sediment. Native microfloral competition/antagonism (including bacterial predation) and protozoan predation are major biotic factors influencing FC and FS survivals. During warm, dry weather periods, abiotic factors were generally stable and had minimal affects on FC and FS survivals.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH PUBL HLTH,DEPT ENVIRONM & IND HLTH,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",,,,,,,,62,67,69,1,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0043-1354,,,WATER RES,Water Res.,SEP,1991,25,9,,,,,1089,1098,,10.1016/0043-1354(91)90202-2,,,10,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GF854,WOS:A1991GF85400008,,Green Published,,,2021-09-24,

Body size is a fundamental trait that impacts many aspects of species biology and ecology. It is, in turn, influenced by a suite of environmental factors, and often decreases with warming. Although environmental conditions can also impact body shape, which is another functional trait that influences locomotion, resource acquisition and potentially physiological processes, such responses are poorly understood and rarely quantified. 2. We experimentally tested the independent and combined effects of environmental temperature, resource level and interspecific competition on the body shape and size responses of two model protist species. We also tested the degree to which these individual--level phenotypic responses are associated with population densities and species coexistence. 3. Body shape was strongly influenced by resource competition, whereas body size changes were mainly driven by environmental temperature. In both species, lower resource levels resulted in body shape elongation, suggesting that relatively more elongate individuals with potentially higher swimming speed were advantaged in the resource scarce environment. However, competition had contrasting influence on the body shape of the two species. Competition decreased the population densities of Blepharisma japonicum, which exhibited relative body shape elongation, similar to the response at low resource levels. In contrast, competition increased the population densities of Paramecium aurelia, which exhibited reduced elongation similar to body shape response at high resource levels. Hence, body shape responses could be indicative of changes in resource availability, aiding our understanding of competitive hierarchies and species interactions. 4. Coexistence was observed in all treatment combinations, likely because body size of both species decreased similarly under warming, potentially maintaining constant per capita competitive intensity. These findings, along with recent research on phytoplankton, diverse pelagic invertebrates, and birds highlight the importance of body shape and morphology across different taxonomic groups. Hence, we call for body size and shape to be considered in concert when investigating ecological consequences of climate warming.","[Tan, Hanrong; Kratina, Pavel] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Hirst, Andrew G.] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell, England; [Hirst, Andrew G.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, Lyngby, Denmark; [Atkinson, David] Univ Liverpool, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Kratina, P (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England.",p.kratina@qmul.ac.uk,"Atkinson, David/D-4664-2009","Atkinson, David/0000-0002-9956-2454; Tan, Hanrong/0000-0002-0365-1592; Hirst, Andrew/0000-0001-9132-1886",Principal's Postgraduate Research Studentship,Principal's Postgraduate Research Studentship,,62,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

However, exactly how the subordinate species coexists with superior species is unknown. In the forests west of Beijing City, intense asymmetrical interactions of food competition exist among granivorous rodents (e.g. Apodemus peninsulae, Niviventer confucianus, Sciurotamias davidianus and Tscherskia triton) that have broadly overlapping habitats and diets but have varied body size (range 15-300 g), hoarding habits (scatter vs larder) and/or daily rhythm (diurnal vs nocturnal). The smallest rodent, A. peninsulae, which typically faces high competitive pressure from larger rodents, is an ideal model to explore how subordinate species coexist with superior species. Under semi-natural enclosure conditions, we tested responses of seed-hoarding behavior in A. peninsulae to intraspecific and interspecific competitors in the situations of pre-competition (without competitor), competition (with competitor) and post-competition (competitor removed). The results showed that for A. peninsulae, the intensity of larder-hoarding increased and the intensity of scatter-hoarding declined in the presence of intraspecifics and S. davidianus, whereas A. peninsulae ceased foraging and hoarding in the presence of N. confucianus and T. triton. A. peninsulae reduced intensity of hoarding outside the nest and moved more seeds into the nest for larder-hoarding under competition from intraspecific individuals and S. davidianus. In most cases, the experimental animals could recover to their original state of pre-competition when competitors were removed. These results suggest that subordinate species contextually regulate their food-hoarding strategies according to different competitors, promoting species coexistence among sympatric animals that have asymmetrical food competition.","[Niu, Hongyu; Zhang, Jie; Wang, Zhiyong; Huang, Guangchuan; Peng, Chao; Zhang, Hongmao] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",zhanghm@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31772471]; self-determined research funds of CCNU from the colleges' basic research and operation of MOE [CCNU17A02017],"We thank F.

Under a quasi-Before-After-Control-Impact experimental design, we assessed how dingoes (Canis dingo) responded to a decline in anthropogenic foods in the Tanami Desert, central Australia. We did so by assessing dingo diets close to and away from human influence during a period when food waste was available at two rubbish tips, and then during a period when food waste was restricted at one of the tips. Our results demonstrate that access to anthropogenic foods can alter a top predator's diet. Namely, dingoes showed a preference for eating the desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor) in areas where food waste was restricted, whereas dingo diets did not reflect ambient prey availability at areas where food waste was constantly available. Reduced availability of food waste also affected interactions between dingoes, with cannibalism decreasing where food waste was removed, and it may have increased consumption of a subordinate mesopredator, the feral cat (Felis catus). By implication, efforts to manage food waste could reestablish or strengthen interactions between predators and their wild prey with possible cascading consequences for ecosystems.","[Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Howden, Chris] Univ Sydney, Sydney Informat Hub, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Wirsing, Aaron J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Newsome, TM (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",thomas.newsome@sydney.edu.au,,"Newsome, Thomas/0000-0003-3457-3256",Newmont Tanami Operations; Central Land Council,"This project was funded and supported by Newmont Tanami Operations and the Central Land Council.

Fluctuating densities and dietary overlap may account for massive ecological and evolutionary changes in fish communities. We sampled a mixed juvenile (0+ stages, being younger than 1 year of age) fish community at the Lower Rhine over three consecutive years, including native and newly established species (similar to 64,000 captured individuals and similar to 4200 dissected fish). Our aim was to develop a new approach in which data on density, individual consumption rates, and diet overlaps (both intra- and interspecific) solely originating from the natural environment, were used and combined to estimate species-specific competitive strengths within and between seasons and species. The juvenile fish community at the food-limited Rhine was dominated by invasive gobies. Species-specific consumption rates decreased depending on the dietary overlap with other juveniles. Two invasive gobies (Neogobius melanostomus and N. fluviatilis) showed the greatest competitive abilities, followed by a third invasive Gobiid species (Ponticola kessleri) and the native Aspius aspius, a species utilizing an exclusive food source. Both other native species (Perca fluviatilis and Sander lucioperca) had the lowest estimates of food-related competitive strength, indicating that these species are forced into a juvenile competitive bottleneck by the invasive gobies, before they finally can develop into successful predators on gobies later in life. Our new analytical approach to measure dietary competitive strength among individuals provides a powerful tool to empirically study eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics in the field.","[Borcherding, Jost; Heubel, Katja; Storm, Svenja] Univ Cologne, Dept Gen Ecol, Inst Zool, Ecol Field Stn Rees, D-50923 Cologne, Germany","Borcherding, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Dept Gen Ecol, Inst Zool, Ecol Field Stn Rees, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",Jost.Borcherding@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011; Heubel, Katja/J-4060-2012","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861; Heubel, Katja/0000-0002-7946-5542","Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia; Volkswagen foundationVolkswagen [92 002]","We thank Pavel Jurajda (Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno) and the members of his team for their help during several fishing campaigns, as well as numerous students from the University of Cologne who helped with field assistance.

Third instars of the invasive blow fly Chrysomya rufifacies are facultative predators on larvae of the native blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria. 2. The effects of priority arrival time on the survivorship and fitness of C. rufifacies and C. macellaria were investigated in laboratory experiments. 3. Cochliomyia macellaria colonising a resource within 1-2 days after C. rufifacies resulted in a 20-70% reduction in survivorship, pupal weight and fecundity compared with those colonising a resource more than 2 days before or after C. rufifacies. Inversely, C. rufifacies exhibited a 50% increase in survivorship and fecundity when closely (approximate to 2 days) associated temporally on the resource with C. macellaria and was negatively affected by disparate arrival. 4. These results demonstrate that arrival sequence significantly affects the fitness of both C. rufifacies and C. macellaria. Early colonisation may allow C. macellaria to persist in a community, while there are fitness benefits for C. rufifacies colonising after C. macellaria. 5. The 60% reduction in C. macellaria survivorship when in close temporal association with C. rufifacies may act as an agent of selection for C. macellaria to colonise a resource early and develop quickly to avoid predation on resources colonised by C. rufifacies. 6. Selection for such traits may explain how C. macellaria is able to persist despite intraguild predation by this invasive species. In contrast, the 50% increase in survivorship and fecundity exhibited by C. rufifacies when arriving after C. macellaria may select for C. rufifacies to delay colonisation.","[Brundage, Adrienne; Tomberlin, Jeffery K.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Benbow, Mark Eric] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Benbow, Mark Eric] Michigan State Univ, Dept Osteopath Med, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Tomberlin, JK (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77845 USA.",jktomberlin@tamu.edu,"Benbow, Mark/V-5895-2019",,"AgriLife Research; National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice [2010-DN-BX-K243]","J.K.T. would like to thank AgriLife Research for providing funds to conduct this research.

These resources may be limited due to poor habitat quality or by intra- and interspecific competitions, which in extreme cases may cause the ant colony to perish. We tested the effect of intraspecific competition and habitat degradation (forest clear-cutting) on colony survival by transplanting 26 nests of the red wood ant (Formica aquilonia Yarrow, 1955) in 26 different forest areas that contained 0-11 conspecific alien nests per hectare. E aquilonia is highly dependent on canopy-dwelling aphids, thus the removal of trees should cause food limitation. During the course of the 4-year experiment, 9 of the forests were partially clear-cut. We found that while forest clear-cutting significantly decreased the colonies' survival, intraspecific competition did not. As a highly polygynous and polydomous species, E aquilonia seems to tolerate the presence of alien conspecific colonies to a certain extent.","[Sorvari, Jouni; Hakkarainen, Harri] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Sorvari, Jouni] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm Sci, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Huhta, Esa] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Rovaniemi Res Unit, FI-96301 Rovaniemi, Finland","Sorvari, J (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm Sci, POB 1627, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",jouni.sorvari@uef.fi,"Sorvari, Jouni/I-5375-2014","Sorvari, Jouni/0000-0003-2668-7771",Emil Aaltonen Foundation; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,Four anonymous referees gave constructive comments on the manuscript.

A decline in habitat may lead to crowding of live coral specialists into remnant habitat patches, intensifying intraspecific competition. Increased local densities of conspecifics are known to negatively affect key demographic processes, but the magnitude of density effects and the role of crowding in response to habitat loss are poorly understood. In this study we examined habitat use and relationships between habitat availability and population density in a coral-dwelling damselfish - Chrysiptera parasema. First, we conducted habitat use and availability surveys to establish the level of habitat selectivity. We then investigated the evidence for crowding due to habitat loss by comparing densities within juvenile aggregations on natural reefs with high and low cover of the preferred habitat. Finally, we used a manipulative patch-reef experiment to measure the potential effects of crowding on mortality of juvenile C. parasema. Surveys revealed that 97% of juvenile C. parasema were associated with Acropora corals. Furthermore, C. parasema densities were closely related to the cover of bottlebrush Acropora, the preferred growth form. Contrary to predictions, there was no evidence of crowding on natural reefs with low coral cover, but rather, reefs with abundant Acropora cover supported larger aggregations with double the density of juveniles. We hypothesized that low densities of C. parasema on natural reefs with low coral cover could be explained by intense intraspecific competition. Experimental manipulations showed that juvenile mortality was density-dependent, with mortality 20% higher on high-density experimental patch-reefs compared to low-density reefs. Behavioural observations on the patch-reefs revealed that the frequency of agonistic interactions and distance to shelter were both unrelated to conspecific densities, highlighting the need for further research into mechanisms underpinning density dependent mortality. These results suggest that intraspecific competition may play an important role in reducing reef fish abundance as a consequence of habitat loss. Given that coral reef systems are currently under threat, with a global decline in coral cover, this study adds to the growing body of knowledge of how disturbances to habitat may affect reef fish communities.

Most studies examine relationships of newcomers with native species, but interactions among introduced species could also affect community shifts. As early ontogenetic stages are particularly vulnerable to biotic interactions, we explored direct and indirect interactions across early life-history stages in space-dominating marine invertebrates. We used introduced ascidians and both native and introduced mussels. To increase generality, we ran our experiments in 2 distant locations, one in the northern and one in the southern hemisphere (Mediterranean and South Africa). We found no sperm interference between the ascidians, nor were there interspecific effects on settlement or metamorphosis success. However, larvae of the ascidian species reacted to each other by shifting from aggregated to random settlement. Juvenile mussels consumed large numbers of ascidian larvae, though larvae that avoided mussel predation showed higher settlement success. Mussel species in the southern hemisphere locality (native Perna perna and introduced Mytilus galloprovincialis) consumed more ascidian larvae than mussels in the northern locality (native M. galloprovincialis), with a tendency for ascidian larvae to avoid settling close to mussels in the northern locality. We conclude that larval consumption by mussels affects the establishment of ascidians, but that the magnitude of this effect is context dependant. These results emphasize the importance of the composition of the receiving community in determining its susceptibility to invasion. Whether the species comprising this community are native or introduced is, however, less important than what manner of species they are.","[Ordonez, Victor; Pascual, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Genet, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Rius, Marc] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [McQuaid, Christopher D.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Pineda, M.

We performed a field experiment to determine whether effects of current abiotic conditions and interspecific competition with O. hylas were responsible for displacement of O. peruncus from parts of their former range. We examined growth and survival of juvenile male O. peruncus exposed to juvenile male O. hylas in enclosures at two sites in the former range of O. peruncus. Enclosures contained 8 (low density) or 16 individuals (high density) and had O. peruncus only (control) or both species (interspecific treatment). Juvenile O. peruncus were able to survive and grow in portions of their former range, implicating biotic versus abiotic factors in the displacement of O. peruncus. Survival rates of O. peruncus did not differ among treatments at either site. Orconectes peruncus showed significant growth in all treatments and interspecific effects were not greater than intraspecific effects on O. peruncus growth rates. High-density treatments showed significantly reduced O. peruncus growth rates compared to low-density treatments, except in Carver Creek interspecific treatments. When considered in the context of previous studies examining the effects of O. hylas on O. peruncus, results suggest that neither direct competition between juvenile males of the two species or abiotic change are responsible for the decreased range of O. peruncus.

To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a literature review, focusing on studies that tested the behavioural and demographic impact of intraguild predation on individuals, populations, and assemblages of diurnal and nocturnal raptorial species. Overall, data were available for 39 empirical and experimental studies on 63 populations belonging to 11 killer species and 15 victim species. An overview of these studies suggested that intraguild predation was a widespread, size-based phenomenon. Results from multiple studies on the same species at different locations were usually consistent across wide geographical areas. Individual-level demographic impacts included reduced site-occupancy, breeding success and survival. Individuals of the prey species responded to predation pressure through direct spatial avoidance, risk-sensitive habitat selection, short-term behavioural avoidance (e.g. reduced vocal activity and escape to refugia after predator detection) and, possibly, temporal segregation. Population-level effects were common but mainly examined as spatio-temporal correlations between the abundance of killer and victim species. Correlative evidence also suggested that intraguild predation may have the potential to structure whole raptor assemblages. More studies on other species and different geographic areas are needed to increase our understanding of the causes and consequences of this widespread interaction. From a conservation point of view, intraguild predation may limit the success of raptor preservation programmes and could be used as a management tool through its effect on mesopredator release and its potentially positive, indirect effects on game species.","[Sergio, Fabrizio; Hiraldo, Fernando] Estac Biol Donana, Dept Appl Biol, E-41013 Seville, Spain","Sergio, F (corresponding author), Estac Biol Donana, Dept Appl Biol, E-41013 Seville, Spain.",fsergio@ebd.csic.es,"Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019; Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015","Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773",,,,99,99,109,1,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,AUG,2008,150,,,1,,,132,145,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00786.x,,,14,Ornithology,Zoology,346ZS,WOS:000259108700012,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

Existing theory suggests that high resource competition can lead to mutualism. However, this is based on an analysis that need only apply near equilibrium, and experimental demonstrations of such mutualism are rare. Two alternative approaches to measuring food web mutualism are examined here. These are based on the population level effects of adding or removing a consumer species or on the amount of additional mortality that can be applied to one consumer without excluding it. Both measures suggest that mutualism is likely to be confined to two situations: when overlap in resource use by the consumers is very low and when the consumers are inefficient users of their resources. Competition between resources is also likely to increase the occurrence and magnitude of hypercompetition between consumers, where the reduction in population size caused by the introduced consumer is greater than that caused by a consumer that is identical to the resident species. Competition between resources can also increase the negative interaction between consumers by destabilizing the dynamics of the system. Such destabilization can cause negative indirect interactions between specialist consumers having no overlap in resource use.","Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Environm Risk, Ecol Risk Res Sect, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Zool Bldg,25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",abrams@zoo.utoronto.ca; mifuyun@hawaii.edu,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008; Nakajima, Mifuyu/N-5337-2015","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X; Nakajima, Mifuyu/0000-0001-7778-2029",,,,54,19,20,0,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

For example, migratory water birds are believed to suffer from competition with resident fish populations for shared food resources. While observational evidence in support of this hypothesis is accumulating, replicated experiments addressing this issue at the proper spatial scale are lacking. Here, we report from a replicated whole-system experiment in which we stocked large (0.07 km(2)), shallow (<= 2.5 m deep), highly eutrophic ponds in the bird protection area Ismaninger Speichersee mit Fischteichen'' with different densities of carp and assessed the responses of water birds and their food resources during summer over several years. In all years, the biomasses of benthic macroinvertebrates, macroalgae, and macrophytes as well as the densities of herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous water birds were reduced in carp ponds compared to fishshless ponds. The negative effects of carp on food resources and on the numbers of water birds feeding in carp ponds increased over the season (May-September) and were stronger at high than at low stocking densities of carp. Consequently, differences in resource densities between ponds with and without carp increased, and the ranking of ponds with respect to resource densities became more predictable over the season. These factors may have contributed to a seasonal improvement of the birds' abilities to track resource densities across ponds, as suggested by tight correlations of bird numbers on ponds with resource densities late, but not early, in the season.","Univ Munich, Dept Biol II, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Haas, K (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Dept Biol II, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",karin_haas@web.de,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051",,,,58,62,68,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2007,88,11,,,,,2915,2925,,10.1890/06-1981.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,233CL,WOS:000251067900028,18051660,,,,2021-09-24,

We hypothesised that interactions among a suite of shoreline plant species shift across a hydrodynamic-exposure gradient, leading to generation of apparently distinct habitat types (e.g. bare cobble beaches, vegetated cobble beaches, fringing marshes and salt marshes). We examined hydrodynamic forcing and found that it was strongly correlated with shoreline habitat type. A transplant experiment revealed that all plants were rapidly crushed and abraded in bare cobble areas with high hydrodynamic energy and were out-competed by grasses in the low-energy salt marshes. Vegetated cobble beaches are inhabited by the largest amount of plant species under intermediate conditions, where hydrodynamic energy is sufficiently low to allow the establishment of the ecosystem engineer Spartina and sufficiently high to prevent the monopolisation of space by competitively dominant, but stress intolerant grasses. Experimentally reducing physical and biotic stresses (hydrodynamics and interspecific competition) on bare cobble beaches and salt marshes, respectively, enabled forbs to persist across the whole gradient. These results demonstrate that the outcome of interspecific interactions at landscape scales is driven by background physical conditions, and that this can result in the development of what are considered distinct habitats.","[Crain, Caitlin M.; Altieri, Andrew H.; Bertness, Mark D.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [van Wesenbeeck, Bregje K.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Estuarine & Marine Ecol, NIOO KNAW, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands","van Wesenbeeck, BK (corresponding author), WL Delft Hydraul, POB 140, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands.",bregje.vanwesenbeeck@wldelft.nl,"Altieri, Andrew H/P-1738-2017","van Wesenbeeck, Bregje/0000-0002-0308-9552",,,,34,15,15,0,28,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In many cases, odours indicate the presence of both food and predators. Spider mites are known to use odours to locate food and mates, but also to avoid interspecific competitors. We studied the response of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, to cues associated with the presence of their predators, the phytoseiid Phytoseiulus persimilis. We found that the spider mites strongly avoid plants defended by this predator, but do not avoid plants with another predatory mite, Neoseiulus californicus. Since P. persimilis is commonly used in the greenhouse where our strain of T. urticae was collected and strains of this pest are known to adapt to greenhouse environments, we hypothesize that there has been selection on the pest to recognize its enemy. We further hypothesize that there has been no selection to recognize N. californicus, as it has not been used against two-spotted spider mites in the greenhouse where our spider mites were collected. We discuss the implications of avoidance of predation by spider mites and non-lethal effects of predators for biological control of this pest in greenhouses.","Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Anim Biol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, Kruislaan 320, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands.",janssen@bio.uva.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545",,,,49,50,52,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

The introduced North American crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus Dana, is expanding its range in Europe and locally often replaces two native crayfish species, Astacus astacus L. and Austropotamobius pallipes Lereboullet. Pacifastacus leniusculus is also expected to invade the habitat of a third native crayfish, the endangered Austropotamobius torrentium Schrank. Interspecific aggressive interactions and competition for shelter were experimentally studied in the laboratory to assess the potential impact of P. leniusculus on A. torrentium. 2. Neither species was inherently dominant in aggressive interactions, but dominance was strongly size-dependent, favouring P. leniusculus. 3. Access to limited shelter was generally determined by aggressive dominance, although species-specific preference also influenced the outcome of competition for shelter. Austropotamobius torrentium had a higher preference for experimental shelters and often defended these even against larger P. leniusculus. 4. In accordance with theoretical models of animal conflicts, agonistic interactions between equally sized contestants were more severe than between animals of different size. 5. The P. leniusculus used in the present experiment were infected with the crayfish plague, Aphanomyces astaci, to which the animals are resistant. The crayfish transmitted the disease to non-resistant A. torrentium which died approximate to 2 weeks after contact with P. leniusculus.","Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Zool Museum, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Vorburger, C (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",chrisvor@zool.unizh.ch,"Vorburger, Christoph/A-1650-2008","Vorburger, Christoph/0000-0002-3627-0841",,,,40,106,110,2,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

On Guam, the sponge Dysidea sp. overgrows the sponge Cacospongia sp. and causes necrosis. Using field assays, we tested the effects of crude organic extracts and a major sesquiterpene isolated from Dysidea, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane, on Cacospongia and on the production of the major terpenoid metabolites scalaradial and desacetylscalaradial by Cacospongia. We also tested whether the amounts of organic compounds produced by Dysidea differed in the presence or absence of Cacospongia. To determine whether 7-deacetoxyolepupuane had another ecological function, we tested the compound as a predator deterrent. In field experiments, crude extracts of Dysidea and pure 7-deacetoxyolepupuane both caused necrosis in Cacospongia when they were incorporated into agar strips and placed in contact with Cacospongia for 7 d. Organic extract, scalaradial, and desacetylscalaradial concentrations in Cacospongia were not affected by the overgrowth of Dysidea. However, a greater quantity of organic extract (but not scalaradial or desacetylscalaradial) was found in portions of Cacospongia covered by agar strips containing Dysidea organic extracts than in portions of Cacospongia covered by control agar strips. The production of 7-deacetoxyolepupuane by Dysidea occurring on rock substrates and on Cacospongia did not differ; thus, the production of this compound is not induced by the presence of competitors. In addition to its role in competition, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane deterred predation by a spongivorous fish, illustrating the multiple ecological roles that a single secondary metabolite may play.","Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA","Paul, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA.",,"Becerro, Mikel/A-5325-2008","Thacker, Robert/0000-0002-9654-0073",,,,78,81,92,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1998,79,5,,,,,1740,1750,,,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101CX,WOS:000074853000023,,,,,2021-09-24,

In this paper, we describe responses of benthic, trout stream communities to replicated, whole-ecosystem perturbations resulting from pathogen-induced reductions in populations of a dominant grazer the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior. Previous small-scale experiments suggested that Glossosoma had strong competitive effects on other grazers (through exploitation) and small-bodied filter-feeders (through interference). Glossosoma populations collapsed in a number of Michigan trout streams since the late 1980s and have been maintained at low levels by recurrent pathogen outbreaks. Here we address the effects on periphyton, grazers, and filter-feeders of parasite-induced Glossosoma reductions in six streams for which considerable pre-and post-collapse data are available, and we compare the results of this large-scale perturbation to responses predicted from a small-scale experiment that had been previously conducted in one of these streams. Periphyton and most grazers and filter-feeders showed marked increases in abundance following reduction in Glossosoma populations. Several grazers that were rare or absent prior to Glossosoma collapse have established sizable populations, suggesting that they had been excluded by competition with Glossosoma. The small-scale experiment successfully predicted the direction of response of most taxa to whole-stream reductions in Glossosoma abundance, but it tended to underestimate the extent and magnitude of Glossosoma's effects in the community. In these systems, observations at larger spatial and temporal scales have been essential to developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms structuring communities.","UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH NAT RESOURCES & ENVIRONM, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA","Kohler, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,"Wiley, Michael/A-6853-2012",,,,,62,111,113,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1997,78,7,,,,,2164,2176,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2164:PORLSE]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ789,WOS:A1997XZ78900020,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

A model for evolution of body size under asymmetric competition within and between species is described. The model links processes operating at the scale of the individual to that of macroscopic evolution through a stochastic mutation-selection process. Phase portraits of evolution in a phenotype space characteristically show character convergence and parallel character shifts, with character divergence being relatively uncommon. The asymptotic states of evolution depend very much on the properties of asymmetric competition. Given relatively weak asymmetries between species, a single equilibrium point exists; this is a local attractor, and its position is determined by the intra- and interspecific asymmetries. When the asymmetries are made stronger, several fixed points may come about, creating further equilibrium points which are local attractors. It is also possible for periodic attractors to occur; such attractors comprise Red Queen dynamics with phenotype values that continue to change without ever settling down to constant values. From certain initial conditions, evolution leading to extinction of one of the species is also a likely outcome.","LEIDEN UNIV, INST EVOLUT & ECOL SCI, NL-2300 AA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","Law, R (corresponding author), UNIV YORK, DEPT BIOL, YORK YO1 5DD, N YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.",,"Dieckmann, Ulf/E-1424-2011","Dieckmann, Ulf/0000-0001-7089-0393; Marrow, Paul/0000-0001-9335-6433",,,,60,77,79,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Possible explanations include nonoverlapping food distributions, interspecific competition, and predation. If food limits distributions, species should forage most successfully in their preferred habitats and should experience poorer food intake rates elsewhere. These same predictions hold if species distributions are shaped by exploitative competition. We tested the foraging success hypothesis and exploitative competition hypothesis as explanations of the habitat distributions of Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli), Black-throated Sparrows (A. bilineata), and Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), which spend the winter in different habitats along an elevational gradient in the Sonoran Desert of southern California. Individuals of each species were transplanted between habitats in a portable aviary and observed while foraging on naturally occurring seeds. Predictions of the foraging success hypothesis and exploitative competition hypothesis were not confirmed. Only Dark-eyed Juncos achieved their highest foraging success in their preferred habitat. Black-throated Sparrows experienced nearly identical foraging success in all three habitats, yet are confined to only one of them naturally. Sage Sparrows foraged more successfully in habitats other than that in which they naturally occur. We conclude that immediate foraging gains do not explain habitat distributions of these birds, and that interference competition, predation, or other unknown factors are responsible. We contrast this finding with that seen in Galapagos finches in which bird distributions closely matched food supply.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT ZOOL, ECOL GRP, VANCOUVER, BC V6T 1Z4, CANADA",,,,,,,,28,6,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1996,77,2,,,,,452,460,,10.2307/2265621,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TY198,WOS:A1996TY19800009,,,,,2021-09-24,

Surveys of naturally breeding populations on an experimental pond site indicated that the two species often compete in the larval phase, and because both species may overwinter as larvae, interactions can occur between disparate size (year) classes. Using an additive design, I conducted field experiments manipulating densities of four species-class combinations (year I and II bullfrogs and green frogs) in the presence of low numbers of the other classes. The design permitted estimates of the effect of manipulated species/classes on different target classes and, because the latter were held constant, the effects of manipulated classes on themselves. Strong competitive effects were found within and between species/classes with one important exception. Neither class of green frogs affected small bullfrogs despite the fact that both had strong effects on large bullfrogs. Both classes of bullfrogs, however, affected both classes of green frogs. In general, smaller classes had a greater per unit biomass effect on target classes than larger classes and tolerated competitive effects better. Independent of size effects, bullfrogs appeared to be better competitors than green frogs because of other traits, presumably greater activity levels. I interpret these results in terms of a simple model of the ontogenetic scaling of foraging costs and gains. This model enables a mechanistic interpretation of the above results through the two components of competitive interactions, effect and response. Larger classes have greater per capita effects on resources, but because the gain curve is decelerating, smaller classes have greater per unit biomass effects. On the other hand, smaller classes respond less to competitors because net gain for these classes is higher of affected less by a decline in resources. I argue that to understand size-structured interactions in many taxa, we must first isolate the underlying ontogenetic or size-scaling component of competitive relations, and then add to these relations the effects of unique species traits.",,"WERNER, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT BIOL, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,66,123,127,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1994,75,1,,,,,197,213,,10.2307/1939394,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MP602,WOS:A1994MP60200019,,,,,2021-09-24,

Rapid evolution can occur over ecological time-scales, potentially resulting in altered temporal variation in abundance and complicating inferences about the consequences of temporal variation. We assessed whether evolution altered the temporal variability in species' abundances in simple assemblages of species. We then compared experimental results to predictions from two-species models to better understand our results in the context of competitive and predator-prey interactions. We compared founder populations and their evolved descendants in experimental communities of ciliates and rotifers. Using a series of orthogonal contrasts, we then evaluated whether: (a) evolutionary history of invaders or (b) residents, (c) co-evolution among invaders and residents, and (d) invasion itself altered temporal variability in species abundances following invasion by a novel species. Using two-species competition and predator-prey models, we also generated predictions to better understand the effects of evolution on temporal variation in the abundances of interacting species. Finally, we compared experimental and modelling results to aid in the interpretation of which interspecific interactions might be affected by ongoing evolution in our communities. In experimental populations, differing evolutionary histories resulted in significant differences among treatments in abundances and temporal variation in abundances of both resident and invading species. For the contrasts, we found evidence that evolutionary history of the invader and residents, co-evolution among invaders and residents, and invasion itself affected temporal variability in abundance, but the importance of each differed for the two communities and the species within those communities. When comparing experimental results to model predictions, the increased abundance and decreased temporal variation in one invader, Euplotes daidaleos, are potentially consistent with evolution resulting in reduced attack rates in the novel community. Evolutionary history alone can affect temporal variation in the abundances of species, generating important consequences for interspecific interactions among species and complicating inferences about the consequences of temporal variability in biological communities.","[Faillace, Cara A.; Morin, Peter J.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Faillace, Cara A.] Natl Ctr Sci Res France, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Moulis, France","Faillace, CA (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",c.faillace@gmail.com,,,Rutgers University; Rutgers University Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution,Rutgers University; Rutgers University Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution,,50,4,4,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Here, we explored the FRs of two land snails that occur in south-western Ontario, one native (Mesodon thyroidus) and one non-indigenous (Cepaea nemoralis) to Canada. The non-indigenous species appears to have low ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities. Consistent with theory, while both species conformed to Type II functional responses, the native species had a significantly higher attack rate (5.30 vs 0.41, respectively) and slightly lower handling time (0.020 vs 0.023), and hence a higher maximum feeding rate (50.0 vs 43.5). The non-indigenous species exhibited a significantly longer time to contact for a variety of food types, and appeared less discriminating of paper that was offered as a non-food type. The non-indigenous species also ate significantly less food when in mixed species trials with the native snail. These feeding patterns match the known low ecological impact of the introduced snail and are consistent with the view that it is an inferior competitor relative to the native species. However, field experimentation is required to clarify whether the largely microallopatric distributions of the two species in south-western Ontario reflect competitive dominance by the native species or other factors such as habitat preference, feeding preferences or predator avoidance. The relative patterns of feeding behaviour and ecological impact are, however, fully in line with recent functional response theory and application.","[Hoxha, Tedi; Crookes, Steve; MacIsaac, Ian; Chang, Xuexiu; Johansson, Mattias; MacIsaac, Hugh J.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Crookes, Steve] Univ Guelph, Biodivers Inst Ontario, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Chang, Xuexiu; MacIsaac, Hugh J.] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Johansson, Mattias] Univ North Georgia, Dept Biol, Gainesville, GA USA; [Dick, Jaimie T.

In this study, we simplified the community assemblage to reduce interspecific competition and gain a better understanding of the role biotic conditions play in creating Yellow Perch fisheries. Yellow Perch were introduced into three recently renovated lakes in an attempt to increase growth rates through reduced interspecific competition and hypothetically allow fish to reach an acceptable size for angler harvest in a shorter period of time compared with four mixed-species lakes. Yellow Perch-only populations exhibited faster growth, potentially resulting from reduced interspecific competition, increased piscivory, and lower levels of activity. Yellow Perch-only populations also had more consistent recruitment, onset of maturation at age 1, and an earlier onset of sexual size dimorphism compared with mixed-species lakes and published literature. While limitations of density dependence were noted, natural resource managers are encouraged to investigate methods that would capitalize on the improved population dynamics of Yellow Perch-only lakes and the release from biotic controls.","[Munter, R.

If resource quality is important for maximizing fitness, then the duration of decision making may be in conflict with other crucial and time consuming tasks, such as anti-predator behaviours or competition monitoring. Individuals facing the risk of predation and/or competition should adjust the duration of decision making and, as a consequence, their level of choosiness for resources. When exposed to predation, the forager could either maintain its level of choosiness for food items but accept a reduction in the amount of food items consumed or it could reduce its level of choosiness and accept all prey items encountered. Under competition risk, individuals are expected to reduce their level of choosiness as slow decision making exposes individuals to a higher risk of opportunity costs. To test these predictions, the level of choosiness of a seed-eating carabid beetle, Harpalus affinis, was examined under 4 different experimental conditions of risk: i) predation risk; ii) intraspecific competition; iii) interspecific competition; and, iv) control. All the risks were simulated using chemical cues from individual conspecifics or beetles of different species that are predatory or granivorous. Our results show that when foraging under the risk of predation, H. affinis individuals significantly reduce their level of choosiness for seeds. Reductions in level of choosiness for food items might serve as a sensible strategy to reduce both the total duration of a foraging task and the cognitive load of the food quality assessment. No significant differences were observed when individuals were exposed to competition cues. Competition, (i.e opportunity cost) may not be perceived as risk high enough to induce changes in the level of choosiness. Our results suggest that considering the amount of items consumed, alone, would be a misleading metric when assessing individual response to a risk of predation. Foraging studies should therefore also take in account the decision making process.","[Charalabidis, Alice; Petit, Sandrine; Bohan, David A.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, Dijon, France; [Charalabidis, Alice; Dechaume-Moncharmont, Francois-Xavier] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR CNRS Biogeosci 6282, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Dijon, France","Bohan, DA (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, Dijon, France.",David.Bohan@inra.fr,"Petit, Sandrine/C-3310-2013; Dechaume-Moncharmont, Francois-Xavier/F-2394-2011; Bohan, David A/D-7992-2012","Petit, Sandrine/0000-0001-8781-8873; Dechaume-Moncharmont, Francois-Xavier/0000-0001-7607-8224; Bohan, David A/0000-0001-5656-775X; Charalabidis, Alice/0000-0002-7225-2114","Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change; European Research Area Network in the Coordinated-Integrated Pest Management in Europe Strategic Research Agenda (FACCE ERA-NET C-IPM) [00000877]; French Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12-Agro-0006, ANR-13-Agro-0001]; Institute Nationale de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA); Region of Burgundy Franche-Comte","This work was supported by the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change, European Research Area Network in the Coordinated-Integrated Pest Management in Europe Strategic Research Agenda (FACCE ERA-NET C-IPM) project BioAWARE (AFB Projet 00000877, https://www.facceipi.com) and the PEERLESS (ANR-12-Agro-0006) and AGROBIOSE (ANR-13-Agro-0001) grants from the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/) to DB and SP.

Their ranges and dispersal rates vary across Europe, which may result from their interspecific interactions, accelerating or reducing migrations. We checked this hypothesis by testing interference competition among co-occurring invaders: Dikerogammarus villosus, D. haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides. We used 140-cm long tanks (gravel substratum), divided into seven compartments. We introduced 25 residents into the outermost compartment, separated with a barrier. After 1 h, we introduced 25 intruders. After the next 1 h, we removed the barrier and the gammarids dispersed in the tank. After 4 or 20 h, we counted the gammarids in the compartments. We tested all pairwise species combinations and single-species controls. Dikerogammarus villosus displaced other species (P. robustoides only after 4 h) and reduced its own motility after 20 h in their presence. Pontogammarus robustoides stimulated the short-time migrations of D. villosus intruders and of D. haemobaphes. As P. robustoides migrated spontaneously much more than Dikerogammarus spp., its impact decreased after longer time. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes stimulated the short-time movement of P. robustoides intruders but reduced the long-time relocation of this species. In general, gammarid dispersal increased in the presence of stronger competitors (D. villosus and P. robustoides, especially residents) and decreased in response to weaker competitors (D. haemobaphes). Thus, competitive interactions may affect dispersal of invasive gammarids and contribute to the fastest spread of the weakest competitor, D. haemobaphes observed in the field, whereas the strongest species, D. villosus was the latest newcomer in many novel areas.","[Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland; [Rachalewski, Michal; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina] Univ Lodz, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Hydrobiol, Lodz, Poland","Kobak, J (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland.",jkob73@umk.pl,"Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina/E-4234-2015","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina/0000-0003-4498-5107","National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland [2011/03/D/NZ8/03012, 2012/05/B/NZ8/00479]",The authors would like to thank Lukasz Jermacz and Kamil Hupalo for help in collecting animals used in the experiments.

For this purpose, experiments of interspecific predation, competition and aggregation were performed. Results show that neither Dermestes maculatus adults nor larvae interact with Lucilia sericata larvae (maggots): they were not attracted to a place where L. sericata larvae were present and they did not eat them either. However, without other food source available (no meat), starved D. haemorrhoidalis larvae did eat pupae of Lucilia sericata, which means they might be able to remove evidences of flies development. In the second part of the study, experiments failed to explain why only a single species of Dermestidae is generally observed on human corpses. Indeed, we did not observe segregation between Dermestes maculatus and Dermestes haemorrhoidalis: these 2 species were able to aggregate on the same spot.

Although it is widely assumed that invasive species impact will increase with density, theory suggests interspecific competition may diminish at high densities due to increased intraspecific interactions. To test this theory, we experimentally examined intra- and interspecific interactions between a globally invasive fish, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and three native species at different round goby densities in a tributary of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Eighteen 2.25 m(2) enclosures were stocked with native fish species at natural abundances, while round gobies were stocked at three different densities: 0 m(-2), 2.7 m(-2), and 10.7 m(-2). After 52 days, native fish growth rate was significantly reduced in the low density goby treatment, while growth in the high density goby treatment mirrored the goby-free treatment for two of three native species. Invertebrate density and gut content weight of native fishes did not differ among treatments. Conversely, gut content weight and growth of round gobies were lower in the high goby density treatment, suggesting interactions between round gobies and native fishes are mediated by interference competition amongst gobies. Our experiment provides evidence that invasive species effects may diminish at high densities, possibly due to increased intraspecific interactions. This is consistent with some ecological theory, and cautions against the assumption that invasive species at moderate densities have low impact.","[Kornis, Matthew S.; Carlson, Jedchada; Lehrer-Brey, Gabrielle; Vander Zanden, M.

The main factors that are thought to influence population size are either resources (bottom-up), or predation (top-down), or interspecific competition (parallel). However, there are highly variable and often contradictory results regarding their relative strengths and influence. These varied results are often interpreted as indicating shifting control among the three main factors, or a complex, nonlinear relationship among environmental variables, resource availability, predation, and competition. We argue here that there is a missing link in our understanding of predator-prey dynamics. We explore whether the landscape-of-fear model can help us clarify the inconsistencies and increase our understanding of the roles, extent, and possible interactions of top-down, bottom-up, and parallel factors on prey population abundance. We propose two main predictions derived from the landscape-of-fear model: (1) for a single species, we suggest that as the makeup of the landscape of fear changes from relatively safe to relatively risky, bottom-up impacts switch from strong to weak as top-down impacts go from weak to strong; (2) for two or more species, interspecific competitive interactions produce various combinations of bottom-up, top-down, and parallel impacts depending on the dominant competing species and whether the landscapes of fear are shared or distinctive among competing species.

On the local scale of interacting species, the response of diversity to warming will depend much on the change in interspecific interactions such as competition or predation. Using a phytoplankton model community, we conducted a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial long-term microcosm experiment (16 months) with an underlying seasonal temperature profile. We manipulated the mean temperature (T-mean), the temperature variance (T-var), and the presence of consumers (ciliates) and monitored treatment effects on algal biomass, species composition and species richness. Temperature effects on algal biomass depended on the seasonal development and consumer presence. Algal biomass decreased with increasing T-mean at consumer absence, but increased at consumer presence. Overall, algal biomass decreased with increasing T-var. Consumer presence reduced algal biomass from summer to winter, but then ciliates and the consumer effect disappeared. Almost all treatment combinations collapsed to monocultures after 16 months, but extinction occurred faster at higher T-mean (especially at consumer absence) and slower at consumer presence (especially at higher T-mean). Contrasting our predictions, increasing T-var reduced richness and increased extinction rate. The treatment effects on biomass and richness were not independent, as algal species richness and biomass were positively correlated. Moreover, accelerated loss of species was consistently correlated to higher temporal variability in biomass. In conclusion, altered temperature regimes strongly affected algal biomass and diversity by interdependently altering competitive and consumer interactions.","[Burgmer, Tanja; Hillebrand, Helmut] Univ Cologne, Inst Bot, DE-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Hillebrand, Helmut] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, DE-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany","Burgmer, T (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Bot, Gyrhofstr 15, DE-50931 Cologne, Germany.",hillebrand@icbm.de,"Hillebrand, Helmut/I-1717-2014","Hillebrand, Helmut/0000-0001-7449-1613",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [Hi 848/3-1],"We thank Helga Tiebel, Sabine Floder and Leo Leson for help during the experiment.

In general, the gammarid amphipods had a significant overlap in habitat selection. Gammarids modified the habitat choices of co-occurring species but impacts were disproportional among species. The effects of G. tigrinus on G. salinus were stronger than vice versa. However, the effects varied among months, and the negative responses were not observed in all habitats.

However, the evolutionary consequences of indirect interactions are rarely considered. Here I conduct selection experiments and examine the evolutionary response of Colpoda sp., a ciliated protozoan, to other members of the inquiline community of purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea). I measured the evolution of six traits in response to (1) predation by mosquito larvae, (2) competition from other ciliated protozoans, and (3) simultaneous predation and competition. The latter treatment incorporated both direct effects and indirect effects due to interactions between predators and competitors. Population growth rate and cell size evolved in response to direct effects of predators and competitors. However, trait values in the multispecies treatment were similar to those in the monoculture treatment, indicating that direct effects were offset by strong indirect effects on the evolution of traits. For most of the traits measured, indirect effects were opposed to, and often stronger than, direct effects. These indirect effects occurred as a result of behavioral changes of the predator in the presence of competitors and as a result of reduced densities of competitors in the presence of predators. Incorporating indirect effects provides a more realistic description of how species evolve in complex natural communities.","[Terhorst, Casey P.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Terhorst, CP (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",casey.terhorst@kbs.msu.edu,,,"Florida State University (FSU); FSU English Department; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0519170, DEB-0716891]","This work could not have been accomplished without valuable assistance in the laboratory from F.

Some animals gain information about nearby predators by eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls. Despite having well-developed ears, most lizards do not use vocal information for intraspecific communication, and few studies have shown practical use of the ears in wild lizards. Here, we show that the Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana (Oplurus cuvieri cuvieri) obtains auditory signals for predator detection. The Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana and the Madagascar paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone mutata) are syntopic inhabitants of the Ampijoroa dry deciduous forest of Madagascar. The iguana and the flycatcher have neither a predator-prey relationship nor resource competition, but they have shared predators such as raptors and snakes. Using playback experiments, we demonstrated that the iguana discriminates mobbing alarm calls of the flycatcher from its songs and then enhances its vigilance behaviour. Our results demonstrate the occurrence of an asymmetrical ecological relationship between the Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana and the paradise flycatcher through eavesdropping on information about the presence of predators. This implies that indirect interspecific interactions through information recognition may be more common than generally thought in an animal community.","[Ito, Ryo; Mori, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Ito, R (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",r.ito@ethol.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yang, Ruizhe/G-5801-2011",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Global COE ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A06]","The original idea for this study was inspired during discussions with M.

There has been much research into the implications of such variation for intraspecific interactions, yet little investigation into its role in influencing interspecific interactions outside of a predator-prey context. In this study, we investigated the role of individual-level behavioural variation in determining the outcomes of interactions between two ecologically similar fishes, the threespine and ninespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus and Pungitius pungitius). Experiment 1 asked whether individuals of both species were consistent in their expression of two behaviours: activity in novel surroundings and latency to attack prey. For each behaviour, focal individuals were assayed twice, 10 days apart. Performances were positively correlated between exposures, suggesting behavioural consistency within individuals, at least over this timescale. Experiment 2 revealed not only differences in habitat use described both by species-level variation, with ninespines spending more time in vegetated areas, but also by individual differences, with more active individuals of both species spending more time in open water than in vegetation. Experiment 3 revealed that when heterospecific pairs competed for prey, bolder individuals consumed a greater share, irrespective of species. These findings suggest that individual-level variation can facilitate overlap in habitat use between heterospecifics and also determine the outcomes of resource contests when they meet. We discuss how this might vary between populations as a function of prevailing selection pressures and suggest approaches for testing our predictions.","[Webster, M.

If two species are distributed across an environmental gradient, and differ in their ability to cope with environmental conditions, the outcome of competitive interactions may be dependent on prevailing abiotic conditions. Two closely related species of poison frogs in north-central Peru were observed to occupy parapatric distributions across an elevation gradient. Ameerega bassleri is a highland endemic restricted to a small region of Peru, and A. trivittata is distributed throughout lowland Amazonia. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of an abiotic factor (elevation) on two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition), by measuring growth and survival in the larvae of A. trivittata and A. bassleri. Using mesocosm experiments arranged in a fractional factorial design, we found that (1) A. bassleri had a strong negative effect on the growth and survival of A. trivittata regardless of elevation, (2) A. trivittata had no effect on the growth of A. bassleri at either elevation, but did appear to reduce the survival of A. bassleri more strongly in the lowlands than highlands, (3) lowland conditions uniformly reduced survival in all treatments and in both species, and (4) competition was strongly asymmetric between A. bassleri and A. trivittata. We conclude that the perceived low density of A. trivittata in highland sites may be influenced by the presence of A. bassleri, but the lower limit to the distribution of A. bassleri cannot be explained by competition with A. trivittata and may be due to physiological constraints imposed by lowland conditions.","[Twomey, Evan; Summers, Kyle] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Morales, Victor] Univ Ricardo Palma, Fac Ciencias Biol, Lima, Peru","Twomey, E (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",emt0424@mail.ecu.edu,,,,,,66,14,15,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2008,117,8,,,,,1175,1184,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16676.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,335KE,WOS:000258288700006,,,,,2021-09-24,

However, predators can alter such competitive interactions substantially. Predation can promote the coexistence of species in a situation where it would otherwise be impossible, for example if a tradeoff between the competitive abilities and predation resistance of the prey species exists. The field vole Microtus agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis are sympatric grassland species, which compete for the same resources. At the population level sibling voles are suggested to be superior competitors to field voles, yet more vulnerable to predation. We tested the effects of predation on the two species in 0.5 ha outdoor enclosures by exposing vole populations to radio-collared freely-hunting least weasels Mustela nivalis nivalis for three weeks. Lethal and non-lethal impacts of predation limited population densities of both species during and after the experimental period, but the effect was more pronounced in sibling voles in which population densities decreased markedly during the treatment period and even after that. Field vole population densities remained stable under weasel predation, while densities increased in controls. Survival in both species was lower in treatment populations compared to controls, but the effect tended to be more pronounced in sibling voles and in females of both species. The average mass of adults in both species declined in the treatment populations. These results suggest that predation by least weasels can limit vole populations locally, even during favourable summer conditions, and have extended negative effects on the dynamics of vole populations. In addition, predation alleviated interspecific competition between the vole species and is, therefore, a potential factor enabling the coexistence of them.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Biomed & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Koivisto, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",elanko@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509",,,,57,8,8,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2008,117,1,,,,,6,12,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15938.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,237PG,WOS:000251387000002,,,,,2021-09-24,

Anuran larvae have therefore been widely studied as a model system for competition. Body size and activity level are considered the most important factors that influence the outcome of competition between tadpoles. As species from temporary ponds normally show higher activity levels in order to achieve rapid growth and thus reduce the risk of desiccation, these species are often considered superior competitors. We designed several laboratory experiments to examine the intra- and interspecific effects on growth rate, mass at metamorphosis and survival to metamorphosis of six species in a Mediterranean area. Body size and activity level were used as explanatory covariables to determine competitive ability among species. An asymmetric and hierarchical relationship was found among the six species. Larger tadpole species were more successful in competitive interactions than smaller ones, but no relationship was found between activity level and competition effects. Species typically found in temporary ponds (Pelodytes punctatus and Bufo calamita) were considered poor competitors in contrast with other communities studied. Species with low competitive ability can persist by using refuges in which competition is reduced (e.g. ephemeral ponds).","Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Richter-Boix, A (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Av Diagonal 645, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",arichterboix@ub.edu,"Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012; Llorente, Gustavo A./I-3097-2015","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Llorente, Gustavo A./0000-0002-0310-8290",,,,75,12,13,1,22,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0173-5373,1568-5381,,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,Amphib.

While we have a good understanding of how trait changes affect predation risk, we lack a mechanistic understanding of why predator-induced phenotypes differ in growth. Using two mesocosm experiments, we combined phenotypic plasticity theory with predictions from optimal digestion theory to demonstrate that intra- and interspecific competition induced relatively long guts while predators induced relatively short guts. The longer guts induced by competition appear to be an adaptive response that allows more efficient digestion and more rapid growth whereas the shorter guts induced by predators appear to result from a tradeoff of building larger tails in predator environments at the cost of smaller bodies. By combining these two bodies of theory, we now have a much better understanding of the mechanisms that cause the phenotypic trade-offs that select for inducible defences.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea@pitt.edu,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014",,,,,47,123,125,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

This study examined whether mangrove recruitment differs among species with respect to the effect of forest gap size, ground disturbance, position along an intertidal gradient and canopy membership. 3 The canopy of a tropical mangrove forest in northern Australia was experimentally manipulated to create two gap sizes (50 m(2) and 225 m(2)) in low and high intertidal forests with or without sediment disturbance. Propagules of six species, from three mangrove families, were sown into treatments and their predation, establishment, growth and survival measured for 5 years. 4 All species established, and five survived, in canopy gaps in both high and low intertidal positions. Interspecific difference in establishment, growth and survival of seedlings in two intertidal positions were not closely matched to canopy membership and hence this does not explain zonation. 5 No seedlings survived under the canopy and there was little evidence for shade-tolerant species. The interactions between canopy treatments and sediment disturbance that would have indicated gap partitioning were not detected. Seedling growth and survival was enhanced in large canopy gaps but there were no growth differences among species that matched canopy membership of plots. 6 Most species appear to be able to recruit in canopy gaps if there is no dispersal limitation. Rather, the range of species available to fill gaps is limited because predation of propagules advantages species that are from the adjacent canopy. Lack of partitioning of resources within gaps by species may result in the exclusion of competitors that are not canopy members, further reducing coexistence.","Univ New England, Sch Environm Sci & Nat Resources Management, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia","Clarke, PJ (corresponding author), Univ New England, Sch Environm Sci & Nat Resources Management, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",pclarke1@metz.une.edu.au,"Clarke, Peter/D-6403-2012",,,,,33,42,44,0,23,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Such nonlethal predator effects have been abundantly demonstrated empirically in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. But the extent to which changes in species traits alter short-term responses such as growth rate or probability of survival is not clear. Here we develop models to examine the nonlethal effects of predators on prey growth. Our analyses illustrate how the nonlethal effects of predators on individual prey growth depend on environmental context; e.g., factors such as focal species density, competitor density, resource dynamics, and the timescale over which the interactions occur. This context dependence arises because of complex interactions of three mechanisms; (1) the direct negative effect of induced reduction in foraging rates, which is opposed by (2) the potential positive effects of reductions in intra- and interspecific competition, and (3) resource responses to reduced foraging. We present new empirical work, and review previous work, on larval-anuran growth that is in general support of model predictions. The framework presented here can serve to facilitate the design and interpretation of experimental results and predict how the nonlethal predator effect on prey growth in natural systems will vary over time and space.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Peacor, SD (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",peacor@msu.edu,,,,,,49,36,37,0,15,SCIENCE FROM ISRAEL-DIVISION OF LASER PAGES PUBL LTD,JERUSALEM,"PO BOX 34299, JERUSALEM 91341, ISRAEL",0021-2210,,,ISR J ZOOL,Isr.

Even though this type of indirect interaction has received significant theoretical and empirical attention, alternative mechanisms producing similar results have not been considered in the literature. In this paper we document the results of a series of microcosm experiments aimed to evaluate the importance of the generalist consumer Daphnia ambigua upon the relative abundance of the more specialized Moina micrura and Ceriodaphnia dubia (Cladocera). We compared the population parameters of M. micrura and C. dubia when alone, in coexistence, and in the presence and absence of D. ambigua. While M. micrura and C. dubia did not show evidence for interspecific competition, the addition of D. ambigua promoted a reduction in the maximal population density of M. micrura, causing a pattern of indirect competition with C. dubia that resembles predator-mediated apparent competition. This result suggests that non-predatory interactions need to be considered as a potential source of apparent interactions in natural communities.","Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile","Martinez, G (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Casilla 653, Santiago, Chile.",gingerma@ing.uchile.cl,,"Medel, Rodrigo/0000-0001-9955-764X",,,,36,4,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2002,97,1,,,,,111,115,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970111.x,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,559JC,WOS:000176022200011,,,,,2021-09-24,

These measurements are used to quantify elements of 'community matrices', which are coefficients summarizing dynamics. In many cases, experimental manipulations are used to estimate certain interactions that are deemed to be likely to be of most dynamic significance (most 'intense'), while other relationships within the community are estimated by using correlative means. These data are then linked by using statistical methods such as path analysis. The two forms of data are gathered by using very different methods: (1) experiments, usually involving confinement (or exclosure); and (2) quadrat- or transect-based information. A major issue is whether information from these two different sources are 'compatible', especially in relation to whether they have similar scalar responses. Can they be reliably mixed? Here, quadrat- and enclosure-based information are derived for the same model systems to evaluate whether scalar responses are consistent between the two forms of information. Interactions between pairs of three forms of forager are considered. For two of these forms, biases are generally consistent between enclosure and quadrat data indicating that they have similar scalar responses. However, for a third foraging form that has more 'intelligent' foraging and decision-making behaviour, major inconsistencies in deductions and biases arise. These latter results are discussed in terms of the implications for construction of community matrices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The animal communities in phytotelmata-plant-held waters-are a convenient exception to this generalization. Tree holes, bamboo internodes, pitcher plants, tank bromeliads, and water-retaining plant axils contain a rich fauna, principally of arthropods, which constitute more or less complex, highly discrete food webs. They are widespread and replicated. The explanations for the community structure observed in these systems may call on bottom-up mechanisms such as simple environmental limitations, competition, predation, and facilitation, or they may adduce grander top-down theories, which explore biogeographic, energetic, dynamic, or biodiversity-related constraints. The existence of the bottom-up mechanisms is well established in experimental systems, and their consequences may be apparent in naturally occurring food webs. Top-down mechanisms demand a more holistic approach and are more difficult to test either by pattern analysis or experimental manipulation. The synoptic explanation of community composition and structure demands a multidimensional approach best expressed as a heuristic template. Phytotelmata represent nearly ideal natural instruments for further study of food web dynamics, and exciting opportunities exist for the development and testing of community theories through their manipulation.","Griffith Univ, Australian Sch Environm Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia","Kitching, RL (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Sch Environm Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",r.kitching@mailbox.gu.edu.au,"Kitching, Roger/C-5102-2009",,,,,184,140,150,3,73,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

The effect of a piscivore, the smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), on intraspecific and interspecific interactions involving crayfish (Crustacea: Cambaridae: Cambarus longulus) and hellgrammites (Insecta: Megaloptera: Corydalus cornutus) was examined. Three possible interactions were recognized in all experiments: (1) the refuge occupant was evicted by an intruder; (2) the refuge occupant excluded the intruder from the refuge; (3) the occupant and the intruder shared the refuge. The size of both crayfish and hellgrammites had a statistically significant effect on the outcome of interspecific and intraspecific interactions, larger individuals being more successful at excluding or evicting smaller individuals from a refuge. The effect of size on the interactions, however, was tempered by the effects of prior occupancy of the refuge (owner-intruder models), allowing smaller individuals of both species to maintain occupancy of the refuge when faced with a larger intruder in about one-third of all trials. There was no significant effect of gender on the outcome of interactions between male and female crayfish. The presence of a fish (Micropterus dolomieu) significantly altered the outcome of interspecific and intraspecific interactions. Not only were both species more likely to gain access to the refuge as an intruder, but the occupant was less likely to be evicted, resulting in a greatly increased incidence of sharing of the refuge in the presence of the fish. Refuge sharing by crayfish never occurred unless a fish was present. Refuge sharing by hellgrammites was an especially important interaction in the presence of fish.","Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","Smock, LA (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",Lsmock@saturn.vcu.edu,,,,,,21,7,7,0,8,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

We examined a case where both functions are accomplished in one song type but seem to be separated into different song parts. Therefore, we firstly tried to confirm the functional separation of the male and female directed parts through recording the natural occurrence of the two song parts and secondly we tried to evaluate possible benefits of such a two part song by means of playback experiments. The song of male moustached warblers Acrocephalus melanopogon consists of a reed warbler-like warbling part often initiated by a repetiton of one simple whistle note (whistle part). According to the general intra-intersexual hypothesis, specifically developed for Acrocephalus warblers, the simple stereotyped beginning (whistle part) should be directed to male competitors and the complex ending (warbling part) to females. We obtained verification of this hypothesis through behavioural observations under natural conditions. For instance, the proportion of warbling song decreases after mating and the relationship between length of warbling song and mating interval - the days between arrival until mating of males - suggests that the warbling part is important for female attraction. The whistle part decreases less steeply after mating and actually increases significantly during the post-fertile period. Furthermore, the occurrence of whistling is related to predator disturbance and intraspecific territorial intrusions. Concerning possible benefits, by offering different playback types to territory holders, fewer males attacked the speaker if whistle intensity increased. So, there seems to be a clear benefit of introducing the song with a male oriented message. The same advantage seems to hold in interspecific context with the reed warbler which was also tested by playback experiments.",,"Fessl, B (corresponding author), KONRAD LORENZ INST VERGLEICHENDE VERHALTENSFORSCH,SAVOYENSTR 1A,A-1160 VIENNA,AUSTRIA.",,,"Fessl, Birgit/0000-0003-1260-6002",,,,37,12,13,0,5,UNIV FIRENZE ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,FLORENCE,"ATTN: PROF.

Recruitment failure was studied on a long-term basis, using data on size structure accumulated in our data base. No inter or intraspecific competition was detected between the two species in the enclosure experiment, since neither species affected survivorship or biomass of the other. No evidence of an alternative to man predator of adults was found, but only a very low predation exerted by Larus dominicanus, Sicyases sanguineus. Stichaster striatus and Rattus rattus. A recruitment failure was detected for F. picta at the exposed area, and we detected the entry of individuals smaller than 30 mm during the last three years in the protected area. F. limbata recruited mainly in the exposed area. These results suggest us to evaluate the availability of suitable habitats that provide a refuge to predation and food requirements that warrant the survival of settlers.",,"Duarte, WE (corresponding author), UNIV AUSTRAL CHILE,FAC CIENCIAS,INST ECOL & EVOLUC,VALDIVIA,CHILE.",,,,,,,56,7,7,0,8,SOC BIOL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 14164 CORREO, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

The question becomes more complex when competition occurs between size-structured populations of predators in which the nature of the interaction extends beyond exploitative competition. I conducted a field experiment examining the interactions between fingerling brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis (total length 78-101 mm), and larval spring salamanders, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (snout-vent length 35.7-62.4 mm), in an array of replicate experimental streams. Brook trout affected both the growth and survival of larval spring salamanders, reducing survival by 50% and growth by > 90% for mass and 44% for SVL. Brook trout also altered the habitat use of larval G. porphyriticus. G. porphyriticus had no effect on any of the responses of fingerling S. fontinalis. These results parallel those found in an earlier experiment on interactions between small adult brook trout and larval spring salamanders. Interactions between size-structured populations of G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis are characterized by strong asymmetry in favor of S. fontinalis across a wide range of relative body sizes. This calls into question the mechanisms allowing continued coexistence of G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis, and in general, the persistence of stream salamanders with predatory fish. Persistence is likely a complex function of the interactions between the life history and local demography of both G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis, coupled with characteristics of the local environment, rather than the result of classic mechanisms of species coexistence such as niche divergence or alpha selection. Such complex mechanisms of species coexistence are likely more common in situations involving competition between size-structured populations than single factor explanations based on models of exploitative competition between competitors of fixed body sizes and life stages.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,,,,,,72,47,48,0,21,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,1995,73,2,,,,,188,198,,10.2307/3545907,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH162,WOS:A1995RH16200006,,,,,2021-09-24,

The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive relationships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously identified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these ''classic'' types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference competition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed ''apparent predation'' and ''indirect defense'' were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35%) and apparent competition (25%) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8%) was least common in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect effects accounted for approximate to 40% of the change in community structure resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24-61%. The proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with web species richness, indicating that strong direct interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level of alteration of community structure regardless of the lever of web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias toward manipulation of consumers over manipulation of basal species, some predator-initiated indirect effect types were scarce while some basal species-initiated types were common. While the frequency of exploitation competition may have been underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this effect should have been detected in many of the studies and reported: and the most intensively studied individual webs did not report frequencies differing much from the average. This analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of theory.",,"MENGE, BA (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA.",,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012",,,,,146,576,595,2,279,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Here I present experimental evidence on the response of two species of gerbils (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum) to the presence of barn owls. I conducted the experiments in a large aviary. Both gerbils responded to the presence of barn owl predators by foraging in fewer resource patches (seed trays) and by quitting foraged resource patches at a higher resource harvest rate (giving-up density of resource; GUD). This reduced the amount of time gerbils were exposed to owl predation, and hence the encounter rate of owls with gerbils, i.e., behavioral resource depression. Thus, the presence of owls imposes a foraging cost on gerbils due to risk of predation, and also on the owls themselves due to resource depression. I then examined how resource depression relaxed over time following exposure to owls. In the days following an encounter with the predator, the reduction in foraging activity for both gerbil species eased. Increasing numbers of trays were foraged each day, and GUDs in seed trays declined. The two gerbils differed in their rate of recovery, with G. pyramidum returning to prepredator levels of foraging after 1 or 2 nights and G. allenbyi taking 5 nights or longer. Interspecific differences in recovery rates may be based on differences between the species in vulnerability to predation and/or ability to detect the presence of predators. The differences in recovery rates may be due to optimal memory windows or decay rates, where differences between species are based on risk of predation or on how perceived risk changes with time since a predator was last encountered. Finally, differences between or among competitors in recovery from resource depression may provide foraging opportunities in time for the species which recover most quickly and may have implications for species coexistence.",,"KOTLER, BP (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,IL-84993 SEDE BOQER,ISRAEL.",,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,41,63,65,0,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

I manipulated the density of con- and heterospecifics in an additive design while keeping water volume and per capita food rations constant. Additional treatments included altering food concentration and reversing an initial size advantage of one of the species. There was no evidence of intraspecific interference competition in either species. There were strong asymmetric interspecific effects; the leopard frog depressed growth of the wood frog in mixed-species treatments whereas the wood frog had no negative effects on the leopard frog. These interspecific effects appear to be largely due to exploitative competition. Reversing initial size advantages of the species did not affect the qualitative outcome of competition, though the effect of the leopard frog on the wood frog was diminished when wood frogs were initially 30% larger. The leopard frog was consistently more active than the wood frog; I argue that this difference in activity contributes to the competitive superiority of the leopard frog in these experiments.

The impact of these processes on the competition and coexistence of the two copepod species was examined with a small strategic model which could be solved analytically, and a detailed numerical simulation model integrating comprehensive experimental evidence with theoretical concepts about species coexistence. In the strategic model considering the major interactions between the two populations, no stable coexistence was achieved within a reasonable parameter range under steady state conditions. However, in the numerical simulation model, which included in addition to many biological details the spatial heterogeneity of the biotope, both species coexisted for a wide and sensible parameter range. Model results suggest that in the present case study, competition is mainly caused by common predators (i.e. carnivorous zooplankton), but not by utilization of common resources. Competition for common resources is weak and diffuse, because of numerous other herbivores. Predation of A. tonsa on nauplii of both species enhances intra-specific and interspecific competition at high abundances but despite being species-specific it does not support coexistence within a reasonable parameter range. Non-selective predation by carnivorous zooplankton depending on the combined abundance of the two prey species appears as the main factor promoting competition between copepod species. At the same time, it is - at least in the model - the most important mechanism of coexistence if the prey species are spatially heterogeneously distributed and the predation pressure relies on the local prey density. Revealing this mechanism of coexistence allows a better explanation for the observed spatial distribution of estuarine copepod species.","UNIV OLDENBURG, FACHBEREICH ECOL MODELLING 6, W-2900 OLDENBURG, GERMANY",,,,,,,,46,3,4,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Despite this, no study has analysed multispecies interactions by combining such a high number of aspects, mostly because the experimental manipulation of studied populations is rarely possible. In our work, we assessed several aspects of interspecific interactions in a rodent assembly composed by three species, by examining diet and temporal- niche partitioning, as well as relevant ectoparasite load and predation pressure, in a natural environment. We analysed stomach contents and ectoparasite load of 78 individuals belonging to all the species, whereas activity rhythms were measured with camera trapping (2200 night-traps, throughout 1 year). Our findings showed that the largest-sized species, i.e. the brown rat Rattus norvegicus was the strongest competitor and may affect diet, temporal behaviour and susceptibility to parasites of smaller-sized ones, i.e. the black rat Rattus rattus and the house mouse Mus domesticus. Larger-sized species showed a broader trophic niche with respect to smaller-sized ones, whereas the smallest species seemed to avoid the largest ones by shifting its temporal activity when the latter was mostly inactive. Larger-sized species may also act as potential predators towards smaller ones, which are also more vulnerable to ectoparasite infestation and to the predation by the only raptor bird present in the study area, the barn owl Tyto alba. We therefore highlight the importance to carry out community-wide studies, to understand interspecific intraguild relationships.","[Mori, Emiliano; Ferretti, F.; Fattorini, N.] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, SI, Italy","Mori, E (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, SI, Italy.",moriemiliano@tiscali.it,"Fattorini, Niccolo/AAJ-9976-2020","Fattorini, Niccolo/0000-0001-8022-7464; Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0002-0414-1615",,,,107,11,12,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

According to the specialist predator hypothesis, reciprocal interactions between voles and small predators that specialize on voles, such as weasels, can cause multiannual cycles. A fundamental feature of classical weasel-vole models is a long time-lag in the numerical response of the predator to variations in prey abundance: weasel abundance increases with that of voles and peaks approximately 1 yr later. We investigated the numerical response of the common weasel (Mustela nivalis) to fluctuating abundances of common voles (Microtus arvalis) in recently colonized agrosteppes of Castilla-y-Leon, northwestern Spain, at the southern limit of the species' range. Populations of both weasels and voles exhibited multiannual cycles with a 3-yr period. Weasels responded quickly and numerically to changes in common-vole abundance, with a time lag between prey and weasel abundance that did not exceed 4 months and occurred during the breeding season, reflecting the quick conversion of prey into predator offspring and/or immigration to sites with high vole populations. We found no evidence of a sustained, high weasel abundance following vole abundance peaks. Weasel population growth rates showed spatial synchrony across study sites approximately 60 km apart. Weasel dynamics were more synchronized with that of common voles than with other prey species (mice or shrews). However, asynchrony within, as well as among sites, in the abundance of voles and alternative prey suggests that weasel mobility could allow them to avoid starvation during low-vole phases, precluding the emergence of prolonged time lag in the numerical response to voles. Our observations are inconsistent with the specialist predator hypothesis as currently formulated, and suggest that weasels might follow rather than cause the vole cycles in northwestern Spain. The reliance of a specialized predator on a functional group of prey such as small rodents does not necessarily lead to a long delay in the numerical response by the predator, depending on the spatial and interspecific synchrony in prey dynamics.","[Mougeot, Francois] Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Rondo Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [Lambin, Xavier] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth; Romairone, Juan; Luque-Larena, Juan-Jose] Univ Valladolid, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agr, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, E-34004 Palencia, Spain; [Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth; Romairone, Juan; Luque-Larena, Juan-Jose] Inst Univ Invest Gest Forestal Sostenible, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, E-34004 Palencia, Spain","Mougeot, F (corresponding author), Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Rondo Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.",francois.mougeot@uclm.es,"Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011; Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth/E-7922-2016; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/D-6454-2014; Mougeot, Francois/B-1894-2009","Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth/0000-0001-8435-6386; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/0000-0001-6425-637X; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275","project ECOCYCLES (Era-net European project) [EUI2008-03641, EUI2008-03658]; project ECOVOLE [CGL2012-35348]; project ECOTULA [CGL2015-66962-C2-1-R]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G002045/1]","This work was funded through the projects ECOCYCLES (BIODIVERSA 2008, Era-net European project, EUI2008-03641 and EUI2008-03658), ECOVOLE (CGL2012-35348), and ECOTULA (CGL2015-66962-C2-1-R; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain), and by NERC NE/G002045/1 to XL.

Sudden Oak Death (SOD), caused by Phytophthora ramorum (Oomycota), is an introduced disease causing large-scale tree mortality. Two additional Phytophthora species, Phytophthora nemorosa and Phytophthora pseudosyringae, cause significantly lower oak mortality, yet they also commonly colonize leaves of Umbellularia californica, the major transmissive host of SOD in California. We combined field surveys and inoculation experiments to understand disease prevalence dynamics and competitive interactions among these pathogen species. Despite the broader geographic distribution of P. nemorosa with respect to that of P. ramorum, our results suggest that P. nemorosa exhibits a narrower ecological amplitude and, in any given region, occupies fewer sites than P. ramorum. Our results additionally suggest that, perhaps due to priority effects, P. nemorosa can persist at levels comparable to those of P. ramorum in ecologically suitable plots when climate favors P. ramorum dormancy. However, P. ramorum prevalence increases to levels higher than those of the competing species when abundant rainfall triggers its sporulation.

We conducted field research and an experiment to elucidate direct and indirect interactions among micro- and filamentous algae, their consumers (fingernail clams and water fleas consume the former and chironomids the latter), and loaches that prey on water fleas and chironomids. The experiment examined the effects loaches and fingernail clams have on algae biomass. Fingernail clams reduced microalgae biomass by filter feeding, while loaches increased it by feeding on water fleas. Loach predation on water fleas increased the biomass of microalgae indirectly, which might have led to an increased density of fingernail clams. Filter feeding on microalgae by fingernail clams increased the density of filamentous algae, a potential competitor of microalgae, suggesting that fingernail clams increase the density of chironomids by enhancing their diet, which may then increase the density of the loaches that prey on chironomids. Field research revealed a positive spatial association between loaches and fingernail clams, attributable to their mutual food resource facilitation.","[Takayanagi, Haruki; Yasuda, Hironori] Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, 1-23 Wakaba Machi, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan; [Takayanagi, Haruki; Nishida, Takayoshi] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, 2500 Hassaka Cho, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan","Takayanagi, H (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, 1-23 Wakaba Machi, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.; Takayanagi, H (corresponding author), Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, 2500 Hassaka Cho, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan.",zn56htakayanagi@ec.usp.ac.jp,,"Takayanagi, Haruki/0000-0003-3204-0640",,,,36,0,0,2,4,JAPAN SOC APPL ENTOMOL ZOOL,TOKYO,"1-43-11 KOMAGOME TOSHIMA-KU, TOKYO, 170, JAPAN",0021-4914,1347-6068,,JPN J APPL ENTOMOL Z,Jpn.

While long periodic cycles in population dynamics can make the experimental observation of the indirect effects difficult, modelling the possible effects on an evolutionary tithe scale may provide the much needed information on the potential threats of the invasive species on the ecosystem. Using empirical data from a recent invasion in northernmost Fennoscandia, we applied adaptive dynamics theory and modelled the long term consequences of the invasion by the winter moth into the resident community. Specifically, we investigated the outcome of the observed short-term asymmetric preferences of generalist predators and specialist parasitoids on the long term population dynamics of the invasive winter moth and resident autumnal moth sharing these natural enemies. Our results indicate that coexistence after the invasion is possible. However, the outcome of the indirect interaction on the population dynamics of the moth species was variable and the dynamics might not be persistent on an evolutionary time scale. In addition, the indirect interactions between the two moth species via shared natural enemies were able to cause asynchrony in the population cycles corresponding to field observations from previous sympatric outbreak areas. Therefore, the invasion may cause drastic changes in the resident community, for example by prolonging outbreak periods of birch-feeding moths, increasing the average population densities of the moths or, alternatively, leading to extinction of the resident moth species or to equilibrium densities of the two, formerly cyclic, herbivores.

However, the asymmetrical negative effect of Ae. albopictus on Ae. aegypti was eliminated in the presence of malathion. In addition, the presence of malathion resulted in shorter development time compared with the controls.

The treatment that involved only the introduction of crustaceans had no significant effect on mosquito larval populations, while treatment with Bti alone caused only a significant reduction in the abundance of mosquito larvae in the short-term (within 310 days after treatment). In contrast, the combined treatment rapidly reduced the abundance of mosquito larvae, which remained low throughout the entire observation period of 28 days. Growth of the introduced crustacean communities was favored by the immediate reduction in the abundance of mosquito larvae following Bti administration, thus preventing recolonization of ponds by mosquito larvae at the late period (days 1428 after treatment).

The impact of introduced non-mammalian competitors, however, is poorly understood. The house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, is one of the most successful invasive reptiles and has been implicated in the decline of endemic geckos and other taxa on a number of tropical and subtropical islands. We investigated the patterns of niche utilization between the house gecko and endemic ornate day gecko, Phelsuma ornata, in Mauritius, two species which were not believed to compete because they had different diel activity periods. The dietary and temporal niche partitioning of the two species were examined in relation to seasonal invertebrate prey abundance for three seasons. Dietary overlap between the two species was least when prey abundance was lowest and temporal overlap in activity greatest. Exploitative competition was therefore inferred, whereby changes in dietary overlap were attributed to shifts in prey selection by the day, but not the house, gecko, which was hypothesized to deplete prey. The compensatory response of the day gecko may have been to increase its tendency for cannibalism, such that the smaller house gecko was indirectly responsible for population reduction of its larger competitor. This is the first study to show how an invasive nocturnal gecko may be affecting a predominantly diurnal species.","[Cole, Nik C.; Harris, Stephen] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England","Cole, NC (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England.",nik.cole@durrell.org,,,"Mauritian Wildlife Foundation; National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Ago-Industry, Mauritius; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust; Dulverton Trust","We thank the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, particularly Asha Poonyth and Poonam Gangaram for phenology data, and the National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Ago-Industry, Mauritius for supporting this study, Lisa Cole for assistance in the field, and Phil Baker and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments that improved the manuscript.

The basic concept is straightforward: host species vary in suitability ( competence) for parasites, and disease transmission decreases when there are more incompetent hosts interacting with vectors or removing free-living stages of a parasite. However, host species also often interact with each other in other ecological ways, e. g., as competitors for resources. The net result of these simultaneous, multiple interactions ( disease dilution and resource competition) is challenging to predict. Nonetheless, we see the signature of both roles operating concurrently in a planktonic host-parasite system. We document pronounced spatiotemporal variation in the size of epidemics of a virulent fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) in Midwestern U. S. lake populations of a dominant crustacean grazer ( Daphnia dentifera). We show that some of this variation is captured by changes in structure of Daphnia assemblages. Lake-years with smaller epidemics were characterized by assemblages dominated by less suitable hosts (diluters,'' D. pulicaria and D. retrocurva, whose suitabilties were determined in lab experiments and field surveys) at the start of epidemics. Furthermore, within a season, less suitable hosts increased as epidemics declined. These observations are consistent with a dilution effect. However, more detailed time series analysis ( using multivariate autoregressive models) of three intensively sampled epidemics show the signature of a likely interaction between dilution and resource competition between these Daphnia species. The net outcome of this interaction likely promoted termination of these fungal outbreaks. Should this outcome always arise in friendly competition'' systems where diluting hosts compete with more competent hosts? The answers to this question lie at a frontier of disease ecology.","[Hall, Spencer R.; Becker, Claes R.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Simonis, Joseph L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Duffy, Meghan A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Tessier, Alan J.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Environm Biol, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Hall, SR (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",sprhall@indiana.edu,"Simonis, Juniper/AAE-2410-2019; Duffy, Meghan A/A-9376-2008; Duffy, Meghan A/E-6867-2016","Simonis, Juniper/0000-0001-9798-0460; Duffy, Meghan A/0000-0002-8142-0802","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [02-35119, 02-35039, DEB 06-13510, 06-14316]","We are grateful for the help of R.

There have, however, been no studies on the cost of sharing an intermediate host with other parasites in terms of reduced adult parasite fecundity. Even if larval parasites suffer a reduction in size, caused by crowding, virtually nothing is known about longer-lasting effects after transmission to the definitive host. This study is the first to use in vitro cultivation with feeding of adult trematodes to investigate how numbers of parasites in the intermediate host affect the size and fecundity of adult parasites. For this purpose, we examined two different infracommunities of parasites in crustacean hosts. Firstly, we used experimental infections of Maritrema novaezealandensis in the amphipod, Paracalliope novizealandiae, to investigate potential density-dependent effects in single-species infections. Secondly, we used the crab, Macrophthalmus hirtipes (Ocypodidae), naturally infected by the trematodes, M. novaezealandensis and Levinseniella sp., the acanthocephalan, Profilicollis spp., and an acuariid nematode. These four helminths all develop and grow in their crustacean host before transmission to their bird definitive host by predation. In experimental infections, we found an intensity-dependent establishment success, with a decrease in the success rate of cercariae developing into infective metacercariae with an increasing dose of cercariae applied to each amphipod. In natural infections, we found that M. novaezealandensis-metacercariae achieved a smaller volume, on average, when infrapopulations of this parasite were large. Small metacercariae produced small in vitro-adult worms, which in turn produced fewer eggs. Crowding effects in the intermediate host thus were expressed at the adult stage in spite of the worms being cultured in a nutrient-rich medium. Furthermore, excystment success and egg-production in M. novaezealandensis in naturally infected crabs were influenced by the number of co-occurring Profilicollis cystacanths, indicating interspecific interactions between the two species. Our results thus indicate that the infracommunity of larval helminths in their intermediate host is interactive and that any density-dependent effect in the intermediate host may have lasting effects on individual parasite fitness.

We did not find a significant effect of the presence of H. axyridis on the survival or weight gain of C. maculata, but H. axyridis larvae weighed more when kept with C. maculata for 5 days than when kept with equal numbers of conspecifics. This suggests that intraspecific competition was stronger for H. axyridis than the interspecific competition with C. maculata.

Predation is one factor that can have widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes. Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey. I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior, morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly, selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems, illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes. Thus, it is important that we identify the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of predation, rather than simply observing the outcomes and then inferring which processes are responsible.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea+@pitt.edu,,,,,,65,76,79,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2002,83,7,,,,,1953,1964,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1953:TMFOPH]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,571LD,WOS:000176718100015,,,,,2021-09-24,

Predators with differing foraging modes may have different effects on prey behavior, and these effects may be transmitted differently through food webs. Here we test the hypothesis that shifts in the type of predator present in a food web indirectly affect the prey's resource independent of changes in the density of prey. We assessed the importance of predator identity in mediating the grazing effects of the freshwater snail Physa integra on its periphyton resources using field and mesocosm studies. Field observations showed that Physa used covered habitats more in ponds containing fish than in ponds containing crayfish or no predators at all. A field experiment confirmed that snail behavior depended on predator identity. Physa placed near caged pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) selected covered habitats, but Physa placed near caged crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) moved to the surface of the water. The effects of predator identity on periphtyon were then examined in a mesocosm experiment, using caged predators. Habitat use of Physa was similar to their habitat use in the field experiment. In the presence of caged sunfish, periphyton standing crop in covered habitats was reduced to 34% of the standing crop in the presence of crayfish. In contrast, periphyton in near-surface habitats was 110% higher in the presence of fish than in the presence of crayfish. Thus, the effects of predator identity on Physa behavior cascaded through the food web to affect the abundance and spatial distribution of periphyton.","Clar Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16412 USA","Bernot, RJ (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 232 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Thus, the biological control of herbivorous arthropods can be either enhanced or disrupted by introducing a predator species to an existing host-parasitoid system. We evaluate the impact of introducing a predator, the convergent ladybird beetle, Hippodamia convergens, on the biological control of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, by the parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes, under field conditions. Predation on immature parasitoids by H. convergens was intense: 98-100% of aphid mummies were consumed by the end of the experiment, and H. convergens substantially reduced immature parasitoid populations. Despite the negative impact of H. convergens on aphid parasitoids, aphid population suppression was greatest in treatments containing both H. convergens and parasitoids. The parasitoid alone or in combination with H. convergens suppressed cotton aphids in a density-dependent manner and increased total plant leaf area and biomass, H. convergens did not substantially alter the percentage of aphids mummified by parasitoids and showed a partial feeding preference for unparasitized aphids over aphid mummies. We conclude that under conditions where a predator shows both a partial preference for unparasitized hosts and high levels of predation on unparasitized hosts, we may expect the predator to improve suppression of herbivores even if it produces high levels of intraguild predation. While intraguild predation is an important ecological interaction in the early-season cotton agroecosystem, it does not disrupt cotton aphid biological control.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Colfer, RG (corresponding author), Mission Organ, POB 2357, Salinas, CA 93902 USA.",ramy@nsfoods.com,,,,,,78,133,139,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2001,126,2,,,,,292,304,,10.1007/s004420000510,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393XK,WOS:000166494800018,28547629,,,,2021-09-24,

However, under some circumstances the evolutionary response to a gradient may be opposite of the ecological response, a phenomenon known as countergradient variation. We had previously predicted that counter-gradient selection has occurred in pumpkinseed sunfish in response to a resource gradient created by competition with bluegill sunfish. Because competition only occurs when pumpkinseed are small, rapid growth has evolved to allow passage through the competing size classes as quickly as possible. We performed a common-garden experiment using juvenile pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill and from lakes without bluegill. Pumpkinseed were raised in cages without bluegill, or with a low density of bluegill, or with a high density of bluegill. Bluegill significantly decreased growth for all pumpkinseed, following the predicted ecological gradient. However, pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill grew faster than those from lakes without bluegill under all treatments, following the predicted evolutionary response.","SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Arendt, JD (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",,,,,,,32,60,65,0,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1999,80,8,,,,,2793,2798,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2793:CSFRGI]2.0.CO;2,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,264VR,WOS:000084204100028,,,,,2021-09-24,

Both polyphagous predatory mite species have been previously shown to interact directly through predation on each other. The present study demonstrated that the adult females of T. pyri and K. aberrans are able to discriminate between con- and heterospecific larvae and protonymphs and that they prefer to prey upon heterospecifics when given the choice. Hunger did not reduce the propensity of the females to prefer heterospecifics over conspecifics. For proto-and deutonymphs the trends followed the results obtained with the adult females, but the preference for heterospecifics was not distinct enough to be significant. In competitive situations reciprocal predation may be a crucial mechanism in the interaction of polyphagous phytoseiid species and may contribute significantly to population persistence. The results are discussed with regard to possible associations between the ability to discriminate con- and heterospecifics and the type of feeding specialization (generalists versus specialists).","Fed Off & Res Ctr Agr, Inst Phytomed, A-1226 Vienna, Austria","Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Entomol, 2046 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",,,,19,35,40,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Previous studies have suggested that Enallagma damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) invaded aquatic habitats with large dragonflies as the top predators at least twice, and large changes in morphological structures (e.g., caudal lamellae acid abdomen), which should increase swimming speed, are associated with these invasions. This is significant because these species swim away from attacking predators, whereas species in the ancestral habitat (habitats with fish as the top predators) do not swim from attacking predators. We quantified swimming speed over a large ontogenetic size range for larvae of seven Enallagma species, two in dragonfly lakes and five in fish lakes. Results of analysis of covariance and a modification of Felsenstein's method of evolutionary contrasts indicate that a large evolutionary increase in the slope of the ontogenetic relationship between swimming speed and log(e)(body length) is associated with invasions into dragonfly lakes, and this shift results in larvae of dragonfly-lake species being faster swimmers, especially in larger size classes, than larvae of fish-lake species. We also present experimental results demonstrating that damselflies with larger lamellae are faster swimmers and have higher survival when exposed to dragonfly predation. The results of this study indicate that the change in selective environment associated with habitat shifts into dragonfly lakes promoted adaptations for increased swimming speed in Enallagma lineages. The potential ramifications of this adaptation for community structure are discussed.","BUCKNELL UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LEWISBURG, PA 17837 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Among Coleoptera, dung beetles are one of the groups that display this behavior. Although diverse aspects of natural history have been reviewed, no agreement exists on which theory may explain this food searching tactic. We performed a systematic literature review about this behavior in dung beetles, analyzing existing studies, and discussing potential explanations. We identified six different hypotheses (resource partitioning, food detection, foraging time, predator's avoidance, thermoregulation, and resting). Based on the evidence that we found, we support the hypothesis that the main driver of perching behavior is a strategy of spatial segregation. We found reports for several tribes in different biogeographical regions, especially in Neotropical forests. Few studies explore the relationship between perching height and dung beetles' size. However, recent findings sustained that dung beetles perch at a height proportional to its size, large beetles prefer bigger leaves, and functional groups perch at different heights. Dung beetles observed perching were strictly coprophagous and there is no specific relationship between dial activity and perching behavior. We also found perching records of the three main functional guilds (tunnelers, rollers, and dwellers). Despite several studies of dung beetles perching, there is a lack of experimental analyses. One aspect to analyze in future investigations is the relationship between perching behavior and functional traits. Finally, it is essential to explore and solve some questions that we propose to understand the functional role of this behavior in the structure of assemblages.

In whole-ecosystem manipulations of small Caribbean islands on which brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) were the native top predator, we experimentally staged invasions by competitors (green anoles, Anolis smaragdinus) and/or new top predators (curly-tailed lizards, Leiocephalus carinatus). We show that curly-tailed lizards destabilized the coexistence of competing prey species, contrary to the classic idea of keystone predation. Fear-driven avoidance of predators collapsed the spatial and dietary niche structure that otherwise stabilized coexistence, which intensified interspecific competition within predator-free refuges and contributed to the extinction of green-anole populations on two islands. Moreover, whereas adding either green anoles or curly-tailed lizards lengthened food chains on the islands, adding both species reversed this effect-in part because the apex predators were trophic omnivores. Our results underscore the importance of top-down control in ecological communities, but show that its outcomes depend on prey behaviour, spatial structure, and omnivory. Diversity-enhancing effects of top predators cannot be assumed, and non-consumptive effects of predation risk may be a widespread constraint on species coexistence.","[Pringle, Robert M.; Kartzinel, Tyler R.; Hutchinson, Matthew C.; Coverdale, Tyler C.; Daskin, Joshua H.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kartzinel, Tyler R.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Palmer, Todd M.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Thurman, Timothy J.; Xu, Charles C.

Here we use on-animal data loggers to assess whether such trade-offs can be revealed by the breathing rates (BR) and timing of breaths in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephela melas). We used the period immediately following foraging dives in particular, for which respiratory behavior can be expected to be optimized for gas exchange. Breath times and fluke strokes were detected using onboard sensors (pressure, 3-axis acceleration) attached to animals using suction cups. The number and timing of breaths were quantified in non-linear mixed models that incorporated serial correlation and individual as a random effect. We found that pilot whales increased their BR in the 5-10 min period prior to, and immediately following, dives that exceeded 31 m depth. While pre-dive BRs did not vary with dive duration, the initial post-dive BR was linearly correlated with duration of >2 min dives, with BR then declining exponentially. Apparent net diving costs were 1.7 (SE 0.2) breaths per min of diving (post-dive number of breaths, above pre-dive breathing rate unrelated to dive recovery). Every fluke stroke was estimated to cost 0.086 breaths, which amounted to 80-90% average contribution of locomotion to the net diving costs. After accounting for fluke stroke rate, individuals in the small body size class took a greater number of breaths per diving minute. Individuals reduced their breathing rate (from the rate expected by diving behavior) by 13-16% during playbacks of killer whale sounds and their first exposure to 1-2 kHz naval sonar, indicating similar responses to interspecific competitor/predator and anthropogenic sounds. Although we cannot rule out individuals increasing their per-breath O-2 uptake to match metabolic demand, our results suggest that behavioral responses to experimental sound exposures were not associated with increased metabolic rates in a stress response, but metabolic rates instead appear to decrease. Our results support the hypothesis that maximal performance leads to predictable (optimized) breathing patterns, which combined with further physiological measurements could improve proxies of field metabolic rates and per-stroke energy costs from animal-borne behavior data.","[Isojunno, Saana; Miller, Patrick James O'Malley] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Aoki, Kagari] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan; [Cure, Charlotte] UMRAE, Cerema Ifsttar, Strasbourg, France; [Kvadsheim, Petter Helgevold] Norwegian Def Res Estab, Horten, Norway","Isojunno, S (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",si66@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Waxler, Robert/S-4345-2018","isojunno, saana/0000-0002-2212-2135","NL Ministry of Defence; FR Ministry of Defence (DGA) [15860052]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; NOR Ministry of Defence; United States Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-08-1-0984, N00014-10-1-0355, N00014-14-1-0390]","This work was funded by NL Ministry of Defence, NOR Ministry of Defence, United States Office of Naval Research (N00014-08-1-0984, N00014-10-1-0355, and N00014-14-1-0390), and FR Ministry of Defence (DGA) (public market no 15860052).

Stresses arise as a consequence of the spatially inhomogeneous tissue growth due to the different activity of healthy and cancer cells inhabiting the various districts of the tissue, an additional piling up effect, induced by stress transferring across the scales, contributing to determine the total stress occurring at the macroscopic level. The spatially inhomogeneous growth rates accompany nonuniform and time-propagating stress profiles, which constitute mechanical barriers to nutrient transport and influence the intratumoral interstitial flow, in this way deciding the starved/feeded regions, with direct aftereffects on necrosis, angiogenesis, cancer aggressiveness and overall tumor mass size. Despite their ascertained role in tumor mechanobiology, stresses cannot be directly appraised neither from overall tumor size nor through standard non-invasive measurements. To date, the sole way for qualitatively revealing their presence within solid tumors is ex vivo, by engraving the excised masses and then observing opening between the cut edges. Therefore, to contribute to unveil stresses and their implications in tumors, it is first proposed a multiscale model where Volterra-Lotka (predator/prey-like) equations describing the interspecific (environment-mediated) competitions among healthy and cancer cells are coupled with equations of nonlinear poroelasticity. Then, an experimental study on mice injected subcutaneously with a suspension of two different cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2 and MDA.MB231) was conducted to provide experimental evidences that gave qualitative and some new quantitative confirmations of the theoretical model predictions.","[Carotenuto, A.

Dual-guild herbivory also can muddle plant signals used by specialist natural enemies to locate prey, further complicating the net impact of herbivore-herbivore interactions in naturally diverse settings. While dual-guild herbivore communities are common in nature, consequences for top-down processes are unclear, as chemically mediated tri-trophic interactions are rarely evaluated in field environments. Combining observational and experimental approaches in the open field, we test a prediction that chewing herbivores interfere with top-down suppression of phloem feeders on Brassica oleracea across broad landscapes. In a two-year survey of 52 working farm sites, we found that parasitoid and aphid densities on broccoli plants positively correlated at farms where aphids and caterpillars rarely co-occurred, but this relationship disappeared at farms where caterpillars commonly co-occurred. In a follow-up experiment, we compared single and dual-guild herbivore communities at four local farm sites and found that caterpillars (P.rapae) caused a 30% reduction in aphid parasitism (primarily by Diaeretiella rapae), and increased aphid colony (Brevicoryne brassicae) growth at some sites. Notably, in the absence of predators, caterpillars indirectly suppressed, rather than enhanced, aphid growth. Amid considerable ecological noise, our study reveals a pattern of apparent commensalism: herbivore-herbivore facilitation via relaxed top-down suppression. This work suggests that enemy-mediated apparent commensalism may override constraints to growth induced by competing herbivores in field environments, and emphasizes the value of placing chemically mediated interactions within their broader environmental and community contexts.","[Blubaugh, Carmen K.] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29678 USA; [Blubaugh, Carmen K.; Asplund, Jacob S.; Philips, Christopher R.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.; Morra, Matthew J.; Popova, Inna E.] Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Soil & Entomol Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Reganold, John P.] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Eigenbrode, Sanford D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Entomol Nematol & Plant Pathol, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Morra, Matthew J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Soil & Water Syst, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29678 USA.; Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",cblubau@clemson.edu,"Morra, Matthew/P-1216-2019; Morra, Matthew J/B-1723-2008","Morra, Matthew/0000-0003-3842-1575; Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102; Popova, Inna/0000-0002-2004-1411",USDA NIFA ORG award [2015-09273],"We are grateful to Elizabeth Magill and Sabrina Judson for field and lab assistance, to Olivia Smith for helping with figures, and to Paul Nabity, Ian Kaplan, Adrienne Godschalx, and Robert Schaeffer for comments on previous drafts of this manuscript.

Thus, competitive interactions may take place. Fish have been introduced to many formerly fishless lakes, which has profoundly affected the competitive and predatory relations in these waters. In this paper we review recent findings on duck fish competitive interactions in boreal lakes. On a general level, analyses based on presence/absence data of fish have indicated that ducks can be negatively affected by fish. More rigorous studies where fish density has been considered have corroborated the pattern emerging from presence/absence studies. For the Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) and Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis), the effect of competition has been tested experimentally. In general, it appears that diving ducks such as Common Goldeneye, which forage in open water, are the most affected by fish, Common Teal (Arias crecca) is intermediate, whereas Mallard (A. platyrhynchos), which forage among the shore vegetation, is little affected. Likelihood or the strength of competition between ducks and fish may also depend on habitat productivity and structure. Numbers of invertebrates are higher among vegetation where there are less fish preying on them. Duck fish interactions are important to take into account when planning wetland creation and restoration for ducks. There is also an urgent need to mitigate the effects of fish introductions in wetlands.","[Nummi, Petri; Vaananen, Veli-Matti; Holopainen, Sari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Poysa, Hannu] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Yliopistokatu 6, Joensuu 80100, Finland","Nummi, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petri.nummi@helsinki.fi,"Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021","Holopainen, Sari/0000-0002-3271-4468; Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633",,,,80,13,13,0,17,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,2016,93,1,,,,,67,76,,,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,DL3FU,WOS:000375520400008,,,,,2021-09-24,

Analysis of video footage suggested competition was enforced without agonistic behaviour and access to the resource was not governed by size. The singularity of the data set and the artificiality of the situation limit the strength of the conclusions. The rarity of such an observation warrants, however, a published description of the event to provide an example of the behaviour of apex predator interactions in the field.","[O'Shea, O.

Both of these impacts increase marine microbial diversity by increasing interspecific competition. By contrast, very little is known about the role of phage predation in terrestrial ecosystems. A recent field study in Barrow, AK found phage predation to be a key factor controlling terrestrial bacterial population dynamics in Arctic soils. When phage abundance was artificially reduced using a tea extract, antiphage treatment, bacterial abundance, and respiration increased accordingly, suggesting top-down control by phages. The goal of this study was to examine the impact of phage predation in temperate soil ecosystems. Laboratory-scale experiments confirmed the potent antiphage properties of tea extracts. However, field experiments conducted at two discrete sites (upland and wetland) yielded little evidence that top-down control by phage predation was significant in temperate soils.","[Helsley, Kaitlin R.; Brown, Theresa M.; Furlong, Kevin; Williamson, Kurt E.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Integrated Sci Ctr 2127, Williamsburg, VA 22185 USA","Williamson, KE (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Integrated Sci Ctr 2127, Williamsburg, VA 22185 USA.",kewilliamson@wm.edu,,,William & Mary Honors Fund; Jeffress Memorial Trust [J-988],"This work was supported by William & Mary Honors Funding to KRH provided by individual donors Dr. John Sherwood, Ms. Margery Daughtry, Mr. Ted Dintersmith, and Ms. Janet Bouland and by a grant to KEW from the Jeffress Memorial Trust ( J-988).

However, these studies have always measured foraging at artificial, static baits that omit traits of living prey items and potential coevolutionary predatorprey relationships. In a series of lab experiments, we compare the ability of ants to harvest live termites (Reticulitermes virginicus) in nests varying in defensive ability. Moreover, we compare foraging performance of 2 co-occurring ant speciesuthe North American native Aphaenogaster rudis and the invasive Pachycondyla chinensisudiffering in their evolutionary experience hunting R. virginicus. Our results show how the invasive P. chinensis may displace the native keystone A. rudis by directly killing A. rudis workers and reducing termite prey available for A. rudis. Specifically, P. chinensis is more sensitive to novel termite prey than the native A. rudis and then destroys termite coloniesueven if they are highly defended by soldiers or nest architecture. Our results further show how whole colony behavioral dominance by P. chinensis is mediated by behavioral interactions among individual workers. More generally, our experimental approach using live prey to study interspecific competition can integrate evolutionary dynamics into studies of proximate behavioral factors governing species coexistence.","[Bednar, David M.; Shik, Jonathan Z.; Silverman, Jules] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Silverman, J (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol, 3314 Gardner Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",jules_silverman@ncsu.edu,,"Shik, Jonathan Zvi/0000-0003-3309-7737",Blanton J.

Though many interspecific associations have been described for closely related mammals, few studies have examined the associations between mammals in different orders. The yellow mongoose (Cynictus pencillata), a carnivore, and the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a rodent, co-occur in arid and semi-arid South Africa where they share sleeping burrows, predators, a similar body size, and the capability to emit alarm calls in response to predators. To investigate enhanced predator avoidance as a potential benefit explaining the persistence of this association, we assessed individual mongoose vigilance alone and with squirrels or other mongooses, and with varying interspecific group size, using field observations. We also tested for responses to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls in both study species using playback experiments. The proportion of time mongoose individuals spent vigilant decreased in the presence of squirrels or other mongooses and was negatively correlated with interspecific group size; a similar pattern was previously shown for conspecific groups of Cape ground squirrels. These results are predicted by both the dilution and collective detection hypotheses. In addition, hetero- and conspecific alarm calls elicited vigilance responses in both species. These results suggest that both species can benefit from the collective detection and dilution arising from their interspecific association and that this interspecific association could be mutualistic.","[Makenbach, Sarah A.; Waterman, Jane M.; Roth, James D.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Waterman, JM (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, 50 Sifton Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",Jane.Waterman@ad.umanitoba.ca,"Roth, James D/N-4178-2016",,National Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank M.

Yet, due to methodological and technical challenges very little is known about the mediation of these interactions and their effect on cetaceans' behavior. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are a highly vocal species and can be both food competitors and potential predators of many other cetaceans. Thus, the interception of their vocalizations by unintended cetacean receivers may be particularly important in mediating interspecific interactions. To address this hypothesis, we conducted playbacks of killer whale vocalizations recorded during herring-feeding activity to free-ranging long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas). Using a multi-sensor tag, we were able to track the whales and to monitor changes of their movements and social behavior in response to the playbacks. We demonstrated that the playback of killer whale sounds to pilot whales induced a clear increase in group size and a strong attraction of the animals towards the sound source. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that the interception of heterospecific vocalizations can mediate interactions between different cetacean species in previously unrecognized ways.","[Cure, Charlotte; Antunes, Ricardo; Samarra, Filipa; Alves, Ana Catarina; Miller, Patrick J.

Microbiological studies that only consider pure cultures are not sufficient to adequately describe the natural behaviour of microbes. Several microbial interactions have been recognized to affect the growth or metabolism of others; e.g. syntrophic cometabolism, competition, production of inhibitors or activators, and predation. It is believed that third-party organisms easily affect the two-species relationships and these relationships form the basis of interspecies networks within microbial communities. A microbial network contributes to 'functional redundancy' or 'structural diversity' and the microbial communities effectively act as a multicellular organism. It is necessary to understand not only the physiological activity of members within microbial communities but also their roles to regulate the activity or population of others. To access the microbial network, we require (i) comprehensive determination of all possible interspecies relationships among microbes, (ii) knock-out experiments by which certain members can be removed or suppressed, and (iii) supplemental addition of microbes or activation of certain members. Microbial network studies have started using defined microbial communities, i.e. a mixed culture that is composed of three or four species. In order to expand these studies to microflora in nature, microbial ecology requires the help of mathematical biology.","[Haruta, Shin] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Tokyo 158, Japan; [Haruta, Shin; Kato, Souichiro; Yamamoto, Kyosuke; Igarashi, Yasuo] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan","Haruta, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Tokyo 158, Japan.",sharuta@tmu.ac.jp,"Kato, Souichiro/M-4151-2018; Yamamoto, Kyosuke/M-2924-2018","Kato, Souichiro/0000-0002-2527-7730; Yamamoto, Kyosuke/0000-0003-2450-779X; Haruta, Shin/0000-0002-3705-2459",,,,58,52,54,1,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1462-2912,1462-2920,,ENVIRON MICROBIOL,Environ.

Indirect effects, as when antagonistic or mutualistic interactions restrict geographic range and thereby elevate extinction risk, are probably widespread and may flow in both directions, as when species- or organismic-level factors increase extinction risk or speciation probabilities. Apparent contradictions across scales and levels have been neglected, including (1) the individualistic geographic shifts of species on centennial and millennial timescales versus evidence for fine-tuned coevolutionary relationships; (2) the extensive and dynamic networks of interactions faced by most species versus the evolution of costly enemy-specific defenses and finely attuned mutualisms; and (3) the macroevolutionary lags often seen between the origin and the diversification of a clade or an evolutionary novelty versus the rapid microevolution of advantageous phenotypes and the invasibility of most communities. Resolution of these and other cross-level tensions presumably hinges on how organismic interactions impinge on genetic population structures, geographic ranges, and the persistence of incipient species, but generalizations are not yet possible. Paleontological and neontological data are both incomplete and so the most powerful response to these problems will require novel integrative approaches. Promising research areas include more realistic approaches to modeling and empirical analysis of large-scale diversity dynamics of ostensibly competing clades; spatial and phylogenetic dissections of clades involved in escalatory dynamics (where prey respond evolutionarily to a broad and shifting array of enemies); analyses of the short- versus long-term consequences of mutualistic symbioses; and fuller use of abundant natural experiments on the evolutionary impacts of ecosystem engineers.","Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Jablonski, D (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",djablons@uchicago.edu,,,,,,392,169,171,4,117,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,2008,62,4,,,,,715,739,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00317.x,,,25,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,283MS,WOS:000254640900001,18387075,,,,2021-09-24,

We assessed species-specific habitat suitability based upon nutrient characteristics using larval survival rates (SR) and wing lengths (WL) from floating habitat enclosures. Anopheles albimanus showed a high SR (81%) in all three habitats, while An. vestitipennis had a similarly high SR in its own habitat (82%) and An. darlingi's habitat (8 1 %). Anopheles darlingi only showed high SR (85%) in its own habitat. Both An. vestitipennis and An. darlingi showed very low SR in the An. albimanus habitat. There were no significant WL differences among field-caught, laboratory-reared, and experimental populations of An. vestitipennis and An. albimanus, with the exception of An. vestitipennis experimental populations and An. vestitipennis field populations placed in the An. albimanus habitat. Habitat quality indicators, particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic nitrogen (PON), were consistently higher in An. vestitipennis habitats than in the habitats of the other two species. Correspondingly, An. vestitipennis adults were larger when measured both as dry mass and from WL. There were no differences in dry mass, lipids, or protein content among the same species reared at different locations. We compared SR and WL among mosquitoes from shaded and unshaded containers to test whether the high mortality rates for An. vestitipennis and An. darlingi in the An. albimanus habitat were due to intense sun exposure. There were no significant differences among developmental times, survivorship, or adult size for shaded versus sun-exposed populations.

The objective is to evaluate hypotheses on interaction webs and population regulation in these ensembles in the context of traditional and recent models of phylogeny and life-history evolution of plethodontids. Two ecological hypotheses evaluated are (1) Hairston's conjecture on differences in the kinds of interactions prevalent among biphasic species with an aquatic larval stage, versus terrestrial species with direct development; and (2) Grover's hypothesis on differences in the factors that limit the distribution of species along the moisture gradient from stream to forest. An evolutionary question concerns the supposition derived from recent phylogenetic reconstructions that the history of one major clade, the supergenus Desmognathus, involved an early transition or reversal from a simple life cycle (direct development) to a biphasic life cycle (larval development, metamorphosis), and that this transition promoted the subsequent adaptive radiation of the taxon. Chippindale et al. proposed that selection for life-history reversal in the genus Desmognathus was promoted by competition between direct-developing ancestral desmognathans and other terrestrial plethodontids. Experimental studies of interaction webs in extant ensembles of plethodontids in the southern Appalachians, in concert with data from descriptive studies of feeding and habitat use, demonstrate variation in the relative importance of competition and predation in population regulation of species in the several codistributed lineages of these salamanders. Whereas the existing ecological data do not refute the Chippindale et al. hypothesis, many unresolved questions require additional investigation.","Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA","Bruce, RC (corresponding author), 200 Breeze Way, Aurora, NC 27806 USA.",ebruce1563@aol.com,,,,,,100,13,13,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

We performed a whole-lake experiment by stocking a non-native top predator (pikeperch (Sander lucioperca)) to two residential piscivores (Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) and northern pike (Esox lucius)). By analyzing spatial distribution, diet composition, growth, and consumption rates of the piscivores before and after pikeperch introduction, we tested how both density-dependent and trait-mediated responses affected interactions between the three predators. Total piscivore biomass increased 1.5 times and annual consumption by the piscivores increased 1.7 times after stocking, attributable to the stocked pikeperch and increased northern pike abundances. Abundance, distribution, and consumption data indicated that northern pike was hardly affected by pikeperch stocking and even increased its biomass, whereas piscivorous perch shifted its habitat use towards the littoral lake areas in response to competition with pikeperch. Furthermore, all piscivores increasingly fed on small perch. The forced habitat shift of piscivorous perch in combination with increased predation on small perch led to a decreased abundance of large perch, attributable to the compensatory effects of intraguild predation and cannibalism.","Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12561 Berlin, Germany; Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12561 Berlin, Germany; Univ Constance, Inst Limnol, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Schulze, T (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Hydrobiol & Aquat Ecosyst Management, Dept Water Atmosphere & Environm, Max Emanuel Str 17, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",torsten.schulze@igb-berlin.de,"Holker, Franz/A-5683-2009; Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008","Holker, Franz/0000-0001-5932-266X; Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X",,,,63,28,28,1,33,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Galls were more abundant in shade than sun across sites. This finding is consistent with the Sink Competition Hypothesis, which predicts higher gall loads on plants with longer internodes (as those in shade) and hence less competition among sinks. Galled leaves were smaller and senesced more rapidly, and galled shoots grew less. In the sun, galled branches produced fewer flowers, but there was ultimately no relationship between gall load and seed production in the year sampled. Gall load was not correlated with seed predation in sun or shade, suggesting no indirect interactions between herbivores. This work suggests that gall insects negatively affect plant growth and reproduction, but manipulative experiments must be conducted to confirm this. Additionally, this study suggests that relationships between leaf gall load and plant fitness traits may not be clearly regulated by the availability of sunlight resources to the plant.","Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA","Leege, LM (corresponding author), Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, POB 8042, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",leege@GeorgiaSouthern.edu,,,,,,46,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,2006,184,2,,,,,203,212,,10.1007/s11258-005-9065-4,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,059PY,WOS:000238745900002,,,,,2021-09-24,

The impact of the different predator communities (protists and metazoans) of prokaryotes was estimated by water fractionation (< 5 mu m: treatment filtered on 5 mu m, without ciliates and metazoans; UNF: unfiltered treatment with all planktonic communities). Enrichments of natural viruses (< 1.2 mu m: with a natural virus concentration; < 1.2 mu m V and VV: with enrichment leading to a double or triple concentration of viruses, respectively) were used to indirectly assess the control of virioplankton. Viral activity was estimated from the frequency of visibly infected cells (FVIC). PCC was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). In this study, PCC was affected by the eukaryote communities (especially flagellates), and viruses to a lesser extent. Cyanobacteria declined significantly during the experiment and were highly correlated with the FVIC. In addition, the 503-bp terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) disappeared in treatments with virus enrichments, suggesting possible viral-associated mortality processes, whereas the 506-bp T-RF was not affected in these treatments. On one hand, these results suggest a control of the PCC: first, by viral lysis of some dominant phylotypes and second, by interspecific competition between resistant strains for the uptake of substrates released by this lysis. The increase of Archaea may suggest that these cells benefit such resources. On the other hand, the disappearance and the stable proportion of some dominant phylotypes suggested a selection pressure due to the predatory activity on prokaryotes. In conclusion, prokaryotic abundance appears to be mainly controlled by flagellate protists, which also affected PCC, whereas viruses seemed to be essentially responsible for profound changes in PCC via direct and indirect actions.","Univ Clermont Ferrand, Lab Biol Protistes, CNRS, UMR 6023, F-63177 Aubiere, France","Bettarel, Y (corresponding author), Univ Clermont Ferrand, Lab Biol Protistes, CNRS, UMR 6023, F-63177 Aubiere, France.",didier.debroas@free.fr,"Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/M-4134-2019; Jardillier, Ludwig E/H-8486-2015","Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Jardillier, Ludwig E/0000-0003-4982-5807",,,,61,25,26,3,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Different availabilities of decorating materials had a positive correlation on decorating amount by juveniles, while the correlation was not so clear in subadults. The amount of decorating decreased with increasing density of conspecific crabs in the presence of a predator, but there was so clear relationship in the absence of a predator. The decrease in decorating under high density could be due to intra-specific aggression, because the superior crab, in fighting, was found to be decorated with more algae. Tiarinia cornigera was found to be superior to the co-occurring different majid species Micippa platipes in fighting. When T. cornigera and M. platipes were housed together, the former was decorated with more algae than the latter in the presence of a predator, but in the absence of a predator, the amount of algae was not different. Thus, presence of a predator may motivate intraspecific competition in T. cornigera as well as interspecific competition between T. cornigera and M. platipes for decorating materials.","Nara Womens Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Nara 6308506, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Seto Marine Biol Lab, Wakayama 6492211, Japan","Wada, K (corresponding author), Nara Womens Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Nara 6308506, Japan.",mbanzai@cc.nara-wu.ac.jp,,,,,,18,6,6,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity. 2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico. 3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes. 4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments. 5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. 6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship. 7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation.","Inst Ecol, AC Dept Ecol Func, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Ctr, Washington, DC 20008 USA","Cruz-Angon, A (corresponding author), Inst Ecol, AC Dept Ecol Func, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera Coatepec,315, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",angon@ecologia.edu.mx,,,,,,65,79,86,0,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We found that competition between these two species was asymmetric. Hylaversicolor tadpoles were more affected by intraspecific competition than interspecific competition (i.e. grew faster when grown with heterospecifics than conspecifics); whereas, R. clamitans tadpoles were more affected by interspecific competition than intraspecific competition (i.e. grew faster when grown with conspecifics than heterospecifics). Based on behavioral observations, this result could not be explained on the basis of activity levels, a trait previously linked to competitive ability in tadpoles. However, differences in initial body size may help explain the observed results; the gray treefrog tadpoles were larger than the green frog tadpoles.","Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA","Smith, GR (corresponding author), Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",smithg@denison.edu,,,,,,40,26,27,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2004,105,3,,,,,626,632,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12841.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,821CT,WOS:000221438100017,,,,,2021-09-24,

Aims To investigate experimentally whether competition for nest cavities and/or food can explain aggressive behaviour between competing species. Methods The Collared Flycatcher's Ficedula albicollis responses to mounts of Great Tit Parus major (nest-site and food competitor), Chaffinch Fringillo coelebs (food competitor) and Dunnock Prunella modularis (control species) were tested. Trials were performed near flycatchers' nests during nest building, incubation and care of nestlings. Results The intensity of dive attacks and frequency of contact attacks showed that the aggression of Collared Flycatchers decreased in the direction: Great Tit > Chaffinch > Dunnock. The difference in aggressiveness was greater between Great Tit and Chaffinch than between Chaffinch and Dunnock. Aggression directed toward Great Tits increased from the nest building to the incubation stage and then decreased markedly in the nestling stage. Males were more aggressive than females. Conclusion These results suggest that competition for nest-sites, and to a lesser extent for food, may be of an interference nature and that the reproductive value hypothesis can only partly explain differences in the Collared Flycatcher's defensive behaviour found between sexes and stages of the breeding cycle.","Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Ornithol Lab, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; Museum Hist Nat, Olomouc 77173, Czech Republic","Krist, M (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Ornithol Lab, Tr Svobody 26, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",krist@prfnw.upol.cz,,,,,,32,13,13,0,11,BRITISH TRUST ORNITHOLOGY,THETFORD NORFOLK,"NUNNERY, NUNNERY PLACE, THETFORD NORFOLK IP24 2PU, ENGLAND",0006-3657,,,BIRD STUDY,Bird Stud.,MAR,2004,51,,1,,,,41,47,,10.1080/00063650409461331,,,7,Ornithology,Zoology,804NR,WOS:000220305900006,,Bronze,,,2021-09-24,

In recent years the population of fur seals has increased, whereas that of macaroni penguins has declined. Both species feed on krill of similar size ranges, dive to similar depths and are restricted in their foraging range at least while provisioning their offspring. In this study we test the hypothesis that the increased fur seal population at South Georgia may have resulted in greater competition for the prey of macaroni penguins, leading to the decline in their population. We used: (1) satellite-tracking data to investigate the spatial separation of the Bird Island populations of these two species whilst at sea during the breeding seasons of 1999 and 2000 and (2) diet data to assess potential changes in their trophic niches between 1989 and 2000. Foraging ranges of the two species showed considerable overlap in both years, but the concentrations of foraging activity were significantly segregated spatially. The size of krill taken by both species was very similar, but over the last 12 years the prevalence of krill in their diets has diverged, with nowadays less krill in the diet of macaroni penguins than in that of Antarctic fur seals. Despite a significant degree of segregation in spatial resource use by the study populations, it is likely that the South Georgia populations of Antarctic fur seal and macaroni penguin exploit the same krill population during their breeding season. For explaining the opposing population trends of the two species, the relative contributions of independent differential response to interannual variation in krill availability and of interspecies competition cannot be resolved with available evidence. The likely competitive advantage of Antarctic fur seals will be enhanced as their population continues to increase, particularly in years of krill scarcity.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Croxall, JP (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",,"Staniland, Iain/I-4725-2012; Brierley, Andrew S/G-8019-2011","Staniland, Iain/0000-0003-2736-9134; Brierley, Andrew S/0000-0002-6438-6892",,,,60,81,85,2,42,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

The extent of directional environmental change expected in the next century underscores the need to understand density-dependent population regulation. 2. Direct density dependence generated by intraspecific competition and/or predator-prey interactions should buffer environmentally produced changes in density-independent growth rates (r), Density dependence generated by interspecific competition should magnify sensitivity to changes in r. 3, We tested these predictions by assembling protist communities in laboratory microcosms and subjecting the communities to directional environmental change. Two experiments used pairs of competing protists (Colpidium striatum Stein and Tetrahymena thermophila Nanney & McCoy, and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn and Blepharisma americanum Suzuki) along with single-species controls, Two experiments used predator-prey pairs (Didinium nasutum Muller or Euplotes patella Ehrenberg preying on Colpidium) and controls containing only prey. We grew replicates of each species combination in two temperature regimes (constant or slowly increasing temperature). Independent of these experiments, we quantified the temperature dependence of r (intrinsic rate of increase) for each species. 4, Comparison of effects of temperature on r to effects on mean density revealed that intraspecific competition buffered species densities against temperature changes that increased r by over 200%, Interspecific interactions did not affect species responses to environmental change. Temperature change had weak effects on species densities, whether or not other species were present. 5, The results suggest that natural populations, regulated by direct density dependence, may be buffered against directional environmental change. Environmental change will have large effects when populations experience little density dependence, and when environmental change has different effects on the vital rates of different species.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",,,,,,,61,38,38,1,99,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies. Our survey revealed 20 fragmentation experiments worldwide. Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) of particular species. Other important themes were the effect of fragmentation in interspecific interactions, the role of corridors and landscape connectivity in individual movements and species richness, and the influences of edge effects on ecosystem services. Our comparisons showed a remarkable lack of consistency in results across studies, especially with regard to species richness and abundance relative to fragment size. Experiments with arthropods showed the best fit with theoretical expectations of greater species richness on larger fragments. Highly mobile taxa such as birds and mammals, early-successional plant species, long-lived species, and generalist predators did not respond in the expected manner. Reasons for these discrepancies included edge effects, competitive release in the habitat fragments, and the spatial scale of the experiments. One of the more consistently supported hypotheses was that movement and species richness are positively affected by corridors and connectivity, respectively. Transient effects dominated many systems; for example, crowding of individuals on fragments commonly was observed after fragmentation, followed by a relaxation toward lower abundance in subsequent years. The three long-term studies (greater than or equal to 14 years) revealed strong patterns that would have been missed in short-term investigations. Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for elucidation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potential for changing responses to fragmentation over time.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ctr Biodivers Res, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Debinski, DM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, 124 Sci 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",debinski@iastate.edu; predator@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu,,"Debinski, Diane/0000-0002-7144-4640; Rodiles-Hernandez, Rocio/0000-0003-0355-5477",,,,82,898,949,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Interpretation of field survey data can be difficult, however, because species numbers in any case change with time and location, as a result of density dependence acting through or together with changing levels of food supply, predation, parasitism, interspecific competition, migration, environmental variables, and so on. As a first step toward resolving these difficulties it is argued that single-species microcosm experiments are needed that establish the joint effects on populations of stress levels and population density. Inter alia these will show how carrying capacity changes with stress levels in the absence of variation in other physical and biotic variables. Until now population effects of stressors have generally been assessed experimentally by calculating population growth rates in Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs), but these are time consuming and labor intensive and have only been performed at low population density. It is argued that measurements made at low density may underestimate population stress responses. To undertake the proposed experiments, faster and more efficient techniques for measuring population growth rates and their associated confidence intervals are needed, and some suggestions are made as to hew these might be achieved.","Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Div Zool, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England","Sibly, RM (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Div Zool, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England.",,,"Sibly, Richard/0000-0001-6828-3543",,,,17,57,60,0,9,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We investigated some of the processes affecting house mouse colonisation success by comparing the fates of mice experimentally introduced into woodland or buildings and provided with food and shelter (straw stacks) at a focal point. House mice introduced into buildings generally became established and bred, while house mice introduced into woodland declined to extinction within three months. House mice in buildings radiated away from the stacks and some established in the surrounding grassland, while house mice in woodland rarely left the stacks. At buildings captures of house mice outdoors correlated negatively with captures of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). There was evidence of heavy predation by weasels (Mustela nivalis) on house mice in woodland, but not in buildings. We suggest that woodland was unsuitable far house mice due to a combination of competition and predation: competition with wood mice restricted house mice to their focal introduction point making them vulnerable to extinction through predation by weasels.","Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Reading RG6 2AJ, Berks, England","Tattersall, FH (corresponding author), Royal Agr Coll, Cirencester GL7 6JS, Glos, England.",,,,,,,25,5,5,0,4,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0044-3468,,,Z SAUGETIERKD,Z.

Three predatory chironomid species constituted numerically 8.8% (+/- 95% CL 2.2) of the macro-and meiobenthic community at the sediment surface and in the hyporheic zone of Oberer Seebach, a gravel stream in Lower Austria. Larvae of Thienemannimyia geijskesi (Goetghebuer) and Nilotanypus dubius (Meigen) occurred in higher densities in sediment depths between 10) and 40 cm, whereas Conchapelopia pallidula (Meigen) achieved higher densities at the sediment surface. The three species completed one generation in a year. 2. A total of ninety-seven prey species and instars were identified by gut analyses, of which forty-one benthic rotifer species constituted 69.5% of individuals and twenty-three chironomid species and their instars, 22.9%. The three tanypod species showed shifts from mainly rotifer species in early instars to chironomids and diverse other meio- and macrofaunal taxa in later instars. Rather than shifting towards larger prey sizes, growing predators expanded their upper size thresholds and continued to include smaller prey species in their diet. The extent to which tanypod instars fed on similar prey size classes declined with increasing larval size. Predation by tanypods amounted to 2.2% (+/- 95% CL 0.1) of the combined prey densities and prey consumption averaged 1.32 (bootstrap 95% CL 1.26-1.39) individuals per predator individual. 3. Preferences for microhabitat flow differed between predator species and in the prey assemblage. Prey densities and densities of T. geijskesi and C. pallidula were highest in pool areas, whereas N. dubius achieved high densities in riffle sites. 4. Tanypod larvae fed non-selectively among prey types. To test the significance of observed size(instar)-specific spatial and dietary overlap values amongst tanypod species, simulations were generated from random models for pairs of intra-and interspecific associations of individuals and groups of prey and predator species. Groups and individuals of tanypod instars fed near randomly on groups of prey types and a high proportion (P > 0.60) of prey individuals are quasi-randomly chosen by tanypods in those patches. Tanypod instar-pairs did not show a sustained trophic resource partitioning in time, thus reducing the degree of competitive interactions for food in this predator guild. Spatially segregated and non-segregated tanypod instars formed random aggregations independent of each other at different flow microhabitats. 5. Species-rich prey assemblages such as benthic rotifers and larval chironomids increased the probability of non-selective feeding upon a wide spectrum of prey species by tanypods. Prey choice was governed by prey availability and tanypod individuals fed on many species at rather even proportions independent of each other.",,"Schmid, PE (corresponding author), AUSTRIAN ACAD SCI, INST LIMNOL, BIOL STN LUNZ, SEEHOF 4, A-3293 LUNZ AM SEE, AUSTRIA.",,,,,,,58,49,51,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

A direct, competitive effect of R. padi on D. noxia was observed only at extraordinarily high aphid densities (>2,000 individuals per greenhouse seedling). Lacewing predators significantly reduced the rate of increase of D. noxia in each experiment, but they were sometimes less effective on plants that received a mixture of both aphid species than they were on plants that received an equivalent number of D. noxia alone. The presence of R. padi may have reduced predation on D. noxia because the former species is more accessible to lacewing predators or because its faster growth rate caused it to outnumber D. noxia on plants that initially received an equal ratio of both species.

The model assumes that patches only vary with respect to host species present and encounter rates of parasitoids and hosts. It predicts that L. heterotoma should visit patches consisting of decaying stinkhorn mushrooms. This prediction is insensitive to values of model parameters and assumptions. However, field data show that L. heterotoma females rarely visit stinkhorn patches. This leads us to consider predation risk and interspecific competition on all patch types in the field. Predation was never observed, and generalist predators did not prey on our parasitoids. We hypothesise that L. heterotoma females avoid visiting stinkhorn patches because another. closely related, parasitoid species (Leptopilina clavipes) is often present on these patches. Subsequent experiments shaw that L. heterotoma females can recognise odours emanating From patches where adult L. clavipes females are present, and that they avoid visiting these patches. We show that L. clavipes is the superior competitor. Hence. by refraining to visit patches with L. clavipes, L. heterotoma females avoid strong interspecific competition. When interspecific competition is included in the model, predictions closely match field observations, indicating that avoidance of competition is an important factor for patch selection by L. heterotoma.","LEIDEN UNIV, INST EVOLUT & ECOL SCI, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","JANSSEN, A (corresponding author), UNIV AMSTERDAM, DEPT PURE & APPL ECOL, KRUISLAAN 320, 1098 SM AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.",,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,48,52,53,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1995,73,3,,,,,356,366,,10.2307/3545959,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TA648,WOS:A1995TA64800007,,,,,2021-09-24,

In central Oklahoma, two species of predaceous, pit-building ant lion larvae (Myrmeleon immaculatus and M. crudelis) coexist in a narrow, high-density (> 50 animals/m2) zone at the base of sandstone cliffs, where they are sheltered from rain and afternoon sun. Although larval movement is frequent and abundance within the zone varies seasonally, ant lions are rarely found > 2 m from the cliff base. I used field experiments and observations to test four hypotheses that could explain the maintenance of the ant lion zone: (1) zonation because of habitat availability; (2) zonation because of food availability; (3) zonation because of increased surface temperatures in exposed microhabitats; (4) zonation because of increased soil moisture and disturbance in exposed microhabitats. Ant lions are probably not limited to the cliffbase by the presence of rocks or vegetation, because there was no correlation between ant lion density and available habitat. The availability of prey also does not appear to limit ant lion distribution: ant abundance in pitfall traps was significantly higher outside the ant lion zone than within. Outside the ant lion zone, soil surface temperatures reach lethal levels in the afternoon sun. However, third-instar larvae of M. immaculatus transplanted in dry, sifted soil suffered little mortality over a 4-d period. Larvae transplanted into exposed sites gained significantly more mass than larvae transplanted into the ant lion zone, probably because of differences in food availability. Small-scale manipulations within the ant lion zone revealed that ant lion numbers decreased significantly over a 5-d period in response to both moisture (misting) and disturbance (pit-filling). In a recolonization experiment, the recovery time of patches exposed to a single ''rainfall'' treatment was extremely long: defaunated ''rainfall'' patches did not achieve the pit densities of defaunated control patches until after 84 d. Rainfall limits ant lion distribution through an interaction with temperature. Transplant experiments on natural substrata revealed the nature of this interaction. Within the ant lion zone, the soil remains dry and ant lion larvae bury themselves more rapidly in the sun than in the shade. Outside the ant lion zone, rainfall leads to the formation of a persistent soil crust. Larvae are unable to penetrate this crust, and they succumb to high temperatures in the sun. Because both species of ant lions are restricted to a narrow spatial zone, the probability of interspecific and intraspecific interactions (including competition, predation, and cannibalism) is increased. Such interactions may affect the density of both species within the ant lion zone. The abundances of M. crudelis and M. immaculatus were negatively correlated in quadrats from the center of the ant lion zone. Across the ant lion zone, the relative abundance of the two species also differed significantly, although the differences were not consistent among sites. Because of overriding abiotic constraints, neither species can achieve an ideal free distribution with respect to food resources. High-density predator aggregations may also affect prey community structure. Arthropod abundance was low within the ant lion zone, perhaps because of direct predation by ant lions or predator avoidance behavior by prey. Although the ant lion zone is caused by the interaction of abiotic factors, high-density predator aggregations have important biotic consequences for the population dynamics of the predators and the spatial distribution of their prey.","UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA",,,,,,,,48,85,89,0,29,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,226,237,,10.2307/1939517,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500023,,,,,2021-09-24,

However, predation is a strong mortality factor for members of the tit guild and predation risk may restrict the selection of foraging sites and organisation of the mixed-species tit flock. We evaluated pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) predation on North European tits and goldcrests. A literature analysis of six areas showed clearly that pygmy owls feed more heavily on those species that forage on exterior tree parts (coal tit P. ater and goldcrest Regulus regulus). These species are also subdominant in mixed-species flocks. The dominant species, crested tit (P. cristatus) and willow tit (P. montanus) were killed less frequently by pygmy owls. These two species forage on the inner parts of trees. The predation or competition hypothesis cannot alone explain the foraging site selection by the dominant species. There is more arthropod food on the outer parts ot branches and predation pressure is also higher on the outer parts of the tree. The most dominant species. crested tit, forages in the middle part of branches. We suggest that in the Parus guild there is a trade-off between predation risk and interspecific competition for food.

Here, we demonstrate that phloem-feeding membracids (Publilia modesta) compete intraspecifically for the protective services of an ant mutualist (Formica altipetens). By experimentally increasing membracid densities in the field, we observed three negative effects due to competition for ants: (1) a 45%-59% reduction in the number of ants tending membracid aggregations, (2) a 63% increase in the abundance of a predatory salticid spider (Pellenes sp.), and (3) a 59% reduction in the mean number of membracid nymphs per plant. In total, the loss of protective services due to competition for mutualists translated into a 92% decrease in the production of newly eclosed membracid adults. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration that animal species compete for mutualists. In addition, our work indicates that mutualisms can be strongly influenced by the local biotic neighborhoods in which they occur and thus may be far more variable than previously thought.","NO ARIZONA UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, FLAGSTAFF, AZ 86011 USA","CUSHMAN, JH (corresponding author), MACQUARIE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,64,68,71,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Increased E. obesus density reduced growth and survival of N. viridescens, but increased N. viridescens density did not significantly affect growth or survival of E. obesus. Increased intraspecific density reduced the growth of both species. There were no significant density effets of either Notophthalmus or Enneacanthus on the number, mass at metamorphosis, or larval period of N. viridescens efts, perhaps due to low reproduction in all treatments. Reproduction of E. obesus varied greatly among replicates, and did not respond to density treatments. A negative correlation between number of juvenile fish and mass indicated competition among juvenile E. obesus. Correlations among mass of adult and juvenile newts and fish were also negative, further suggesting competition between newts and fish.

By using a quasi-experimental, non-intrusive approach, we go beyond the classical view that predators only compete for living prey and disentangle the mechanisms of exploitative and interference competition between two charismatic apex predators, lionsPanthera leoand spotted hyaenasCrocuta crocuta, at carcasses other than their own kills. Carcasses of different sizes were monitored in two study areas of South Africa: one with both lions and hyaenas and the other with hyaenas only. We found evidence of both symmetric exploitative competition and asymmetric interference competition. Interactions were strongly conditioned by carcass size, and co-occurrence was mostly recorded at large ungulate carcasses. Interference competition seemed to dominate interspecific interactions, with lions having preferential access. However, interference while feeding did not exert any cost on the subordinate hyaenas, in terms of amount of ingested food and consumption rate, probably thanks to the reward provided by large carcasses in the form of abundant carrion, the use of lions to detect carcasses, and spatiotemporal segregation at the carcass-scale. Securing a diverse carrion supply in terms of carcass size, including megaherbivore carcasses, may favor the coexistence of the largest African carnivores, especially in small protected areas. Overall, our study reveals mechanisms related to both the food resource heterogeneity and the competitor behavior that allow the coexistence of strongly interacting species.","[Amoros, Mar] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Barcelona, Spain; [Gil-Sanchez, Jose M.; Moleon, Marcos] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain; [Moleon, Marcos] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Lopez-Pastor, Beatriz de las N.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Biol Aplicada, Alicante, Spain","Gil-Sanchez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain.",jmgilsanchez@yahoo.es,"Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/AAW-1016-2021; Moleon, Marcos/K-2875-2014","Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/0000-0002-7052-8332; Moleon, Marcos/0000-0002-3126-619X",Spanish Ministry of Education (Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011); Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R+D+I [SEV-2012-0262]; Ramon y Cajal ProgramSpanish Government [RYC-2015-19231]; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL2017-89905-R]; ERDF funds,"MM was supported by postdoctoral grants from the Spanish Ministry of Education (Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011), the Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R+D+I (SEV-2012-0262) and the Ramon y Cajal Program (RYC-2015-19231).

One important factor driving the degree of interspecific territoriality is competition for resources. Other influential factors are, for instance, population density, phylogenetic relatedness, fighting asymmetries, and shared predation. Although the degree of competition is usually a composite of several factors potentially influencing competition, it is possible to determine the degree of competition without knowing all influential factors and their importance. In line with this, we used the strength of behavioural interactions between species under standardized experimental conditions. In particular, we investigated the degree of interspecific competition using the territorial song of male Eurasian Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) as a low-risk response variable and the crossing flights and nearest approach distance to an intruder as high-risk defence behaviours. To simulate an interspecific intruder, we used male song playbacks of phylogenetic-related and more or less coexisting species. In line with our predictions, we found territorial defence to be most intense against conspecifics (positive control) and virtually non-existent against the allopatric Subalpine Warblers (S. cantillans) (negative control). In terms of the defence reaction to sympatric interspecific intruders, the response seemed strongest in relation to the Garden Warbler (S. borin) and weakest in relation to the Barred Warbler (S. nisoria). Our results further show that the vegetation characteristics of a territory influence behavioural responses to intruders, but only in relation to low-risk defence.","[Darolova, Alzbeta; Kristofik, Jan] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia; [Knauer, Felix] Univ Vet Med, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Savoyenstr 1, A-1160 Vienna, Austria; [Hoi, Herbert] Univ Vet Med, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Savoyenstr 1a, A-1160 Vienna, Austria","Darolova, A (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia.",alzbeta.darolova@savba.sk,,,"Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA)Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA) [2/0097/16]","This study was funded by Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA Grant Nr. 2/0097/16).",,59,3,3,4,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

The functional response of predators to prey density is a fundamental measure of interaction strength and its characterisation is essential to understanding these processes. We used mesocosm experiments to quantify the functional responses of five ground beetle species that represent common generalist predators of north-west European arable agriculture. We investigated two mechanisms predicted to be key drivers of trophic interactions in natural communities: predator:prey body size ratio and multiple predator effects. Our results show regularities in foraging patterns characteristic of similarly sized predators. Ground beetle attack rates increased and handling times decreased as the predator:prey body-mass ratio rose. Multiple predator effects on total prey consumption rates were sensitive to the identity of the interacting species but not prey density. The extent of interspecific interactions may be a result of differences in body mass between competing beetle species. Overall these results add to the growing evidence for the importance of size in determining trophic interactions and suggest that body mass could offer a focus on which to base the management of natural enemy assemblages.,"[Ball, S.

Populations of coral reef fish are structurally complex, so it is important to understand how these populations are shaped as a result of an individual's suite of traits and those of its competitors. We conducted a 2 x 2 factorial field experiment that manipulated body condition (high or low, manipulated through a feeding regime) and residency (resident or intruder, where the resident arrived at the habitat 3 h before the intruder) to evaluate effects on competitive ability and survival. Prior residency alleviated the disadvantage of a low body condition with respect to aggression, which was similar between low-condition residents and high-condition intruders. However, high-condition residents displayed a significantly greater level of aggression than intruders, regardless of whether intruders were from high- or low-condition treatments. For intruders to have a high probability of becoming dominant, they needed to have a large body condition advantage. Mortality trajectories suggested that body condition modified the effect of prior residency, and intruders were more likely to suffer mortality if they had a low body condition because residents pushed them away from shelter. Our results highlight that the negative effects of some traits may be compensated for by the positive effects of other traits, and that the specific ecological context an individual faces (such as the characteristics of its competitors) can have a major influence on successful establishment and persistence.","[Poulos, Davina E.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Poulos, Davina E.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Poulos, DE (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",davina.poulos@my.jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council,"We would like to thank L.

The best opportunity to test whether ongoing competition contributes to niche differentiation is to test for behavioral shifts by the subordinate competitor in controlled experiments in which the abundance of the dominant competitor is manipulated. Because these circumstances are difficult to coordinate in natural settings for wide-ranging species, researchers seize opportunities presented by species reintroductions. We tested for new competition between reintroduced wolves and resident cougars in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem to assess whether wolves might be impacting the realized niche of sympatric cougars. Results: Between 2002 and 2012, a period during which wolves increased from 15 to as high as 91 in the study area, cougars significantly increased the percentage of deer and decreased the percentage of elk in their diet in summer. Our top models explaining these changes identified elk availability, defined as the number of elk per wolf each year, as the strongest predictor of changing cougar prey selection. Both elk and deer were simultaneously declining in the system, though deer more quickly than elk, and wolf numbers increased exponentially during the same time frame. Therefore, we concluded that prey availability did not explain prey switching and that competition with wolves at least partially explained cougar prey switching from elk to deer. We also recorded 5 marked cougar kittens killed by wolves and 2 more that were killed by an undetermined predator. In addition, between 2005 and 2012, 9 adult cougars and 10 cougar kittens died of starvation, which may also be in part explained by competition with wolves. Conclusions: Direct interspecific predation and shifting cougar prey selection as wolves increased in the system provided evidence for competition between recolonizing wolves and resident cougars. Through competition, recolonizing wolves have impacted the realized niche of resident cougars in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem (SYE), and current resident cougars may now exhibit a realized niche more reflective of an era when these species were previously sympatric in the Yellowstone Ecosystem.","[Elbroch, L.

Current theory suggests that an increase in habitat generalist predators in response to landscape change is partially responsible for these declines. However, empirical tests have failed to reach a consensus on how and through what mechanisms landscape change affects nest predation. We tested one hypothesis, the Additive Predation Model, with an artificial nest experiment in fragmented landscapes in southern Queensland, Australia. We employed structural equation modelling of the influence of the relative density of woodland and habitat generalist predators and landscape features at the nest, site, patch and landscape scales on the probability of nest predation. We found little support for the Additive Predation Model, with no significant influence of the density of woodland predators on the probability of nest predation, although landscape features at different spatial scales were important. Within woodlands fragmented by agriculture in eastern Australia, the presence of noisy miner colonies appears to influence ecological processes important for nest predation such that the Additive Predation Model does not hold. In the absence of colonies of the aggressive native bird, the noisy miner, the influence of woodland predators on the risk of artificial nest predation was low compared with that of habitat generalist predators. Outside noisy miner colonies, we found significant edge effects with greater predation rates for artificial nests within woodland patches located closer to the agricultural matrix. Furthermore, the density of habitat generalist predators increased with the extent of irrigated land-use, suggesting that in the absence of noisy miner colonies, nest predation increases with land-use intensity at the landscape scale.","[Robertson, Oliver; Maron, Martine; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [House, Alan] Ecosure, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Robertson, O (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia.",olyrobertson@gmail.com,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011; Buckley, Yvonne/B-1281-2008","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789; Buckley, Yvonne/0000-0001-7599-3201; McAlpine, Clive/0000-0003-0457-8144","Cotton CRCAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Stuart Leslie Bird Research Award",These data were collected with permission from the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (reference no. 811108) and a scientific purposes (non-protected areas) permit (permit no.

Within lacustrine environments, cover habitat provides refuge from potential predators and is a resource that is competed for if limiting. Competitive interactions between bull trout and other species could result in bull trout being displaced from cover habitat, and bull trout may lack evolutionary adaptations to compete with introduced species, such as lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush. A laboratory experiment was performed to examine habitat use and interactions for cover by juvenile (i.e., < 80 mm total length) bull trout and lake trout. Differences were observed between bull trout and lake trout in the proportion of time using cover (F (1,22.6) = 20.08, P < 0.001) and bottom (F (1,23.7) = 37.01, P < 0.001) habitat, with bull trout using cover and bottom habitats more than lake trout. Habitat selection ratios indicated that bull trout avoided water column habitat in the presence of lake trout and that lake trout avoided bottom habitat. Intraspecific and interspecific agonistic interactions were infrequent, but approximately 10 times greater for intraspecific interactions between lake trout. Results from this study provide little evidence that juvenile bull trout and lake trout compete for cover, and that species-specific differences in habitat use and selection likely result in habitat partitioning between these species.","[Meeuwig, Michael H.; Guy, Christopher S.] Montana State Univ, Montana Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Fredenberg, Wade A.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Creston Fish & Wildlife Ctr, Kalispell, MT 59901 USA","Meeuwig, MH (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Mail Stop 315, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",meeuwig@gmail.com,,,U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service,"Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Augmentative releases of EPN have been used to enhance biological control of pests in agroecosystems. Pest managers strive to achieve a trophic cascade whereby natural-enemy effects permeate down throguh the food web to suppress host herbivores and increase crop production. Although trophic cascades have been studied in diverse aboveground arthropod-based systems, they are infrequently investigated in soil systems. Moreover, no overall quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of EPN in suppressing hosts with cascading benefits to plants has been made. Toward synthesizing the available but limited information on EPN and their ability to suppress prey and affect plant, yield, we surveyed the litrerature and performed a meta-analysis of 35 published studies. Our analysis found that effect sizes for arthropod hosts as a result of EPN addition were consistently negative and indirect effects on plants were consistently positive. Results held across several different host metrics (abundance, fecundity and survival) and across measures of plant performance (biomass, growth, yield and survival). Moreover, the relationship between plant and host effect sizes was strikingly and significantly negative. That is, the positive impact on plant responses generally increased as the negative effect of EPN on hosts intensified, providing strong support for the mechanism of trophic cascades. We also review the ways in which EPN might interact antagonistically with each other and other predators and pathogens to adversely affect host suppression and dampen trophic cascades. We conclude that the food web implications of multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN are little studied, but, as management techniques that promote the long-term persistence of EPN are improved, antagonistic interactions are more likely to arise. We hope that the likely occurrence of antagonistic interactions in soil food webs should stimulate researchers to conduct field experiments explicitly designed to examine multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN and their cascading effects to hosts and plants.","[Denno, Robert F.; Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kaplan, Ian] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Denno, RF (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",,,,128,44,46,0,40,SOC NEMATOLOGISTS,MARCELINE,"PO BOX 311, MARCELINE, MO 64658 USA",0022-300X,,,J NEMATOL,J.

The leading hypothesis for this displacement is exclusion via resource competition; however, the proximate mechanism producing a competitive advantage for A. albopictus over A. aegypti has Dot been identified. We performed laboratory experiments to test the hypotheses that these species differ in feeding behavior, and that these differences result in differences in survival when resources are scarce. Differences in feeding behavior were assessed in three environments with food (growing microorganisms) available: 1) in fluid only; 2) on leaf surfaces only; 3) or both in fluid and on leaf surfaces. We determined behavior of larvae in these environments, recording their positions (bottom, wall, leaf, top, or middle) and activities (browsing, filtering, resting, or thrashing) using instantaneous scan censuses. A. albopictus spent significantly more time at leaf surfaces, whereas A. aegypti spent more time engaging in nonfeeding activities. Both species showed a significant shift in foraging activity toward leaves when leaves were available. In a second experiment, we recorded survivorship for individuals raised in two treatment combinations: whole or half 17-mm disks of live oak leaves, with or without direct access to the leaf surface (controlled using nylon mesh, which allowed movement of microscopic organisms, but prevented mosquito larva movement between container sides). After 31 d, survivorsbip of A. albopictus was significantly greater than that of A. aegypti regardless of treatments. Moreover, A. albopictus showed significantly greater survivorship compared with A. aegypti when deprived of access to leaf surfaces and in whole leaf disk treatments, suggesting superior resource-harvesting ability for A. albopictus. Our experiments suggest that differences in foraging behavior contribute to the competitive advantage of A. albopictus over A. aegypti that has been observed in North America.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Yee, DA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",dayee@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI051374, R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15 AI051374, R01 AI044793] Funding Source: Medline",,,45,35,40,0,13,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0013-8746,,,ANN ENTOMOL SOC AM,Ann.

We examined group-choice decisions by individuals in armored and nonarmored species and predicted that either (1) the oddity effect would result in preference for conspecific groups for solitary individuals of both species, or (2) individuals in the armored species would prefer to associate with groups containing individuals of the more vulnerable species. Armored brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans) and nonarmored fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) have the same predators and often occur together in streams. In mixed-species shoals, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) attacked minnows earlier and more often than sticklebacks. We tested whether solitary minnows and sticklebacks preferred to associate with conspecific or heterospecific shoals under conditions of both low and high predation risk. When predation risk was high, minnows preferred to associate with conspecifics over heterospecifics, as predicted by the oddity effect. In contrast, sticklebacks preferentially associated with groups of minnows over groups of conspecifics when predation risk was high. When predation risk was low, solitary individuals of both species preferentially associated with conspecific over heterospecific shoals. Stickleback shoal choices under low-risk conditions may have been influenced by interspecific competition for food. In feeding experiments, minnows were more efficient foragers than sticklebacks, so it should benefit sticklebacks to avoid minnows unless predation risk is high. Therefore, for armored prey, the benefits of associating with more vulnerable prey appear to override the costs of both the oddity effect and food competition when predation risk is high.","SW Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Springfield, MO 65804 USA; Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada","Mathis, A (corresponding author), SW Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Springfield, MO 65804 USA.",sam477f@smsu.edu,,,,,,39,39,42,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The aphid, Chaitophorus populicola, is found only in association with ants, which provide tending services and protection from predators. As a consequence, aphid abundance declined by 88% on host plants located greater than or equal to6 m from an ant mound. Differences in host plant quality resulted in aphid fecundity being greatest on narrowleaf cottonwoods, 7-22% less on backcross hybrids, 37-46% less on F-1 hybrids, and 57-61% less on Fremont cottonwoods. Due to the combined effects of these factors, we found that the realized aphid habitat was only 21% of their potential habitat. On trees where aphids and tending ants are present, aphids and ants greatly outnumber any other arthropod species; therefore, we examined the hypothesis that the factors affecting aphid density and distribution are also determinants of arthropod community structure. On a per-tree basis, observational data showed that arthropod species richness was 51% greater and abundance was 67% greater on trees where aphid-ant mutualists were absent relative to trees where they were present. When aphids were experimentally removed and ants abandoned the tree, we found the same pattern. On a per-tree basis, arthropod species richness increased by 57%, and abundance increased by 80% where aphid-ant mutualists were removed, relative to control trees. Overall, a total of 90 arthropod species were examined in this study: 56% were found only on trees without aphid-ant mutualists, 12% were found only on trees with aphid-ant mutualists, and 32% were common to both. Specific guilds were also affected; the aphid-ant mutualism had a negative effect on herbivores, generalist predators, and other species of tending ants, and a positive effect on specialist enemies of aphids. These results suggest that, by examining the factors responsible for the population dynamics of a common herbivore, we may also uncover mechanisms that determine arthropod community structure. Furthermore, studies that address the role of mutualism in shaping communities are underrepresented in the literature; these results emphasize the importance of mutualism in ecological communities.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Wimp, GM (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",,"Wimp, Gina/AAT-3776-2020",,,,,66,138,150,2,60,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2001,82,2,,,,,440,452,,10.2307/2679871,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,403VX,WOS:000167064100012,,,,,2021-09-24,

The community consisted of 17 hoverfly species feeding on 20 aphid species occurring on 14 species of dominant herbaceous plants. In terms of larval prey preference, the dominant eight species of hoverfly were categorized into three groups: a polyphagous 'generalist' group consisting of four species, Episyrphus balteatus, Betasyrphus serarius, Syrphus vitripennis and Sphaerophoria sp.; an oligophagous 'specialist' group consisting of three species, Metasyrphus hakiensis, Dideoides latus and Paragus hemorrhous and Leucopis puncticornis, which showed a preference for two aphid species on the plant Torilis scabra. The prey aphids of the second group have behavioral or morphological defense mechanisms that are effective for preventing attacks by generalist hoverflies; two prey aphids are aggressive toward generalist predators and the others are protected by ant-attendance. The specialist hoverflies seem to be adapted to overcome these defense mechanisms. The prey ranges overlapped little between the generalist and the specialist groups, while those within the generalist group overlapped greatly.","Nagoya Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Lab Appl Entomol, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 46401, Japan","Itioka, T (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Lab Appl Entomol, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 46401, Japan.",,,,,,,33,21,22,0,24,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

The site is unusual in that the amphipod Corophium volutator is absent. In flats where the above polychaetes and Corophium co-occur, fish and shorebird predators significantly affect Corophium abundance but not polychaete abundance. Experiments were performed at Porter Point to determine whether fish and shorebirds depress polychaete abundance in the absence of their preferred prey. Caging experiments, with cages erected in late May 1985 and sampled in early July and in late August, revealed that Tharyx abundance was significantly higher within cages, demonstrating a significant effect of epibenthic predators. No other species showed significant differences in abundance between caged and control areas. Experiments demonstrate that fish prey on Tharyx but shorebirds do not. No species showed significant differences in abundance between caged and control areas in October collections. Winter ice, present between mid-December and mid-March, did not lead to a decline in the abundance of any taxon.

In coastal Newfoundland, Canada, capelin Mallotus villosus is the focal forage fish species that many top predators feed on during the summer: however, inshore availability varies throughout the boreal summer when abundant aggregations migrate inshore to spawn. We investigated the interactions and responses of Great Shearwaters Ardenna gravis and Sooty Shearwaters A. grisea during their non-breeding season to supplemental food supply under changing natural prey availability (higher and lower capelin availability) by conducting an at-sea experiment during July-August (2015/2016) in coastal Newfoundland. Supplemental food was offered every 30 s over 10 min (`experimental period'), which was preceded and followed by 10-min control periods (i.e., no food provided). The number of both species increased during the experimental periods, indicating that both species were attracted to the food supplementation experiment. Great Shearwaters were 7.6-13.8 times more likely than Sooty Shearwaters to land near the experimental platform and 95.2 times more likely than Sooty Shearwaters to fight over supplemental food items with individuals of the same or different species. These species-specific tendencies remained consistent as prey availability varied within years, but both species increased in their abundance and interactions with other species (including Herring Gulls Larus argentatus and Northern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialis) during prey capture at lower relative to higher prey availability, as evidenced by lower proportions of flying birds and a greater likelihood of landing on the water. Overall, we suggest that when Great and Sooty shearwaters feed in close association, Great Shearwaters are the more competitively dominant species, which may lead to higher risks of by-catch mortality, especially when the availability of natural prey decreases.","[Carvalho, Paloma C.; Maynard, Laurie D.; Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Carvalho, PC (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",ccpaloma@gmail.com,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2014-06290, 470195-2015, 486208-2016]; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship; CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education PersonnelCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001203/2013-04]","This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (2014-06290) to GKD; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Ship Time Grants (470195-2015, 486208-2016) to GKD; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program grants (2015-2016) to GKD; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship to LDM, and CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (001203/2013-04) to PCC.

Competitive performance is often interpreted in terms of biological species traits such as fecundity, resource use, and predation. However, many studies only measure competitive ability when species enter an environment simultaneously, and thus do not consider how the relative timing of species' arrival may determine competitive outcome (i.e., priority effects). Whether priority effects may influence competition inTriboliumremains to be tested. The present study examined the importance of priority effects in competitions between two common species of flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae):Tribolium castaneumandT.confusum. To investigate whether priority effects confer competitive advantages toTriboliumbeetles, relative introduction times ofT.castaneumandT.confusumto competitive arenas were manipulated, and adult populations were measured for seven months. Four important patterns were noted: (1)Triboliumspecies given two-weeks priority access to experimental arenas attained larger populations than their late-arriving competitor, (2) when founding adults were introduced simultaneously,T.castaneumwas competitively dominant, (3)T.castaneumbenefited more from priority arrival thanT.confusum, and (4) available bran resources largely predicted population decline in adult beetles toward the end of the experiment. These results suggest competitive outcome inTriboliumis not always predicted by species' identity, and that performance could instead be determined by the timing of species' arrivals and available resources.","[Holditch, Zane; Smith, Aaron D.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Smith, Aaron D.] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Smith, AD (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.; Smith, AD (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",Pimeliinae@gmail.com,,"Smith, Aaron/0000-0002-1286-950X",NSF ARTS program [DEB-1523605],This study was funded by the NSF ARTS program (DEB-1523605).,,59,0,0,0,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUL 9,2020,15,7,,,,,,,e0235289,10.1371/journal.pone.0235289,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,MQ0QU,WOS:000552602700069,32645709,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-24,

Our objective was to investigate how fire, rodent activity, and competition among plant species modify plant community structure, invasion patterns, and vulnerability to altered fire regimes. We imposed experimental fires, and reduced rodent density using fencing in a full factorial design and quantified competitive interactions among plant species in the northeast Mojave Desert that has experienced dramatic increases in plant invasion and fire in recent years. Vegetation surveys were conducted in the experimental plots to determine plant density, cover, and biomass of herbaceous plants over a 5-year period. Rodent exclusion increased the density, cover, and biomass of Bromus rubens, an invasive annual grass, and density of forb species. In contrast, rodent exclusion decreased the density, cover, and biomass of Schismus spp. another dominant annual invader. Fire increased Schismus spp. and forb species density, cover, and biomass but decreased B. rubens density. Negative spatial correlation between B. rubens and Schismus spp., and forbs indicated interspecific competition among the dominant plant species. Fire reduced rodent community diversity (Shannon's) 2.5-fold, which was correlated with increases in B. rubens cover and biomass, and native forb diversity. Fire, high rodent diversity, and competition from the other plant species may decrease fire potential in our study system by reducing the density and biomass of B. rubens, which because of its taller growth form tends to ignite and carry fire better than Schismus spp. and forbs.","[Bishop, Tara B.

Throughout their range, observations have been made of a dominance shift favouring D. r. bugensis where the two species co-occur. Although both dreissenids have been widely studied, the mechanisms driving this dominance shift are not completely understood. Our long-term and short-term field experiments assessed a selection of species traits related to growth and settlement, which may be linked to a competitive benefit for either of both species. We assessed relative population densities in time and space, mortality, and inter- and intraspecific interactions in relation to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, and light intensity, using 14 x 14 cm PVC settlement plates. Dreissenids were identified, counted and measured over 11 years in the waterbody where D. r. bugensis was first discovered in Western Europe. Dreissena polymorpha appeared to have a competitive benefit over D. r. bugensis by being able to settle earlier, i.e. in spring, while other studies indicate the opposite. As salinities in the study region were relatively high in spring, this discrepancy may be explained by a higher salinity tolerance of D. polymorpha, as is known from the literature. In addition, Common Coots predated D. r. bugensis clusters. Dreissena polymorpha were not usually found in such clusters. Regardless of these competitive benefits for D. polymorpha, D. r. bugensis is the dominant species in the region. One possible explanation could be the fact that D. r. bugensis was found in similar densities on both light exposed and shaded fouling plates. Dreissena polymorpha on the other hand, was practically absent on light-exposed plates after 12 months. Therefore, a wider range of habitats seems to be suitable for the settlement of D. r. bugensis. Another driver of the dominance shift can be linked to it having faster growth than D. polymorpha, especially during spring. More generally, D. r. bugensis occurred in higher population densities on plates with D. polymorpha than on plates with only D. r. bugensis. Dreissena polymorpha individuals may thus induce the settlement of additional individuals of D. r. bugensis. A final reason for the dominance of D. r. bugensis concerns its low winter mortality. While the number of D. polymorpha individuals more than halved over the winter 2016-2017, no significant decrease in numbers of D. r. bugensis was recorded.","[D'Hont, Anouk; Gittenberger, Adriaan] GiMaRIS Marine Res Inventory & Strategy Solut, Rijksstr Weg 75, NL-2171 AK Sassenheim, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Marine Zool, Pesthuislaan 7, NL-2333 BA Leiden, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Leiden Univ, Ctr Environm Studies CML, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Gittenberger, Adriaan] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol Leiden, Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Hendriks, A.

The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and spinycheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus) are invasive benthic predators that occupy and defend similar cryptic microhabitats, and thus may compete for shelter. The round goby expanded throughout the North American Great Lakes within 8 years of introduction, whereas another 6 years passed before it had spread through the upper St. Lawrence River. Here, we explore the premise that dense established populations of the invasive spinycheek crayfish slowed round goby colonization of the St. Lawrence River. We performed a series of videotaped laboratory experiments to determine if round gobies suffer from aggressive attacks or alter their behaviour (e.g. use of shelter and movement) in the presence of spinycheek crayfish. We also assessed the prolonged effects of food and shelter competition by comparing changes in the submerged mass of juvenile round gobies and spinycheek crayfish in conspecific and heterospecific pairs. Contrary to our predictions, round gobies more frequently initiated aggressive encounters with spinycheek crayfish, whereas the crayfish were more likely to flee or be evicted from their shelters. Furthermore, round gobies gained more body mass than spinycheek crayfish, regardless of conspecific or heterospecific pairing. Rather than impeding round goby colonization, spinycheek crayfish appear more likely to suffer energetic costs and an increased exposure to predation in the presence of round gobies.","[Church, Kathleen] Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Iacarella, Josephine C.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada","Ricciardi, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada.",tony.ricciardi@mcgill.ca,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN),"The authors are grateful to N.

Insecticides are agents of environmental disturbance that can potentially change ecological relationships and competitive outcomes, but this subject has seldom been examined. As the co-existing cereal grain beetle species Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and Rhyzopertha dominica F. share a common realized niche, directly competing for the same resources, they were used as models in our study. Intraspecific competition experiments were performed with increasing insect densities and insecticide doses in additive and replacement series using various density combinations of both beetle species maintained on insecticide-free or -sprayed grains. Insecticide-mediated release from competitive stress was not observed in our study of intraspecific competition in grain beetles. The insecticide enhanced the effect of insect density, particularly for the maize weevil S. zeamais, further impairing population growth at high densities. Therefore, insecticide susceptibility increased with intraspecific competition favoring insecticide efficacy. However, the effect of insecticide exposure on competitive interaction extends beyond intraspecific competition, affecting interspecific competition as well. Sitophilus zeamais was the dominant species when in interspecific competition prevailing in natural conditions (without insecticide exposure), but the dominance and species prevalence shifted from S. zeamais to R. dominica under insecticide exposure. Therefore, high conspecific densities favored insecticide efficacy, but the strength of the relationship differs with the species. In addition, the insecticide mediated a shift in species dominance and competition outcome indicating that insecticides are relevant mediators of species interaction, potentially influencing community composition and raising management concerns as potential cause of secondary pest outbreaks.","[Cordeiro, Erick Mauricio G.; Correa, Alberto S.; Guedes, Raul Narciso C.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Correa, Alberto S.] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Dept Entomol & Acarol Agr, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Guedes, RNC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",guedes@ufv.br,"Guedes, Raul Narciso Carvalho/L-3924-2013; Correa, Alberto S/C-4683-2014; Cordeiro, Erick MG/P-7042-2015","Guedes, Raul Narciso Carvalho/0000-0001-6229-7549; Correa, Alberto S/0000-0002-3788-7480; ",Minas Gerais State Foundation of Research Aid (FAPEMIG)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); CAPES Foundation (Brazilian Ministry of Education)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology,"Funding was provided by the following Brazilian agencies: Minas Gerais State Foundation of Research Aid (FAPEMIG; www.fapemig.br), the CAPES Foundation (Brazilian Ministry of Education; www.capes.gov.br), and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq; Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology; www.cnpq.br).

Recent analyses suggest a strong likelihood of competition between eutherian predators and the endangered spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), although experiments are required to confirm this. If competition does occur, what are its likely effects on the long-term survival of spotted-tailed quoll populations? We used population viability analysis (PVA) to predict the fate of a hypothetical quoll population under various scenarios of competition. PVA showed that spotted-tailed quoll populations may be susceptible to extinction when faced with high densities of competitors. Model scenarios simulating exploitation competition and/or intraguild killing greatly reduced the population's probability of survival, leading in the worst-case scenario to almost certain extinction.","[Glen, A.

Certainly there have been copious, seminal works on competition in marine and freshwater ecosystems, most often on research executed at smaller ecological scales such as rocky intertidal zones, coral reefs, or littoral zones, and often involving experimental manipulation. Such studies have typically emphasized organisms with relatively high site fidelity, and all have focused primarily at the individual level. Here we springboard from those studies to explore competition among marine fishes at broader spatiotemporal scales, scales at which fish populations are distributed, scales at which their associated fisheries operate and are managed, and as observed under ambient (i.e., nonexperimental) system dynamics. Inferring that competition might be occurring among marine fishes requires four conditions: opposite population trajectories, high spatiotemporal overlap, high dietary overlap, and some indication of resource limitation. We used those criteria to examine cases of species pairings from the Northeast United States Large Marine Ecosystem to ascertain if there are broadly applicable rules of thumb to determine when competition might be a significant consideration. We assert that such rules exist, and where competition is strongly suspected, we provide an empirically based method of calculating first-order, model-free interaction terms that can scope the potential magnitude of competitive effects. We do so very much cognizant of several caveats and theoretical considerations; but our main premise is that estimating and evaluating competition for marine fishes from extant, commonly available data is feasible, is highly germane, and has many valuable applications for multispecies and ecosystem models as we move toward ecosystem-based fisheries management.","[Link, Jason S.] NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Auster, Peter J.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Auster, Peter J.] Sea Res Fdn Myst Aquarium, Groton, CT 06340 USA","Link, JS (corresponding author), NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",Jason.Link@noaa.gov,"Auster, Peter/ABI-3568-2020","Link, Jason/0000-0003-2740-7161",NOAA Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary; National Marine Sanctuary Foundation; Florida State University,"We thank the organizers, especially PC Coleman, of the Mote Symposium on Species Interactions for inviting us to contribute this work and its associated keynote presentation.

To gain insight into ensuing mechanisms that might alter indirect species interactions, we examined how behavioural responses to an upper-level predatory fish might differ between mesopredator species with different life histories. In rocky reefs of the northeast Pacific Ocean, adult lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are upper-level predators that use a sit-and-wait hunting mode. Reef mesopredators that are prey to adult lingcod include kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus), younger lingcod, copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and quillback rockfish (S. maliger). Across these mesopredators species, longevity and age at maturity increases and, consequently, the annual proportion of lifetime reproductive output decreases in the order just listed. Therefore, we hypothesized that the level of risk taken to acquire resources would vary interspecifically in that same order. During field experiments we manipulated predation risk with a model adult lingcod and used fixed video cameras to quantify interactions between mesopredators and tethered prey (Pandalus shrimps). We predicted that the probabilities of inspecting and attacking tethered prey would rank from highest to lowest and the timing of these behaviours would rank from earliest to latest as follows: kelp greenling, lingcod, copper rockfish, and quillback rockfish. We also predicted that responses to the model lingcod, such as avoidance of interactions with tethered prey, would rank from weakest to strongest in the same order. Results were consistent with our predictions suggesting that, despite occupying similar trophic levels, longer-lived mesopredators with late maturity have stronger antipredator responses and therefore experience lower foraging rates in the presence of predators than mesopredators with faster life histories. The corollary is that the fishery removal of top predators, which relaxes predation risk, could potentially lead to stronger increases in foraging rates for mesopredators with slower life histories.","[Frid, Alejandro; Marliave, Jeff] Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, Dept Biol Sci, N Miami, FL USA","Frid, A (corresponding author), Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",alejfrid@gmail.com,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003",Florida International University Division of Research,"The study was funded in its entirety through a Seed Funds Award to Michael R Heithaus from the The Florida International University Division of Research.

Such size-dependent predation risk is very common in systems with intraguild predation (IGP), i.e. when predatory species interact through predation and competition. Theory on IGP predicts that community composition depends on productivity. When recently testing this prediction using a terrestrial experimental system consisting of two phytoseiid mite species, Iphiseius degenerans as the IG-predator and Neoseiulus cucumeris as the IG-prey, and pollen (Typha latifolia) as the shared resource, we could not find the predicted community shift. Instead, we observed that IG-prey excluded IG-predators when the initial IG-prey/IG-predator ratio was high, whereas the opposite held when the initial ratio was low, which is also not predicted by theory. We therefore hypothesized that the existence of vulnerable and invulnerable stages in the two populations could be an important driver of the community composition. To test this, we first demonstrate that IG-prey adults indeed attacked IG-predator juveniles in the presence of the shared resource. Second, we show that the invasion capacity of IG-predators at high productivity levels indeed depended on the structure of resident IG-prey populations. Third, we further confirmed our hypothesis by mimicking successive invasion events of IG-predators into an established population of IG-prey at high productivity levels, which consistently failed. Our results show that the interplay between stage structure of populations and reciprocal intraguild predation is decisive at determining the species composition of communities with intraguild predation.","[Montserrat, M.; Sabelis, M.

The present study provides direct evidence indicating that the oviposition behaviour of the two main mango fruit fly species, Ceratitis cosyra (Walker) and Bactrocera invadens Drew-Tsurata & White, is affected by secretions of the dominant arboreal ant Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille). When offered ant-exposed and unexposed mangoes in the absence of the ants, both fly species are reluctant to land on ant-exposed fruits and, when having landed, often take off quickly and fail to oviposit. The number of puparia collected from unexposed mangoes is approximately eight-fold higher than from ant-exposed ones. The results obtained from laboratory experiments and field observations confirm that adult fruit flies are more affected through repellence by ant cues than by direct predation. The use of cues by fruit flies in predator avoidance has implications for evolutionary ecology, behavioural ecology and chemical ecology.","[Van Mele, Paul] Africa Rice Ctr WARDA, Cotonou, Benin; [Vayssieres, Jean-Francois] UR HortSys, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Vayssieres, Jean-Francois; Adandonon, Appolinaire; Sinzogan, Antonio] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin","Van Mele, P (corresponding author), Africa Rice Ctr WARDA, 01 BP 2031, Cotonou, Benin.",p.vanmele@cgiar.org,,,"Conservation, Food and Health Foundation","We thank Mr Delou for his technical assistance and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

However, it is relatively unknown how potential competitive interactions could be taking place. In many freshwater turtles, semiochemicals from different glands might facilitate species and sex recognition. We hypothesized that chemosensory detection of competitor species might affect space use and habitat selection by freshwater turtles. We analyzed whether T. scripta and M. leprosa turtles recognized chemical cues from male and female conspecifics and heterospecifics in water. We compared time spent by turtles in clean water pools vs. water pools containing the different chemical stimuli. Introduced T. scripta did not avoid nor prefer water pools with chemical stimuli of native M. leprosa terrapins, which might favor the expansion of the invasive species. In contrast, M. leprosa preferred water with chemical stimuli of conspecifics and avoided water with chemical cues of T. scripta, which suggests that chemical cues could be used by native M. leprosa to avoid water pools occupied by introduced T. scripta. We suggest that this avoidance behavior of native M. leprosa may be one of the causes that contribute to the observed displacement of their populations by invasive T. scripta.","[Polo-Cavia, Nuria; Lopez, Pilar; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",Jose.Martin@mncn.csic.es,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014; , Nuria/L-5372-2014; Lopez, Pilar/K-6221-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Lopez, Pilar/0000-0001-6577-1509",Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2005-00391/BOS]; El Ventorrillo'' C.S.I.C.,"We thank an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments, the Grupo de Rehabilitacion de la Fauna Autoctona y su Habitat'' ( GREFA) for providing sliders, and El Ventorrillo'' MNCN Field Station for use of their facilities.

However, rarely has propagule size been experimentally manipulated to examine changes in invader behaviour, and propagule longevity and success. We manipulated propagule size of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile in laboratory and field studies. Laboratory experiments involved L. humile propagules containing two queens and 10, 100, 200 or 1000 workers. Propagules were introduced into arenas containing colonies of queens and 200 workers of the competing native ant Monomorium antarcticum. The effects of food availability were investigated via treatments of only one central resource, or 10 separated resources. Field studies used similar colony sizes of L. humile, which were introduced into novel environments near an invasion front. In laboratory studies, small propagules of L. humile were quickly annihilated. Only the larger propagule size survived and killed the native ant colony in some replicates. Aggression was largely independent of food availability, but the behaviour of L. humile changed substantially with propagule size. In larger propagules, aggressive behaviour was significantly more frequent, while L. humile were much more likely to avoid conflict in smaller propagules. In field studies, however, propagule size did not influence colony persistence. Linepithema humile colonies persisted for up to 2 months, even in small propagules of 10 workers. Factors such as temperature or competitor abundance had no effect, although some colonies were decimated by M. antarcticum. Synthesis and applications. Although propagule size has been correlated with invasion success in a wide variety of taxa, our results indicate that it will have limited predictive power with species displaying behavioural plasticity. We recommend that aspects of animal behaviour be given much more consideration in attempts to model invasion success. Secondly, areas of high biodiversity are thought to offer biotic resistance to invasion via the abundance of predators and competitors. Invasive pests such as L. humile appear to modify their behaviour according to local conditions, and establishment was not related to resource availability. We cannot necessarily rely on high levels of native biodiversity to repel invasions.","[Sagata, Katayo; Lester, Philip J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand","Lester, PJ (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",phil.lester@vuw.ac.nz,"Lester, Phil/A-1296-2008","Lester, Phil/0000-0002-1801-5687",NZ Aid Scholarship,"We thank Carrone Conroy, Alex Dixson, Catherine Duthie and Megan Sarty for assistance, and John Haywood for statistical advice.

While in mobile species the outcome of interference at a local scale can usually be determined from differences in body size and behavior, the population-level consequences of such interactions vary depending on rates of settlement and recruitment at a site, which are not directly correlated to local reproductive success. Previous experimental studies in central Chile demonstrated that interference competition for refuges is the primary factor driving microhabitat segregation between the predatory crabs Acanthocyclus gayi and Acanthocyclus hassleri, with the latter species monopolizing galleries inside mussel beds and excluding A. gayi to rock crevices. Between April 2001 and March 2006 we quantified monthly recruitment rates in artificial collectors at 17 sites over 900 km of the central coast of Chile. Results show that recruitment rates of A. hassleri are almost two orders of magnitude lower than those of A. gayi, and that they are tightly and positively correlated among sites across the region, suggesting that at scales of kilometers larval stages of these species are affected by similar oceanographic processes. Total crab densities per site were also positively correlated between species and strongly associated to mussel cover, with overall low crab densities at all sites where mussel cover was lower than about 60%. At all sites with mussel cover > 60%, the ratio of A. gayi to A. hassleri density progressively decreased from recruits (2.6) to juveniles (0.5) to adults (0.04), overcoming initial differences in recruitment rates. The relative success of the inferior competitor at sites with low mussel cover does not appear to provide a potential mechanism favoring regional coexistence through dispersal to other sites (mass effects), because their densities were lower than at sites of high mussel cover. Yet, at many sites of low mussel cover the dominant competitor is virtually absent, allowing A. gayi to attain larger population sizes at the scale of the region. Thus, the factors limiting the dominant competitor from successfully utilizing other microhabitats seem to be the most critical factor in promoting both local and regional coexistence between these species.","[Navarrete, Sergio A.; Parrague, Mirtala; Wieters, Evie A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile; [Navarrete, Sergio A.; Parrague, Mirtala; Wieters, Evie A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile","Navarrete, SA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",snavarrete@bio.puc.cl,"Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013","Parrague, Mirtala/0000-0002-7899-3263",,,,54,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

As crosses between two distinct genotypes, hybrids might express fitness characteristics similar to either parent species, or they might produce unique phenotypic attributes that make them more or less than either parent species. We identified a potential hybrid zone among soft corals in a backreef community on Guam, where the broadcast- spawning species Sinularia maxima and S. polydactyla co- occur. Morphological and chemical traits con. rmed the intermediate and unique status of the putative hybrid. Laboratory cross- fertilization experiments using S. maxima and S. polydactyla gametes demonstrated that barriers to hybridization are absent and that the laboratory- reared hybrids developed specific characteristics identified in adult hybrid field populations. Changes in the populations of each parent species and the hybrid were monitored over a decade. While populations of the parent species declined significantly, the hybrid population doubled in percent cover over this period. We assessed responses to abiotic ( sedimentation) and biotic ( competition and predation) factors to determine whether the two parent species or the hybrids exhibited greater. tness. While sedimentation alone could not explain the decline in field populations of the parent species, sediment effects exact a significant cost to these soft corals over narrow spatial scales. Competition between the parent and hybrid soft corals explains some of the changes in the distribution and abundance of these species through time. The extracts of S. polydactyla had no effect against congeners, whereas those of S. maxima and the hybrid caused significant tissue necrosis. Field predation was significantly lower on the hybrid than on either parent species. Laboratory feeding assays demonstrated that the extracts of the hybrid were signi. cantly more deterrent than either S. maxima or S. polydactyla. Comparisons of the bioactive metabolites from the parent species, a hybrid compound, and a semi- purified mixture indicated that the hybrid is more deterrent than either of the parent species. Our results indicate that the hybrid Sinularia maxima3polydactyla exhibits greater. tness than the parent species and suggests that hybrid vigor may have implications for coral reef resilience.","[Slattery, Marc; Kamel, Haidy N.; Ankisetty, Sridevi] Univ Mississippi, Dept Pharmacognosy, University, MS 38677 USA; [Slattery, Marc; Gochfeld, Deborah J.] Univ Mississippi, Natl Ctr Nat Prod Res, University, MS 38677 USA; [Hoover, Cindi A.] Univ Delaware, Coll Marine & Earth Sci, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Thacker, Robert W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA","Slattery, M (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Pharmacognosy, University, MS 38677 USA.",slattery@olemiss.edu,,,,,,152,19,20,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

We examined the response of several dominant and subordinate cavity-nesting species to a reduction in the availability of an essential resource (nesting cavities) using the novel experimental approach of blocking the entrances to high-quality cavities. We monitored nest abundance on seven treatment and 13 control sites (aspen groves in a grassland matrix) in British Columbia, Canada, for two years pretreatment (2000-2001), two years during treatment (2002-2003), and two years posttreatment (cavities reopened; 2004-2005). At the community level, nest abundance declined by 50% on treatment sites following cavity blocking and returned to pretreatment levels following cavity reopening. Nest abundance of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a dominant secondary cavity-nester (SCN), declined by 89% and failed to recover posttreatment. Conversely, nest abundance of Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides; a subordinate SCN) increased following cavity blocking and remained high following reopening. Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were unaffected by cavity blocking. We suggest that starlings, while being the dominant SCN, may be limited by availability of suitable nest sites, whereas bluebirds may be limited by starling abundance. We propose that plasticity in nest site preferences of subordinate cavity-nesters may enable them to contend with natural variation in availability of critical resources, such as nest cavities and food, in addition to coping with interspecific competition. This is the. first community-level, multiyear study involving manipulation of nest site availability via experimental cavity blocking.","[Aitken, Kathryn E.

Past research has indicated that numerous factors may influence salamander distributions, including competition, predation, and abiotic factors. We conducted a field removal experiment to investigate potential interactions among salamanders across the steam-woodland ecotone and to determine the effects of such interactions on community structure. We used removals of a terrestrial salamander, Plethodon cinereus, and/or several species of semi-aquatic salamanders of the genus Desmognathus to investigate potential interactions between these genera and the semi-aquatic salamander Eurycea cirrigera. Although removals did not significantly decrease numbers of P. cinereus or Desmognathus on plots, distribution of E. cirrigera shifted unexpectedly closer to streams in response to removals of P. cinereus. Eurycea cirrigera may have been responding to demographic shifts of P. cinereus, as average snout-vent length and mass of P. cinereus decreased significanfly on removal plots.

While small-scale individual-level studies on normative-native fish interactions have helped elucidate mechanisms of impact, very few investigations have occurred at a scale consistent with that of species replacement. Thus, large-scale population-level studies are needed to understand the effects of normative fish as well as to more effectively conserve native fishes in the presence of normative fish. For this reason, we conducted an evaluation of the effects of normative brown trout Salmo trutta on the individual- and population-level performance of native cutthroat trout using a field-experimental approach. We studied local populations of cutthroat trout in the presence and absence of brown trout in long stream reaches and subsequently compared growth, condition, stable-isotope-based measures of dietary habits, movement, and survival between treatment groups. We found clear evidence for reduced cutthroat trout growth owing to the presence of brown trout. Additionally, we observed differences in cutthroat trout dietary habits based on delta C-13 signatures resulting from our experimental manipulation of brown trout abundance. Finally, brown trout suppressed cutthroat trout movement but had no apparent effect on their survival. Considering previous studies, we concluded that the individual-level effects of brown trout on cutthroat trout are scale invariant. Higher-level impacts (i.e., on movement and survival), in contrast, appear to be more sensitive to the scale at which the investigation is conducted. Overall, our results indicate that brown trout can have strong negative effects on cutthroat trout performance and should therefore be more explicitly considered in native fish conservation plans.","Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources,Coll Nat, Logan, UT 84322 USA","McHugh, P (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources,Coll Nat, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",pam@cc.usu.edu,"Budy, Phaedra/B-2415-2012","Budy, Phaedra/0000-0002-9918-1678",,,,88,35,37,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Although the two species have similar diets, the jackal is about three times larger than the red fox. The current evidence for interspecific competition between these two canids is circumstantial and indirect. In this study we aimed to measure experimentally the response of red foxes to increasing exposure to the presence of the golden jackal. Our field experiments comprised three stimuli: urine as a scent stimulus, a mounted specimen and urine as a static animal-image stimulus, and a caged pet animal as a live animal stimulus. The treatment and control were placed near food trays, and the behaviour of foxes around these trays was documented by video recorders. In most cases, the presence of scent or cast of a golden jackal did not alter the behaviour of the foxes. However, foxes avoided the test arena when a live jackal was present. This finding provides strong evidence that red foxes fear jackals, and shows that foxes are more concerned when a live jackal is present. The possible implications of the observed fox behaviour for the understanding of large-scale competitive exclusion among canid species are discussed.

Its colonies defend their whole foraging areas (territories) against other territorial ants, including F. sanguinea Latr., a common facultative slave-maker. The most frequent 'victim' of F. sanguinea is F. fusca L., a ubiquitous submissive ant species. On the basis of some earlier observations, the presumption was made that F. polyetena, when defending its own territories, would indirectly protect F. fusca, colonies, which nest within these territories, from F. sanguinea raids. It was expected that F. fusca should be more abundant in F. polyetena territories, than in F. sanguinea territories, while other subordinate ants, which are not potential slaves of F. sanguinea, should not show such difference. This hypothesis was supported by the results of the baiting experiments carried out in the Bialowieza Forest, NE Poland.

We examined whether isolation creates differences in fish assemblages among reefs through changes in predation pressure. First, small artificial reefs were placed at increasing distances from a naturally continuous reef, over a sloping bottom. Species richness and density of each species increased with isolation. Next, artificial reefs were relocated, together with all their fish inhabitants, closer to the natural reef. Following relocation, resident fishes of the artificial reefs exhibited a sharp decline in numbers, while predatory fish density increased. Both video observations of the relocated artificial reefs and the correlation between piscivore aggregation and decline of the resident fishes revealed that the cause of decline was the strong predation around the artificial reefs. The decline was density-dependent, such that the per-capita rate of decline was higher on artificial reefs with higher fish density. This study shows that the impact of piscivores on resident fish is modified by small-scale isolation. The results suggest that the high density of fish on small, isolated reefs is enabled by low predation.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Evolut Syst & Ecol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Belmaker, J (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",belmakej@bgumail.ac.il,"Shashar, Nadav/Y-8552-2019; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Belmaker, Jonathan/I-1004-2019; Belmaker, Jonathan/F-7166-2011","Belmaker, Jonathan/0000-0002-5618-7359; Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,58,23,24,0,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In central Europe where densities are high, densities were unimodally related to each other. In northern and southern Europe linear and positive associations appeared.

The results suggest that species interactions may indeed vary in relation to the density of potential competitor and switch from positive to negative along environmental gradients.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland","Monkkonen, M (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",mikko.monkkonen@oulu.fi,"Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012; Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,47,19,19,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2004,27,1,,,,,112,118,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03705.x,,,7,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,775DP,WOS:000189025700011,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

However, interactions between established residents and incoming juveniles may affect juvenile persistence in species-specific ways and could therefore impose a degree of determinism on future Community structure. Using 16 spatially isolated communities of, coral reef fishes, I conducted two experiments to determine how prior residency by two guilds of fishes affected juvenile recruitment. Each experiment factorially manipulated the presence and absence of two guilds: resident piscivores (groupers and moray eels) and interference competitors (territorial damselfishes). In the first experiment, guilds were manipulated via selective removals, and subsequent recruitment (larval settlement minus mortality) was monitored for 44 days. In the second experiment, guilds Were placed within large cages to prevent direct resident-juvenile interactions, while allowing for any cues produced by enclosed fishes, thereby testing whether incoming larvae used resident-derived cues to select or reject settlement sites. Colonizing juveniles were collected from each reef over 42 days to prevent confounding resident- and recruit-derived cues. In the first experiment, piscivores inhibited recruitment of a damselfish (Pomacentridae) and a surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), and enhanced recruitment of a wrasse (Labridae). In contrast, territorial damselfishes inhibited recruitment of the damselfish and the wrasse, and enhanced recruitment of the surgeonfish. Observations of early recruitment patterns suggested that recruitment differences were established rapidly during the night or dawn periods shortly after settlement and before each daily census. In the second experiment, there was no evidence that larvae used resident-derived cues to select settlement sites, suggesting that recruitment differences in the first experiment resulted from differential mortality caused by direct resident-recruit interactions rather than differential larval settlement. These results demonstrate that interactions between established residents and newly arrived juveniles can have a strong influence on juvenile persistence, and that such interactions appear to be strongest within hours of larval, settlement. Furthermore, because resident effects were species specific, the present composition of these communities may impose a previously undocumented degree of determinism on their future structure.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Almany, GR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Glenn.Almany@jcu.edu.au,,,,,,76,111,111,1,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2003,84,7,,,,,1920,1935,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1920:PEICRF]2.0.CO;2,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,713DN,WOS:000184840900025,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-24,

We tested single-species (three slimy sculpins/m(2) or three brown trout/m(2)) and combined-species (three sculpins/m(2) and three trout/m(2)) combinations in each of six riffles. We placed a clay tile in each enclosure to evaluate the effects of fish combinations on benthic macroinvertebrates. Growth of brown trout was unaffected by the presence of slimy sculpins (P = 0.647, power [to detect 50% increase in growth] = 0.92), whereas slimy sculpin growth was less in the presence of brown trout (P = 0.038). Densities of total benthic macroinvertebrates, Chironomidae, Trichoptera, and Physa did not differ among fish combinations (P > 0.3). However, densities of Gammarus pseudolimnaeus were significantly less in the presence of brown trout irrespective of the presence of slimy sculpins (P = 0.024), which could be a causal factor underlying the interaction between brown trout and slimy sculpins. We found asymmetrical competition between brown trout and slimy sculpins in stream enclosures, with brown trout being the superior competitor. Nevertheless, the size of enclosures may have biased our results, making it more likely to detect an effect of brown trout on slimy sculpins than vice versa.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Fairfield Univ, Dept Biol, Fairfield, CT 06430 USA; Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Ruetz, CR (corresponding author), Lake Michigan Ctr, Annis Water Resources Inst, 740 W Shoreline Dr, Muskegon, MI 49441 USA.",,,,,,,45,22,23,1,14,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

We conducted two manipulative field experiments in the soft-bottom intertidal zone during 19901991 in eastern Maine to assess effects of predation, intraspecific competition, and initial planting size on the survival and growth of cultured individuals of Mya. Experiment I (23 June 1990 to 13 June 1991) tested interactive effects of two planting sizes (small=8.5 mm shell length (SL); large=11.8 mm SL) and protective netting on fate and growth of clams. Animals of each size were added to separate experimental units within each of 60 1-m(2) areas delimited by a wooden box. To deter predators, 50 boxes were covered with a specific type of plastic netting that differed in aperture size (4.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mm) and degree of rigidity (flexible vs. extruded) while 10 boxes served as controls (without netting). Small clams grew at a faster rate than large clams, but both added approximately 18 mm of new shell by the end of the study. Growth was unaffected by netting size and rigidity, but 13% more clams were recovered alive after a year in protected vs. unprotected treatments (84% vs. 71%). Survival was independent of netting type. The presence of netting resulted in nearly a 3 x enhancement of wild spat (<15 mm SL) compared to unprotected controls (568.8+/-24.4 vs. 199.6+/-22.8 m(-2)). This result suggests that the decline of wild stocks in eastern Maine may not be related to recruitment failure, but to post-settlement events, such as predation, which remove clams from the intertidal. In Experiment II (15 April to 6 October 1991), clam (14.6+/-0.2 mm SL) density was manipulated across four levels from 333 to 2664 m(-2) in protected (extruded netting, 12.8 mm aperture) and unprotected 1-m(2) boxes. Survival within unprotected boxes was independent of stocking density (79%), but was inversely density-dependent in protected boxes (77% in the lowest density treatment increasing to a mean of 88% in the other three treatments). A negative cubic relationship explained the effect of density on growth. We present the first mariculture strategy for public stock enhancement or private entrepreneurs interested in rearing M. arenaria in Maine and the northeast US. Hatchery-reared juveniles 8-10 mm SL should be planted in the spring near or below mid tide levels at densities between 333 and 666 m(-2) and protected with flexible netting (6.4 mm aperture) raised several centimeters above the sediment surface. Netting should be removed from mud flats in the late fall before the threat of ice and severe winter storms. Animals should attain sizes between 25 and 30 mm SL during this time and reach a size refuge from burrowing and other predators. Growth to legal, commercial size (50.8 mm SL) should take another 2-4 years depending on geographic location and mean seawater temperature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

When eggs of two or more species are deposited at the same time and patch, one can expect a high density of early-instar larvae. Thus, interspecific interactions should be evident. We studied the interaction of two species, Sympetrum fonscolombii and Orthetrum cancellatum, which typically co-occur in French rice fields. We experimentally simulated the laying of egg clutches of both species at the same time and site. Survival of O. cancellatum was reduced compared with that of controls without S. fonscolombii and also with that of S. fonscolombii in the two-species treatment. At the end of the experiment, mean head width of S. fonscolombii was greater than that of O. cancellatum, which may be one reason for the differential survival. In a second experiment we observed the behaviour of pairs of early-instar larvae of both species in different size combinations. Small larvae of S. fonscolombii reduced locomotory activity in the presence of larger O. cancellatum. In contrast, small O. cancellatum did not do so in the presence of larger S. fonscolombii. This behavioural difference may also cause asymmetric interspecific predation.","Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, D-38092 Braunschweig, Germany","Suhling, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Fasanenstr 3, D-38092 Braunschweig, Germany.",f.suhling@tu-bs.de,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",,,,56,16,18,1,11,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Increasing both the dispersion of food resources and microhabitat topography dramatically reduced interspecific competition. Adding topographic structure reduced the advantages of the larger, faster, invasive species. Interindividual spacing decreased, but intraspecific agonistic interference increased in the more territorial, resident species. Human structural alterations of the environment facilitate invasion and competitive displacement in this system.

It is now known that larval amphibians exposed to acid water may experience increased mortality or reduced rates of growth. At the interspecific level, species that respond differently to variation in abiotic factors such as pH may experience a shift in their interactions. I used naturally occurring pH levels (4.5, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0) in laboratory experiments to examine the effects of pH on the growth and predator-prey interaction of Ambystoma tigrinum and Pseudacris triseriata. Larvae of A. tigrinum exhibited reduced growth and increased developmental time at lower pH levels. However, pH had no significant effect on growth or developmental time in larvae of P. triseriata. In combination, these factors led to decreased predatory success of A. tigrinum larvae on P. triseriata larvae at lower pH levels. These results suggest that surface water acidification and perhaps other abiotic factors may have consequences at the community level that extend beyond direct lethal effects on amphibian populations in temporary ponds.",,"Kiesecker, J (corresponding author), UNIV NO COLORADO,DEPT BIOL SCI,GREELEY,CO 80639, USA.",,,,,,,63,35,38,0,11,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Profile shapes included distributions that were unimodal and strongly skewed, bimodal, and uniform with roughly equivalent proportions of low, intermediate, and high overlaps. Spatial overlap profiles are idiosyncratic, neither characterizing a particular pair of lizard species, nor typifying a specific habitat type. The observations provide insight into the results of experimental studies that show weak or undetectable effects of competition at the population level, but may include asymmetric effects targeted at specific individuals.

To examine the effects of the local environmental setting on the outcome of competition for space, pairs of octocoral and scleractinian corals actively competing for space were transplanted from this inshore reef to a mid-shelf one (Britomart) in a controlled experiment. The 2 areas differ in their physical characteristics and biological communities. Competition for space between Clavularia inflata (Coelenterata, Octocorallia), Briareum stechei (Octocorallia), and Acropora longicyathus (Coelenterata, Scleractinia) in all possible pairs was assessed. Controls included undisturbed paired and solo colonies in their natural environment. A second set of corals was relocated to the mid-shelf and returned to its original environment as a control for handling effects. Competitive advantage was estimated via growth rate. Frequency of overgrowth, tissue necrosis, whole colony mortality, and tissue bleaching were also monitored. In their natural environment, Clavularia and Briareum were competitively superior to Acropora. Briareum was superior to Clavularia. With respect to mid-shelf transplants: the competitive edge of Clavularia over Acropora was reversed; the advantage of Briareum over Clavularia was reduced; and the advantage of Briareum over Acropora remained unchanged. On the mid-shelf, transplanted Acropora and Clavularia controls both suffered high mortality due to increased predation and, in the former, apparently increased light penetration. The growth rate of Briareum increased on the mid-shelf. Competitive relationships between these species are complex and can be modified by environmental factors, The refuge of the branching coral A. longicyathus on Pandora Reef was its marginally higher growth rate. Most other coral species dt the study site, particularly the massives, appear to have succumbed to octocoral growth. Competitive advantage in some octocorals is apparently enhanced in inshore waters of the Great Barrier Reef in the presence of nutrient enrichment and lower levels of predation and light. Changes in local environmental factors in these inshore waters may be contributing to the observed increasing domination of Pandora Reef by octocorals.","JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND, DEPT CHEM & BIOCHEM, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIAN INST MARINE SCI, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4810, AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,71,41,44,0,15,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Dietary overlap is one of the numerous niche dimensions used to characterize resource partitioning and potential competition within a community. We characterize the diet, potential dietary niche overlap and prey preference of a large African carnivore guild on small fenced protected areas. To quantify the potential inter- and intraspecific foraging competition, we analysed 5,128 kills, representing 35 prey species made by African wild dogs Lycaon pictus (n = 553), cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus (1,427), lions Panthera leo (2,648) and leopards P. pardus (500). Our results show that large African carnivores in small protected areas are exposed to considerable overlap in dietary resource utilization. At the interspecific level, African wild dogs and cheetahs displayed the greatest vulnerability to potential dietary competition. Lions exhibited marked differences in prey preference, mass and species utilization compared to the other carnivores. African wild dogs and cheetah females with dependent offspring occupied the greatest potential for dietary competition within the large carnivore guild. Using a case study based on the preferred biomass of prey available, we estimate the sustainable density of large carnivores at a small fenced prospective African wild dog reintroduction site. African wild dogs displayed the lowest mean predicted density compared to all sympatric predators with an expected population size of 7 individuals. Our research highlights the need to assess the influence of competitive forces in structuring and restoring large predators to portions of their historical range by identifying species most vulnerable to a potential reintroduction attempt. In the absence of controlled experiments, elucidating the influences of exploitation competition is challenging, and only through manipulating sympatric species presence and densities can these complex interactions be fully understood.","[Vogel, John T.; Venter, Jan A.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management, George Campus,Madiba Dr, ZA-6530 George, Western Cape, South Africa; [Vogel, John T.] Eastern Cape Pk & Tourism Agcy, East London, South Africa; [Somers, Michael J.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Invas Biol, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol,Eugene Marais Chair Wildlife, Pretoria, South Africa","Venter, JA (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management, George Campus,Madiba Dr, ZA-6530 George, Western Cape, South Africa.",jan.venter@mandela.ac.za,/A-1523-2008,/0000-0002-5836-8823,,,,61,3,3,5,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Thus, these designs assume that all individuals will respond to contaminant exposure in a similar manner. Additionally, commonly used constant, static exposure regime designs neglect to recognize the spatial and temporal variation in contaminant plume structures as they move throughout fluid environments. The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of the structural characteristics (concentration, duration, and frequency) of temporally and spatially variant contaminant plumes on the personality of individuals. This experimental design aimed to construct a sensitive definition of exposure by connecting sublethal effects of toxicants and realistic exposure regimes. This study used escape response of Faxonius virilis crayfish from the predatory odor of Micropterus saltnoides prior to and following exposure to the herbicide, atrazine. Atrazine was delivered in pulses to flow through exposure arenas for a total of 47 h while manipulating the concentration, frequency, and duration of the herbicide pulses. Escape response of crayfish prior to exposure was used to categorize animals into bold and shy personalities. The change in escape response was analyzed and resulted in a personality-dependent behavioral sensitivity to the polluted environment. Individuals classified as bold showed increased change in response to predatory odor relative to shy animals. Bold animals exhibited decreased activity after exposure where no change was presented in shy individuals. Shifts in individual behavior have impacts on the population level (e.g. resource acquisition/value; interspecies competition) and the ecosystem level (e.g. food web dynamics; trophic cascades). This study demonstrates the importance of sensitive measures in ecological risk assessment methods.","[Steele, Alexandra N.; Moore, Paul A.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lab Sensory Ecol, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Steele, Alexandra N.; Moore, Paul A.] Univ Michigan, Biol Stn, Pellston, MI 49769 USA; [Moore, Paul A.] Bowling Green State Univ, JP Scott Ctr Neurosci Mind & Behav, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA","Moore, PA (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lab Sensory Ecol, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",pmoore@bgsu.edu,,,University of Michigan Biological StationUniversity of Michigan System; Larry and Linda Oman Graduate Scholarship; Bowling Green State University Faculty Research Committee; Fulbright Fellowship,"The authors would like to thank the Laboratory for Sensory Ecology for their continued support and feedback throughout this project.

Throughout the western Atlantic, invasive Indo-Pacific lionfishes (Pterois spp.) are likely to compete with native mesopredators such as the graysby Cephalopholis cruentata, an ecologically similar serranid. In conjunction with a before-after-control-impact lionfish removal experiment, this study measured whether graysby population size, diet, and condition varied in relation to cohabitant lionfish biomass. Lionfish, graysby, and prey populations were surveyed and sampled along a contiguous reef ledge in Biscayne National Park, south Florida. Mesopredator diet was measured with stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and gut content analyses, and isotopic niches were used to compare patterns of inter-and intraspecific resource use diversity. The isotopic niches of graysby and lionfishes overlapped by 67%, suggesting similar population-level resource use. On sites with higher lionfish biomass, graysby isotopic niche was 34% smaller and overlapped 47% less with that of lionfishes, possibly indicating both a narrower breadth of resource use and associated interspecific niche segregation. Although gut content analyses suggested that graysby may consume less fishes on high lionfish biomass sites, prey fish populations did not vary accordingly, potentially inferring interference by lionfishes on graysby foraging behavior. However, graysby condition was not related to lionfish biomass, so the 2 species ultimately did not fit the classic definition of competitors. By discussing potential influences of lionfishes on graysby resource use, our research contributes useful information to the study of how invasive lionfishes may affect native predator communities.","[Curtis, Joseph S.; Wall, Kara R.; Stallings, Christopher D.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33705 USA; [Albins, Mark A.] Univ S Alabama, Mobile, AL 36608 USA","Curtis, JS (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33705 USA.",jcurtis@mail.usf.edu,,"Stallings, Christopher/0000-0002-3410-4540",Florida Sea Grant [R/LR-B-66H]; Guy Harvey Scholarship; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1144244]; Von Rosenstiel Endowed Fellowship from the College of Marine Science at the University of South Florida,"Funding for this work was provided by Florida Sea Grant (Project # R/LR-B-66H and the Guy Harvey Scholarship), the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (Award # 1144244), and the Von Rosenstiel Endowed Fellowship from the College of Marine Science at the University of South Florida.

Invasive alien predators, for example, can significantly disrupt recipient communities by consuming prey species or acting as an intraguild predator (IGP). Behavioural interactions are key components of interspecific competition between predators, yet these are often overlooked invasion processes. Here, we show how behavioural, non-lethal IGP interactions might facilitate the establishment success of an invading alien species. We experimentally assessed changes in feeding behaviour (prey preference and consumption rate) of native UK coccinellid species (Adalia bipunctata and Coccinella septempunctata), whose populations are, respectively, declining and stable, when exposed to the invasive intraguild predator, Harmonia axyridis. Using a population dynamics model parameterized with these experimental data, we predicted how intraguild predation, accommodating interspecific behavioural interactions, might impact the abundance of the native and invasive alien species over time. When competing for the same aphid resource, the feeding rate of A.bipunctata significantly increased compared to the feeding in isolation, while the feeding rate of H.axyridis significantly decreased. This suggests that despite significant declines in the UK, A.bipunctata is a superior competitor to the intraguild predator H.axyridis. In contrast, the behaviour of non-declining C.septempunctata was unaltered by the presence of H.axyridis. Our experimental data show the differential behavioural plasticity of competing native and invasive alien predators, but do not explain A.bipunctata declines observed in the UK. Using behavioural plasticity as a parameter in a population dynamic model for A.bipunctata and H.axyridis, coexistence is predicted between the native and invasive alien following an initial period of decline in the native species. We demonstrate how empirical and theoretical techniques can be combined to understand better the processes and consequences of alien species invasions for native biodiversity.","[Hentley, William T.; Beckerman, Andrew P.; Brien, Melanie N.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Hentley, William T.; Brien, Melanie N.; Hails, Rosemary S.] CEH, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Hentley, William T.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Hentley, William T.; Jones, T.

This simplifying assumption is often justified by the perception that variation among individuals does not have significant effects on the dynamics of whole populations. However, this perception may be skewed by a historic focus on studying single populations. A true evaluation of the extent to which among-individual variation affects the dynamics of populations requires the study of multiple populations. In this study, we examined variation in the dynamics of populations of a live-bearing, marine fish (black surfperch; Embiotoca jacksoni). In collaboration with an organization of citizen scientists (Reef Check California), we were able to examine the dynamics of eight populations that were distributed throughout similar to 700km of coastline, a distance that encompasses much of this species' range. We hypothesized that genetic variation within a local population would be related to the intensity of competition and to the strength of population regulation. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether genetic diversity (measured by the diversity of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes) was related to the strength of population regulation. Low-diversity populations experienced strong density dependence in population growth rates and population sizes were regulated much more tightly than they were in high-diversity populations. Mechanisms that contributed to this pattern include links between genetic diversity, habitat use, and spatial crowding. On average, low-diversity populations used less of the available habitat and exhibited greater spatial clustering (and more intense competition) for a given level of density (measured at the scale of the reef). Although the populations we studied also varied with respect to exogenous characteristics (habitat complexity, densities of predators, and interspecific competitors), none of these characteristics was significantly related to the strength of population regulation. In contrast, an endogenous characteristic of the population (genetic diversity) explained 77% of the variation in the strength of population regulation (95% CI: 27-94%). Our results suggest that the genetic and phenotypic composition of populations can play a major role in their dynamics.","[Johnson, D.

Kleptoparasitic interactions, whereby crabs take prey from whelks, have been documented, although results from previous experiments are not consistent with respect to the presence and frequency of such interactions, perhaps because of the sizes of crabs used. We conducted a lab experiment to clarify the effects of interactions among crabs and whelks on consumption of blue mussels. Crab density, size, and whelk presence were manipulated, and number of mussels and mussel sizes consumed by crabs were assessed during a series of 10-day trials. In the absence of whelks, two small crabs foraging together consumed no more prey than a single crab, suggesting substantial inhibition of feeding through interference competition or other negative intraspecific interactions. Presence of whelks led to increased consumption, either through a reduction of this interference or other stimulatory mechanisms. Such effects were less apparent for large crabs and small crabs feeding without conspecifics. We found clear evidence of kleptoparasitism in all crab treatments, though this feeding mode only contributed substantially to the diet of small crabs in the presence of conspecifics. Small crabs feeding in pairs kleptoparasitized larger mussels than they consumed independently, allowing them to exploit prey larger than they usually would. Our size-specific results highlight the importance of considering predator size when studying such interactions. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Biomass, diet overlap, prey selectivity, predation impact and stable isotope composition (C, N) of both species were assessed from June to September 2010. High biomass of C. harengus was found in June and July (wet weight 3.0 +/- A 1.8 g m(-3)) followed by a steep decline from August to September (wet weight 0.01 +/- A 0.01 g m(-3)), coinciding with a dramatic increase in M. leidyi biomass (wet weight 18.3 +/- A 16.1 g m(-3) during August). These two species showed a high overlap in their respective diets (copepods, meroplankton) during the study period. Predation impact of C. harengus on calanoid copepods was highest in June and July where 84 and 41 % of the standing stock were eaten per day in June and July, respectively. Predation impact of M. leidyi on calanoid copepods was highest in September (16 %). Based on stable isotope analysis C. harengus and M. leidyi were assigned to a trophic level of 3.08 and 2.47, respectively. Furthermore, we assessed the potential of competition between M. leidyi and C. harengus in a mesocosm experiment. Results indicated that at present zooplankton densities intraspecific competition in C. harengus seemed to be greater than interspecies competition with M. leidyi. Due to the low predation impact of M. leidyi and the reduced temporal overlap, competition between M. leidyi and C. harengus during the study period was estimated as low. Nevertheless, considering the high dietary overlap and the inter-annual variation in biomass and occurrence of both species and their zooplankton prey, competition in the Wadden Sea area cannot be excluded.","[Kellnreitner, Florian; Pockberger, Moritz; Asmus, Ragnhild; Asmus, Harald] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany","Kellnreitner, F (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, Hafenstr 43, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany.",florian.kellnreitner@web.de,"Asmus, Harald/O-2417-2017; Asmus, Ragnhild/O-2397-2017","Asmus, Harald/0000-0002-7772-1303; Asmus, Ragnhild/0000-0003-3300-6065",,,,76,6,6,1,78,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Ecologists have argued about the commonness and strength of interspecific competition between insect herbivores, but facilitation between herbivores has received much less consideration. We previously found that when two species of folivorous caterpillars co-occurred on a shared host plant, feeding by early season tiger moth caterpillars reduced the growth and reproduction of later season tussock caterpillars. However, densities of tussock caterpillars in summer were positively correlated with densities of tiger moth caterpillars the following spring. 2. In this study, we experimentally manipulated numbers of feeding tussock caterpillars and found that they facilitated tiger moth caterpillars. 3. The depth of the litter layer beneath host lupine bushes was positively correlated with the number of tussock caterpillars feeding on each bush. Experimental additions of litter beneath lupine canopies during summer resulted in increased numbers of tiger moth caterpillars in the following spring, indicating a causal role of litter. Litter potentially provides food, habitat and protection from desiccation and predation. We failed to find evidence that tussock caterpillars facilitated tiger moth caterpillars by mechanisms independent of litter. 4. Our study demonstrates that facilitation may operate between insect herbivores, across life-stages through indirect interactions that are non-trophic. Facilitation operated by a novel mechanism, the accumulation of litter which was a by-product of feeding by one species was valuable to a second species. Facilitation persisted in time and space far beyond the creation of litter by tussock caterpillars which should be considered important ecosystem engineers from the point of view of tiger moths. Facilitations that involve habitat modification may generally connect species that do not interact directly or trophically, and have not previously been considered to affect one another.","[Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Grof-Tisza, Patrick] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Karban, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rkarban@ucdavis.edu,"Grof-Tisza, Patrick/AAY-7318-2020; Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009","Grof-Tisza, Patrick/0000-0002-0217-4253; Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [LTREB-0639885]; Division Of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [0841297] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank Claire Karban and Tawny Mata for help with field work and Susan Harrison, Bitty Roy and two anonymous reviewers for improving the manuscript.

Previous experiments with dominant understory Piper shrubs in a Costa Rican rain forest revealed that increases in herbivore densities on these shrubs caused widespread seedling mortality as a result of herbivores moving from Piper to seedlings of many different plant genera. We tested components of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis by conducting focused studies on the effects of specialist and generalist Piper herbivores on local seedling diversity. Whereas specialist herbivores are predicted to increase mortality to neighboring seedlings that are closely related to the source plant, true generalists moving from source plants may cause density-dependent mortality of many species, and possibly increase richness if new species replace abundant species that have been thinned by herbivores. Therefore, we hypothesized that seedling richness would be greater in understory control plots created in patches of Piper that had normal densities of generalist herbivores compared to plots from which we removed generalist herbivores manually from all Piper shrubs. After 15 months, generalist-herbivore-removal plots had >40% fewer seedlings,>40% fewer species, and 40% greater seedling evenness, on average, than control plots with generalist herbivores intact. Using a complementary approach in unmanipulated plots in four forests, we used path analysis to test for a positive association between seedling diversity and herbivore damage on Piper species. In unmanipulated plots, for both generalist and specialist herbivores, our data were significant fits to the causal model that Piper herbivores decrease evenness and increase plant species richness, corroborating the experimental results. Because herbivores changed how individuals were apportioned among the species and families present (lower evenness), one interpretation of these associations between herbivores on Piper shrubs and local seedling richness is that high seedling mortality in dominant families allowed the colonization or survival of less common species. If interspecific or apparent competition allowed for a relative increase in species richness, then the Janzen-Connell hypothesis may extend its predictions to generalist seedling predators. We speculate that apparent competition may explain some of the deviations from neutral model predictions, especially at small scales.","[Dyer, Lee A.; Chavarria, Gerardo Vega] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Letourneau, Deborah K.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Amoretti, Diego Salazar] Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA","Dyer, LA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",nolaclimber@gmail.com,"Letourneau, Deborah/G-3694-2011","Salazar, Diego/0000-0001-9810-5828","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0344250, CHE-0718732]; Earthwatch Institute; National GeographicNational Geographic Society; Tulane University","This study was funded by NSF grant DEB-0344250 and CHE-0718732, as well as grants from Earthwatch Institute, National Geographic, and Tulane University.

Males exposed to malathion were significantly larger than those from control treatments while the effect of malathion on size of females varied with larval density and the level of nutrients. Larval exposure to malathion and low nutrient resulted in significantly larger females with increases in larval densities compared with other treatments. The effect of malathion on male longevity varied with larval density and amount of nutrients. At higher densities, male longevity was consistently higher in low nutrient than in high nutrient conditions and addition of malathion in high nutrient treatment increased male longevity at the highest density. These effects are most likely attributable to release from competition among survivors after mortality from malathion and density-dependent effects. We conclude that biotic conditions of the larval habitat can alter the impact of low concentrations of chemical contaminants on mosquito populations in ways that may influence the pattern of disease transmission and the outcome of vector control efforts.

Furthermore, it was investigated whether the release of first instar juveniles instead of megalopae would reduce the mortality related to interspecific predation. A preliminary estimate of the crab community structure in the target area of a restocking program was undertaken and indicated a great dominance of fiddler crabs (Uca spp). Based on this information, experiments were conducted to assess the ecological relationship between Ucides cordatus megalopae and first instar juveniles and fiddler crabs of different size classes in the presence of mangrove sediment, simulating natural conditions, as well as in the absence of any kind of refuge. It was observed that fiddler crabs not only compete with, and prey on U. cordatus youngsters, both as megalopae and juveniles. Furthermore, it was observed that the predation behavior of fiddler crabs is exercised only by individuals with carapaces wider than 0.5 cm. The results of the assay simulating natural conditions showed that, even when sediment was provided as a refuge, the same pattern was observed, with survivorship rates significantly lower in the presence of Uca crabs.","[Ventura, Robson; da Silva, Ubirata A.

We investigated the potential role of two introduced predatory gastropods, the Japanese drill (Ocinebrina inornata) and the eastern drill (Urosalpinx cinerea), in limiting Olympia oyster recovery. We quantified the bay-wide distribution, local abundance, and per capita effects of drills, and asked how each of these three components of total invasion impact might be influenced by another dominant introduced species, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea g gas). Bay-wide sampling revealed differences in spatial distribution of the two drill species, with U. cinerea more abundant toward the head of the estuary and O. inornata more abundant toward the Mouth. Individual feeding trials indicated that both drill species preferred Pacific oysters to Olympia oysters of similar size, and preferentially attacked smaller oysters. We used field enclosures to quantify the direct effects of Japanese drill predation on Olympia and Pacific oysters, intra and interspecific competition, and indirect effects mediated by the shared predator. Predation reduced the survival of both oyster species, but the per capita impact of Japanese drills declined with increasing density of either Olympia or Pacific oysters, consistent with a type I I functional response. This positive indirect effect of Pacific oysters oil Olympia oysters was offset by asymmetric competition, in which Pacific oysters reduced Olympia oyster growth and survival but not vice versa. Despite the large drill impacts seen in these experiments, Olympia oysters transplanted to intertidal sites throughout the bay experienced low and variable rates of drill predation compared with other mortality sources. Introduced drills may be only one of a suite of factors that prevent rebuilding of Olympia oysters in the intertidal zone in Willapa Bay.","[Buhle, Eric R.; Ruesink, Jennifer L.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Buhle, ER (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",eric.buhle@noaa.gov,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to Washington Sea Grant Program, University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington [9NA16RG1044]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research fellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Achievement Rewards for College Scientists fellowship","The authors thank the organizers of the 2006 West Coast Native Oyster Restoration Workshop for coordinating this Special Issue.

Acomys cahirinus is nocturnal and A. russatus is diurnal. although it becomes nocturnal if its congener is experimentally removed, suggesting that the temporal partitioning is driven by interspecific competition. Such extreme temporal partitioning within the diel cycle has not previously been recorded elsewhere among mammals. Using artificial food patches. we studied microhabitat use and foraging efficiencies under seasonally variable predator regimes and physiological pressures to assess the roles that habitat structure and foraging behavior might play in coexistence. The two species showed trade-offs in foraging efficiency leading to different strategies of microhabitat use that may help promote coexistence. A. cahirinus is a cream skimmer, a relatively inefficient forager that gives up at relatively high giving-up densities, and a habitat generalist: whereas A. russatus is a habitat specialist, perhaps compensating for this restricted niche by foraging very efficiently to low giving-up densities. Seasonal shifts in foraging microhabitat suggest that the response to predation risk from snakes in summer overrides and opposes the effects of physiological costs and risk from owls and diurnal raptors, leading to increased predatory risk and foraging microhabitat overlap in summer. Temporal partitioning of the food resource may compensate for decreased partitioning of the habitat resource in summer. Provision of cover was more important than escape distance in determining habitat and microhabitat use. Boulder fields in rocky deserts provide a physical structure that is more complex and provides more continuous cover than is available in open deserts, where most research on community structure of desert rodents has been carried out. We propose that this physical structure of rocky deserts, in conjunction with the desert adaptations of A. russatus, may enable the extreme temporal partitioning to opposite parts of the diel cycle and, therefore, contributes to coexistence in this community.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Jones, M (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Div Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Jones, Menna E/J-7975-2012","Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022",,,,70,84,88,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2001,82,8,,,,,2164,2176,,10.2307/2680223,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,462ZP,WOS:000170452600006,,,,,2021-09-24,

We experimentally tested these predictions in three aquatic food web configurations subjected to either high or low nutrient additions. The results were structured by viewing the systems as either food chains or webs and showed that trophic level biomass increased with enrichment, which contradicts food chain theory. However, within each trophic level, food web configuration affected the extent to which different functional groups responded to enrichment. By dividing trophic levels into functional groups, based on vulnerability to consumption, we were able to identify significant effects that were obscured when systems were viewed as food chains. The results support the prediction that invulnerable prey may stabilize trophic-level dynamics by replacing other, more vulnerable prey. Furthermore, the vulnerable prey, such as Daphnia and edible algae, responded as predicted by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis; that is, variability in population density increased with enrichment. Hence, by describing ecosystems as a matrix of food web interactions, and by recognizing the interplay between interspecific competition and predation, a more complete description of the ecosystem function was obtained compared to when species were placed into distinct trophic levels.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limnol.lu.se; lars-anders.hansson@limnol.lu.se; christer.bronmark@limnol.lu.se; per.lundberg@teorekol.lu.se; lars.pettersson@zooekol.lu.se; larry.greenberg@kau.se; anders.nilsson@zooekol.lu.se; per.nystrom@limnol.lu.se; pia.romare@limnol.lu.se; lars.tranvik@limno.uu.se,"Lundberg, Per/A-2479-2010; Pettersson, Lars/AAX-3948-2020; Tranvik, Lars J/H-2222-2011; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014","Pettersson, Lars/0000-0001-5745-508X; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Persson, Anders/0000-0001-5961-3651; Lundberg, Per/0000-0002-9609-726X; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266",,,,76,68,72,1,55,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Considerable year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10-yr study (1983-1992), with most extreme hut-dry conditions in 1988 during a 3-yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature: occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age-0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age-0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding an invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no-chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot-dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size-structured trophic interactions between age-0 fish along lake-stream gradients. Hot-dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species. The response of fish to climatic variation appears to be strongly influenced by their position in the hydrologic landscape. The most dramatic fish response occurred in stream reaches influenced by groundwater.","Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Univ Stn, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; Univ Lodz, Dept Appl Ecol, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland","Schlosser, IJ (corresponding author), Univ N Dakota, Dept Biol, Univ Stn, Box 9019, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",,,"Lapinska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-4421-8330",,,,58,41,42,1,43,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,1046,1057,,10.2307/177177,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500015,,,,,2021-09-24,

The common spiny mouse (A. cahirinus) is nocturnally active whereas the golden spiny mouse (A. russatus) is diurnally active. An early removal study suggested that competition accounts for this pattern of temporal partitioning: the golden spiny mouse is forced into diurnal activity by its congener. Theoretically, temporal segregation should facilitate coexistence if the shared limiting resources differ at different times (primarily among predators whose prey populations have activity rhythms), or if they are renewed within the period of the temporal segregation. We studied food preferences of the two Acomys species in a controlled cafeteria experiment in order to assess resource overlap and the potential for competition for food between the two species. We found no significant difference in food preferences between species. The dietary items preferred by both were arthropods. We also carried out a seasonal study of the percentage and identity of arthropods taken in the field by individuals of the two species. Individuals of both species took on annual; average a high percentage of arthropods in their diets. Seasonal diet shifts reflect seasonal abundance of arthropods at Fin Gedi during day and night. Diurnal activity may also reduce interspecific interference competition between A. russatus and A. cahirinus. However, the strong interspecific dietary overlap in food preference, the heavy reliance on arthropods in spiny mouse diets, and the seasonal and circadian differences in arthropod consumption suggest that prey partitioning may be a viable mechanism of coexistence in this system.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Kronfeld-Schor, N (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",Kronfeld@bu.edu,"Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/AAU-3792-2020","Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/0000-0002-5224-3341",,,,52,81,85,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1999,121,1,,,,,123,128,,10.1007/s004420050913,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245WT,WOS:000083131600014,28307881,,,,2021-09-24,

We studied (1) larval feeding, walking, intraspecific interactions (cannibalism, touch-avoidance responses and/or touching with palps and tarsi) and tendency to aggregate (when resting), (2) predation and cannibalism on phytoseiid eggs by young females and (3) the effects of starvation for 10 days on young females relative to ambulation speed, longevity, fecundity, progeny survival and sex ratio. Larvae of T. athiasae were almost inert, did not feed and hardly walked or interacted whereas larvae of N. californicus fed, walked and interacted, mainly by touching with palps and tarsi. No cannibalism in the larval stage was observed for either species. The presence of prey increased the larval walking and intraspecific interactions of N. californicus but not of T. athiasae. Egg predation by adult females of both species was substantially higher than cannibalism, implying that both are capable of distinguishing their eggs from those of other species. Soaking eggs for 30 min in deionized water increased cannibalism in both species. During the 10 days of starvation, the ambulation speed of adult female N. californicus ranged from 1.8 to 10.1 times that of T. athiasae. The 50% lethal time value (LT50) of T. athiasae (6.0 days) was significantly lower than that of N. californicus (10.4 days). None of the starved T. athiasae recuperated following the reintroduction of prey, whereas 75% of N. californicus did and oviposited after 2 days. These traits should enable N. californicus to persist when prey is scarce; however the selective predation of N. californicus eggs by T. athiasae could prevent establishment of N. californicus.

Most of the analysis is based on a consumer-resource model introduced by Robert MacArthur. Contrary to many statements in the literature and in textbooks, measures of competition may decrease as similarity increases and may be greatest when similarity of the two species' sets of resource capture rates is very low. High competition with low similarity may occur whether competition is measured by a competition coefficient near equilibrium or is measured by the proportional increase in a species' population density when its competitor is removed. However, these two measures may differ considerably and may change in opposite directions with a given change in similarity. The general conditions required for such counterintuitive relationships between similarity and competition are that the consumer species have relatively low resource requirements for successful reproduction and that the resources be self-reproducing. These same conditions also frequently lead to exclusion of one or more resources via apparent competition, and this is always true of MacArthur's model. A variety of other models of competition are analyzed, and circumstances most likely to produce large competitive effects with little overlap are identified.","Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,46,71,74,0,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5801 S ELLIS AVENUE, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

In nature, however, stream pools often contain not just sunfish and water striders, but also smaller fish such as minnows. Here, we used factorial experiments in seminatural streams to document the direct and indirect effects of sunfish and fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, on water strider survival and behavior. Sunfish, minnows and gerrids all consume surface prey (here, crickets); thus these three species are potential food competitors. Sunfish eat minnows. Accordingly, the presence of sunfish caused minnows to increase their schooling behavior and shift their activity from the surface toward the bottom substrate. The presence of sunfish was also associated with an increase in the number of missing gerrids, whereas minnows caused relatively little gerrid disappearance. Most interestingly, the presence of minnows decreased the effect of sunfish on gerrid disappearance rates; that is, minnows apparently had an indirect positive effect on water strider survival. We suggest that this indirect positive effect reflects the fact that minnows are alternative prey for sunfish. The effects of sunfish and minnows on gerrid mortality explained the influence of these fish on gerrid behavior. Sunfish caused decreases in male gerrid activity, female availability, mating activity, mating frequency and mating duration. Larger males had a mating advantage over smaller males only in pools with sunfish and no minnows. Sunfish also caused a borderline significant decrease in the large female mating advantage. These results were all observed in previous studies and can be viewed as adaptive responses to predation risk. These patterns were not consistent with the expected effects of sunfish as food competitors with water striders. In contrast, minnows had relatively Little influence on water strider behavior and the few significant effects were the opposite of those of sunfish. Minnows caused increases in female activity and in mating duration, a decrease in the large male mating advantage and an increase in the large female mating advantage. These patterns fit the view that minnows caused an increase in gerrid hunger, i.e., that minnows acted as food competitors with gerrids. Finally, planned contrasts against controls showed that, in the presence of both sunfish and minnows, water striders showed no significant behavioral responses to fish (i.e., gerrid behavior in pools with sunfish and minnows did not significantly differ from behavior in fishless pools). The most likely mechanism explaining this pattern is a dilution of sunfish predation risk due to the presence of minnows serving as alternative prey for sunfish.",,"Sih, A (corresponding author), UNIV KENTUCKY,TH MORGAN SCH BIOL SCI,CTR ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV,LEXINGTON,KY 40506, USA.",,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,42,26,26,0,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1996,105,2,,,,,179,188,,10.1007/BF00328544,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TV593,WOS:A1996TV59300006,28307080,,,,2021-09-24,

We censused the fish community at 86 sites, measuring each fish collected and recording physical variables for each site (pool size, substrate composition, cover, etc.). One member of the fauna, a killifish, Rivulus hartii, was widely distributed in the drainage, occurring alone in each headwater but also encountering other fish species below barrier waterfalls. This pattern allowed us to use Rivulus to test four predictions derived from the species interaction hypothesis: (1) Rivulus density (in grams per square metre) would be depressed at sites with other fish species present, when compared to the density expected from physical characteristics of each site as if Rivulus were alone; (2) Rivulus density would decline at points of contact with the piscivorous fish Hoplias malabaricus; (3) local populations of Rivulus found in pools occupied by the predator would show a smaller maximal size than in pools without the predator; and (4) the growth rate of Rivulus would be lowered in the event of a local invasion by the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, another abundant and sometimes co-occurring species in the watershed. The first three predictions were tested with data from the survey, while the fourth prediction was tested by experiments in a nearby stream. We used a factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the physical variables to four factors. A regression analysis of Rivulus density on the four factors, using 43 Rivulus-only pools, was used to predict Rivulus density in nine pools, each in a different tributary, in which Rivulus first encountered a second species after being the only species present upstream of this pool. The expected density was based solely on the physical characteristics of the pool and represented the expected Rivulus density purely from physical attributes, as if Rivulus were the only species present. Comparison of these expected densities with the actual Rivulus densities revealed a consistent negative impact of the presence of other species on Rivulus density, in support of Prediction 1. Overall, actual Rivulus densities at points of contact with other species were about one-third of the density expected if the other species were absent. The distribution of Rivulus was essentially complementary to that of the piscivorous fish, although only one site provided an unambiguous test of Prediction 2, since Hoplias did not ascend the tributaries in this watershed. The size distribution of Rivulus in populations occurring in pools with predators was dominated by small individuals, with none larger than the median size of Rivulus in predator-free populations, supporting Prediction 3. Finally, the competition experiments revealed that adult Poecilia depressed the growth rate of young Rivulus. We conclude that interspecific interactions are important in structuring the geographical distribution and abundance of Rivulus throughout this tropical watershed, and suggest that interspecific interactions can fragment Rivulus into local populations.","SIENA COLL, DEPT BIOL, LOUDONVILLE, NY 12211 USA; UNIV W INDIES, DEPT ZOOL, ST AUGUSTINE, TRINIDAD TOBAGO","GILLIAM, JF (corresponding author), N CAROLINA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, RALEIGH, NC 27695 USA.",,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Gilliam, James F/D-5605-2013",,,,,47,152,161,3,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1993,74,6,,,,,1856,1870,,10.2307/1939943,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LV242,WOS:A1993LV24200025,,,,,2021-09-24,

We explored density-dependent fitness attributes and carry-over effects in Crawfish Frogs (Rana areolata) using a set of field enclosure experiments and a series of field data. Using field enclosures, we hypothesized that 1) at high densities, intraspecific competition would produce smaller Crawfish Frog juveniles that took longer to metamorphose; 2) at high densities, interspecific competition would also produce smaller Crawfish Frog juveniles that took longer to metamorphose; and 3) vertebrate (ambystomatid salamander) predation on Crawfish Frog larvae would reduce survivorship, but by releasing competition pressure would produce relatively larger tadpoles that metamorphosed earlier. Further, we hypothesized 4) that these enclosure results would apply to field data, and that fitness attributes in newly metamorphosed Crawfish Frogs would carry over to first-time breeding adults. Our results confirmed all four hypotheses. Specifically, in Crawfish Frogs, at high densities, both intra- and interspecific competition reduced size (length and mass) at metamorphosis (hypotheses 1 and 2), and predation reduced survivorship and increased size at metamorphosis (hypothesis 3). Finally, we observed density-dependent fitness effects on newly metamorphosed Crawfish Frog juvenile size (length and mass), and carry-over effects from the larval stage on juvenile survival, adult size, and breeding adult numbers (hypothesis 4). In the absence of predators, high densities of intra- and interspecific competitors had no effect on Crawfish Frog larval survivorship. We also present suggestive evidence for compensatory effects. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the patterns of these interactions, as well as the role of these relationships in informing management guidelines intended to ensure the future of this species of conservation concern.","[Stiles, Rochelle M.] San Francisco Zool Soc, 1 Zoo Rd, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Terrell, Vanessa C.

Larval anurans are models to examine activity level-predation risk tradeoffs, as they occupy a variety of lentic habitats that impose constraints on the distribution and abundance of species. Ephemeral ponds have a low abundance and diversity of predators and as a result tadpole species tend to have high foraging rates for rapid development. Permanent ponds generally possess a greater diversity and abundance of predators and tadpoles inhabiting these locations tend to have low activity rates or chemical defenses to minimize predation risk. The objective of this research was to examine how interspecific variation in activity level and response to predation risk, corresponds to the distributions of tadpole species along the hydroperiod gradient. Furthermore, we examined the intraspecific variation in activity level among the species. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments in which we quantified baseline activity patterns and the change in activity after the addition of a predator or exposure to alarm cues, for 12 species of larval anurans native to East Texas. Species that maintained a high activity level generally occupied ephemeral ponds and species that maintained low activity levels generally occupied permanent ponds. Only one species (Gastrophryne carolinensis) decreased their activity level in the presence of predator cues or conspecific alarm cues. These results highlight this tradeoff can have consequences on the life histories of multiple species, providing insight into how it affects the organization of ecological communities.","[Schiwitz, Nicholas C.; Schalk, Christopher M.] Stephen F Austin State Univ, Arthur Temple Coll Forestry & Agr, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA; [Saenz, Daniel] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, Nacogdoches, TX 75965 USA","Schiwitz, NC (corresponding author), Stephen F Austin State Univ, Arthur Temple Coll Forestry & Agr, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA.",nschiwitz@gmail.com,,,McIntire-Stennis from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,We thank Cory K.

However, what actually drives social affinity between species in the wild will depend on the characteristics of the species available to group. Here we first present an agent-based model that predicts trait-related survival benefits from mixed-species group formation in a multi-species community and we then test the model predictions in a community-wide field study of African savannah herbivores using multi-layered network analysis. We reveal benefits from information transfer about predators as a key determinant of mixed-species group formation, and that dilution benefits alone are not enough to explain patterns in interspecific sociality. The findings highlight the limitations of classical ecological approaches focusing only on direct trophic interactions when analysing community structure and suggest that declines in species occupying central social network positions, such as key informants, can have significant repercussions throughout communities.","[Meise, Kristine; Bro-Jorgensen, Jakob] Univ Liverpool, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Inst Integrat Biol, Neston CH64 7TE, England; [Meise, Kristine; Franks, Daniel W.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Franks, Daniel W.] Univ York, Dept Comp Sci, York YO10 5GH, N Yorkshire, England","Bro-Jorgensen, J (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Inst Integrat Biol, Neston CH64 7TE, England.",bro@liv.ac.uk,,"Franks, Daniel Wayne/0000-0002-4832-7470","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L007185/1, NE/L007266/1]","We are grateful to the Kenyan National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation, the Narok County Government, the Chief Park Warden of the Masai Mara National Reserve, and the Kenya Wildlife Service for permission to conduct the fieldwork.

The endangered Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus) is being reintroduced to parts of its former range where multiple species of native rodents have overlapping diets. The granivorous species in this foraging guild compete for seeds exploitatively and through direct interference interactions, and pocket mice are the smallest and least dominant species in the guild. Repeated aggressive interactions from resident heterospecifics could lower the chances of reintroduced pocket mice establishing burrows during the post-release settlement period. As such, temporarily reducing the density of competing species through exclusionary fencing might be an advisable reintroduction strategy, in combination with other interventions, such as predator exclusion. The presence of other members of the seed-foraging guild, however, could have a net benefit for pocket mice, if the pocket mice pilfer from the other species' seed caches more than the other species pilfer from their caches. To test the frequency of cache pilfering between species, we conducted a field experiment with fluorescent dyed seeds. Two of 10 pocket mice pilfered from heterospecifics, but only 1 of 33 heterospecifics pilfered from pocket mice. In a field-enclosure experiment, we could not conclude that any of the 4 species tested used heterospecific scent to find (or avoid) seed caches, and pocket mice were less efficient in pilfering from artificial caches, recovering fewer seeds than the larger species. We did not find strong evidence that Pacific pocket mice benefit from living in sympatry with larger, dominant species. Although further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between heterospecific density and the prevalence of cache pilfering, a conservative reintroduction approach would be to select receiver sites with low densities of known competitors to benefit pocket mice during the critical post-release establishment phase.","[Chock, Rachel Y.; Grether, Gregory F.; Shier, Debra M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 612 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chock, Rachel Y.; Shier, Debra M.] San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Recovery Ecol, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA","Chock, RY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 612 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Chock, RY (corresponding author), San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Recovery Ecol, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA.",rchock@sandiegozoo.org,"Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011",,"United States Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and California Department of Fish and Wildlife; United States Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need Fellowship; Los Angeles (UCLA), a UCLA Pauley Fellowship, a UCLA Chancellor's Prize; Animal Behavior Society; Center for California Conservation Science, Sea and Sage Audubon, Santa Monica Bay Audubon; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","We thank J.

We used a pairwise approach to identify co-occurrence patterns of 76 fish species across almost 9500 lakes, followed by a meta-analytic approach to compare the co-occurrence pattern of each species pair across watersheds and determine their cumulative species associations. Biological information relating to species' phylogeny, habitat preferences, and diet was used to group species into relevant subsets in order to test community assembly processes of competition, predation, and habitat filtering. We found consistent non-random patterns of co-occurrence in nearly half the species pairs and more extremely aggregated than segregated species pairs. Observed co-occurrence patterns indicated the importance of shared habitat requirements and predation, rather than competition, driving positively aggregated and negatively segregated species associations, respectively.

The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis on temporal samples (10-57 years) of 19 breeding bird assemblages of various habitats. We used presence/absence null model (SIM2) in combination with the C-score and Sorensen indices. The C-score index estimates the average number of checkerboards for two species, while the S(sic)rensen index measures the qualitative similarity of co-occurrence between two species in a time series. We used pairwise null model analysis to select significant species pairs based on three selection criteria: the standard confidence interval criterion, conservative empirical Bayes mean based criterion and confidence limit based criterion. Altogether, 21402 species pairs were analysed. The SIM2 algorithm detected from 157 to 7 segregated pairs depending on the selection criterion. The number of significant negative pairs with possible biological significance (foraging guild membership, predator-prey interactions) was far lower and represented approximately 0.0-0.3% (4-65) of pairs in a matrix. Indeed, the number of detected negative associations depended on the selection criterion. Moreover, the number of segregated pairs was negatively related to the area of the census plots and fill of the species matrix. Our results underline the minor importance of interspecific competitive interactions in temporal patterns of bird assemblages. Instead, we suggest that stochastic factors, climate or heterospecific social information may lead to more or less synchronous dynamics of bird pairs. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

In field studies, all gray triggerfish and red snapper were counted and sizes estimated on 24 reef sites. Gray triggerfish were then removed from half of these reef sites, resulting in significantly fewer gray triggerfish on the removal reefs at the start of the experiment. After 7 months the experiment ended and reef sites were resurveyed. Gray triggerfish decreased on both treatments, while the mean number of red snapper did not differ between treatments; however, there were significantly more small (<400 mm total length) red snapper on reefs where gray triggerfish were removed. In seven laboratory growth trials (30 to 35 days each), red snapper held with gray triggerfish had significantly lower growth rates and numerous bite marks compared with red snapper alone. These competitive interactions indicate that management efforts to rebuild and increase gray triggerfish populations may have unintentional negative effects on red snapper populations, particularly for smaller fish.","[Simmons, Carrie M.; Szedlmayer, Stephen T.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA; [Simmons, Carrie M.] Gulf Mexico Fishery Management Council, 4107 West Spruce St,Suite 200, Tampa, FL 33607 USA","Simmons, CM (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA.; Simmons, CM (corresponding author), Gulf Mexico Fishery Management Council, 4107 West Spruce St,Suite 200, Tampa, FL 33607 USA.",carrie.simmons@gulfcouncil.org,,,"Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium [MASGC R/SP-14]; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA06OAR4170078]; Marine Resources Division, Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources","We thank Sabrina Beyer, Allison Chapin, Lee Grove, Diana Miller, David Nadeau, Rebecca Redman, Darin Topping, Rebecca Wingate, and Bill Wildberger for field assistance.

Similar reciprocal indirect effects may emerge even when the signal is not mimicked; termed associational effects, such interactions are well known in plants sharing herbivores but have received little attention in animal studies. We investigated associational interactions in a system where unequally defended prey (chemically defended Bufo bufo and undefended Rana temporaria tadpoles), sharing general morphology but not an aposematic signal, were exposed to predation by the carp Cyprinus carpio along a gradient of relative prey abundance. In the absence of fish, the assemblage composition had no effect on the survival of Rana, while that of Bufo decreased with increasing abundance of Rana. Fish reduced the survival of tadpoles from both species. However, increased relative abundance of Bufo in the community led to enhanced survival in both Bufo and Rana. Increasing relative proportions of heterospecifics reduced metamorph mass only in Bufo, indicating greater sensitivity to interspecific competition compared to Rana; the effect was reduced in the presence of fish. Our results show that undefended non-mimetic prey enjoy reduced predation with increasing relative abundance of chemically defended prey, which in turn suffer greater mortality with an increasing proportion of the undefended species. Associational resistance/susceptibility, driven by current assemblage composition, not by selection for resemblance, can shape the dynamics of mixed communities of defended and undefended prey in the absence of mimicry.","[Kaczmarek, Jan M.; Kaczmarski, Mikolaj; Kloskowski, Janusz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Zool, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Mazurkiewicz, Jan] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Inland Fisheries & Aquaculture, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland","Kaczmarek, JM (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Zool, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.",kaczmarq@up.poznan.pl,"KACZMARSKI, MIKOLAJ/AAA-3643-2021","KACZMARSKI, MIKOLAJ/0000-0002-3341-0933; Kaczmarek, Jan/0000-0002-4152-6928; Mazurkiewicz, Jan/0000-0002-3344-1094; Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421",Poznan University of Life Sciences Grant Program for Young Scientists [507.511.60/2016],"The project was funded by Poznan University of Life Sciences Grant Program for Young Scientists (project no. 507.511.60/2016) awarded to JMK.

As distress calls may trigger antipredator behaviour even in individuals that are not under attack, we tested whether this defensive behaviour induced behavioural changes in neighbouring conspecifics. We compared the behavioural responses of two species of Neotropical hylid frogs (genus Boana) to conspecific distress calls and white noise. Individuals of both species interrupted their vocal activity and decreased call rate after hearing the distress call. Natural variation on signal intensity calibrated among the nearest neighbours did not influence the response and we did not observe negative phonotaxis after any acoustic stimulus. Despite the fact that many predators are acoustically oriented, we could not determine if such response (reduced call rate) was induced by risk assessment or by the masking effect on advertisement calls. Boana faber responded similarly to white noise and distress calls, while B. bischoffi responded more intensely to distress calls. Duration of silence after playbacks in B. faber was longer than B. bischoffi. We suggest that, if the signals are interpreted as a risk cue by neighbouring conspecifics, each species may be preyed upon by different predators, as they may have led to distinct defensive strategies and different responses to distress calls. If risk assessment information is included in distress calls, it triggers behavioural responses only in the nearest neighbours, as we did not observe responses on the vocal activity of the interspecific chorus. Our results add relevant data about acoustic communication and interpretations by anurans, highlighting the importance of considering cues within common and widespread signals.","[Forti, Lucas Rodriguez; Toledo, Luis Felipe] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Forti, Lucas Rodriguez; Toledo, Luis Felipe] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Bella Sanches Forti, Anna Barbara] Fac Direito Sorocaba, Rua Doutora Ursulina Lopes Torres, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Marquez, Rafael] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat CSIC, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Fonoteca Zool, Madrid, Spain","Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lucas_forti@yahoo.com.br,"Toledo, Luis Felipe/I-4017-2012; Forti, Lucas/E-8207-2013","Toledo, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-4929-9598; Forti, Lucas/0000-0003-3057-2141; Marquez, Rafael/0000-0002-2070-860X","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/21519-4, 2014/23388-7]; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas [CGL2011-16159-E]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302589/2013-9, 300896/2016-6, 438675/2016-9, 150041/2017-9, 405285/2013-2]; Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [ACOURA CGL2008-04814]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Grant/Award Number: #2013/21519-4 and #2014/23388-7; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Grant/Award Number: CGL2011-16159-E; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Grant/Award Number: #302589/2013-9, #300896/2016-6, #438675/2016-9, #150041/2017-9 and #405285/2013-2; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: ACOURA CGL2008-04814; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad",,32,5,5,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,DEC,2017,123,12,,,,,942,948,,10.1111/eth.12693,,,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FM2YC,WOS:000414867800007,,,,,2021-09-24,

When unequal competitors are involved, the dominant species tends to displace the subordinate one to its less preferred habitat. Here, we use habitat isodars, an approach which reflects evolutionary stable strategies of habitat selection, to evaluate whether interspecific competition between two competing species with distinct habitat preferences, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax and the great bustard Otis tarda, modulates their habitat use. Field data on these endangered species demonstrate that unequal competitors can coexist without completely segregating on their preferred habitats. The negatively sloped isodar of the subordinate little bustard unveils its competition with the dominant great bustard. Interference from great bustards in secondary cereal habitats reinforces use of preferred natural habitat by little bustards. Studies of density-dependent habitat selection by a single-species can thus aid in identifying the effects of competition on community composition, and guide the conservation of at-risk species. Isodars, in particular, represent a promising method to gain clear knowledge on interspecific competition for species in which experimental manipulations are not feasible.","[Tarjuelo, Rocio; Traba, Juan; Morales, Manuel B.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, C Darwin 2, ES-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Tarjuelo, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, C Darwin 2, ES-28049 Madrid, Spain.",rocio.tarjuelo@gmail.com,"Tarjuelo, Rocio/ABG-9983-2020; Traba, Juan/D-9191-2012; Morales, Manuel B./B-1448-2014","Traba, Juan/0000-0001-6326-8942; Tarjuelo Mostajo, Rocio/0000-0002-0638-1911",Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2009-13029/BOS]; network of the Madrid region REMEDINAL2 [S-2009/AMB/1783]; network of the Madrid region REMEDINAL 3CM [S2013/MAE-2719]; Aeropuerto de Ciudad Real S.A.; FPU-grantSpanish Government [AP2009-0762],Funding was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Science (CGL2009-13029/BOS); and the networks of the Madrid region REMEDINAL2 (S-2009/AMB/1783) and REMEDINAL 3CM (S2013/MAE-2719).

For this reason, they have been often used to examine the consequences of competitive interactions. Hosts represent limited resources for larval parasitoid development and thus one competitor usually excludes all others. Although parasitoid competition has been debated and studied over the past several decades, understanding the factors that allow for coexistence among species sharing the same host in the field remains elusive. Parasitoids may be able to coexist on the same host species if they partition host resources according to size, age, or stage, or if their dynamics vary at spatial and temporal scales. One area that has thus far received little experimental attention is if competition can alter host usage strategies in parasitoids that in the absence of competitors attack hosts of the same size in the field. Here, we test this hypothesis with two parasitoid species in the genus Aphytis, both of which are specialized on the citrus pest California red scale Aonidiella aurantii. These parasitoids prefer large scales as hosts and yet coexist in sympatry in eastern parts of Spain. Parasitoids and hosts were sampled in 12 replicated orange groves. When host exploitation by the stronger competitor, A. melinus, was high the poorer competitor, A. chrysomphali, changed its foraging strategy to prefer alternative plant substrates where it parasitized hosts of smaller size. Consequently, the inferior parasitoid species shifted both its habitat and host size as a result of competition. Our results suggest that density-dependent size-mediated asymmetric competition is the likely mechanism allowing for the coexistence of these two species, and that the use of suboptimal (small) hosts can be advantageous under conditions imposed by competition where survival in higher quality larger hosts may be greatly reduced.","[Pekas, Apostolos; Garcia-Mari, Ferran] Univ Politecn Valencia, IAM, Cami de Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Tena, Alejandro] UJI, IVIA, Unidad Asociada Entomol, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Harvey, Jeffrey A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Frago, Enric] Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, Droevendaalsesteeg 1,Bldg 107,POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Frago, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, Droevendaalsesteeg 1,Bldg 107,POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",enric.frago@gmail.com,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Harvey, Jeffrey A/B-7439-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Harvey, Jeffrey A/0000-0002-4227-7935; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of SpainSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [AGL2005-07155-C03-03]; European CommunityEuropean Commission [329648],"We would like to thank Amparo Aguilar for her valuable help in the field and in the laboratory, and Camille Ponzio for her comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Amphibians play a critical role both as consumers and prey in aquatic communities and yet there is still little information on the trophic status of most amphibians. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which they can alter their trophic ecology in response to changing conditions. We experimentally investigated the effects of increased amphibian density, presence of intraguild competitors, and presence of native and invasive predators (either free or caged) on the trophic status of a Mediterranean amphibian guild, using stable isotopes. We observed variations in delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic values among amphibian species and treatments and differences in their food sources. Macrophytes were the most important food resource for spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes) and relatively important for all anurans within the guild. High density and presence of P. cultripes tadpoles markedly reduced macrophyte biomass, forcing tadpoles to increase their feeding on detritus, algae and zooplankton, resulting in lower delta C-13 values. Native dytiscid predators only changed the isotopic signature of newts whereas invasive red swamp crayfish had an enormous impact on environmental conditions and greatly affected the isotopic values of amphibians. Crayfish forced tadpoles to increase detritus ingestion or other resources depleted in delta C-13. We found that the opportunistic amphibian feeding was greatly conditioned by intra-and interspecific competition whereas non-consumptive predator effects were negligible. Determining the trophic plasticity of amphibians can help us understand natural and anthropogenic changes in aquatic ecosystems and assess amphibians' ability to adjust to different environmental conditions.","[Arribas, Rosa; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Caut, Stephane] CSIC, Dept Ethol & Conservat Biodivers, Donana Biol Stn, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/F-8226-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/0000-0003-0094-8195","Plan Nacional I+D from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [CGL2009-11123, CGL2012-4044]; Spanish Severo Ochoa Program [SEV-2012-0262]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity [BES2010-042243]","Funding for this study was provided by grants CGL2009-11123 and CGL2012-4044 from Plan Nacional I+D from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, from the Spanish Severo Ochoa Program (SEV-2012-0262), and dissertation grant BES2010-042243 awarded to RA by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity.",,61,26,26,1,47,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 19,2015,10,6,,,,,,,e0130897,10.1371/journal.pone.0130897,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CL3FE,WOS:000356835000157,26091281,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-24,

This study assessed the importance of anthropogenic foods to the diets of red foxes and arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus (L., 1758)), and competition for food resources between the two species in Prudhoe Bay. We used stable isotope analysis of fox tissues to infer diet during summer and winter for both red and arctic foxes, and lifetime diet for red fox. While the contribution of anthropogenic foods in late summer for both species' diets was low (similar to 10% to 15%), the contribution in late winter was higher and varied between species (red foxes = 49%; arctic foxes = 39%). Estimates of lifetime diet in red foxes suggest consistent use of anthropogenic foods. We found moderate overlap of fox diets, although red foxes appeared to be more specialized on lemmings, whereas arctic foxes had a more diverse diet. Availability and consumption of anthropogenic foods by red foxes, particularly in winter, may partially explain their year-round presence in Prudhoe Bay.","[Savory, G. A.; Hunter, C.

To locate hosts for their offspring, parasitic wasps, or parasitoids, use plant odour blends induced by herbivore feeding. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) may also be used by competitors and predators. Therefore, offspring of parasitoids that respond to the most conspicuous odours may find themselves more frequently involved in competition or predation risk. We studied cultivars of Brassica oleracea that are known to differ in volatile production that underlies attractiveness to parasitoids and asked whether variation in this parameter is associated with a heterogeneous distribution of intrinsic competition among parasitoid larvae and predation risk by hyperparasitoids that parasitize parasitoid larvae or pupae. We inoculated field-grown plants with Pieris caterpillars and, thereafter, exposed them to the natural parasitoid community. We measured the frequency of multiple incidences of parasitism in these herbivores. Cocoons of the parasitoids were collected to identify the degree of hyperparasitism associated with different Brassica cultivars. Pieris caterpillars on cultivars that were more attractive to Cotesia parasitoids were more commonly parasitized by several females of the same (superparasitism) or different wasp species (multiparasitism) than caterpillars on less attractive plants. Cocoons of parasitoids on attractive plants also more frequently produced hyperparasitoids. Our results show that there is heterogeneity in intrinsic competition and risk of hyperparasitism for parasitoids on different cabbage cultivars and that this heterogeneity is likely generated by variation in attraction of parasitoids to HIPVs of these cultivars. We conclude that parasitoids may find themselves between a rock and a hard place as cues for host presence may also predict high levels of competition and risk of predation. We speculate that this affects selection on parasitoid responses to plant odours and enhances selection on traits that make wasps better intrinsic or extrinsic competitors as well as selection for adaptive traits - such as crypsis - that protect them against hyperparasitoids.

Squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, and C. apella form ubiquitous interspecific associations, but the reason remains debatable. With a large biogeographic field study, we tested the degree to which the distribution and abundance of Cebus and S. sciureus is determined by habitat type, fruit availability, and geography (i.e., determinants of the fundamental niche) relative to interspecific interactions, such as competition and facilitation (i.e., the realized niche). We used the competition between the two capuchin monkeys as a natural experiment that subjected S. sciureus to C. apella and C. olivaceus treatments'. Using spatial regression models and principal components analysis, we found that S. sciureus was associated with seasonally flooded forests, and was correlated with fruit abundance and diversity (fundamental niche), but was also correlated with C. apella density even when accounting for habitat and fruit availability (realized niche). Saimiri sciureus density was unrelated to C. olivaceus density. Cebus apella was associated with a variety of forest types, but particularly included disturbed and edge habitats such as logged forests, seasonally flooded forests, and upland savanna, in addition to mature forest. Cebus apella was also positively correlated with S. sciureus density and negatively correlated with the density of C. olivaceus. In contrast, C. olivaceus avoided riparian areas and was associated with mixed-height forests on sloped mountainous terrain. In sum, interspecific interactions such as competition between species of Cebus and facilitation between C. apella and S. sciureus were as important as habitat and fruit availability in determining the distribution and abundance of these primates.","[Levi, Taal] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Levi, Taal] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Silvius, Kirsten M.] Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Oliveira, Luiz F.

However, we reviewed recent studies and found that only nine of 144 cases are strong examples that have ruled out alternative explanations for an ECD-like pattern. We suggest that the rise in esteem of ECD has outpaced available data and that more complete, rather than simply more, case studies are needed.

In this study, we examine the impacts of the trophic ecology of non-native fishes on the three species' in the San Rafael River, Utah, USA. We employ a suite of abundance comparisons, stable isotope techniques and size-at-age back-calculation analyses to compare food web structure and growth rates of the three species' in study areas with and without established populations of non-native species. We found that the three species' are more abundant in areas with few non-native fishes present, regardless of habitat complexity. Stable isotope analyses indicate non-native fishes lengthen the food chain by 0.5 trophic positions. Further, the trophic niche spaces of the native fishes shift and are narrower in the presence of non-native fishes, as several non-native species' trophic niche spaces overlap almost entirely with each of the three species' (bluehead sucker and flannelmouth sucker 100%, roundtail chub 98.5%) indicating strong potential for competition. However, the three species' demonstrated no evidence of reduced growth in the presence of these non-native fishes. Collectively, these results suggest that while non-native fishes alter the food web structure presenting novel sources of predation and competition, mechanisms other than competition are controlling the size-structure of three species' populations in the San Rafael River.","[Walsworth, Timothy E.; Budy, Phaedra; Thiede, Gary P.] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Walsworth, TE (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",tewalsworth@gmail.com,,,United States Bureau of Reclamation Activities to Avoid Jeopardy Program; S.E. and Jessie E.

Experiments of multiple predator effects on prey populations are extremely demanding, as the number of treatments and the amount of labour associated with these experiments increases exponentially with the number of species in question. Therefore, researchers tend to vary only presence/absence of the species and use only one (supposedly realistic) combination of their numbers in experiments. However, nonlinearities in density dependence, functional responses, interactions between natural enemies etc. are typical for such systems, and nonlinear models of population dynamics generally predict qualitatively different results, if initial absolute densities of the species studied differ, even if their relative densities are maintained. Therefore, testing combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities may not be sufficient. Here we test this prediction experimentally. We show that the population dynamics of a system consisting of 2 natural enemies (aphid predator Adalia bipunctata (L.), and aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani Viereck) and their shared prey (peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer) are strongly affected by the absolute initial densities of the species in question. Even if their relative densities are kept constant, the natural enemy species or combination thereof that most effectively suppresses the prey may depend on the absolute initial densities used in the experiment. Future empirical studies of multiple predator - one prey interactions should therefore use a two-dimensional array of initial densities of the studied species. Varying only combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities is not sufficient and can lead to misleading results.","[Ameixa, Olga M. C.

In some contexts, the aggressive behaviours shown in these interspecific interactions are very similar to those shown in intraspecific interactions. It is still an open question whether intra- and interspecific aggression share common causality. We studied a year-round territorial species the jewel damselfish, (Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus), which cultivate algae they feed on. Territory holders aggressively defend these algae that are an attractive resource for many other species. In this study, we recorded territorial aggression in free-living individuals and recorded aggressive responses to a standardized territorial intrusion test in captive individuals. Field observations indicated that territorial aggression was selectively targeted towards food competitors. Independent of the size of the species, aggression was more frequent towards common species around their territories. This relationship was confirmed experimentally by confronting the jewel damselfish with novel objects to which the subjects were exposed either frequently or rarely. We suggest that jewel damselfish have to learn which species are competitors and therefore should be chased. In a standardized intrusion test with captive individuals, no significant differences were found in territorial responses towards intra- or interspecific intruders. Neither territorial aggression nor the intrusion showed any relationship with plasma androgen levels. Together, these data suggest that experience might be more important in non-seasonal territorial aggression than circulating hormonal factors.","[Di Paola, Valentina; Vullioud, Philippe; Demarta, Lanila; Ros, Albert F.

Ants interact with a diversity of organisms. These interactions, coupled with their abundance, cause ants to have ecologically important effects across multiple trophic levels. 2. Empirical study of ant nutritional ecology has led to the prediction that a macronutrient imbalance will affect ant behaviour and interspecific interactions that underlie these broad-scale effects. Excess carbohydrate relative to protein is predicted to increase ant aggressiveness, predatory tendency and foraging activity, and to decrease collection of hemipteran honeydew and plant nectar. 3. In field experiments conducted in 2009 and 2010, captive colony fragments of a native ant, Formica podzolica (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), were provided with either simulated prey or carbohydrate solution ad libitum. Foraging behaviours and interactions with flowers, myrmecophilous aphids and aphid natural enemies on wild-grown plants were documented. 4. Strong effects of macronutrient imbalance on foraging manifested quickly and consistently across colonies; in accordance with predictions, prey-fed foragers collected both honeydew and floral nectar, whereas carbohydrate-fed ants ceased collecting these resources. Counter to predictions, carbohydrate-fed ants dramatically lowered their activity levels and did not prey upon aphids. 5. Ants had no effect on aphid enemies in 2009, when the latter were relatively rare, but decreased their abundance in 2010. Despite this protection, the net effect of ants on aphids was negative (measured only in 2009). Prey-fed ants demonstrated a strong preference for honeydew over floral nectar, thus demonstrating that a macronutrient imbalance may lead to different interactions with similar resources. 6. This study links ant nutrition and community ecology by demonstrating the rapid, asymmetric and multitrophic consequences of nutritionally mediated behaviour.","[Petry, William K.; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92617 USA; [Petry, William K.] Truman State Univ, Dept Biol, Kirksville, MO USA; [Perry, Kayla I.] Baldwin Wallace Coll, Dept Biol & Geol, Berea, OH USA; [Perry, Kayla I.] Ohio State Univ, Ohio Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Entomol, Wooster, OH 44691 USA","Petry, WK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92617 USA.",wpetry@uci.edu,,"Petry, William/0000-0002-5230-5987",National Science Foundation through Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) [DBI-0753774]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919178]; RMBL; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0919178] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by National Science Foundation grants DBI-0753774 to WKP and KIP through the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) and DEB-0919178 to KAM and a RMBL Ehrlich Fellowship to KAM.

As the Earth's climate warms, interactions such as competition, predation, and mutualism are changing due to shifts in per capita interaction strength and the relative abundance of interacting species. Changes in interspecific relationships, in turn, can drive important local-scale changes in community dynamics, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, and can potentially alter large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance. In many cases, the importance of indirect effects of warming, mediated by changing species interactions, will be greater-albeit less well understood-than direct effects in determining the community-and ecosystem-level outcomes of global climate change. Despite considerable community-specific idiosyncrasy, ecological theory and a growing body of data suggest that certain general trends are emerging at local scales: positive interactions tend to become more prevalent with warming, and top trophic levels are disproportionately vulnerable. In addition, important ecological changes result when the geographic overlap between species changes, and when the seasonal timing of life history events of interacting species falls into or out of synchrony. We assess the degree to which such changes are predictable, and urge advancement on several high priority questions surrounding the relationships between temperature and community ecology.

We found that 86% of the overwintering invertebrates in traps were predators, which were dominated by spiders (72%) of different guilds and different body sizes. Spiders had spatially segregated in the traps so that smaller specimens hid in an interstitial space that was inaccessible to larger specimens. Spiders of the bark-dwelling guild, Anyphaena and Philodromus, are winter-active and can prey on other smaller spiders. Analysis of their abundance in traps indicated a negative relationship between Anyphaena and Philodromus or other spiders. Inspection of traps during winter revealed an influx of spider specimens confirming their winter-activity. In a semi-field experiment, where overwintering in cardboard bands was studied under controlled conditions, we observed mortality of both winter-active Philodromus and Anyphaena spiders due to their interspecific predation. The mortality was affected by their size ratio - larger specimens consumed smaller ones. Presence of alternative prey, theridiid spiders, did not affect their mortalities, but the presence of shelters (interstitial spaces) did. In boards with interstitial spaces smaller spiders suffered lower mortality than in boards without the interstitial spaces. Obtained results suggest that intraguild predation between overwintering spiders can decrease their population density during winter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The species was first detected in the northeastern United States in 1998 and has rapidly spread throughout much of eastern North America. in addition to used tire casings, Oc. j. japonicus develops in a wide variety of artificial and natural container habitats, especially rock pools along stream beds. In an effort to evaluate the invasion success and impact of Oc. j. japonicus on populations of native container dwelling species, waste tire disposal sites and natural rock pool habitats were sampled for mosquito larvae throughout Connecticut in 2005, and data were compared with results from prior surveys made in 1987 and 1999. Oc. j. japonicus was the predominant species collected at the waste tire disposal sites regardless of surrounding landscape features, accounting for 55.9% of all larvae. A comparison with collections from prior surveys revealed a 90% reduction in the relative abundance of larval populations of Oc. triseriatus (Say) and significant reductions among larval populations of Oc. atropalpus (Coquillett) and Culex restuans Theobald. Oc. j. japonicus was also the most abundant mosquito collected in rock pool habitats, accounting for nearly 80% of all collected larvae, except where water temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. This was concomitant with significant declines in the relative abundance of Oc. atropalpus and Cx. restuans. We conclude that Oc. j. japonicus is a potentially effective competitor in rock pool and tire environments and may be responsible for reducing populations of several native species occupying these habitats through interspecific competition for limited resources. The exclusion of Oc. j. japonicus from warm water pools further suggests that a temperature barrier may exist for Oc. j. japonicus and that populations may not be able to colonize southern regions of the United States with relatively high summer temperatures.","[Andreadis, Theodore G.; Wolfe, Boger J.] Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, New Haven, CT 06504 USA","Andreadis, TG (corresponding author), Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, 123 Huntington St,POB 1106, New Haven, CT 06504 USA.",theodore.andreadis@ct.gov,,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [U50/CCU6806-01-1, 58-6615-1-218]; USDA-administered Hatch [CONH00768]","We wish to acknowledge John Shepard and Michael Thomas; The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, for assistance in establishing collections sites and in collecting, processing and identifying mosquitoes; and Christopher Samorajczyk, CT Department of Environmental Protection for assistance in field collections.

HYMENOPTERA; FUSCA L.; PREDATION; TAIGA; MAYR; INTERFERENCE; TERRITORIES; ASSEMBLAGES; POLYETHISM; COLONY,"Some literature reports show that ants use bodies of their dead nestmates and other insect remains in conflict situations. The paper describes such phenomenon in a Formica rufa L. colony brought into conflict with a R cinerea Mayr colony when the former tried to extend its own territory at the expense of the latter. A territorially stable E rufa colony, neighbouring the same E cinerea colony, served as control. Workers of the expansive F. rufa colony were repeatedly observed to carry numerous ant corpses, empty pupal cocoons and insect leftovers from their nest to the place of confrontation with E cinerea, on a much bigger scale than workers of the stable E rufa colony. Corpse-carrying intensity was not correlated with the general activity level of foragers which suggests that corpse carriers could be a separate task group. Workers of a small colony of F. cinerea were also observed to surround their nest entrance with corpses of their nestmates and prey remains, taken out from inside the nest, in response to intensified traffic of workers of E rufa in the vicinity of their nest. These results are discussed in the context of a possible interrelation between ant aggressive behaviour and transport behaviour. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the observed phenomenon: (1) explaining it as a by-product of the aggressive arousal of workers, and (2) ascribing to it a possible signalling function in conflict situations.","[Czechowski, Wojciech] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Marko, Balint] Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Taxon & Ecol, Cluj Napoca 400006, Romania; [Godzinska, Ewa Joanna] Polish Acad Sci, M Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Dept Neurophysiol, Ethol Lab, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland","Czechowski, W (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",wcz@miiz.waw.pl; mbalint@biolog.ubbcluj.ro; e.godzinska@nencki.gov.pl,"Godzinska, Ewa/B-2622-2012; Marko, Balint/C-3081-2011","Godzinska, Ewa Joanna/0000-0001-6993-2082; Marko, Balint/0000-0001-6039-8231; Czechowski, Wojciech/0000-0001-9422-2453",EU FP 6European Commission [PL-TAF-3066]; Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw [407];  [31/1342];  [ID-552 PNII],"The field observations were made during WCz.'s stay at the Tvarminne Zoological Station, University of Helsinki, within the programme of scientific co-operation between the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Finland.

Previous studies have shown that interspecific hybridisation is common among taxa from the Daphnia galeata/hyalina/cucullata species complex. We investigated the influence of predator kairomones on the morphology and life histories of nine clones belonging to three taxa (pure D. galeata, F-1 hybrids between D. galeata and D. hyalina, and backcrossed D. hyalina) of this species complex. Predators exerting positive (fish) and negative (Chaoborus larvae) size-selective predation were tested. 2. The most responsive traits were size at maturity and size of neonates. Despite large between-clone variation, discriminant analysis revealed that the three taxa were distinct from each other in key life-history traits. F-1 hybrids did not react in an intermediate way compared to the other taxa: the multivariate distances between F-1 hybrids and either taxon were larger than between pure D. galeata and backcrossed D. hyalina. 3. The average plasticity (calculated across all traits) was similar for all three taxa. With regard to the size at maturity and neonate body size, the strength of the response was a function of the intrinsic values of these traits expressed in the control. For example, for size at maturity, smaller individuals showed a significantly stronger reaction to Chaoborus kairomones than larger ones. 4. Finally, we monitored seasonal changes in body size, egg number and population density of pure D. galeata and F-1 hybrids in Greifensee (Switzerland). The two taxa experienced similar seasonal changes in body size but, on some sampling dates, they differed in mean egg number. The observed seasonal changes in Daphnia body size were consistent with what would be expected if the predator assemblage shifted from fish to Chaoborus over the course of the summer. The fluctuations in the frequencies of Daphnia taxa, however, were not related to seasonal variation in Daphnia body size. 5. Experimental data suggest that temporally heterogeneous predation regimes might be an important condition stabilising the co-occurrence of Daphnia hybrids with parental taxa. Predation regimes, however, cannot solely explain dynamic changes in taxon frequency in Greifensee.","Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-7750 Constance, Germany","Spaak, P (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jwolinsk@indiana.edu,"Wolinska, Justyna/N-6455-2014; Wolinska, Jaroszynska-Wolinska/A-5268-2013","Wolinska, Justyna/0000-0003-2913-2923",,,,56,19,20,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

P. perna predominates in the lower mussel zone and M. galloprovincialis in the upper zone, with mixed beds where the two overlap. We examined competitive interactions between these species by translocating mussels into small plots at high densities. Treatments involved different combinations of species and densities placed in each zone. Mortality was monitored regularly and at the end of each experiment, growth and condition index were measured. The experiment was attempted three times. The first two attempts were disrupted by wave action, especially winter storms, but provided information on species-specific effects of wave action. In experiment one, wave induced mortality decreased from a mean for both species of approximately 90% on the low shore to ca. 50% on the high shore, and was 15-30% lower for P. perna than M. galloprovincialis in each zone. In experiment two, M. galloprovincialis mortality was not affected by zone (Kruskal-Wallis test, P > 0.05), but was higher than P. perna mortality in the low zone (P < 0.05). P. perna survival was significantly (P < 0.05) lower on the high than mid and low zones, apparently due to the effects of greater emersion. Condition index showed a similar pattern, being lowest in the low zone for M. galloprovincialis and in the high zone for P. perna (3-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Growth rates were fastest for both species in the low zone (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05 in both cases). The third experiment was run for 12 months in the low zone only and provided evidence of intraspecific competition for P. perna and of interspecific competition. Condition was significantly greater for P. perna in all treatments (2-way ANOVA), as was growth (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.05). Significant treatment effects indicated that P. perna had a negative effect on M. galloprovincialis survival (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05). Again wave action was important; by the end of the experiment all mussels had been removed from plots stocked only with M. galloprovincialis. Thus P. perna improves survival of M. galloprovincialis on the low shore in the short term, by providing protection against wave action, but excludes it competitively in the longer term. The results show that partial habitat segregation is likely to be a permanent feature on the south coast, with M. galloprovincialis unable to dominate the low shore due to the effects of waves and competitive exclusion by P. perna. This study is the first attempt to examine the mechanisms of interaction between invasive and indigenous marine mussel species and provides evidence of the importance of environmental conditions in the mediation of this interaction.","Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","McQuaid, CD (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",c.mcquaid@ru.ac.za,"McQuaid, Christopher/AAT-3725-2020; Rius, Marc/C-5088-2011","McQuaid, Christopher/0000-0002-3473-8308; Rius, Marc/0000-0002-2195-6605",,,,51,60,62,0,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

While benthic communities in tropical and also Antarctic regions are thought to be mainly structured by intra- and interspecific interactions, these factors are proposed to be less important in northern high latitudes. Consequently, selective pressure for chemical defence should be low in these regions. To investigate the incidence of chemical defence against predation in northern high latitudes, crude extracts of 18 abundant sessile or slow-moving invertebrate species (4 sponges, 3 actinians, 1 soft coral, 4 bryozoans, 3 ascidians and the egg mass of a gastropod) from Kongsfjord (Spitsbergen) were tested for feeding deterrent activity. Laboratory assays were performed by offering artificial food with extracts to two different predators, the amphipod Anonyx nugax which is a common species in Kongsfjord, and the starfish Asterias rubens from the North Sea. Of the 18 extracts tested, 2 (Haliclona viscosa, Hormathia nodosa) exhibited significant feeding deterrent effects in the amphipod assay. Furthermore, 6 extracts had a significantly stimulating effect on the amphipod feeding, and 10 extracts did not affect consumption. In the starfish assay, only the crude extract of H. viscosa was significantly rejected. For H. viscosa, feeding deterrence could be established for two pure compounds, and for H. nodosa for one fraction. The present data show that feeding deterrent compounds are present in sub-Arctic marine invertebrates from Kongsfjord but are less abundant than in temperate, tropical and Antarctic species.

Larvae of C. coeruleus, although defended on their dorsal surface with long spines, had the smallest mandibles, were the slowest-moving, and the least successful in interspecific larval combat. The long spines of third instar C. coeruleus appeared to reduce their palatability as food to H. axyridis and O. v-nigrum larvae in choice tests with dead larvae, but were not an effective defence against these species in Petri dish arenas. Larvae of O. v-nigrum had a smooth dorsal surface, were intermediate in terms of mandible size, but were the fastest moving, a trait that benefited their survival in intraguild combat. Larvae of H. axyridis were intermediate with respect to dorsal spines and speed of movement, but had the largest mandibles. This species was the most effective intraguild combatant among the coccinellids and the only one to successfully compete against C. rufilabris larvae of similar age. The speed, manoeuverability and long mandibles of C. rufilabris enabled them to impale coccinellid larvae at a relatively safe distance. The spines of C. coeruleus larvae impeded laterally oriented attacks by C. rufilabris, but did not provide sustained protection from repeated attacks. Success in these interactions appeared largely a function of offensive weaponry (mandible size and morphology) and speed of movement, although the role of dorsal spines as defensive structures was not ruled out. Rates of larval cannibalism were highest for C. rufilabris and largely mirrored the level of aggression observed in interspecific combat for each species.","Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA","Michaud, JP (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Agr Res Ctr Hays, 1232 240th Ave, Hays, KS 67601 USA.",jpmi@ksu.edu,,,,,,13,30,33,0,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-4853,1475-2670,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

In 1990, seven-year-old trees were inoculated with Panonychus ulmi (Koch), Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) or both, and sprayed with azinphosmethyl (alone or plus endosulfan), or nothing. The species Zetzellia mali (Ewing) (Acari: Stigmaeidae), Amblyseius andersoni Chant (Acari: Phytoseiidae), Eotetranychus sp., Bryobia rubrioculus (Scheuten) (Acari: Tetranychidae), and Aculus schlechtendali Nalepa (Acari: Eriophyidae) were already present or immigrated into plots, and Galendromus occidentalis (Nesbitt) and Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten (Acari: Phytoseiidae) were introduced. Yule's V association index was used to measure positive, neutral, or negative interspecific associations for each species pair, because of its robustness with spatially autocorrelated data. We found that pesticide and release treatments did not greatly affect the association results, but there were strong seasonal differences. Predator-predator associations were the strongest and most consistent, showing negative associations in the early and mid seasons, and neutral ones in late season. Negative associations of T. pyri with other predators were the strongest, which is consistent with evidence that this mite can detect other predators on a leaf. Predator-prey seasonal associations were mixed, with some positive and others negative, with most significant associations occurring in the mid season. One prey-prey interaction was positive, again in mid season, most likely because of similar habitat preferences.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Entomol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Slone, DH (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Entomol Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,,"Slone, Daniel/0000-0002-9903-9727",,,,36,20,24,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

This experiment investigated effects of accumulated invertebrate carcasses as a resource for two competing mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes aegypti (L.) whether either species differentially benefited from accumulated carcasses, and if such a benefit affected interspecific competition. First, we measured accumulation of invertebrate carcasses in standard containers at a field site. We then used a replacement series with five different species ratios at the same total density: and varied the input of invertebrate carcasses [dead Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) ] in three levels: none, the average input from our field site, or the maximum input recorded at our field site. Survivorship, development time, and mass were measured for each mosquito species as correlates of population growth, and were used to calculate a population performance index, lambda'. There were strong positive effects of invertebrate carcass additions on all growth correlates and lambda'. Differences in performance between species were pronounced in small or no carcass additions and absent in large inputs of invertebrate carcasses, but there was little evidence that inputs of invertebrate carcasses altered the competitive advantage in this system. These results suggest that terrestrial invertebrate carcasses may be an important resource for many types of container communities, and large accumulations of dead invertebrates may: reduce resource competition between these mosquitoes. thus favoring coexistence. We propose that the total amount of resource, including accumulated invertebrate carcasses, may explain observed patterns of replacement involving these mosquitoes.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Div Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Daugherty, MP (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Div Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793, R01 AI044793-01, R15 AI039700-01, R01 AI44793-01, R15 AI39700-01] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI039700, R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,37,111,115,0,18,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0022-2585,,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Each stream consisted of three habitats, a riffle, a run and a pool, the latter two being further divided into shallow margins and deeper mid-regions. The experimental design differentiated between intraspecific and interspecific effects by having two densities of allopatry for each salmonid and one density of sympatry, for a total of five treatments. These five treatments were then run in the presence and absence of the piscivorous northern pike (Esox lucius) at high and low discharge. Decreasing discharge reduced the area of the run and pool margins covered by water, thereby reducing use of these areas by trout and grayling. In the absence of a predator, brown trout caused grayling to markedly reduce its use of pool mid-regions and increase its use of the shallow margins, but only at high flow. Grayling had a more modest effect on brown trout, causing brown trout to increase its use of pool mid-regions, but only at high flow. There were no effects of intraspecific effects on habitat use by either species. In the presence of pike, which occupied the Fool, grayling had no effect on habitat use by brown trout, whereas brown trout caused grayling to increase its use of shallow water habitats. There were no effects of intraspecific effects on habitat use by either species when pike was present. The number of grayling or trout consumed by pike did not vary among the different treatments. The results showed that variation in flow and predation altered habitat use patterns of brown trout and grayling.","Univ Lund, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Greenberg, LA (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Biol, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",,,,,,,27,18,18,0,10,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGS,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

The experiment also enabled the assessment of species-specific influences of food supplements and spatial heterogeneity on predatory behavior. Ae, triseriatus was substantially more predatory and less susceptible to attack than the other 2 species. These differences were amplified in food-deprived and spatially simple conditions, indicating that Ae. triseriatus predatory behavior may have important retarding effects on the colonization of occupied treehole habitats by Ae. albopictus. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were similar in imposing little (Ae. aegypti) or almost no (Ae. albopictus) predation on Ist instars and in being susceptible to predation by AB, triseriatus. The general lack of species-specific differences between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus indicates that interspecific predation is not a likely explanation for the rapid displacement of Ae. aegypti by Ae. albopictus in domestic containers in the southeastern United States.","Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; Clark Univ, Dept Biol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Edgerly, JS (corresponding author), Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",,,,"NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15 AI-27940-01, R15 AI-28039-01A1] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI027940, R15AI028039] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,31,30,30,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2585,1938-2928,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

The model consists of community matrices with density-dependent species interactions and a limit on the total population of each species. A general natural pattern forms the basis of the model: organisms which are most similar compete, those which are less similar may enter into a predator-prey relationship, and those which are most different may be mutualistic. In this model, contrary to some previously published studies, increasing the number of species increased stability of community matrices. The rate of change in phenotype was varied to assess the response of community characteristics. At the highest rate of random phenotypic change there were the most species; the minimum number of species was found at intermediate rates of change. The models were run in the absence of predation, competition, or mutualism. The absence of mutualism led to more extinction. The absence of competition caused communities to quickly reach a population ceiling. Results suggest that it is extremely important to understand the relative occurrence of mutualism and competition in natural communities.

They can arise in two general ways: through linked chains of direct interactions, and when a species changes the interactions among species. Indirect effects have been uncovered largely by experimental studies that have monitored the response of many species and discovered ''unexpected results,'' although some studies have looked for specific indirect effects predicted from simple models. The characteristics of such approaches make it likely that the many indirect effects remain uncovered, but the application of techniques such as path analysis may reduce this problem. Deterministic theory indicates that indirect effects should often be important, although stochastic models need exploration. Simulation models indicate that some indirect effects may stabilize multi-species assemblages. Five simple types of indirect effects have been regularly demonstrated in nature: exploitative competition, trophic cascades, apparent competition, indirect mutualism, and interaction modifications. Detailed experimental investigations of natural communities have yielded complicated effects. Indirect effects have the potential to affect evolutionary patterns, but empirical examples are limited. Future directions in the study of indirect effects include developing techniques to estimate interaction strength in dynamic models, deriving more efficient approaches to detecting indirect effects, evaluating the effectiveness of approaches such as path analysis, and investigating mechanisms in which a species changes how other species interact.",,"WOOTTON, JT (corresponding author), UNIV CHICAGO,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT,1101 E 57TH ST,CHICAGO,IL 60637, USA.",,"Wootton, J.

Some of their phytoseiid predators, however, show the reverse pattern. We test the hypothesis that this different seasonal phenology can be attributed to distinct saturation deficit tolerance spectra. Eggs of various species c.q. strains of phytoseiids, originating from different climate zones, were screened for their tolerance to a range of saturation deficits and compared with the tolerance spectrum of tetranychid species collected from cassava. In total 19 species/strains of predatory mites were compared with six tetranychid species. The response curves for all predators were sigmoidal with a narrow and specific region of saturation deficits where egg hatch success fell from 100% to 0%. Using probit analysis this region was characterized by the SD50, the saturation deficit at which only 50% of the eggs hatch. The response curves for the herbivores were trapezoid. In contrast to the phytoseiids the latter do not differ in the range of saturation deficits tolerated, but in the magnitude of the response. It appeared that inter-strain differences in the Phytoseiidae are sometimes larger than interspecific differences. We demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between population-specific SD50-values and long term average relative humidity in the collection site. The implications of this finding are discussed in terms of condition specific competition.","CTR INT AGR TROP,CALI,COLOMBIA","BAKKER, FM (corresponding author), UNIV AMSTERDAM,DEPT PURE & APPL ECOL,POPULAT BIOL SECT,KRUISLAAN 302,1098 SM AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.",,"Bakker, F.M./AAF-5380-2019","Bakker, F.M./0000-0002-1447-3285",,,,0,50,52,0,8,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

In Poland, three different species of those beetles develop on the same host plant and use the same resources, which can lead to increased competition. We tested preferences of weevil females towards acorn size chosen for oviposition as well as reproduction time and other characteristics of their breeding behavior. The results clearly indicate that particular species prefer acorns of different masses and breeds in different periods corresponding to different stages of fruit growth. In other words, this enables weevils to pass each other during reproduction. Furthermore, one of the studied species varies distinctly also in terms of the number of laid eggs and the manner of locating them within the acorn tissues. Our observations support the hypothesis that niche partitioning among the species appears to be occurring when the resources-acorns, are limited. The work helps to understand how multi-species communities of insects cope in order to survive in a shared habitat. Oak seed predatory weevils occurring in Poland are prone to increased interspecific competition due to the limited number of Quercus species, compared to southern Europe, in which they can develop. Therefore, analyses on the preferences of three weevil species for acorn sizes chosen for reproduction, as well as on reproductive period duration, were performed. Cafeteria-type experiments were set for females of three species associated with one oak species. Females were allowed to choose and oviposit in acorns of different sizes and growth stages. Research revealed statistically significant differences between the masses of acorns chosen for oviposition by females of Curculio glandium (the biggest), C. pellitus (medium), and C. venosus (the smallest). Studied weevils also differed in terms of the beginning of the reproductive period, which corresponded with the increasing mass of growing acorns. Moreover, C. glandium was observed to be the only species to perform radial egg galleries and lay a considerably higher and varied number of eggs. The results support the hypothesis of a strategy aimed at reducing interspecific competition between Curculio spp. in terms of limited host plant species number.","[Reut, Michal; Moniuszko, Hanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Hort Sci, Dept Plant Protect, Sect Appl Entomol, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Chrabaszcz, Mariusz] Univ Wroclaw, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Ecol Biogeochem & Environm Protect, Kanonia 6-8, PL-50328 Wroclaw, Poland","Reut, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Hort Sci, Dept Plant Protect, Sect Appl Entomol, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",michal_reut@sggw.edu.pl; mariusz.chrabaszcz@uwr.edu.pl; hanna_moniuszko@sggw.edu.pl,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,AUG,2021,12,8,,,,,,,687,10.3390/insects12080687,,,11,Entomology,Entomology,UG3QR,WOS:000689171900001,34442253,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-24,

In mammalian carnivores, to reduce the risks of negative encounters between competitors, species can employ a strategy of temporal partitioning, adapting activity patterns to limit synchronous activity. This strategy of non-human competitor avoidance, however, may be influenced by the expansion of human activities, which has driven wild mammals towards nocturnality. We hypothesise that the disruption of temporal niche partitioning by humans and their activities could increase temporal overlap between carnivores, enhancing interspecific competition. We reviewed the published literature systematically and employed generalised linear models to evaluate quantitatively the relative influence of a range of human, meteorological and ecological variables on coefficients of temporal overlap within mammalian terrestrial carnivore communities (orders Carnivora and Didelphimorphia) on a global scale. None of the models investigated showed evidence of an impact of humans on temporal partitioning between carnivores on a global scale. This illustrates that temporal avoidance of humans and competitors does not always follow a consistent pattern and that its strength may be context-dependent and relative to other dimensions of niche partitioning (spatial and trophic). Similarly, the regulation of activity patterns may be strongly site-specific and may be influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic characteristics. Temporal avoidance of both humans and competitors by carnivores may take the form of short, reactive responses that do not impact activity patterns in the longer term. Although we did not detect a global disruption of temporal partitioning due to human disturbance, carnivore communities may still experience an increase in interspecific competition in other niche dimensions.

An ecological model for the community was developed by means of interspecific relationship including competition and predation to calculate the APDP. As a case study, we reported here the ecotoxicological effects of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) collected from Bohai oil field on densities of two algae, Platymonas subcordiformis and Isochrysis galbana, a rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, and of a cladocera, Penilia avirostris, in single species and a microcosm experiment Time scales expressing toxic effect increased with increasing levels of toxic effect from molecule to community. Remarkable periodic changes in densities were found during the tests in microcosm experiment, revealing a strong species reaction. The minimum time scale characterizing toxic effect at a community level should be the common cycle of population densities of the microcosm. In addition, the cycles of plankton densities shortened in general with increasing PHC, showing an evident toxic effect on the microcosm. Using APDP as the endpoint, a threshold concentration for the modeled microcosm was calculated to be 0.404 mg-PHC-1. The APDP was found to be more sensitive and reliable than the standing crops of populations as the endpoint This indicated that the APDP, an endpoint at the community level, could be quantitatively related to the endpoints at the population level, and led to the quantitative concentration-toxic effect relationship at the community level.","[Wang, Changyou; Wang, Siwen; Luo, Zhuhua; Mao, Longjiang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Xinming] Jiangsu Environm Monitoring Ctr, Nanjing 210036, Peoples R China; [Yang, Bin] Beibu Gulf Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Marine Disaster Beibu Gulf, Qinzhou 535011, Peoples R China; [Liang, Shengkang] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China","Wang, CY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",chy.w@hotmail.com,,,Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2020r028]; National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC1402101]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This study was supported by the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST (Project No. 2020r028), the National Key Research and Development Program (Project No. 2016YFC1402101), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,83,0,0,5,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-6513,1090-2414,,ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE,Ecotox.

Salinity choice experiments revealed that juveniles of this species significantly prefer brackish water (salinity 20) to freshwater (salinity 0) when acclimated to a salinity of 20 in advance. Additional experiments revealed no preference between brackish water and seawater (salinity 35). Since body size was not correlated with the strength of preference for brackish water, and adults of this species are also known to prefer brackish water at a salinity of 20 to freshwater, the preference for saline water may be consistent after migration to a freshwater area. Considering that juvenile G. petschiliensis would often migrate to freshwater areas just after entering streams, the migration should be against its salinity preference. This directly contrasts with other diadromous species, which prefer the salinity of destination areas during and after migration. Adult and juvenile G. petschiliensis may take advantage of high euryhalinity to choose habitats where such ecological costs, such as high predation risk and interspecific competition, are low (i.e., freshwater areas).","[Oto, Yumeki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Div Biol Sci, Kyoto, Japan","Oto, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Div Biol Sci,Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwakecho, Kyoto, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",ooto.yumeki.78s@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Without manipulative experiments, assessing the role of foraging ecology and interspecific competition in structuring diet is challenging. Systems with regular pulses of resources act as a natural experiment to investigate the factors that influence the dietary niches of consumers. We used natural pulses of mast-fruiting of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) to test whether optimal foraging or competition structure the dietary niche breadth and overlap between two congener rodent species (Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus), both of which are generalist consumers. We reconstructed diets seasonally over a 2-year period using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15) of hair and of potential dietary items and measured niche dynamics using standard ellipse area calculated within a Bayesian framework. Changes in niche breadth were generally consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory, with both species consuming more beechnuts (a high-quality food resource) and having a narrower niche breadth during masting seasons compared to nonmasting seasons when dietary niches expanded and more fungi (a low-quality food source) were consumed. In contrast, changes in dietary niche overlap were consistent with competition theory, with higher diet overlap during masting seasons than during nonmasting seasons. Overall, dietary niche dynamics were closely tied to beech masting, underscoring that food availability influences competition. Diet plasticity and niche partitioning between the two Peromyscus species may reflect differences in foraging strategies, thereby reducing competition when food availability is low. Such dietary shifts may have important implications for changes in ecosystem function, including the dispersal of fungal spores.","[Stephens, Ryan B.; Lee, Thomas D.; Rowe, Rebecca J.] Univ New Hampshire, Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall,56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Hobbie, Erik A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Stephens, RB (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Nat Resources & Environm, 114 James Hall,56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",rbd8@wildcats.unh.edu,,"Stephens, Ryan/0000-0001-8524-9873","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Project [0229197, 1006881]; University of New Hampshire NRESS Student Support Fund; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire-Stennis Project, Grant/Award Number: 0229197 and 1006881; University of New Hampshire NRESS Student Support Fund; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station",,75,5,5,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, linking competitive interactions to predator distribution patterns is difficult and theoretical models predict different habitat selection patterns dependent on habitat quality and how competition manifests itself. While models generally consider competitors to be either equal in ability, or for one phenotype to have a fixed advantage over the other, few studies consider that an animal may only have a competitive advantage in specific habitats. We used ? 10 years of telemetry data, habitat surveys and behavioral experiments, to show spatial partitioning between and within two species of reef shark (grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhinchos and blacktip reef sharks C. melanopterus) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Within a species, sharks remained within small sub-habitats' with very few movements of individuals between sub-habitats, which previous models have suggested could be caused by intra-specific competition. Blacktip reef sharks were more broadly distributed across habitat types but a greater proportion used lagoon and backreef habitats, while grey reef sharks preferred forereef habitats. Grey reef sharks at a nearby atoll where blacktip reef sharks are absent, were distributed more broadly between habitat types than when both species were present. A series of individual-based models predict that habitat separation would only arise if there are competitive interactions between species that are habitat-specific, with grey reefs having a competitive advantage on the forereefs and blacktips in the lagoons and backreef. We provide compelling evidence that competition helps drive distribution patterns and spatial separation of a marine predator community, and highlight that competitive advantages may not be constant but rather dependent on habitats.","[Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St,MSB 355, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Bodey, Thomas W.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC USA; [Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Bradley, Darcy] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Weng, Kevin] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Fisheries Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Priestley, Victoria] Imperial Coll, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Caselle, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Papastamatiou, YP (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St,MSB 355, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",ypapastamatiou@gmail.com,"; Weng, Kevin Chi-Ming/C-4709-2013","Bradley, Darcy/0000-0003-2581-8768; Bodey, Thomas/0000-0002-5334-9615; Weng, Kevin Chi-Ming/0000-0002-7069-7152",Marisla Foundation; Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory/NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program; Nature Conservancy (TNC),"Funding was provided by the Marisla Foundation, the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory/NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC).",,56,15,15,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2018,127,6,,,,,767,779,,10.1111/oik.04289,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GI1TN,WOS:000434153600002,,,,,2021-09-24,

Overall, L. campechanus were more active and aggressive predators and appear to be competitively resistant to L. griseus and L. synagris.

Currently, predictions on the vulnerability of ecological communities to extinction cascades are based on models that focus on bottom-up effects, which cannot capture the effects of extinctions at higher trophic levels. We show, in experimental insect communities, that harvesting of single carnivorous parasitoid species led to a significant increase in extinction rate of other parasitoid species, separated by four trophic links. Harvesting resulted in the release of prey from top-down control, leading to increased interspecific competition at the herbivore trophic level. This resulted in increased extinction rates of non-harvested parasitoid species when their host had become rare relative to other herbivores. The results demonstrate a mechanism for horizontal extinction cascades, and illustrate that altering the relationship between a predator and its prey can cause wide-ranging ripple effects through ecosystems, including unexpected extinctions.","[Sanders, Dirk; Sutter, Louis] Inst Ecol & Evolut, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Sanders, Dirk; van Veen, F.

Mobile facultative scavengers are likely to negatively impact tundra biodiversity as dominant competitors or predators, if they spill over into tundra. Here, we provide the first quantitative assessments of the structure of a scavenger guild in low arctic tundra with emphasis on how it changes along spatial gradients from neighbouring ecosystems (i.e. forest and coast) and with altitude (i.e. productivity gradients). We also assess the likelihood of interactions between guild members that may negatively impact vulnerable tundra species. Location North-eastern part of Norway. Methods Extensive records of scavenger prevalence were obtained by deploying automatic digital cameras at experimental carcasses in tundra regions covering several thousand square kilometres and three winters in northern Norway. Main conclusions We found short-range neighbourhood effects of forest and coast within the tundra scavenger guild. Species richness declined steeply with decreasing distance from the neighbouring ecosystems, in particular subarctic forest, and with increasing altitude. Bird species with strongholds in forest (golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos and hooded crow Corvus cornix) or along the coast (white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla) were mostly responsible for short-range neighbourhood effects on guild structure. However, the two most abundant guild members, the common raven Corvus corax and the red fox Vulpes vulpes, exhibited no spatial patterns within the range of neighbourhoods and altitudes examined. There was a clear diurnal segregation in the use of carcasses between birds and mammals reducing the likelihood of direct interactions between these two taxa. Presence of red fox appeared to exclude the arctic fox Vulpes lagopus, the only endemic tundra species within the guild, from carcasses.","[Killengreen, Siw T.; Stromseng, Elise; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Killengreen, ST (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",siw.killengreen@uit.no,"Killengreen, Siw/G-9205-2016; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039",Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management,"We would like to thank Ashild Bye, John Andre Henden, Erik Isakson, Bjorn Hugo Kristoffersen, Arne Petter Sarre, Elin Skog and Alfred Orjebu for skilled help during field work.

Corophium volutator (Pallas), a burrowing amphipod abundant in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, frequently interacts with the eastern mudsnail, Ilyanassa obsoleta (Say), as both species utilize similar habitats and food resources. Typically these interactions result in negative effects on C. volutator. There is evidence that Corophium species exhibit avoidance behaviour when interacting with other species, but whether such a response occurs in the presence of I. obsoleta is unknown. To investigate C. volutator response to I. obsoleta. total C. volutator abundance and vertical distribution within the sediment was examined in a field experiment involving I. obsoleta enclosures and exclosures at two mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy. I. obsoleta densities were manipulated between June and August 2008 and their effects on C. volutator abundance and vertical distribution observed. Results varied between mudflats and C volutator size classes. At Peck's Cove, total C volutator abundance was largely unaffected by I. obsoleta. No size class exhibited a distribution shift in response to I. obsoleta, though both mid-sized individuals and adults occupied deeper layers of sediment late in the summer. Abundance of C. volutator in all size classes at Grande Anse was reduced in July in direct proportion to exposure to I. obsoleta, and adults occupied higher sediment layers in July when L obsoleta were excluded, suggesting that I. obsoleta curtailed use of these upper layers. juvenile abundance rebounded in August, possibly due to the mass dispersal of a newly produced juvenile cohort. Adults were reduced in all treatments in August, probably as a result of normal seasonal mortality. Differences in C. volutator responses between mudflats highlight the site-specific nature of such interactions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In gape-limited predators, body size asymmetries determine the outcome of predator-prey interactions. Due to ontogenetic changes in body size, the intensity of intra- and interspecific interactions may change rapidly between the match situation of a predator-prey system and the mismatch situation in which competition, including competition with the prey, dominates. 2. Based on a physiologically structured population model using the European perch (Perca fluviatilis), analysis was performed on how prey density (bream, Abramis brama), initial size differences in the young-of-the-year (YOY) age cohort of the predator, and phenology (time-gap in hatching of predator and prey) influence the size structure of the predator cohort. 3. In relation to the seasonality of reproduction, the match situation of the predator-prey system occurred when perch hatched earlier than bream and when no gape-size limitations existed, leading to decreased size divergence in the predator age cohort. Decreased size divergence was also found when bream hatched much earlier than perch, preventing perch predation on bream occurring, which, in turn, increased the competitive interaction of the perch with bream for the common prey, zooplankton; i.e. the mismatch situation in which also the mean size of the age cohort of the predator decreased. 4. In between the total match and the mismatch, however, only the largest individuals of the perch age cohort were able to prey on the bream, while smaller conspecifics got trapped in competition with each other and with bream for zooplankton, leading to enlarged differences in growth that increased size divergence. 5. The modelling results were combined with 7 years of field data in a lake, where large differences in the length-frequency distribution of YOY perch were observed after their first summer. These field data corroborate that phenology and prey density per predator are important mechanisms in determining size differences within the YOY age cohort of the predator. 6. The results demonstrate that the switch between competitive interactions and a predator-prey relationship depended on phenology. This resulted in pronounced size differences in the YOY age cohort, which had far-reaching consequences for the entire predator population.","[Borcherding, Jost; Beeck, Peter; Scharf, Werner R.] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Ecol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, Biol Resources Div, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, US Geol Survey, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Borcherding, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Ecol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",jost.borcherding@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG BO1507/5-1]; U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources DivisionUnited States Geological Survey","We gratefully acknowledge the help of Joscha Groddeck, Lisa Heermann, Martina Heynen, Stephanie Kiel, Ulrike Konig, Andreas Scharbert, Ralph Urbatzka and many volunteer helpers during the field sampling.

Little information is available on the importance of biotic interactions in shaping the communities in these habitats. A common observation in the freshwater rock pool community assembly process is the clearly separated density peaks of fairy shrimp (Anostraca) and cladocerans (Anomopoda) over time. Fairy shrimp (Anostraca), the flagship group and dominant filter feeders of temporary waters hatch early after inundation. This contrasts with the occurrence pattern of coexisting cladocerans, which despite higher chances of abortive hatching occur later during the hydroperiod. To study this apparent succession pattern and test the possible presence of a biotic interaction, we set up enclosure experiments in freshwater rock pools in Western Australia and monitored cladoceran (Macrothrix hardingii) densities in the presence of variable densities or absence of fairy shrimp (Branchinella longirostris). The anomopod cladoceran populations decreased with increasing anostracan densities revealing a negative biotic interaction. The competitive dominance of anostracans most probably was mainly due to exploitation competition, with possibly elements of interference competition or predation included. Early hatching and competitive superiority may help anostracans in temporary pools to monopolize the habitat with respect to small and/or other filter feeding invertebrates. As such they influence succession dynamics and invertebrate community structure, making anostracans keystone species of temporary pools.","[Jocque, M.; Vanschoenwinkel, B.; Brendonck, L.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Jocque, M (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Cent Lab Gen Ecol, 2 Yurii Gagarin St, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.",MerlijnJocque@gmail.com,"Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/I-9021-2019","Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/0000-0002-8973-6297; Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420",IWT (Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); Fund for scientific research Flanders (FWO)FWO [G.0118.03],"We thank David Angeler, Anne Robertson and an anonymous reviewer for suggestions to improve the manuscript.

Given their importance, shells are acquired and transferred between crabs through several modalities. We conducted observations and experiments at the Asinara Island (Sardinia, Italy) to investigate the efficacy of the different behavioral tactics adopted by the hermit crab Clibanarius erythropus to acquire shells, such as: (1) locomotion and activity at different tidal phases; (2) attendance at shell-supplying sites (simulated predation sites with five different odors: live and dead gastropods, live and dead crabs, predator); and (3) interactions with conspecifics in aggregations on simulated gastropod predation sites. In each tidal phase, locomotion was slow (0.7 cm min(-1)) and, as a consequence, the probability of encountering empty shells and conspecifics was low. Simulated gastropod predation sites quickly attracted a larger number of hermit crabs than the other sites tested. Aggregations seemed to function as shell exchange markets, as previously suggested for other species: the first attendant took the experimental shell and a chain of shell exchanges among conspecifics followed. Our results show that, in C erythropus, aggregation is the most efficient tactic for the acquisition of new shells, whereas in other species, such as Pagurus longicarpus, it is associated with exploitation ability due to the intense locomotion. The interspecific plasticity in hermit crabs' behavior is confirmed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the spatiotemporal distribution of the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the associated specialist and generalist predators Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus on bean plants. Tetranychus urticae is a key pest on numerous agricultural crops. Both predators are used singly and in combination for biological control of spider mites. Population development and within-plant distribution of the spider mites and the predators were compared among five treatments: T. urticae without predators, with either predator alone and with both predators in combination at full and half densities. The spider mites were suppressed to zero density in both predator combination treatments but not in the single predator treatments. The predators determined the spatiotemporal distribution of the spider mites through density- and behaviour-mediated effects, and these effects were linked to diet specialisation. The specialist P. persimilis exerted stronger density-mediated effects on the spider mite distribution than did the generalist N. californicus. Either predator induced in the spider mites early upward migration on plants. The predators also affected each other's distribution. The aggregation level of N. californicus was lowered by P. persimilis but not vice versa. In combination, the predators were more dispersed than when alone, reducing the predator-free space and leading to the local extinction of T. urticae.","[Walzer, A.; Schausberger, P.] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Appl Plant Sci & Plant Biotechnol, Inst Plant Protect, Vienna, Austria; [Moder, K.] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Vienna, Austria","Walzer, A (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Appl Plant Sci & Plant Biotechnol, Inst Plant Protect, Vienna, Austria.",andreas.walzer@boku.ac.at,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; European Community (CRAFT)European Commission,Andreas Walzer was financially supported by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the European Community (CRAFT).,,56,21,22,0,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-4853,,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

Decline of native anurans has been linked to possible competition with adult O. septentrionalis but interactions during the larval stage are largely unknown. Rearing O. septentrionalis tadpoles along with two native anurans, the Squirrel Treefrog (Hyla squirella) and the Southern Toad (Bufo terrestris) in both experimental artificial ponds and laboratory aquaria, the role of competition as the mechanism driving the dynamics of invaded amphibian communities in Florida was examined. Also examined was the role of priority effects and variation between pond locations in altering interactions between O. septentrionalis and native anuran larvae. Interspecific competition was strong during the larval stage; the presence of O. septentrionalis reduced larval performance and survival of native anurans. Pond location alone had little effect on interspecific interactions, but priority effects were strong. Pond location and priority effects acted together to influence species interactions. The selective influence of different interaction modifiers acted to increase or decrease the impacts of exotic species on native taxa.","[Knight, C.

Whilst the specific threats vary among species, problems such as introduced predators, loss of suitable nesting habitat and inter- and intra-specific competition for nest sites are common to many situations. This paper reports on an experiment to increase the availability of secure nest sites at a colony of Madeiran storm petrels breeding on an islet (free from introduced predators) in the Azores islands where there is evidence of interspecific competition. The provision of nest boxes that were designed to exclude larger species led to around a 12% increase in the size of the breeding population in the first year and a 28% increase over the original colony size in the second year. Over three seasons, the breeding success of storm petrels nesting in boxes averaged 2.9 times greater than that of birds at natural sites, despite their likely reproductive inexperience. The techniques presented here should serve as a model for conservation management of other burrowing procellariiform species in situations where colony size or breeding performance is believed to be constrained by nest site quality.

The effect of the removal of Timarcha lugens (Chrysomelidae), one of the main herbivores of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae), on the abundance of co-occurring phytophagous insects, the abundance of non-phytophagous arthropods (detritivores, predators, and parasitoids), and the structure and diversity of the entire arthropod community, was studied for 3 years (1999-2001). 2. There was competition between T. lugens and co-occurring herbivores; the removal of T. lugens was correlated with an increase in the abundance of sap-suckers, flower-feeders, and, above all, folivores. 3. Timarcha lugens also had an indirect effect on arthropods belonging to other trophic levels; the abundance of predators increased significantly after the removal of T. lugens . 4. Community composition was affected by the experimental removal. In addition, the diversity of the overall community increased after removal of T. lugens . 5. The study demonstrated experimentally that T. lugens has a significant effect not only on other species belonging to the same trophic level, but also on the abundance of species belonging to higher trophic levels, and, consequently, on the entire structure and diversity of the complex community in which it is immersed.","Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Gonzalez-Megias, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",bgyagm@leeds.ac.uk,"Megias, Adela Gonzalez/P-8974-2016; Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017","Megias, Adela Gonzalez/0000-0002-2292-9334; Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664",,,,49,22,25,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

In this study, I quantified the predator avoidance trait burst swim speed and related traits for 14 anuran species found in three pond types and within three taxonomic families. Absolute swim speed differed significantly among species and among taxonomic families. Inclusion of size in the model revealed a three-way interaction between size, habitat and taxonomic family. Tail beat frequency and body shape differed significantly among species, but with no pattern by family or habitat. Functional relationships among traits also did not differ among family by habitat groups. The evolution of swim speed was significantly correlated with the evolution of increased size.

Most successional theories focus on the rise to dominance, assuming demise is the result of competition, but other factors can cause differential mortality among species, including physical disturbance, senescence, and consumers. In rocky intertidal communities on the coast of Washington state, USA, gaps in mussel beds exhibit a succession from predator-susceptible to predator-resistant species following disturbance, suggesting that differential consumption by mobile species may play an important role in the demise of early succession species and the eventual dominance of the mussel Mytilus californianus. Experimental manipulation of a dominant species earlier in succession, the blue mussel Mytilus trossulus, demonstrated that this species inhibits the invasion of M. californianus in the absence of predators. Experimental manipulation of predatory snails (Nucella emarginata and Nucella canaliculata), which feed heavily on M. trossulus but not M. californianus, greatly increased the rate at which M. californianus invaded gaps. These results and those of other studies indicate that consumers frequently have important effects on the dynamics of succession in benthic marine systems, and might also play a role in other settings.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wootton, JT (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",twootton@uchicago.edu,"Wootton, J.

In a survey of 35 sites within the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, Nuttallia was found almost exclusively in sandy substrates, higher in the intertidal than most native clams (>1 m above mean lower low water). The distinctive distribution of Nuttallia suggested that tidal height and sediment composition may be important physical factors that control its refuge availability, regulating its exposure to predation and ultimately the success of its invasion. I tethered Nuttallia for 24 h in the high intertidal where it is typically found and in the low intertidal at an elevation where it was never found. Clams restrained to the surface suffered high mortality from crab predation at both tidal heights, whereas control clams with unrestricted burrowing movement exhibited high mortality rates only in the low intertidal. In a second experiment, I transplanted sediment within and between the two intertidal heights to measure effects of tidal height and sediment type on survival and burial depth of Nuttallia. At both tidal heights all clams placed on mud-cobble substrate, naturally common in the low intertidal, suffered high mortality rates (> 60% in 24 h). Nuttallia on loosely packed sand substrate, naturally found in the upper intertidal, survived much better, however, because they buried deeper than in the tightly packed mud. Caged control clams at both tidal heights suffered no mortality. Apparently native predators are mitigating community level impacts of an invader by excluding Nuttallia completely from some beaches with improper sediment characteristics or relegating it in others to a zone not often inhabited by native species, thereby reducing potential competitive interactions. These findings show that a physical habitat characteristic can mediate biotic resistance to an invader and thus control invasion success and community-level impacts. Generally, such physical-biological interactions may explain some of the reported site-to-site variability in invasion Success, as well as the patchy distribution of many soft-sediment infaunal species.","Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Lab, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Zool, Rudman Hall,46 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jebyers@cisunix.unh.edu,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,67,115,135,0,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2002,130,1,,,,,146,156,,10.1007/s004420100777,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,507MP,WOS:000173032500016,28547019,,,,2021-09-24,

We studied the spatial distribution of avian microtine predators using data from 19 study areas on the tundra of northern Siberia. 2. Numbers of snowy owls, and long-tailed skuas and pomarine skuas depended strongly on Iemming density. However, a significant relationship between lemming density and number of rough-legged buzzards appeared first after removal of the effect of snowy owl abundance on the distribution of rough-legged buzzards. 3. We applied a recently developed method (Manly 1995) to examine co-occurrences of species and found that rough-legged buzzards and snowy owls did not co-occur while snowy owls, long-tailed skuas and pomarine skuas did. 4. There are large differences in nest construction and chick behaviour between rough-legged buzzards and the three other species. Moreover, the snow owl is a polyphagous predator preying also on large birds including raptor chicks. Therefore, we propose that reduced risk of nest predation favours rough-legged buzzards nesting away from snowy owls. 5. Variations in abundance of the two lemming species did not seem to influence the distributions of snowy owls and rough-legged buzzards. Neither was it likely that latitudinally related factors such as breeding season length affected the distribution of rough-legged buzzards.","Gothenburg Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Anim Ecol, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Lund, Dept Anim Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Wiklund, CG (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Anim Ecol, Med Aregatan 18, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,"Wiklund, Christer G/0000-0003-3898-0289",,,,58,26,26,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Mosquito larvae are their most common prey. Holes colonized naturally by predators and prey had lower densities of mosquitoes if odonates were present than if they were absent. Using artificial tree holes placed in the field, we tested the effects of odonates on their mosquito prey while controlling for the quantity and species of predator, hole volume, and nutrient input. In large and small holes with low nutrient input, odonates depressed the number of mosquitoes present and the number that survived to pupation. Increasing nutrient input (and consequently, mosquito abundance) to abnormally high levels dampened the effect of predation when odonates were relatively small. However, the predators grew faster with higher nutrients, and large larvae in all three genera reduced the number of mosquitoes surviving to pupation, even though the abundance of mosquito larvae remained high. Size-selective predation by the odonates is a likely explanation for this result; large mosquito larvae were less abundant in the predator treatment than in the controls. Because species assemblages were similar between natural and artificial tree holes, our results suggest that odonates are keystone species in tree holes on BCI, where they are the most common large predators.",,"Fincke, OM (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA,DEPT ZOOL,NORMAN,OK 73019, USA.",,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136; Yanoviak, Stephen/0000-0001-6425-1413",,,,45,79,84,2,21,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1997,112,2,,,,,244,253,,10.1007/s004420050307,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YA693,WOS:A1997YA69300015,28307577,,,,2021-09-24,

This lake is sited outside the natural range of the ruffe and has a lower fish diversity and a different fish species composition than within its native range. From June through September the ruffe was planktivorous and mainly caught at 4 to 6 m depth in the benthic zone. At other times of year ruffe was feeding on zoobenthos and caught deeper in the benthic zone. Ruffe was mainly day active. Zooplankton feeding during summer is the dearest difference compared to ruffe populations living within its natural range. Presence of large zooplankton organisms available for ruffe is suggested as the main reason for the difference found in food choice. The availability of large zooplankton is probably due to community structure caused by a predator and lack of interspecific competition for zooplankton in the deeper parts of the lake. Piscivorous brown trout, Salmo trutta, restrict the habitat of threespined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to the zone of littoral vegetation, allowing high densities of larger zooplankton species like Bythotrephes longimanus to be present in the lake. Brown trout is present only in the upper light and well oxygenated parts of the lake, leaving a refuge for the ruffe, where they can feed on the rich zooplankton community.",,"KALAS, S (corresponding author), UNIV BERGEN,INST ZOOL,DEPT ANIM ECOL,ALLEGATEN 41,N-5007 BERGEN,NORWAY.",,,,,,,52,22,23,2,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

A series of eight shallow wells, four in patches of each grass type, was used to describe physicochemical conditions known to limit the distribution of both grasses. Tidal amplitude, surface and subsurface salinity, and subsurface oxidation-reduction potential were found to be within range, but suboptimal, for both grasses. Evidence of selective grazing upon S. alterniflora was found through examination of grazing sign within the grass patches, observations of feral horse feeding behavior, and examination of feral horse feces for grass epidermal fragments. An exclosure experiment simulated preferential grazing and showed that S. alternifora responded negatively while D. spicata responded positively to simulated preferential grazing of S. alterniflora. These results point to a competitive relationship between the grasses under suboptimal conditions for dominance of either species. Selective herbivory (analogous to predation) upon S. alterniflora was shown to be a plausible factor impacting the competitive relationship to favor D. spicata. Location along physical gradients, interspecies competition, and herbivory are discussed in relation to salt marsh plant communities.","UNIV MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, PRINCESS ANNE, MD 21853 USA","FURBISH, CE (corresponding author), ASSATEAGUE ISL NATL SEASHORE, 7206 NATL SEASHORE LANE, BERLIN, MD 21811 USA.",,,,,,,29,56,61,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1994,75,4,,,,,1015,1022,,10.2307/1939425,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NP103,WOS:A1994NP10300014,,,,,2021-09-24,

G. complanata breeds in advance of H. stagnalis and maintains a body size advantage throughout their annual life-cycle. In experiments, conducted at 14-degrees-C and a photoperiod of 16 hrs L: 8 hrs D, three size classes of leeches of each species were each exposed to each of three size classes of each of five prey species, viz. Tubifex sp., Chironomus sp., Asellus aquaticus, Lymnaea peregra and Potamopyrgus jenkinsi. For each prey species, three different types of experiments were performed: one leech exposed to four prey individuals; four leeches of the same species with sixteen prey; and two leeches of each species with sixteen prey. In the first experiment, all sizes of G. complanata were capable of feeding on all sizes of the prey types offered; the same was true for H. stagnalis with exceptions of feeding on large A. aquaticus and large L. peregra. For both species, but especially for G. complanata, there was a trend within each size class of leech for decreasing proportions of fed leeches with increasing prey size, and within each size class of prey for an increasing proportion of fed leeches with increasing leech size; however there were several exceptions to these trends. Both leeches fed extensively on Tubifex sp. but there were significant differences in the proportions feeding on other prey types; G. complanata fed more on A. aquaticus and the two snail species, and less on Chironomus, than H. stagnalis. The effect of increasing the number of leech individuals from one to four individuals, of the same or mixed species, had little effect on the proportion of leeches which had fed. It is concluded that large G. complanata will have access to large individuals of certain prey taxa denied H. stagnalis, which may lessen the intensity of interspecific competition.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,4,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN 21,1994,273,2,,,,,67,75,,10.1007/BF00006848,,,9,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,MX529,WOS:A1994MX52900001,,,,,2021-09-24,

When different species produce acoustic signals simultaneously, the signals create a noisy environment, with potential acoustic interference between species. Theoretical studies suggest that such reproductive interference may have strong effects on species interaction. For example, the inferior resource competitor can survive if its disadvantage is counterbalanced by superiority in reproductive interference. Two field cricket species, Teleogryllus occipitalis (Audinet-Serville) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) and Loxoblemmus equestris Saussure (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), cooccur in the same habitat. A previous study has shown that L. equestris is an inferior species to T. occipitalis in terms of resource competition. Therefore, we predicted that mate location and choice behavior of female T. occipitalis would be negatively affected by the acoustic signals of L. equestris and tested this with a series of playback experiments.The mate choice behavior of female T. occipitalis was not significantly affected by the calling song of L. equestris. Our results suggest that the acoustic interference does not explain the cooccurrence of the two species in the same habitat.","[Kuriwada, Takashi; Kawasaki, Rintaro; Kuwano, Akifumi] Kagoshima Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Sci Educ, Lab Zool, Korimoto 1-20-6, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Reddy, Gadi V.

In natural communities, however, other antagonists and symbionts moderate competition. Thus, we have to go beyond studying pairwise interactions. Natural enemies may facilitate coexistence if they affect the superior competitor more strongly, or they can hinder coexistence via apparent competition. Less well studied is the role of symbionts, which may influence species coexistence in conjunction with enemies. Eukaryotes commonly harbour microbial endosymbionts that provide protection against natural enemies, but are costly in their absence. Such defensive symbionts could thus mediate coexistence of species competing for the same resource, both in the presence and in the absence of enemies, but as yet there is little evidence for this claim. We addressed this proposed role of defensive symbionts in replicated simple communities consisting of two aphid species sharing the same host plant and the same natural enemy, a parasitoid wasp. Both, one, or neither species were infected with a resistance-conferring symbiont, and they competed in the absence as well as the presence of parasitoids. The symbiont had significant effects in the absence of parasitoids by lowering competitive ability especially in one species, but the effects were more dramatic in the presence of parasitoids. With both species protected by the symbiont, parasitoid densities remained low and both aphid species persisted. When neither species was protected, parasitoids drove both species to extinction. Surprisingly, the same outcome was observed when only one species was protected. The susceptible species supported high densities of parasitoids that also killed the resistant aphids via mechanisms other than parasitism, presumably by disturbing them to the point of starvation. This is an intriguing form of apparent competition. Our results demonstrate an important role of defensive symbionts in insect communities through modifying species interactions. This highlights the need for experimental data when studying species coexistence in competitive networks. Furthermore, the observation that a susceptible host can negatively affect a resistant host via a shared parasitoid is an instructive insight for biological control.","[Hertaeg, Corinne; Vorburger, Christoph] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Hertaeg, Corinne; Vorburger, Christoph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, D USYS, Zurich, Switzerland","Vorburger, C (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland.; Vorburger, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, D USYS, Zurich, Switzerland.",christoph.vorburger@eawag.ch,"Vorburger, Christoph/A-1650-2008; Hertaeg, Corinne/ABA-6078-2020","Vorburger, Christoph/0000-0002-3627-0841; Hertaeg, Corinne/0000-0002-2730-4042","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [CRSII3_154396, PP00P3_146341]","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: CRSII3_154396 and PP00P3_146341",,51,5,5,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Niche separation by means of exploitation or interference competition was investigated in two taxa of crop-inhabiting spiders that overlap in microhabitat use and have similar web design. Competition for prey and web sites was tested in microcosm experiments with the most common species that build sheet-webs: Enoplognatha gemina (Theridiidae) and Alioranus pastoralis (Linyphiidae). A field survey over the crop season provided data on spatial and temporal dispersion of Enoplognatha spp. (Theridiidae) and linyphiid spiders (Linyphiidae) and on availability of prey over the season. In the microcosm experiments, both taxa took springtails as prey, but only Enoplognatha fed on aphids. Differences in diet, however, could not be attributed to either exploitative or interference competition. Spatial separation of websites was attained by vertical displacement of webs in the vegetation (Enoplognatha) and by avoidance of patches occupied by conspecific or heterospecific individuals (linyphiids). In the field, densities of linyphiids and Enoplognatha were correlated negatively and webs were over-dispersed relative to a random distribution. Both taxa colonized the field at the start of the season; linyphiids colonized as adults, quickly reproduced, and had a second adult peak; Enoplognatha matured in the middle of the season and their numbers remained fairly constant over the season. The combined experimental manipulations and field data suggest that niche separation occurs at different scales. The hypothesis of competition for websites was partially supported, while prey preference (or tolerance) and temporal differences in life history stages also may explain the negative correlations between densities of the two taxa.","[Opatovsky, Itai] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Opatovsky, Itai] Reg Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Southern Branch Besor, IL-85400 Besor, Israel; [Gavish-Regev, Efrat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Natl Nat Hist Collect, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel; [Weintraub, Phyllis G.] Agr Res Org, Dept Entomol, IL-85280 Gilat Res Ctr, Israel; [Lubin, Yael] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Opatovsky, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.; Opatovsky, I (corresponding author), Reg Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Southern Branch Besor, IL-85400 Besor, Israel.",itaiopa6@gmail.com,"Lubin, Yael D/F-1382-2012","Lubin, Yael D/0000-0003-3876-1668; Weintraub, Phyllis/0000-0003-0661-9499",Ministry of AgricultureGida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi [857-0578-09]; JNF (Emilio Sacerdote fund) [02-4682]; Sigma Xi; Ben-Gurion University,"We thank Z.

Larval amphibians are model organisms to investigate the balancing of life history trade-offs because individuals must metamorphose before a wetland dries. Therefore, we deployed enclosures in a natural wetland to investigate the interactive effects of Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) density (50 or 100 tadpoles) and Brook Stickleback (Culaea inconstans) presence on survival and growth of tadpoles. We hypothesized that the effects of conspecific density on tadpole survival and growth would be dependent on the presence of fish predators. Stickleback predation significantly decreased Wood Frog survival; however, a trend of higher tadpole survival with fish was detected at high conspecific densities. Wood Frog time to and mass at metamorphosis was not significantly affected by either conspecific density or stickleback presence. Our results demonstrate that Brook Sticklebacks can play a significant role in regulating Wood Frog survival in a Subarctic wetland, but the impact is likely dependent on tadpole density. Therefore, this research highlights the dynamic and complex effects of competition and predation in a Subarctic wetland. Our study also contributes to the limited understanding of factors affecting amphibian community structure in Subarctic wetlands.","[Davenport, Jon M.] Southeast Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, One Univ Plaza, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA; [Seiwert, Phillip A.; Ben Cash, W.] Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Biol, 201 Donaghey Ave, Conway, AR 72035 USA; [Fishback, LeeAnn] Churchill Northern Studies Ctr, POB 610, Churchill, MB R0B 0E0, Canada","Davenport, JM (corresponding author), Southeast Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, One Univ Plaza, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA.",jdavenport@semo.edu; pseiwert1@uca.edu; fishback@churchillscience.ca; wbcash@uca.edu,"Davenport, Jon M/AAG-8457-2020","Davenport, Jon M/0000-0002-9911-2779",CNSC; Earthwatch Institute; University of Central Arkansas,"We thank Earthwatch Institute participants from the summer of 2013 and D.

However, lack of knowledge of the indirect consequences of invasions, combined with poor understanding of how their ecological effects depend upon competitive attributes of the receiving community, hinders our ability to manage and predict the effects of invasive species on ecosystems. We established an experiment using a combination of both additive and substitutive experimental designs to explore the effects of the globally spreading mysid shrimp Hemimysis anomala on the biological structure of outdoor pond mesocosms in the absence and presence of a functionally similar native competitor, Mysis salemaai. The naturally smaller H.anomala had considerably stronger effects on primary producers, multiple aspects of consumer assemblages and overall biological structure of the ponds in comparison with the functionally similar native. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects was generally independent of the presence of M.salemaai and even total mysid density. Hemimysis anomala reduced both the abundance and diversity of zooplankton assemblages significantly, triggering a strong trophic cascade on phytoplankton and a simultaneous increase of benthic invertebrate biomass. These findings indicate that invasion by H.anomala may exacerbate the effects of nutrient enrichment on lakes. Our results demonstrate that introduced species can, irrespective of the presence of functionally similar natives, induce complex changes to ecosystems that reach beyond direct consumptive effects. Moreover, the cascading indirect effects of invasion can exacerbate the impacts of other stressors. Disregarding the complexity of indirect effects therefore risks underestimating significantly the global ecological footprint of biological invasions.","[Penk, Marcin; Irvine, Kenneth; Donohue, Ian] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Irvine, Kenneth] UNESCO IHE Inst Water & Educ, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Donohue, Ian] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Trinity Ctr Biodivers Res, Dublin 2, Ireland","Penk, M (corresponding author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",penkm@tcd.ie,"Donohue, Ian/A-7270-2010; Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013","Donohue, Ian/0000-0002-4698-6448; Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991; Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064","Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [ECS/2009/01, GOIPD/2014/129]; Ecological Consultancy Services Limited","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments, which helped to improve the quality of the manuscript.

Knowledge about the ecology of A. rubens in these highly seasonal systems is largely limited to studies of interspecific competition for prey. Two experiments in an oscillatory wave tank were used to test the hypothesis that wave action and starvation modulate displacement, microhabitat selection, and ability to contact mussel (Mytilus edulis) prey in A. rubens from southeastern Newfoundland. Both experiments were carried out in two seasons (winter and summer) to quantify intra-annual variation in the effects of wave action (three wave velocities: null [0.0 m s(-1)], low [0.1 m s(-1)], and high [0.2 m s(-1)]) and starvation (two levels: fed and starved three weeks). Experiment 1, in which two sea stars were allowed to displace and make contact with six microhabitats typifying natural seabed heterogeneity, showed that A. rubens displaced up to 50% less with increasing wave velocity. Displacement was 120% higher in summer than winter and lower in starved than fed individuals in summer only. The sea star predominantly stayed on flat horizontal surfaces, did so more frequently in the presence than absence of waves, and spent more time in the two most uneven microhabitats in winter than summer regardless of wave velocity. Experiment 2, in which one sea star in the centre of a depression was allowed to move to the top of surrounding mounds, showed that more sea stars that left the centre of the depression reached the top of the mounds in summer than winter, in the absence than presence of waves, and when starved than fed. Sea stars that reached the top of mounds spent more time there in the presence than absence of mussels in summer only, when starved than fed in summer only, and in the presence than absence of mussels at null and low wave velocities. Measurements of wave height, sea temperature, and A. rubens abundance over six months at one subtidal site indicated that the sea star was >4 times more abundant at 8 m than at 2 m and 4 m. This difference was unrelated to temperature and likely mainly caused by the wave environment. Collectively, results demonstrate that wave action, and to a lesser extent starvation, are key modulators of the inclination and ability of A. rubens to explore its environment and localize prey. In southeastern Newfoundland, the response of A. rubens to wave action and starvation is adaptable, being generally stronger in summer than winter, when sea temperature is markedly lower.

The effects of phenology on species interactions are especially pronounced in aquatic systems, but the evidence is largely derived from experimental studies. We examined whether differences in breeding phenology between two pond-breeding salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum and A. maculatum) affected metamorph recruitment and demographic traits within natural populations, with the expectation that the fall-breeding A. annulatum would negatively affect the spring-breeding A. maculatum. We monitored populations of each species at five ponds over 4 years using drift fences. Metamorph abundance and survival of A. annulatum were affected by intra- and interspecific processes, whereas metamorph size and date of emigration were primarily influenced by intraspecific effects. Metamorph abundance, snout-vent length, date of emigration and survival for A. maculatum were all predicted by combinations of intra- and interspecific effects, but often showed negative relationships with A. annulatum metamorph traits and abundance. Size and date of metamorphosis were strongly correlated within each species, but in opposite patterns (negative for A. annulatum and positive for A. maculatum), suggesting that the two species use alternative strategies to enhance terrestrial survival and that these factors may influence their interactions. Our results match predictions from experimental studies that suggest recruitment is influenced by intra- and interspecific processes which are determined by phenological differences between species. Incorporating spatiotemporal variability when modeling population dynamics is necessary to understand the importance of phenology in species interactions, especially as shifts in phenology occur under climate change.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Conner, Christopher A.; Osbourn, Michael S.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Hocking, Daniel J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Earl, Julia E.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Harper, Elizabeth B.] Paul Smiths Coll, Div Nat Resource Management & Ecol, Paul Smiths, NY 12970 USA; [Peterman, William E.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Rittenhouse, Tracy A.

For example, altered predator-prey interactions may influence the dynamics of trophic cascades, affecting net primary production. In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated a plant-grasshopper-spider food chain in mesic tallgrass prairie to investigate the effects of temperature and food quality on grasshopper performance, and to understand the direct and indirect tritrophic interactions that contribute to trophic cascades. Because spiders are active at cooler temperatures than grasshoppers in our system, we hypothesized that predator effects would be strongest in cooled treatments, and weakest in warmed treatments. Grasshopper spider interactions were highly context-dependent and varied significantly with food quality, temperature treatment and year. Spiders most often reduced grasshopper survival in the cooled and ambient temperature treatments, but had little to no effect on grasshopper survival in the warmed treatments, as hypothesized. In some years, plants compensated for grasshopper herbivory and trophic cascades were not observed despite significant effects of predators on grasshopper survival. However, in the year they were observed, trophic cascades only occurred in cooled treatments where predator effects on grasshoppers were strongest. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change will require an understanding of how temperature influences species interactions. Our results demonstrate that changes in daily temperature regimes can alter predator-prey interactions among arthropods with consequences for ecosystem processes such as primary production and the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes.","[Laws, Angela Nardoni; Joern, Anthony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Laws, AN (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",alaws@ksu.edu,,,NSF Kansas EPSCoR Ecological Forecasting Consortium; Kansas State Univ.

Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"Research was funded through the Australian Research Council.

However, an important question is whether it is adaptive. Most models for plasticity in life-history timing predict that animals, once they have reached the minimal nutritional threshold under poor conditions, will accelerate development or time to reproduction. Adaptive delays in reproduction are not common, especially in short-lived species. Examples of adaptive reproductive delays exist in mammalian populations experiencing strong interspecific (e.g., predation) and intraspecific (e.g., infanticide) competition. But are there other environmental factors that may trigger an adaptive delay in reproductive timing? We show that the short-lived flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis will delay reproduction under nutrient-poor conditions, even though it has already met the minimal nutritional threshold for reproduction. We test whether this delay strategy is an adaptive response allowing the scavenger time to locate more resources by experimentally providing supplemental protein pulses (early, mid and late) throughout the reproductive delay period. Flies receiving additional protein produced more and larger eggs, demonstrating a benefit of the delay. In addition, by tracking the allocation of carbon from the pulses using stable isotopes, we show that flies receiving earlier pulses incorporated more carbon into eggs and somatic tissue than those given a later pulse. These results indicate that the reproductive delay in S. crassipalpis is consistent with adaptive post-threshold plasticity, a nutritionally linked reproductive strategy that has not been reported previously in an invertebrate species.","[Wessels, Frank J.; Kristal, Ross; Netter, Fleta; Hahn, Daniel A.] Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hatle, John D.] Univ N Florida, Dept Biol, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA","Wessels, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, POB 110621, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",fwessels@ufl.edu,"Hahn, Daniel A/B-6971-2012",,Florida State Agricultural Experiment Station;  [NSF-IOS-641505]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R15AG028512] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,We thank Jason Curtis for his insight and assistance in processing our stable isotope samples.

One strategy employed by carnivores to minimize potentially costly interspecific competition is avoidance of dominant species. Recent research has highlighted the importance of consistent individual differences in behavior (i.e. temperament traits) in understanding behavioral variation during predator-prey interactions and intraspecific interactions. However, the importance of such individual differences to interspecific competition has received little attention. Here, we examined the responses of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) to their primary competitors, African lions (Panthera leo), to (1) determine whether hyenas avoid lions and (2) evaluate the potential importance of individual differences in behavior during interspecific competition. Spotted hyenas and lions co-occur throughout much of Africa and are vigorous competitors. Whereas lions sometimes kill hyenas and steal their food, lions also represent a source of food for hyenas via scavenging. Using audio playback experiments, we found that hyenas do not uniformly avoid potential encounters with lions. Indeed, we noted considerable variation among individuals in their responses to lion roars, and this variation reflected consistent individual differences in risk-taking and vigilance tendencies. Individual differences in vigilance behavior were specific to interactions with lions. We conclude that individual differences in behavior have the potential to play an important role in determining the nature and outcome of interspecific competition.","[Watts, Heather E.; Blankenship, Lisa M.; Dawes, Stephanie E.; Holekamp, Kay E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Watts, HE (corresponding author), Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",hwatts1@lmu.edu,"Holekamp, Kay E/G-6054-2010",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN0113170, IBN0343381, IOB0618022, IOS0819437]; Michigan State University","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (IBN0113170, IBN0343381, IOB0618022, and IOS0819437) and Michigan State University.

The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of post-metamorphic green frogs (Rana clamitans) on post-metamorphic American toads (Bufo americanus) in the terrestrial environment as a model for understanding how interspecific differences in size at metamorphosis may influence terrestrial interactions. We examined if caged, uncaged or no green frogs affected survival, growth and hiding behavior of recently metamorphosed American toads in a replicated laboratory experiment. Green frogs did not appear to prey upon small American toads. However, by the end of the experiment American toad survival was lowest in treatments with uncaged green frogs; this result suggests that green frogs may outcompete American toads for food, but such impacts in nature may be limited or may have selected for spatial segregation in the terrestrial environment. Green frogs also increased hiding activity of toads at sonic times, which may in part explain the trend of reduced mass gained when toads were reared with green frogs. Thus study represents one of the first to examine interspecific interactions among anurans with complex life cycles in the terrestrial environment.","[Sams, Erin; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Boone, MD (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 212 Pearson Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",boonemd@muohio.edu,,,Miami University,"We thank M.

We conducted a field experiment in western Finland to evaluate the relative roles of these mechanisms in inducing spatial synchrony among cyclic populations of field voles Microtus agrestis. The study was conducted during the increase and peak phases of a vole population cycle on four agricultural field sites situated 1.5-7.0 km apart. Each field contained two 0.5-ha fenced enclosures and one 1-ha unfenced control area. One enclosure per field allowed access by small mustelid predators and the other by avian predators; all enclosures prevented the dispersal of voles. The unfenced control areas allowed access by all predators as well as dispersal by voles. Enclosed vole populations were in a treatment-wise asynchronous phase before the predator access treatments were applied. The growth rates of all enclosed populations were tightly synchronized during the course of the experiment. Conversely, synchrony both among the unfenced populations and between the fenced and unfenced populations was practically non-existent. During winter, in the increase phase of the cycle, vole populations in all treatments declined to low densities due to a seasonal effect of winter food depletion. During summer, in the peak year of the vole cycle, all populations fluctuated in synchrony. At this time, both small mustelids and birds of prey appeared to be abundant enough to induce synchrony. Dispersal was identified as a potential contributor to synchronization, but the magnitude of its effects could not be reliably discerned. Our results indicate that no single mechanism can account for the observed patterns of spatial synchrony among cyclic northern vole populations. Rather, spatial synchronization is induced by different mechanisms, namely seasonality and predation, acting successively during different seasons and phases of the vole cycle.","Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",ohuitu@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,83,25,26,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2005,109,3,,,,,583,593,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13476.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907MO,WOS:000227722400017,,,,,2021-09-24,

Such complexity makes it difficult to discern the mechanisms generating community structure. In this paper we review concepts and issues related to linking functional and community studies while also including greater complexity into the experimental realm. These principles are primarily illustrated with case studies involving predation ecology in a freshwater snail-fish-crayfish model system. The system illustrates how predator impacts on prey are mediated by multiple prey traits, correlations between traits, functional trade-offs in predator defence, interactions between predators, and interactions with other community members. We argue for a pluralistic approach to investigating mechanisms of community structure; that is, an approach that integrates many subdisciplines of ecology and evolution. We discuss four main areas that when used together yield important insights on community structure. First, selection gradient analyses formally link functional and community ecology. This formalisation is shown to help identify targets of selection, estimate environment-specific mortality rates, and identify agents of selection in complex communities. Second, we encourage increased focus on emergent community properties (results not predicted based on pairwise species interactions). Third, we emphasise that a community, rather than a web of species interactions, may more profitably be viewed as a network of trait interactions. This trait-centred view makes clear how indirect community effects arise between species that do not interact physically. This perspective also leads to our fourth topic, the integration of phenotypes. Just as populations evolve co-adapted suites of traits, so too should individuals embody integrated trait correlations, termed 'trait integration', rather than randomly assembled collections of phenotypes. All the perspectives mentioned above suggest that investigations should focus on multiple traits and multiple environments simultaneously, rather than singular, atomised components of complex systems.

I studied prey type and predator size-prey size relationships of these snakes in four swamp-forest areas of southeastern Nigeria (West Africa): only N. fuliginoides was found in two of these areas, whereas both species were common in the other two areas. The feeding ecology of N. fuliginoides shifted greatly in the presence of its potential competitor, N. variegata, in terms of prey-type preferences and predatory behaviour as well as in terms of predator size-prey size relationships. In particular, the effects of the potential competitor on the feeding ecology of N. fuliginoides were (i) a shift toward eating many invertebrates from a diet based on many small vertebrates, (ii) a shift toward eating many terrestrial organisms from a diet based on many aquatic organisms, and (iii) a shift in mean prey size for females toward relatively larger prey from a diet based on smaller prey. The resulting effect was a clear partitioning of food resources between the two predator species in both the areas where they are sympatric, whereas N. fuliginoides had a wider dietary spectrum (covering that of the two species together) in the areas where its competitor is not found. The role of intraspecific competition seems less strong, as no apparent resource partitioning in prey type or prey size was observed between males and females of either species or in any study area. However, mean prey size was significantly greater for females than for males of both species and in all study areas, but depended on the significant reverse sexual size dimorphism observed in both species.","Italian Fdn Vertebrate Zool Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Inst Environm Studies Demetra, I-00139 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Italian Fdn Vertebrate Zool Ecol, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,39,29,30,0,7,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Two recent reviews have compared the performances of different measures of interaction strength using simulations. The goal of obtaining measures of interaction strength is based on the premise that such measures will achieve a closer connection between theory and experiment in community ecology. The present article disputes this premise. Because interactions are typically nonlinear, single numerical measures are generally poor characterizations. Typically, the functional dependencies of growth rates on population densities are unknown. Lacking more information about the form of these functions, the results of most population manipulations make very limited contributions to the construction of dynamic models of communities. Even if all effects of population, densities on per capita growth rates were linear, performing all possible removal experiments will frequently fail to identify the constants of proportionality. Many misconceptions about the meaning and measurement of interaction coefficient persist. More extensive natural history observations and use of more flexible short-term experiments are advocated as approaches that will aid in constructing mathematical models of interspecific interactions.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M6R 2V6, Canada","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M6R 2V6, Canada.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,45,96,98,3,57,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2001,94,2,,,,,209,218,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.940201.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,475PM,WOS:000171173200001,,,,,2021-09-24,

We examined behavioral interactions between two coexisting, migratory wood warblers that competitively interact on breeding territories in central Arizona, USA. The larger Orange-crowned Warbler (Vermivora celata) is aggressive toward the later-arriving Virginia's Warbler (V. virginiae) and responds to playback of Virginia's Warbler songs by approaching the playback speaker or by singing over Virginia's Warbler songs. Virginia's Warblers retreat from interactions with Orange-crowned Warblers and avoid the playback speaker when presented with Orange-crowned Warbler songs. Responses of both species to song playback of the opposite species differed from responses to conspecific songs, indicating that behavioral interactions do not result from misdirected intraspecific aggression. Behavioral responses were consistent with observed ecological interactions between the two species and suggest that asymmetrical behavioral aggression by the dominant Orange-crowned Warbler may be an important mechanism for competitive interactions involving nest sites. These results support previous studies that have used behavioral experiments to infer ecological interactions among coexisting species. While Orange-crowned Warblers may benefit from aggressively excluding Virginia's Warblers from preferred nest sites, limited data on Virginia's Warbler settlement patterns suggest that Virginia's Warblers do not avoid settling on Orange-crowned Warbler territories. Similar reproductive success in sympatric vs, allopatric habitats suggests little consequence for Virginia's Warblers settling with Orange-crowned Warblers, despite increased reproductive success of Virginia's Warblers in sympatric habitat when Orange-crowned Warblers were experimentally removed.","Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div,Avian Studies Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div,Avian Studies Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867",,,,43,81,83,1,41,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2001,82,1,,,,,207,218,,10.2307/2680097,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393UN,WOS:000166488200017,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

We examine processes regulating the structure of tidepool communities for comparison with emergent substrata. The physical environment of tidepools is highly regulated by the tidal cycle, although fluctuations in physical factors are smaller in tidepools, and the organisms remain submerged for the entire tidal cycle. As a result, the upper limits of the distribution of organisms are extended in tidepools and some species either tend to aggregate in pools or avoid them. The vertical zonation of organisms is not as pronounced in tidepools as on emergent substrata. Herbivory has been shown to influence the distribution and abundance of algal species in tidepools, but the effect of predation in regulating community structure has been less well documented. The importance of interspecific competition has been consistently shown in tidepools, particularly among algal species, which usually are the dominant space occupiers. Although the introduction of most species into tidepools depends upon recruitment from the surrounding water, the effects of variation in the supply of new individuals has not been examined. Aspects of the physical regime such as habitat complexity and wave exposure affect the community structure of tidepools, as they do communities on emergent substrata. However, the specific characteristics of tidepools such as pool depth, volume, orientation, shading and flushing rate make individual pools unique, resulting in large spatial variability in tidepool community structure. For this reason, replication in tidepool studies should be carefully selected. Because of their variable characteristics, well-defined boundaries and tidepools of manageable size can serve as experimental mesocosms to test general ecological theories about community organization.",,"METAXAS, A (corresponding author), DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, HALIFAX B3H 4J1, NS, CANADA.",,,,,,,140,149,155,1,124,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Populations of many extant forest bird species continue to be depredated by mammals, especially rats, possums, and mustelids. The management history of New Zealand's forests over the past 50 years presents a unique opportunity because a varied program of mammalian predator control has created a replicated management experiment. We conducted a meta-analysis of population-level responses of forest birds to different levels of mammal control recorded across New Zealand. We collected data from 32 uniquely treated sites and 20 extant bird species representing a total of 247 population responses to 3 intensities of invasive mammal control (zero, low, and high). The treatments varied from eradication of invasive mammals via ground-based techniques to periodic suppression of mammals via aerially sown toxin. We modeled population-level responses of birds according to key life history attributes to determine the biological processes that influence species' responses to management. Large endemic species, such as the Kaka (Nestor meridionalis) and New Zealand Pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae), responded positively at the population level to mammal control in 61 of 77 cases for species >= 20 g compared with 31 positive responses from 78 cases for species <20 g. The Fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa) and Grey Warbler (Gerygone igata), both shallow endemic species, and 4 nonendemic species (Blackbird [Turdus merula], Chaffinch [Fringilla coelebs], Dunnock [Prunella modularis], and Silvereye [Zosterops lateralis]) that arrived in New Zealand in the last 200 years tended to have slight negative or neutral responses to mammal control (59 of 77 cases). Our results suggest that large, deeply endemic forest birds, especially cavity nesters, are most at risk of further decline in the absence of mammal control and, conversely suggest that 6 species apparently tolerate the presence of invasive mammals and may be sensitive to competition from larger endemic birds.","[Fea, Nyree; Hartley, Stephen] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Linklater, Wayne] Calif State Univ Sacramento, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA","Fea, N (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",nyree.fea@gmail.com,"Hartley, Stephen/A-2794-2008","Hartley, Stephen/0000-0002-9049-5072; Fea, Nyree/0000-0001-5335-5209; Linklater, Wayne/0000-0003-2627-693X",Holdsworth Charitable Trust [80759-2268],"N.F. collected the data, contacted project managers, and led the analysis and writing of the manuscript.

One possible mechanism thereby is resource partitioning, where each species utilizes a distinct subset of the most limited resource. This resource partitioning is difficult to investigate using empirical research in nature, as only few species are primarily limited by solely one resource, rather than a combination of multiple factors. One exception are the shell-dwelling hermit crabs, which are known to be limited under natural conditions and in suitable habitats primarily by the availability of gastropod shells. In the present study, we used two co-occurring terrestrial hermit crab species, Coenobita rugosus and C. perlatus, to investigate how resource partitioning is realized in nature and whether it could be a driver of coexistence. Results Field sampling of eleven separated hermit crab populations showed that the two co-occurring hermit crab species inhabit the same beach habitat but utilize a distinct subset of the shell resource. Preference experiments and principal component analysis of the shell morphometric data thereby revealed that the observed utilization patterns arise out of different intrinsic preferences towards two distinct shell shapes. While C. rugosus displayed a preference towards a short and globose shell morphology, C. perlatus showed preferences towards an elongated shell morphology with narrow aperture. Conclusion The two terrestrial hermit crab species occur in the same habitat but have evolved different preferences towards distinct subsets of the limiting shell resource. Resource partitioning might therefore be the main driver of their ecological differentiation, which ultimately allowed these co-occurring species to coexist in their environment. As the preferred shell morphology of C. rugosus maximizes reproductive output at the expense of protection, while the preferred shell morphology of C. perlatus maximizes protection against predation at the expense of reproductive output, shell resource partitioning might reflect different strategies to respond to the same set of selective pressures occurring in beach habitats. This work offers empirical support for the competitive exclusion principle-hypothesis and demonstrates that hermit crabs are an ideal model organism to investigate resource partitioning in natural populations.","[Laforsch, Christian] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; BayCEER, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Laforsch, C (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",christian.laforsch@uni-bayreuth.de,"Steibl, Sebastian/ABE-8074-2020","Steibl, Sebastian/0000-0003-4819-8581",Max Weber-Programm-scholarship,"Financial support for accommodation during the field study by the Max Weber-Programm-scholarship.

The distribution of the introduced calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the upper San Francisco Estuary (SFE) shifted from brackish to fresh water in 1993 following the introductions of 2 brackish-water copepods, the small but numerically dominant Limnoithona tetraspina (Cyclo poida) and the predatory Acartiella sinensis (Calanoida). The nearly simultaneous timing of these introductions complicated interpretation of the temporal change in distribution of P. forbesi. Although P. forbesi is now uncommon at salinity >similar to 2, which might be interpreted as the result of salinity stress, short-term experiments showed high survival of adults up to salinity similar to 8 and of nauplii to salinity of at least 14, and reproduction was highest at salinity 5. Feeding experiments showed some overlap in diets of P. forbesi and L. tetraspina, but P. forbesi consumed a broader range of prey than L. tetraspina. Furthermore, feeding rates of the L. tetraspina population appeared insufficient to reduce prey availability to P. forbesi. Previous reports of high consumption of nauplii by A. sinensis and the clam Potamocorbula amurensis suggest that these interspecific interactions are important in constraining the distribution of P. forbesi in the upper SFE. Thus, we interpret the temporal shift in distribution of P. forbesi as due mainly to the introduction of the predatory copepod, whose high abundance may have been facilitated by the availability of a common alternative prey, L. tetraspina.","[Kayfetz, Karen] Delta Stewardship Council, Delta Sci Program, 980 9th St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Kimmerer, Wim] San Francisco State Univ, Romberg Tiburon Ctr Environm Studies, 3152 Paradise Dr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA","Kayfetz, K (corresponding author), Delta Stewardship Council, Delta Sci Program, 980 9th St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA.",karen.kayfetz@deltacouncil.ca.gov,,"Kayfetz, Karen/0000-0003-3236-4469",U.S. Dept. of Interior agreement [R10AC20074],"We thank A.

Competition for limiting resources is a fundamental and well-established driver of niche partitioning, which in turn promotes species coexistence and biodiversity. Although contests are a well-known behavioural mechanism by which organisms compete over limiting resources, there has been surprisingly little application of contest theory to understanding interspecific interactions, niche partitioning, species coexistence and biodiversity. 2. We investigated the link between contest dynamics and community structure using two intertidal rockpool fishes, Bathygobius cocosensis (Gobiidae) and Lepidoblennius haplodactylus (Tripterygiidae), as model species. We assessed the abundance and distribution of the two species on intertidal rocky shores of South-East Australia, and whether distribution patterns were related to abiotic variables. We then conducted interspecific contest experiments between pairs of B. cocosensis and L. haplodactylus of varying size and sex under high and low dissolved oxygen levels to assess the competitive dominance of the species. To relate these results to community structure, we quantified temporal patterns of rockpool fidelity of each species in situ. 3. Field surveys revealed that B. cocosensis was most prevalent in rockpools with higher dissolved oxygen, and L. haplodactylus was most prevalent in rockpools that contained no B. cocosensis. Contest experiments revealed that B. cocosensis displayed higher resource holding power than L. haplodactylus regardless of size asymmetry, sex or dissolved oxygen concentration, although contest intensity was influenced by relative body size of competing individuals. Furthermore, the microhabitat preference of L. haplodactylus was modulated in the presence of B. cocosensis. In the field, B. cocosensis displayed higher rockpool fidelity than L. haplodactylus. 4. In light of these findings, we propose that B. cocosensis is the superior competitor but persistence of both species is likely facilitated by low-cost contest resolution strategies, plasticity in microhabitat preference, negative spatial co-variation and interspecific variation in dispersal and corresponding home range sizes. 5. By using contest theory to understand the dynamics of interspecific contests, insight has been gained into how habitat is partitioned, species coexist and ultimately how biodiversity is maintained.","[Paijmans, Kai C.; Wong, Marian Y.

Dominant ant species are known to determine the structure of ant communities by interfering in the foraging of other ant species. Using bait and pitfall trapping experiments, we performed a pattern analysis at a fine spatial scale of an ant community in a very simplified and homogeneous agroecosystem, that is, a single-crop banana field in Martinique (French West Indies). We found that the community structure was driven by three dominant species (Solenopsis geminata, Nylanderia guatemalensis, and Monomorium ebeninum) and two subdominant species (Pheidole fallax and Brachymyrmex patagonicus). Our results showed that dominant and subdominant species generally maintained numerical dominance at baits across time, although S. geminata, M. ebeninum, and B. patagonicus displayed better abilities to maintain dominance than P. fallax and N. guatemalensis. Almost all interspecific correlations between species abundances, except those between B. patagonicus and N. guatemalensis, were symmetrically negative, suggesting that interference competition prevails in this ground-dwelling ant community. However, we observed variations in the diurnal and nocturnal foraging activity and in the daily occurrence at baits, which may mitigate the effect of interference competition through the induction of spatial and temporal niche partitioning. This may explain the coexistence of dominant, subdominant, and subordinate species in this very simplified agroecosystem, limited in habitat structure and diversity.","[Carval, Dominique; Cotte, Violaine; Resmond, Remi; Perrin, Benjamin] CIRAD, UPR GECO, Le Lamentin, Martinique, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CIRAD, UPR GECO, Montpellier, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CATIE, Dept Agr & Agroforesteria, Turrialba, Costa Rica","Carval, D (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR GECO, Le Lamentin, Martinique, France.",dominique.carval@cirad.fr,"Tixier, Philippe/C-2119-2008","Tixier, Philippe/0000-0001-5147-9777; Carval, Dominique/0000-0002-1525-2855; Resmond, Remi/0000-0003-4805-9688",CIRAD; E.U.

Previous studies have suggested that the reason for the fragmented distribution pattern of E. depressa is competitive displacement by the sympatric C. stellatus, following random settlement. This hypothesis is in agreement with the common model of zonation suggested by Connell that lower distribution limits are determined by biotic factors (competition and predation), while upper limits are set by physical factors. It is hard to test the validity of this model for this barnacle pair since the early ontogenetic stages of the species are morphologically indistinguishable, hindering our ability to understand distribution processes. Using 16S mtDNA as a genetic marker in a multiplex PCR system, cyprids and spats were individually identified. Settlement and recruitment rates were assessed using settlement plates, and the effect of post-settlement processes was tested with transplantation of settlers between zones. Results showed different strategies in each species: settlement of E. depressa was habitat-specific, while settlement of C. stellatus was random. Shifting individuals of C stellatus to the high and cryptic zones resulted in high mortality; however, exposing juveniles of E. depressa that settled in artificially cryptic low shore habitat to C stellatus presence had no effect on their survival. These finding do not agree with the formerly suggested hypothesis that zonation is mainly determined by post-settlement factors, and that the interspecies boundary is determined by interspecific competition, implying that competition model cannot be adapted to Mediterranean intertidal zonation and that other models, dominated by physical enforcement and pre-settlement recruitment-limiting factors, may prevail in this ecosystem.

Interannual variation in seasonal weather patterns causes shifts in the relative timing of phenological events of species within communities, but we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of how these phenological shifts affect species interactions. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to predicting how interannual variation affects populations and communities. 2. Species' phenologies, particularly the timing of offspring arrival, play an important role in the annual cycles of community assembly. We hypothesize that shifts in relative arrival of off-spring can alter interspecific interactions through a mechanism called size-mediated priority effects (SMPE), in which individuals that arrive earlier can grow to achieve a body size advantage over those that arrive later. 3. In this study, we used an experimental approach to isolate and quantify the importance of SMPE for species interactions. Specifically, we simulated shifts in relative arrival of the nymphs of two dragonfly species to determine the consequences for their interactions as intraguild predators. 4. We found that shifts in relative arrival altered not only predation strength but also the nature of predator-prey interactions. When arrival differences were great, SMPE allowed the early arriver to prey intensely upon the late arriver, causing exclusion of the late arriver from nearly all habitats. As arrival differences decreased, the early arriver's size advantage also decreased. When arrival differences were smallest, there was mutual predation, and the two species coexisted in similar abundances across habitats. Importantly, we also found a nonlinear scaling relationship between shifts in relative arrival and predation strength. Specifically, small shifts in relative arrival caused large changes in predation strength while subsequent changes had relatively minor effects. 5. These results demonstrate that SMPE can alter not only the outcome of interactions but also the demographic rates of species and the structure of communities. Elucidating the mechanisms that link phenological shifts to species interactions is crucial for understanding the dynamics of seasonal communities as well as for predicting the effects of climate change on these communities.","[Rasmussen, Nick L.; Van Allen, Benjamin G.; Rudolf, Volker H.

Milne-Edwards, 1861), is a relatively recent invader (approx. 10 years) to northeastern New Zealand, and its large size and aggressive nature makes it a potentially formidable competitor with native species. The only endemic, similarly sized, New Zealand paddle crab, Ovalipes catharus (White and Doubleday, 1843), overlaps frequently with C. japonica in both habitat and diet. To understand their probable interactions in the field, we performed a series of experimental behavioral trials in a closed laboratory system to determine whether the crabs interact antagonistically over a shared prey resource (Perna canaliculus (Gmelin, 1791) - green-lipped mussel). In interspecific trials, C. japonica frequently displaced both sexes of O. catharus from the prey, while O. catharus usually failed to acquire prey from feeding C. japonica. In addition, male C. japonica dominated both male and female O. catharus in one-on-one competition for food, regardless of which crab possessed the food initially. Overall, male C. japonica behaved aggressively towards O. catharus and conspecifics of equal size when competing for a prey item; O. catharus showed low levels of aggression throughout all trials and increased time spent evading C. japonica as compared to C. japonica's high levels of aggression. Our research highlights the importance of understanding how aggressive behavior may influence establishment success of invading species.","[Fowler, Amy E.] Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Warkworth 0941, New Zealand; [Muirhead, Jim R.; Taylor, Richard B.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Fowler, AE (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",fowlera@si.edu,,"Muirhead, Jim/0000-0002-0264-3662",J.

Genetic evidence suggests that the Atlantic Canadian populations originated from two separate introductions with differences in time of establishment among regions and possible population-level behavioural differences. In this study, we examine intraspecific foraging behaviour among crabs from different populations, and interspecific foraging behaviour between genetically similar crabs and juvenile lobsters. Both sets of foraging experiments involved competition for a limited food source over a 1-h period. In intraspecific match-ups, recent invaders from Newfoundland (NL) were significantly superior foragers than long-established invaders from Nova Scotia (NS) and New Brunswick (NB) populations; however, we found no differences between NL and Prince Edward Island (PE) invaders. Crabs from PE were better competitors than those from NS and NB, but these differences were not significant. Interspecific competition experiments indicated that the feeding behaviour of recent invaders (NL) and genetically similar, but long-established invaders (NS), differed in the presence of juvenile lobsters. Our study documents striking behavioural differences among populations of green crab from a small geographic region, which may reflect a combination of both genetic differences and time since establishment. These differences may result in varying impacts on newly invaded habitats.","[Rossong, Melanie A.; Snelgrove, Paul V.

Adult TF emerged on average 2 wk before TC both in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions. This observation, combined with the early reproduction of emergent females, implies that the smaller (younger) larvae of native TC may be at increased risk of intra-guild predation by TF. The high spatial association between male and female TF in dense, aggregated populations suggests that the rate of mate encounter is depressed in sparse populations toward the edge of the invasive range. The higher level of spatial aggregation for TF than TC, particularly at high population density, suggests a higher propensity of adult TF to congregate at landmarks. Considering the broader range of host conditions, earlier seasonal emergence, and presumably more effective mate encounter for TF than TC, the exotic TF may be a superior competitor with the potential to displace or reduce the abundance of TC.","[Rhainds, Marc; Heard, Stephen B.; Sweeney, Jon D.; Silk, Peter; Flaherty, Leah] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada","Rhainds, M (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, POB 4000, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada.",mrhainds@nrcan.gc.ca,"Sweeney, Jonathan/Q-5281-2019; Heard, Stephen/C-2737-2012",,Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Canadian Forest ServiceNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Canadian Food Inspection Agency; Forest Protection Limited New Brunswick; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Nova Scotia Ministry of Natural Resources; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank G.

In various studies, sympatric lady beetles differ in habitat-use at the scales of landscapes, single agricultural fields, and single plants. Species also differ in their seasonal and diel activity-patterns. These spatiotemporal differences in habitat-use should lead to complementary impacts on prey, by encouraging different predator species to attack different subsets of the prey population. This in turn should lead to stronger biological control at higher predator diversity levels. Indeed, experimental manipulations of predator species richness in communities that include coccinellids have generally revealed stronger prey suppression with greater predator biodiversity. In these experimental studies, lady beetles sometimes filled unique niches as particularly voracious predators, and often also complemented or facilitated prey capture by other species. Intraguild predation was rarely found to be a strongly disruptive force, perhaps because spatiotemporal niche differences reduced encounters among species. In summary, coccinellid species both respond to and affect their communities in unique ways, generally to the benefit of herbivore suppression. Thus, the best niche fit for coccinellids may be that of a complement to other species, contributing to improved biological control with greater predator biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Results indicated that mixed assemblages of seven distinct genotypes (representing clonal lineages of D. pulex, D. pulicaria and interspecific hybrids) showed rapid loss of genetic diversity in all treatments (2 x 2 factorial design, high vs. low quantity, and high vs. low quality). However, the erosion of diversity (measured as the effective number of clones) was slowest under the poorest food conditions (i.e., low quantity, low quality) and by the conclusion of the experiment (90 days) had resulted in the (low, low) treatment having significantly greater genetic diversity than the other three treatments. In addition, significant genotype (clone) x (food) environment interactions were observed, with a different predominant species/clone found under low food quality versus high food quality (no significant differences were detected for the two food quantities). A clone of D. pulex displaced the other clones under low food quality conditions, while a clone of D. pulicaria displaced the other clones in the high food quality treatments. Subsequent life-history experiments were not sufficient to predict the outcome of competitive interactions among members of this clonal assemblage. Our results suggest that genetic diversity among herbivore species such as Daphnia may be impacted not only by differences in food quantity but also by those in food quality and could be important in the overall maintenance of genetic diversity in natural populations.","[Weider, Lawrence J.; Jeyasingh, Punidan D.; Looper, Karen G.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Grad Program EEB, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Weider, Lawrence J.; Jeyasingh, Punidan D.; Looper, Karen G.] Univ Oklahoma, Biol Stn, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Weider, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Grad Program EEB, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",ljweider@ou.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [9977047],This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (U.S. Grant no. 9977047).

These changes may affect discontiguous trophic levels via adjacent trophic levels. The invasion of an exotic host species may provide the opportunity to observe the dynamics of changing interspecific interactions among parasitoids belonging to different trophic levels. The exotic large white butterfly Pieris brassicae invaded Hokkaido Island, Japan, and quickly spread throughout the island. Prior to the invasion, the small white butterfly P. rapae was the host of the primary parasitoid Cotesia glomerata, on which both the larval hyperparasitoid Baryscapus galactopus and the pupal hyperparasitoid Trichomalopsis apanteroctena depended. At the time of the invasion, C. glomerata generally laid eggs exclusively in P. rapae. During the five years following the invasion, however, the clutch size of C. glomerata in P. rapae gradually decreased, whereas the clutch size in P. brassicae increased. The field results corresponded well with laboratory experiments showing an increase in the rate of parasitism in P. brassicae. The host expansion of C. glomerata provided the two hyperparasitoids with an opportunity to choose between alternative hosts, that is, C. glomerata within P. brassicae and C. glomerata within P. rapae. Indeed, the pupal hyperparasitoid T. apanteroctena shifted its preference gradually to C. glomerata in P. brassicae, whereas the larval hyperparasitoid B. galactopus maintained a preference for C. glomerata in P. rapae. These changes in host preference may result from differential suitability of the two host types. The larval hyperparasitoid preferred C. glomerata within P. rapae to C. glomerata within P. brassicae, presumably because P. brassicae larvae attacked aggressively, thereby hindering the parasitization, whereas the pupal hyperparasitoid could take advantage of the competition-free resource by shifting its host preference. Consequently, the invasion of P. brassicae has changed the host use of the primary parasitoid C. glomerata and the pupal hyperparasitoid T. apanteroctena within a very short time.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Tanaka, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",sing@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp; nishida@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp; ohsaki@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,49,25,27,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,AUG,2007,61,8,,,,,1791,1802,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00165.x,,,12,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,198AV,WOS:000248600300001,17683423,Bronze,,,2021-09-24,

We investigated the hypothesis that the duration of a habitat following disturbance mediates the relative importance of physical and biotic control. We combined detailed information on natural populations in a series of temporary ponds with small-scale experiments on specific processes. We compared data on presence/absence and abundance of taxa from temporary ponds showing a gradient of habitat duration with 3 simple models of community structure that incorporate random forces, life history adaptations, and biotic interactions, respectively. Different scales of resolution in describing community structure provide different emphases on which processes are important in these communities. The Life History Model explained patterns of presence/absence in the ponds, but not patterns of abundance of many taxa which best fit a model in which the importance of predation and competition in structuring communities increases with increasing duration. Experimental studies confirmed that the effect of predation and competition in temporary pond communities depends on habitat duration. Predation on all prey species examined increased with increasing pond duration. Predators were more diverse and more abundant in long-duration ponds where effects of their consumption on the abundance of prey taxa were greater than in shorter-duration ponds. Predators from long-duration ponds fed preferentially on prey taxa that predominate in shorter-duration habitats such as Aedes mosquitoes and the fairy shrimp Eubranchipus. Competition between Daphnia and rotifers occurred primarily in intermediate-duration ponds, where Daphnia at typical densities was capable of drastically reducing abundances of Keratella cochlearis in cultures. However, at densities found in both short- and long-duration habitats, Daphnia had no effect.","UNIV WISCONSIN, CTR LIMNOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",,,,,,,,103,285,297,3,101,NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0887-3593,,,J N AM BENTHOL SOC,J.

I performed two experiments in an early-successional site in two consecutive years. In the first experiment I tested the effects of litter and competition, and their interaction, on establishment and growth of tree seedlings. In the second experiment I studied the effect of insecticide application in combination with litter and herb competition on seedling establishment and growth, and on arthropod abundance. In the absence of competition, litter had no significant effect on the biomass of woody seedlings, though it delayed seedling emergence. Herb competition reduced the growth of the woody seedlings, but the addition of leaf litter reduced the density and biomass of the herbs, indirectly improving the growth of the woody seedlings. Litter increased both invertebrate damage to seedling cotyledons and seedling mortality. The application of insecticide increased seedling emergence and reduced seedling mortality, and more so in the presence of litter. The total number of arthropods and the number of plant-chewing arthropods were increased by the addition of litter and reduced by application of insecticide. Thus, litter had, simultaneously, a positive indirect effect on individual biomass through reduced competition, and a negative indirect effect on the number of individuals through increased seed and/or seedling predation, and a negative direct effect on seedling mortality.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,POB 1059,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08855; NEW YORK BOT GARDEN,INST ECOSYST STUDIES,MARY FLAGLER CARY ARBORETUM,MILLBROOK,NY 12454",,,,"Facelli, Jose/0000-0002-0408-0082",,,,52,154,167,2,53,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1727,1735,,10.2307/1939632,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700020,,,,,2021-09-24,

In eastern deciduous forests of the United States, a single ant genus (Aphaenogaster) appears ecologically dominant with high abundance and opportunistic foraging. However, Aphaenogaster ants are not particularly behaviorally aggressive toward co-occurring ants, making it unclear as to how they might sustain dominance. We offered myrmecochorous seeds and termite carrion at bait stations and quantified ant aggression, food selection and recruitment. We conducted the experiments throughout the natural seed-release window to determine how the abundance of low- and high-quality food items impacted behavior. We found evidence that Aphaenogaster ants dominate the retrieval of both seeds and insect carrion (dead termites). Aphaenogaster foraging dominance did not appear driven by superior fighting or recruitment abilities but simply by having more foragers on the ground, essentially achieving control of different types of food resources through numerical dominance. Moreover, though they are the dominant effective seed dispersers in the system, A. picea exhibited a much greater affinity for termites than seeds, and the desirability of termites decreased in the presence of seeds. Overall, our results suggest that high numbers of foragers-as opposed to aggressive territoriality-can be an effective ecological strategy for sustaining ecological dominance through resource acquisition.","[Warren, R.

Such species are expected to display community drift dynamics analogous to neutral alleles undergoing genetic drift. While entire communities of species are not ecologically equivalent, recent field experiments have documented the existence of guilds of such neutral species embedded in real food webs. What demographic outcomes of the interactions within and between species in these guilds are expected to produce ecological drift versus coexistence remains unclear. To address this issue, and guide empirical testing, we consider models of a guild of ecologically equivalent competitors feeding on a single resource to explore when community drift should manifest. We show that community drift dynamics only emerge when the density-dependent effects of each species on itself are identical to its density-dependent effects on every other guild member. In contrast, if each guild member directly limits itself more than it limits the abundance of other guild members, all species in the guild are coexisting, even though they all are ecologically equivalent with respect to their interactions with species outside the guild (i.e. resources, predators, mutualists). Hence, considering only interspecific ecological differences generating density dependence, and not fully accounting for the preponderance of mechanisms causing intraspecific density dependence, will provide an incomplete picture for segregating between neutrality and coexistence. We also identify critical experiments necessary to disentangle guilds of ecologically equivalent species from those experiencing ecological drift, as well as provide an overview of ways of incorporating a mechanistic basis into studies of species coexistence and neutrality. Identifying these characteristics, and the mechanistic basis underlying community structure, is not merely an exercise in clarifying the semantics of coexistence and neutral theories, but rather reflects key differences that must exist among community members in order to determine how and why communities are structured.","[McPeek, Mark A.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",mark.mcpeek@dartmouth.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021","McPeek, Mark/0000-0001-7794-9466",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1748945],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1748945",,71,8,8,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Acropora spp., however, are not the most common species found in Hong Kong. In the present study, we examined comparable temperature effects, both low and elevated, on Platygyra acuta, one of the most dominant coral species in Hong Kong. Platygyra acuta fragments were exposed to six temperature levels ranging from 14 degrees C to 32 degrees C for 7 days before they were exposed to prey-choice experiments with Drupella. Results from these experiments indicated that P. acuta fragments were generally tolerant to temperature changes within the range tested. In contrast to those observed for A. valida, they were not found to be attractive to the subsequent Drupella corallivory. The greater tolerance of P. acuta to both these environmental and biological stresses may have contributed to its dominance in Hong Kong coral communities.","[Tsang, Ryan Ho Leung; Ang, Put, Jr.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Marine Sci Lab, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Ang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Marine Sci Lab, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",thlryan.411@gmail.com; aput96229@gmail.com,"Ang, Put/AAO-5490-2021",,Research Grant Council of Hong Kong General Research Fund [14122215],"This study was partly supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong General Research Fund No. 14122215, we thank HL Leung, YE Leung, TY Ng and KT Wong for their assistance in the experiments.

We quantified the degree of spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the small carnivores using camera trap data over a year-long period. Carnivores separated into two temporal groups: nocturnal species (wildcat, polecat and genet) and diurnal species (mongooses). In addition, carnivores within the same temporal group had strong patterns of reduced spatial co-occurrence. The smaller bodied carnivores showed lower co-occurrence with the larger bodied African wildcat than expected by chance, supporting the idea of dominant competitor avoidance.

We posited that biotic interactions, particularly predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory assumed a primary top-down role in affecting small mammals and annual plants here. Using a multi factorial design we selectively excluded vertebrate predators (principally carnivores and raptors) and a large small mammal herbivore, the degu (Octodon degus), from replicated 0.56 ha exclosures located in a valley near the coast in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park. Evidence initially supported effects of predator exclusion on O. degus but not for other small mammals in the assemblage (e.g., Phyllotis darwini, Abrothrix olivaceus). Subsequent years of monitoring have documented that predation has temporary effects on degu numbers, but that populations of this and other small mammals are much more strongly influenced by environmental bottom-up factors (i.e., rainfall). Further, our experimental manipulation has provided no evidence for negative interspecific competition effects on numbers of any small mammal in this assemblage. Degu exclusions, however, have had negative indirect effects on exotic annuals; native annuals appear to outcompete exotics especially during drought years The effect is magnified in all-small mammal exclusions. Since about 2002, selective exclusions of lagomorphs and small mammals have resulted in changes in cover of some perennial shrubs. Also notable has been a fundamental shift in the small mammal composition following the last major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event in 2000 2002; degus now comprise a majority of small mammal biomass in the assemblage, and their numbers have become more stable and less temporally variable. This appears to have been caused by a shift in rainfall periodicity from strong interannual fluctuations in response to periodic ENSOs, to a more equitable pattern with more consistent annual rainfall. This represents one of the first documented cases of system-wide biotic phase shifts to a relatively modest change in rainfall regime.

However, severe declines in diadromous fish populations in the nearshore Gulf of Maine (GOM) have impacted trophic dynamics and increased pressure on other estuarine-dependent forage resources. The objective of this study was to compare the trophic positions and interspecific interactions of diadromous fishes as predators and prey in relation to current GOM forage fishes. Empirical biomass data along with diet compositions and vital rates were used to construct a static model of a representative GOM coastal food web: the Saco River estuary (SRE) in Maine. A series of sensitivity analyses based on model outputs was performed to determine the trophic role of diadromous fishes in this estuarine food web. Model results suggested that juvenile marine transients played a greater role as forage species for SRE predators than did the anadromous Blueback Herring Alosa aestivalis and Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. Due to the abundant forage fish base, Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus and Shortnose Sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum were estimated to have a greater trophic position than reported in past literature. Lower-trophic-level fishes functioned as keystone prey species for sturgeon. The use of holistic approaches to update the ecological data on predator-prey interactions among diadromous fishes and forage resources within coastal ecosystems is necessary for the future management of these ecologically significant and threatened species.","[Smith, Kayla M.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Sci, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Byron, Carrie J.; Sulikowski, James A.] Univ New England, Dept Marine Sci, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA","Smith, KM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Sci, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",kmsmi100@syr.edu,"Byron, Carrie J/B-6606-2014","Byron, Carrie J/0000-0003-3820-7392","NOAA Species of Concern Research Program; NOAA Section 6 Research Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS-0904155, DGE-0841361]","We thank the graduate and undergraduate students of the Sulikowski and Byron laboratories at the Marine Science Center (MSC), University of New England (UNE).

Yet, very little is known how animals gather and integrate information about environmental factors to fine tune investment. Observing the decisions and success of other individuals, particularly when those individuals initiate breeding earlier, may provide a way for animals to quickly arrive at better breeding investment decisions. Here we show, with a field experiment using artificial nests appearing similar to resident tit nests with completed clutches, that a migratory bird can use the observed high and low clutch size of a resident competing bird species to increase and decrease clutch size and egg mass, accordingly. Our results demonstrate that songbirds can discriminate between high and low quantity of heterospecific eggs, and that social information can have long-term physiological consequences affecting reproductive strategies. Such behaviour may help animals to better adapt to changing environments and lead to convergent traits with competitors.","[Forsman, Jukka T.; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas; Nykanen, Inka L.] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Forsman, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",jukka.forsman@oulu.fi,"Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [122665, 125720]",We acknowledge the financial support provided by the Academy of Finland (project nos. 122665 and 125720).

Sulfur, predatory mites, and powdery mildew have long been studied separately regarding their impacts on spider mites, but knowledge of their combined influence in that context is also needed to aid integrated pest and disease management. Therefore, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments to study the main and the interaction effects of sulfur, P. persimilis, P. aphanis, and T. urticae in strawberry leaf disc bioassays. The results showed that the predatory mite, powdery mildew, and sulfur had additive effects on reducing egg number and population growth of T. urticae. Compared to the control, populations of T. urticae on the leaf discs were decreased by 83%, 76%, and 61% after 5 days of treatment with sulfur + powdery mildew + predatory mites, mildew + predatory mites, and predatory mites alone, respectively. The survival and egg production of T. urticae females was affected to the greatest extent by P. persimilis, followed by powdery mildew. Residual sulfur had a short-term suppressive effect on T. urticae egg production but did not influence survival and reproduction of P. persimilis. If these findings also apply under field conditions, controlling powdery mildew will not reduce the need for spider mite control in strawberry, as has been suggested for other fruit crops.

However, recent reviews have shown that competitors, unlike predators and parasites, have rarely been documented to cause extinctions. There is a need for better understanding of competitive interactions between nonindigenous species and native competitors across systems where NIS reach high densities. In this paper we examine competitive interactions between the exotic, invasive New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and native estuarine invertebrates. P. antipodarum is often described as a freshwater snail but can occur in brackish water as well; it has been established in the Columbia River Estuary for over ten years. We addressed competition in this estuarine system using three approaches: field surveys of the benthic invertebrate community, stable isotope analysis of overlap in resource use by common invertebrates, and a laboratory competition experiment that tested the strength of competition between P. antipodarum and the isopod, Gnorimosphaeroma insulare, which overlap in resource use. We found no evidence of negative competitive impacts of P. antipodarum on native benthic invertebrates in this estuarine system. Densities of P. antipodarum and common native epibenthic invertebrates are positively correlated in the intertidal, likely due to shared habitat preferences. The competition experiment showed that the effect of interspecific competition from P. antipodarum on the foraging and survival of G. insulare was significantly less than the effect of intraspecific competition between isopods. The presence of the isopod G. insulare reduced foraging in P. antipodarum, but this change did not result in reduced survival and growth of snails. Hence, interspecific competition is weak despite high densities achieved by the invading species. Finally, we discuss several possible explanations for the observation that P. antipodarum does not have an obvious negative competitive impact on native benthic invertebrates.","[Brenneis, Valance E.

Here the suggest an alternative framework jot understanding this phenomenon: the competitive exclusion of native, non-synanthropic species by invasive species. We use data from two urban centers (Phoenix and Baltimore) and two taxa (birds and spiders) to link diversity loss with reduced community evenness among species in urban communities. This reduction in evenmess may be caused by a minority of invasive species dominating the majority of the resources, consequently excluding nonsynanthropic species that could otherwise adapt to urban conditions.

In order to test whether the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) holds in less exposed shores comprised exclusively of smaller rocks (cobbles) we measured 1) the size frequency distribution of cobbles (mass and basal surface area), 2) the incidence of barnacle encrustation as an indirect measure of cobble disturbance, 3) the abundances of the dominant macroinvertebrates occurring beneath cobbles (the crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus, the chiton Sypharochiton pelliserpentis and the snail Diloma zealandica), and 4) macroinvertebrate fidelity beneath a range of cobble sizes. Only large cobbles were found to be encrusted with barnacles, indicative of their greater resistance to physical disturbance by waves and currents. Mark and relocate experiments indicated fidelity to a given cobble over two tidal cycles was 11-14% for crabs and did not vary with cobble size. In contrast, fidelity to medium and large cobbles was higher for chitons (26-45%) and snails (17-31%) and generally increased with increasing cobble size. In contrast to the predictions of the IDH, there was a positive correlation between increasing cobble size and increasing species diversity of organisms found under the cobbles. This pattern is not simply attributable to greater space available beneath large cobbles as there was a significantly greater density of macroinvertebrates beneath medium and large, compared to the small cobbles. Increasing species diversity with increasing cobble size appears to be independent of patterns of species recolonization associated with small cobbles being subject to high disturbance or interspecific competitive hierarchies associated with low disturbance beneath large cobbles. Instead, factors such as aggregative behaviors, and reducing vulnerability to predators and desiccation stress are likely to explain the relationship between cobbles and their associated macroinvertebrate communities.

Scincid lizards use both chemosensory and visual cues in tasks such as mate location, shelter-site selection, and predator evasion. Published literature has focused primarily on the use of chemosensory information by these lizards, but our experiments reveal an alternative scenario. Water skinks (Eulamprus heatwolei) are sympatric with larger black rock skinks (Egernia saxatilis) in southeastern Australia, and use similar long-term retreat-sites. However, Eulamprus avoid shelter-sites occupied by Egernia because of the risk of attack and injury. We conducted laboratory trials to clarify the kinds of information used by Eulamprus to avoid already-occupied shelters. In the field, shelter-sites might provide three types of information about prior occupancy: either scent deposited by a previously present Egernia; evidence of the current presence of an Egernia, perhaps involving visual, chemical, and/or auditory information; or a direct behavioural interaction with a resident lizard (potentially involving an attack). In our trials, Eulamprus based their shelter-site avoidance only on direct interactions. Thus, Eulamprus reacted strongly to Egernia with which they were able to interact physically, but not to either Egernia scent deposits, or a (caged) Egernia with which they could not physically interact. The behaviour of the resident was critical, in that Eulamprus fled from the crevice in response to bites, movements, or open-mouth displays by the resident Egernia. We suggest that Eulamprus base their shelter-site choices on the presence of an actual resident animal rather than more indirect cues (such as scent), because only a direct encounter provides reliable information about the magnitude of threat associated with crevice occupancy.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Langkilde, T (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",langkild@bio.usyd.edu.au; rshine@mail.usyd.edu.au,"Langkilde, Tracy/L-8696-2017; Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008","Langkilde, Tracy/0000-0001-7014-2432; ",,,,34,13,14,0,12,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,FEB,2005,142,,2,,,,203,216,,10.1163/1568539053627659,,,14,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,925TE,WOS:000229075400005,,,,,2021-09-24,

In a tropical coastal terrestrial forest in Costa Rica, we investigated the relative importance of predation by land crabs, Gecarcinus quadratus, and hermit crabs, Coenobita compressus, on measured forest composition through a series of seed removal and seedling establishment experiments. We also used natural light-gaps and adjacent non-gap sites to test how canopy cover affects crab predation ( seed removal) and seedling establishment. We found fewer tree species (S = 18) and lower densities ( seedlings, saplings, and adults) in the coastal zone within 100 m of coastline, than in the inland zone (S = 59). Land crab densities were higher in the coastal zone (3.03 +/- 1.44 crabs m(-2)) than in the inland zone (0.76 +/- 0.78 crabs m(-2)), and hermit crabs were not present in the inland zone. Seed removal and seedling mortality also were higher in the coastal zone than in the inland zone, and in the open controls than in the crab exclosures. Mortality of seeds and seedlings was two to six times higher in the controls than exclosures for four of the five experiments. Crabs preferred seeds and younger seedlings over older seedlings but showed no species preferences in the seed (Anacardium excelsum, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Terminalia oblonga) and seedling (Pachira quinata and E. cyclocarpum) stages. We conclude that the observed differences in tree densities were caused by differential crab predation pressure along the coastal gradient, while the differences in species composition were due to predator escape ( satiation) by seed quantity. Canopy cover did not affect seed removal rates, but did affect seedling survival with higher mortality in the non-gap versus gap environments. In summary, crab predation of seeds and seedlings, and secondarily canopy cover, are important factors affecting tree establishment in terrestrial coastal forests.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Lindquist, ES (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Org Trop Studies, Box 90630, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",erin@ots.ac.cr,,,,,,50,46,53,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2004,141,4,,,,,661,671,,10.1007/s00442-004-1673-5,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,869QT,WOS:000224999800012,15349766,,,,2021-09-24,

One potential explanation is that these are statistical expectations over the range of potential species characteristics. We systematically examine the indirect interactions between two hosts with a shared parasitoid across all potential parameter values, using a family of simple models. By including a detection limit for nonzero interspecific effects, we demonstrate that (-,0) indirect interactions between hosts are the most common type for many variants of the model. However, the absence of positive indirect effects in empirical studies constitutes a puzzling inconsistency between the empirical and theoretical literatures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Most examples of this come from instances of aggression or communication within a species. We tested whether interspecific encounters between ants enhance the host location success of a parasitoid (Diptera: Phoridae) that attacks ants in the genus Linepithema. At food resources recruited to by Linepithema, parasitoid discovery rates were lower when Linepithema was alone than when other ant species were present. In experimentally controlled encounters, parasitoid discovery rates were elevated when Linepithema confronted an ant species that elicited use of chemicals, but not when it confronted an ant species that primarily elicited physical aggression. These results indicate that phorid parasitoids of Linepithema use the ant's chemicals as host location cues. Because Linepithema is known to abandon food resources in the presence of its phorid parasitoids, its use of chemicals during interspecific encounters may diminish its competitive success when phorids are nearby.

Kin recognition is important in many social insects, but has also been found in several nonsocial insects such as parasitoids, where it plays an important role in oviposition behaviour. In nonparasitic arthropods, however, the fitness of ovipositing females also depends on the oviposition behaviour of related and unrelated females, especially when eggs are oviposited in clusters by several females. 2. In this paper, kin recognition in a predatory mite, Iphiseius degenerans, is studied. Mothers are capable of determining offspring sex ratio, and cannibalism on juvenile stages is a common phenomenon. Therefore, kin recognition is expected to occur in this predator. 3. Oviposition behaviour of this species is particularly interesting because it alternates foraging bouts in flowers with deposition of a single egg at a time on a leaf, where predation risk is lower. The eggs are not scattered but are deposited in clusters. After feeding in a flower, females therefore have to locate clusters of eggs. 4. Experiments on two-choice arenas showed that females prefer to oviposit close to conspecific eggs rather than close to heterospecific eggs. Females also showed a preference for ovipositing near closely related conspecific eggs rather than more distantly related eggs. 5. Females tended to displace eggs of heterospecifics more frequently than eggs of conspecifics. 6. These behavioural observations show that females can discriminate not only between conspecific and heterospecific eggs but also between eggs that vary in degree of relatedness. This enables females to oviposit in clusters containing related eggs and thus avoid cannibalism by non-kin and/or produce adaptive sex ratios despite the fact that the adults commute between flowers and leaves.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Systemat & Ecol, Sect Populat Biol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Systemat & Populat Biol, Sect Populat Biol, Kruislaan 320, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Janssen@bio.uva.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,40,47,48,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Both species experienced reduced survivorship and altered growth rates at high density and in the presence of heterospecific larvae, confirming results from previous field pen studies. Interspecific interactions are a complex combination of intraguild predation (including cannibalism) and competition.

This indirect interaction is further complicated because M. balthica facultatively switches between suspension- and deposit-feeding in response to the availability of suspended food particles. Laboratory experiments showed that the proportion of clams deposit feeding with exposed siphons increased with decreasing food concentrations in the water column and this resulted in shallower burial depths in the sediment. The clams showed similar responses in feeding mode and burial depth to the concentrations of suspended food indirectly manipulated by the presence and/or density of either interspecific (suspension-feeding soft-shelled clam Mya arenarin L.) or intraspecific competitors.","SMITHSONIAN ENVIRONM RES CTR,EDGEWATER,MD 21037",,,,,,,,55,64,64,0,19,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1994,69,1,,,,,28,36,,10.2307/3545280,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MR887,WOS:A1994MR88700003,,,,,2021-09-24,

In the first experiment, the zooplanktivorous fish species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) (primary carnivore), was reduced to 27% of its previous population size (53%) of biomass) by a selective rotenone treatment. In the second experiment, zander (Stizostedion lucioperca) (secondary carnivore), were stocked in the lake resulting in a reduction in the population size of roach to 51% of its previous population size (31% of biomass). In both experiments, seasonal average biomass of Daphnia cucullata) increased in the two years with the lowest roach biomasses. but no shift to larger zooplankton forms took place. In the years with increased Daphnia biomass, phytoplankton biomass and transparency showed an increased seasonal variation (measured as coefficient of variation). In contrast to manipulations in which planktivorous fish were totally removed, no effect on seasonal average phytoplankton biomass was observed. Due to the high reproductive capacity of roach, the system returned to previous conditions within a year or two after the perturbations. Under unperturbed conditions, the lake showed few indications of instability as suggested by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis. This lack of instability can. among other things, be related to high zooplanktivore predation pressure present in highly productive lakes preventing overexploitation of primary producers by grazers. In addition, the omnivorous feeding characteristics of roach (feeding on both zooplankton and algae/detritus) and interactions between the open water and the detritus nutrient pool are likely to increase the stability of the system. The two perturbation experiments plus a previous natural experiment (winter fish kill), which all were pulsed perturbations, provide no evidence for the presence of alternative stable states in highly productive lakes. Possibly, a sustained perturbation over several years may shift highly productive lakes from a dominance of phytoplankton production to a dominance of macrophyte production leading to an alternative state.","UNIV LUND,DEPT ECOL LIMNOL,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN","PERSSON, L (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT ANIM ECOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,90,62,63,0,36,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1993,66,2,,,,,193,208,,10.2307/3544805,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KJ535,WOS:A1993KJ53500003,,,,,2021-09-24,

These enclosures allowed each species to experience environmental conditions within each lake without directly interacting with each other. In the four-species lake, two other sets of enclosures addressed the effects of intra- and interspecific competition. Changes in total biomass of enclosure stocks (from growth and mortality) indicated that in the absence of other species, perch did best in the lake containing the richest fish assemblage, intermediate in the two-species lake, and worst in the mudminnow-only lake. Mudminnow stocks similarly performed significantly better in the four-species lake than the mudminnow-only lake. These results suggest that the lakes' environmental conditions contribute to the patterns of presence and abundance of perch, but that interspecific interactions override a similar contribution for the mudminnow, which is regarded as a fugitive species.

Its literature is classically scientific in the sense that it combines pattern discovery, theory, and empirical testing. It is, implicitly, one of the significant demonstrations that general ecological principles exist and can be discovered by hypothetico-deductive methodologies. I outline the development of the topic in the context of two questions, both of which take it as an assumption that habitat selection is an optimal-foraging process. How does habitat selection alter (or reinforce) the dynamics of population interactions? How do those interactions alter the optimal behavior? Competition within a single species forces the use of a wide variety of habitats. This has been shown in many taxa, and Fretwell's theory gives it a sound basis in evolutionary ecology. In other words, we ecologists know that the pattern exists, and we know why it exists. Ecologists are capitalizing on their understanding of single-species habitat selection to design methods for comparing fitnesses (and components of fitnesses) in different habitats. It has been known for 40 yr that a second, competing species can reverse the effects of competition within a species, producing habitat selection where it would not otherwise exist. For the past decade, however, we have been discovering that this effect is really a cluster of effects. Whether competition restores selectivity depends on the kind of competition at work and on the information-gathering abilities of foragers. So does the extent to which it is restored. Generally, the strongest separation of species by habitat selection results from distinct-preference competition between species whose individuals have very limited abilities to assess the density of food in a patch. (This model yields the ghost of competition past.) But if individuals have much ability to assess food density, there is little or no increase likely in their selectivity compared with the single-species case. Other sorts of competition produce intermediate results. The effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection have been investigated with theory and experiment working closely together. The by-products of the combination have been that new sorts of competitive relationship have been suggested and that it has been possible to compare these relationships with those suggested from other areas of investigation such as plant-herbivore interactions, succession, and plant specializations. Habitat selection may stabilize predation as well as competition. Sih has shown that the conditions required for stabilization closely resemble those predicted by optimal-foraging theory: Victims need to prefer the safer habitat most when their populations are lowest or when their chance of being killed in the riskier habitat is highest. Numerous experiments show that foragers behave appropriately to protect themselves from predation. Multispecies studies emphasize the potential for differential susceptibility and optimal habitat selection to maintain diverse communities. Despite, or perhaps because of, the rich understanding that the study of habitat selection has already engendered, many new and exciting topics are emerging. Perhaps the most challenging is the combination of time scales that allows pheotypes to change morphologically and physiologically as well as behaviorally. It seems probable that investigators interested in these topics will continue to receive substantial payoffs for their efforts.","UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,,,,,,57,407,410,2,141,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Apart from interspecific interactions, parasites can affect how their hosts behave with conspecifics, such as during competition for resources. Fish are important hosts to a variety of parasite taxa that can, through physical impairment or invasion of sense organs, affect how they interact with conspecifics for food, territory, or mates. In New Zealand, the common bully Gobiomorphus cotidianus plays host to a variety of parasites, encysting throughout the body (Apatemon sp.) or residing within the eyes (Tylodelphys darbyi). We hypothesized that fish with lower levels of infection would secure territories closer to a food patch and be more likely to tolerate sharing that territory. Our experiments show that parasites infecting different areas may have variable impacts on how far the host positions itself from a food patch and the likelihood that it shares its territory. Fish with higher intensities of T. darbyi tended to be closer to the food patch, but Apatemon sp. did not show a similar pattern. Higher infection levels of both parasites were statistically associated with bullies being less likely to share territory. Further, bigger fish were less likely to share their territory at higher intensities infection, and we observed individual variation in a fish's response between trials. Our findings support that parasites matter in ecological interactions but also emphasize the context dependence of their effects.","[Ruehle, Brandon; Poulin, Robert] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand","Ruehle, B (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, 340 Great King St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand.",brandon.ruehle90@gmail.com,,"Ruehle, Brandon/0000-0002-9898-3169",University of Otago,We would like to thank the members of the Evolutionary and Ecological Parasitology Lab as well as Jolyn Chia for their assistance with field and lab work.

We implemented an innovative trophic interaction framework for novel communities and quantified the interaction strength and impact potential of a truly novel species (marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis) with a resident non-native counterpart (spiny-cheek crayfish Faxonius limosus). As prey, we used Dreissena mussels, which are non-native as well and now hold a key position in many European and North American aquatic ecosystems. For both crayfish species, we predicted functional responses based on a mechanistic model that we parameterised with a set of experimental observations of foraging behaviour and satiation. We compared these predicted functional responses to empirically observed responses. In addition, we incorporated behavioural traits such as aggression, activity, and boldness in the comparisons between the species and individuals to determine their influence on functional responses. We tested individuals from aquarium stocks as well as naturalised individuals from invaded water bodies. Altogether, we performed 1,095 experiments with 26 individual crayfish. We found that per capita predation of spiny-cheek crayfish exceeded that of marbled crayfish from aquaria and naturalised individuals. Functional responses differed between species and were mostly higher for spiny-cheek crayfish males. Marbled crayfish, however, were more voracious and reached satiation more slowly. Consumption rates correlated with aggression for marbled crayfish and with an aggressive threat response for spiny-cheek crayfish. We conclude that spiny-cheek crayfish can reach higher short-term consumption rates than marbled crayfish, but both species probably do not substantially affect Dreissena mussel populations in the field. For marbled crayfish, high long-term consumption, interspecific aggression, and reproduction rates can promote their establishment and spread. Risk assessments of these invaders should be improved by considering numerical responses, and different prey organisms and predators.","[Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Chem Pharm, Berlin, Germany; [Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany","Linzmaier, SM (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.",stefan.linzmaier@gmail.com,"Jeschke, Jonathan M/A-2707-2008","Jeschke, Jonathan M/0000-0003-3328-4217","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [JE 288/9-1, JE 288/9-2]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: JE 288/9-1 and JE 288/9-2",,132,3,3,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The consequences of intraguild interactions on the foraging efficiency of the two coccinellid species were investigated by evaluating the functional responses of single beetles and intra- and interspecific combinations to densities of the spirea aphid, Aphis citricola van der Goot (Hemiptera: Aphididae), on apple seedlings, during 2 and 12 h under laboratory conditions. A type II functional response was observed in all the bioassays. Solitary H. axyridis consumed significantly more aphids than single P. japonica in both exposure periods. However, at intermediate prey densities the prey consumption of P. japonica was slightly greater than that of H. axyridis. The 95% confidence intervals of the functional response curves of conspecific and heterospecific pairs overlapped at 2 h. In contrast, conspecific pairs of H. axyridis showed a higher functional response curve at 12 h compared to a combination of H. axyridis and P. japonica. Prey's predation risk reduction was only detected for paired H. axyridis and mixed predators compared to their estimated functional responses at the 2-h foraging period. By comparing functional responses between intraguild predatory lady beetle combinations, we could further predict the potential ecosystem service provided by these natural enemies.","[Feng, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Xu; An, Meng-Ru; Li, Yu-Dan; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Wang, Lin-Lin; Ren, Jin-Ze; Liu, Tong-Xian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Xu; An, Meng-Ru; Li, Yu-Dan; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Wang, Lin-Lin; Ren, Jin-Ze; Liu, Tong-Xian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Minist Agr, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops Northwes, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhao-Xu] Gansu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Liu, TX (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Liu, TX (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Minist Agr, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops Northwes, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",txliu@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Liu, Tong-Xian/0000-0002-7686-0686",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31272089]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Z109021611]; national college students' science and technology innovation project [201610712004],"We thank Xing-Lin Yu for assistance in field collection of insects.

However, the interspecific interactions that result in the negative impacts on native species tend to be poorly understood. One contributing factor to this knowledge gap may be that the vulnerability of native species can vary between different life-history stages. For example, the parental care phase is often risky both for the developing offspring and care-giving parents. Accordingly, we investigated the interactions between invasive mud crabs, Rhithropanopeus harrissii, and native nest-building littoral fish, with a special focus on the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus. Firstly, our field survey demonstrated that while the recently established mud crab and native nest-building fish have different habitat and depth optima, their distributions also have a considerable overlap, with a high potential for interactions between them. Secondly, our laboratory experiments indicate that the crabs are likely to impact the fish negatively, especially by taking over occupied nests, as well as pre-occupying nesting resources that are of very limited supply in the studied population. We did not find evidence for successful predation on eggs guarded by male sand gobies naive to the mud crabs. Collectively, the results suggest that the invasive crabs have high potential to negatively impact native fish. Furthermore, the results support the scenario that the parental phase can be a particularly vulnerable life-history stage in face of novel selection pressures, such as species invasions.","[Lehtonen, Topi K.; Vesakoski, Outi; Yli-Rosti, Juho] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Lehtonen, Topi K.; Saarinen, Anniina] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 25 Rainforest Walk, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Vesakoski, Outi] Univ Turku, Archipelago Res Inst, Turku 20014, Finland; [Saarinen, Anniina; Lindstrom, Kai] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Tykistokatu 6, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland","Lehtonen, TK (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 25 Rainforest Walk, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",topilehtonen@gmail.com,"Lindstrom, Kai/ABG-4353-2020; Lehtonen, Topi/A-6679-2010; /B-5479-2008","Lindstrom, Kai/0000-0002-8356-5538; Lehtonen, Topi/0000-0002-1372-9509; /0000-0002-8356-5538; Vesakoski, Outi/0000-0002-7220-3347",Finnish Foundation for Nature Conservation; University of Turku; VIPU,"We thank the Finnish Foundation for Nature Conservation and the University of Turku for funding (to T.K.L.), and the Tvarminne Zoological Station staff for logistic support.

To determine the effects of potential competitive and behavioral interactions between native predators and invasive lionfish, we experimentally altered the presence of lionfish and red grouper Epinephelus morio in karst solution holes in Florida Bay, USA, and then tracked subsequent changes in the juvenile reef fish and motile macroinvertebrate communities for 6 wk. Relative to solution holes where we excluded both predators, mean juvenile reef fish abundance declined 83.7% in solution holes with a lionfish but increased by 154% in solution holes with a red grouper. There was no difference in juvenile reef fish abundance in solution holes with both lionfish and red grouper compared to holes where we excluded both predators. The composition of lionfish stomach contents shifted from mostly teleost fishes when lionfish were present in solution holes alone, to mostly crustaceans when in the presence of a red grouper. Concurrently, the abundance of 2 species of cleaner shrimp (Ancylomenes pedersoni and Periclimenes yucatanicus) decreased by 14.7% when lionfish were present but increased by 56.2% at holes where lionfish were excluded. We suggest that these results are due to altered lionfish predatory behavior in the presence of red grouper and highlight the importance of maintaining intact native predator communities for ameliorating the negative effects of the lionfish invasion.","[Ellis, Robert D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Faletti, Meaghan E.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Div Marine Fisheries Management, 2950 Execut Ctr Circle East, Tallahassee, FL 32301 USA; [Ellis, Robert D.] Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",robert.ellis@myfwc.com,,"Ellis, Robert/0000-0001-7178-8980",PADI Foundation; Florida Sea Grant; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute (GCFI),"This project was conducted with permissions from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (permit #FKNMS-2012-078), the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (SAL #11-1330-SR), and the FSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocol #1106).

On intertidal mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, mechanisms underlying the negative correlation between the densities of two dominant macro-invertebrates, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsolete and the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator, are unclear. We investigated the effect of mud snail density on survival, growth and fecundity of C volutator in 2-wk experiments in the laboratory and field, and observed behavioral interactions between the two species. Snails negatively affected juvenile and adult survival of amphipods, juvenile growth, and proportion of females. that were ovigerous. Behavioral observations revealed that snails are active predators of C. volutator, both juveniles and adults. We documented several attack methods by snails. As well, we observed that C volutator could become entangled in laid mucus trails of snails, leaving them vulnerable to attack from snail trail-followers or other predators. Snail predation, in combination with increased C. volutator migration in the presence of snails, appears to be a primary short-term mechanism for the observed negative correlation between these invertebrate species. Competition (likely through interference), resulting in lowered growth and fecundity, may be a longer-term mechanism for this negative correlation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the Great Lakes, the exotic round goby (Apollonia melanostoma) is very abundant in littoral areas used by the native yellow perch (Perca flavencens). We examined yellow perch-round goby interactions using multiple approaches. Field surveys analyzing dietary overlap among three size classes of yellow perch and round goby detected significant overlap only between juvenile perch (< 95 mm TL) and gobies (< 60 mm TL). laboratory experiments using juvenile stages tested for habitat preference differences (open sand, macrophytes and dreissenids) in solitary, intraspecific (2 perch) and interspecific (1 perch, 1 goby) treatments. In macrophyte and dreissenid habitats, we tested for treatment differences in fish behavior (intraspecific vs. interspecific) and yellow perch growth (solitary, intraspecific and interspecific). Round goby consistently preferred complex habitats. Yellow perch showed diurnal preference of complex habitats, but increased nocturnal use of sand in the solitary and interspecific treatments. Activity was greater in dreissenid than macrophyte habitat, but prey attacks showed the opposite trend. Activity and prey attacks were greater in the intraspecific than interspecific treatments. The trend was due to lower prey attacks executed by round goby. In macrophytes, individual yellow perch growth was lower in the intraspecific than in the solitary and interspecific treatments. In dreissenids, intraspecific and interspecific competitors equally decreased yellow perch growth. Our results suggest differences in diet, habitat preference and behavior between juvenile round goby and yellow perch may allow their coexistence in nearshore areas.

Gaps exist in the knowledge about second generation breeding performance in bivoltine populations. In this study, the breeding performance of the second generation was evaluated in three bivoltine populations of I. typographus in the SE Alps. Length of the maternal galleries (from 40.5 to 44.8 mm), population growth rate (PGR; from 0.7 to 3.6), and emerged adults per m(2) (from 669 to 1,570 insects/m(2)) varied among populations and were negatively correlated with bark colonisation density. Pheromone traps set up in the three investigated forests differed in the number of trapped beetles, with mean captures ranging between 5,310 and 19,850 insects per trap. The populations giving the highest captures in the traps showed the lowest bark colonisation density (248 vs. 489 maternal galleries per m(2)) and the best breeding performance. The populations of parasitoids and predators corresponded to just 1-9 and 2-10% of the emerging I. typographus adults, respectively, and phloem temperature never reached thresholds lethal to I. typographus. Interspecific competition was negligible, whereas intraspecific competition was found to be the main factor affecting the breeding performance of the second generation, although with different intensity according to the colonisation density. It is hypothesised that competition with the first generation and spring precipitation influence the number of suitable hosts available to the second generation.","[Faccoli, Massimo] Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy; [Bernardinelli, Iris] Univ Udine, Dept Biol, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Faccoli, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy.",massimo.faccoli@unipd.it,"Faccoli, Massimo/AAC-8141-2020",,"Direzione Centrale delle Risorse Agricole, Naturali, Forestali e della Montagna-Regione Autonoma Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy); PRIN projectMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN) [200774ENMR]","The authors would like to thank Fabio Stergulc, Olle Anderbrant, Andrea Battisti, Marc Kenis and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments on earlier versions of the manuscript, and to Alison Garside for linguistic proofreading.

This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.","[Langer-Jaesrich, Miriam; Kienle, Cornelia; Koehler, Heinz-R.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Anim Physiol Ecol, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany; [Gerhardt, Almut] LimCo Int, D-49477 Ibbenburen, Germany","Langer-Jaesrich, M (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Anim Physiol Ecol, Konrad Adenauer Str 20, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany.",langermiriam@gmx.de; cornelia.kienle@gmx.de; Heinz-R.Koehler@uni-tuebingen.de; Almutg@web.de,"Kienle, Cornelia/ABG-5199-2020; Kohler, Heinz-R./AAL-1350-2021","Kienle, Cornelia/0000-0002-7695-6549; ",,,,53,15,16,0,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,OCT,2010,19,7,,,,,1294,1301,,10.1007/s10646-010-0516-x,,,8,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,666HN,WOS:000283105500014,20628814,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-24,

In Moorea, French Polynesia, surveys were used to quantify habitat association for juvenile Thalassoma hardwicke and 7 sympatric labroid species. Having identified the 3 species most similar to focal T. hardwicke in habitat association, a field assay was used to determine if the presence of larger individuals of these species adversely affected the survival of focal individuals. Finally, a field experiment was used to test how competition with larger residents and structural refuge interact to influence survival of transplanted T. hardwicke. Surveys demonstrated that Gomphosus varius, Pseudocheilinus hexataenia, and T. quinquevittatum were most similar to T. hardwicke in habitat association. In the field assay, the presence of T. quinquevittatum had the greatest negative effect on survival of T. hardwicke. The field experiment revealed that competition with T. quinquevittatum and structural refuge both altered T. hardwicke survival, although their effects were not interactive. Survival of T. hardwicke was 2.3 times greater in treatments without T. quinquevittatum relative to those with T. quinquevittatum, and 2.8 times greater in treatments with structural refuge relative to those without structural refuge. The additive effect may have occurred via the establishment of social dominance hierarchies between transplanted T. hardwicke and resident T. quinquevittatum independently of structural refuge, suggesting that it is important to account for interactions occurring independently of resources when examining resource competition.","Victoria Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Sch Biol Sci, POB 6140, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",shane.geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; VUW; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology","C.

However, there is growing evidence that negative interactions among distantly related taxa also occur and may be far more important than previously thought. In this study, we took advantage of an 11-year-old replicated vertebrate-exclosure experiment in a coastal dune community in northern California, USA, to examine the effects of the two most common vertebrate herbivores (jackrabbits and black-tailed deer) on the abundance of the three most visible invertebrate herbivores (two snail, a moth, and a grasshopper species). Our results indicate that four of the six possible pairwise interactions were significantly negative for the invertebrates. Jackrabbits reduced the abundances of snails by 44-75%, tiger moth caterpillars by 36%, and grasshoppers by 62%. Deer reduced the abundances of snails by 32%, increased the abundances of caterpillars by 31%, and had no measurable effect on grasshopper abundance. Our data also revealed that jackrabbits significantly decreased the volume of forbs and common shrubs and the flowering by grasses in our study plots. We were unable to detect an effect of deer on these measures of vegetation. These results suggest that by changing vegetation, jackrabbits may reduce invertebrate populations that are limited by food, protective structures, or microclimate provided by plants. Of these three mechanisms, only shade was strongly supported as limiting snail numbers in smaller-scale manipulations. In most systems, as in this one, the number of pairs of distantly related herbivores far exceeds the number of pairs of congeners. Since interactions among distantly related herbivores may be common in many cases, these interactions are likely to be important and should receive far more attention from ecologists.","[Huntzinger, Mikaela] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Cushman, Hall] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA","Huntzinger, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,40,35,37,0,51,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2008,89,7,,,,,1972,1980,,10.1890/07-0834.1,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,331JC,WOS:000258007500019,18705383,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-24,

These studies have found that increasing enemy diversity can strengthen, weaken, and not affect prey suppression, demonstrating that multi-enemy effects on prey are context-dependent. Here we ask how one factor, plant species identity, influences multi-enemy effects on prey. We focused on two plant species of agricultural importance, potato (Solanum tuberosum), and collards (Brassica oleracea L.). These species share a common herbivorous pest, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), but vary in structural and chemical traits that affect aphid reproductive rates and which may also influence inter-enemy interactions. In a large-scale field experiment, overall prey exploitation varied dramatically among the plant species, with enemies reducing aphid populations by similar to 94% on potatoes and similar to 62% on collards. Increasing enemy diversity similarly strengthened aphid suppression on both plants, however, and there was no evidence that plant species identity significantly altered the relationship between enemy diversity and prey suppression. Microcosm experiments suggested that, on both collards and potatoes, intraspecific competition among natural enemies exceeded interspecific competition. Enemy species showed consistent and significant differences in where they foraged on the plants, and enemies in the low-diversity treatment tended to spend less time foraging than enemies in the high-diversity treatment. These data suggest that increasing enemy diversity may strengthen aphid suppression because interspecific differences in where enemies forage on the plant allow for greater resource partitioning. Further, these functional benefits of diversity appear to be robust to changes in plant species identity.","[Straub, Cory S.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99163 USA","Straub, CS (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",straub@entomology.wisc.edu,,"Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",,,,49,80,82,2,94,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2008,89,6,,,,,1605,1615,,10.1890/07-0657.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,310OZ,WOS:000256540300014,18589525,,,,2021-09-24,

A field study, spanning the 1990s, describes a rapid decline of the Fucus spp. stands along the wave-exposed Swedish southeast coast. During this period, a relative dominance of Fucus vesiculosus L. shifted to a relative dominance of Fucus serratus L. The decline of F. vesiculosus coincided with observations of large numbers of the grazing isopods Idotea baltica (Pallas) and Idotea granulosa Rathke, or with field observations of frequent grazing marks on Fucus fronds. I. baltica, but not I. granulosa, tended to aggregate in the declining Fucus spp. stands, indicating a strong preference for Fucus spp. In a mesocosm experiment I. baltica, when given a choice, grazed both Fucus species at weak water motion. At strong water motion grazing was concentrated on F. vesiculosus. It is hypothesized that one of the reasons I. baltica preferred F. vesiculosus to F. serratus at strong water motion may have been differences in habitat quality, like width of thallus, influencing the ability to cling to the plant. Smaller thallus, as in F. vesiculosus, thus is the preferred habitat for grazing of I. blatica. We postulate that the existence of F. serratus in the area may be favoured by strong wave action and moderate but not strong grazing by I. baltica, relaxing the interspecific competition from F. vesiculosus.","Kalmar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Engkvist, R (corresponding author), Kalmar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.",roland.engkvist@hik.se,,,,,,48,21,21,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

Growth was strongly negatively density-dependent for both juveniles and subadults. We then used sediment of low organic content (loss on ignition 3.7 %) to test whether the density-dependence of growth was due to a direct crowding effect at high density, or mainly due to food limitation. Using an intermediate amphipod density (2800 ind. m(-2)) expected to give clear growth depression, we added baker's yeast as supplementary food at 6 levels corresponding to an input of 0 (control) to 147 g C m(-2) over an 8 wk period. The 3 highest yeast additions resulted in black, reduced sediment and elevated amphipod mortality in some replicates, but where the sediment did not become reduced, food additions enhanced growth significantly, demonstrating that growth depression at high density was primarily due to food limitation and not to crowding as such.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Stockholm, Asko Lab, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Elmgren, R (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",ragnar_e@system.ecology.su.se,"Elmgren, Ragnar/A-1854-2013",,,,,54,18,18,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The relationships between the activity time and frequency, biological factors (perceived predation risk, food resources, and species composition), and abiotic factors (temperature, air moisture, wind speed) were analysed using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Our results showed that: (1) relative humidity mainly affected activities in the springtime; temperature, relative humidity and interspecific competition mainly affected activities in the summertime; relative humidity and perceived predation risk mainly influenced activities in the autumn. (2) The activity pattern of the Siberian jerboa altered depending on the season. The activity of the Siberian jerboa was found to be bimodal in spring and summer, and was trimodal in autumn. The activity time and frequency in autumn were significantly lower than the spring. (3) Animals possess the ability to integrate disparate sources of information about danger to optimize energy gain. The jerboa adapted different responses to predation risks and competition in different seasons according to the demand for food resources.","[Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Rodent Res Ctr, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Minist Educ, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Fu, Heping] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hohhot, Peoples R China","Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Rodent Res Ctr, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",fuheping@126.com; wuxiaodong_hgb@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [32060256, 32060395, 31772667]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [2018MS03014, 2019MS03012]; Key Project of the Education Department of Inner Mongolia [NJZZ17055]; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Grassland Resources","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 32060256, 32060395, 31772667], the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [grant numbers 2018MS03014, 2019MS03012], the Key Project of the Education Department of Inner Mongolia [grant number NJZZ17055], and the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Grassland Resources.

Changes in this key functional trait can therefore have important implications for populations as well. For example, among invertebrates, there is typically a positive correlation between female body size and reproductive output. Increasing body size can consequently trigger changes in population density, population structure (e.g. adult to juvenile ratio) and the strength of intraspecific competition. Body size changes have been documented in several species in the Arctic, a region that is warming rapidly. In particular, wolf spiders, one of the most abundant arctic invertebrate predators, are becoming larger and therefore more fecund. Whether these changes are affecting their populations and role within food webs is currently unclear. We investigated the population structure and feeding ecology of the dominant wolf spider species Pardosa lapponica at two tundra sites where adult spiders naturally differ in mean body size. Additionally, we performed a mesocosm experiment to investigate how variation in wolf spider density, which is likely to change as a function of body size, influences feeding ecology and its sensitivity to warming. We found that juvenile abundance is negatively associated with female size and that wolf spiders occupied higher trophic positions where adult females were larger. Because female body size is positively related to fecundity in P. lapponica, the unexpected finding of fewer juveniles with larger females suggests an increase in density-dependent cannibalism as a result of increased intraspecific competition for resources. Higher rates of density-dependent cannibalism are further supported by the results from our mesocosm experiment, in which individuals occupied higher trophic positions in plots with higher wolf spider densities. We observed no changes in wolf spider feeding ecology in association with short-term experimental warming. Our results suggest that body size variation in wolf spiders is associated with variation in intraspecific competition, feeding ecology and population structure. Given the widespread distribution of wolf spiders in arctic ecosystems, body size shifts in these predators as a result of climate change could have implications for lower trophic levels and for ecosystem functioning.","[Koltz, Amanda M.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Wright, Justin P.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA","Koltz, AM (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",akoltz@wustl.edu,,"Wright, Justin/0000-0002-9102-5347","Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International; Lewis and Clark Fund; Arctic Institute of North America; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1210704]; Alaska Geographic; Discover Denali Research Fellowship; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Kappa Delta Foundation","\Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International; Lewis and Clark Fund; Arctic Institute of North America; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1210704; Alaska Geographic; Discover Denali Research Fellowship; National Geographic Society; Kappa Delta Foundation",,85,4,4,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We used the LoCoH algorithm to generate polygons describing the home ranges used by Warpaint Shiners.

Rainbow Trout did not significantly affect the edge/area ratio of Warpaint Shiner home ranges. Warpaint Shiner density (two and five fish treatments) did not significantly affect any response variable.

Therefore understanding which characteristics or mechanisms contribute to their invasive success is important. Here the role of symbiotic microsporidia in the hemolymph of H. axyridis was investigated in the context of intraguild predation between wild-caught H. axyridis and the native ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata. The microsporidia were recently discussed to contribute to the unpalatability of Harmonia for other coccinellids during intraguild predation and to function as biological weapons. In the present study, visual detection of microsporidia in hemolymph samples revealed that 73.5% of H. axyridis were infected. Intraguild predation experiments between larvae of the two species showed a significant competitive advantage for H. axyridis, even against larger larvae of C. septempunctata. Adult C. septempunctata always killed and fed on H. axyridis larvae. However only 11.4% (4 of 47) of C. septempunctata that fed on infected H. axyridis died within 4 months. In contrast to previous studies this suggests that microsporidia or harmonine, the chemical defense compound of H. axyridis, do not lead to death of C. septempunctata preying on larvae of H. axyridis. Instead our results support the idea that competitive advantage during intraguild predation greatly facilitates the success of H. axyridis and that this may help this highly invasive species to outcompete native species. The impact of microsporidia on Harmonia itself as well as on interspecific interactions require further studies.","[Gegner, Tobias; Otti, Oliver; Tragust, Simon; Feldhaar, Heike] Univ Bayreuth, Anim Populat Ecol, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Feldhaar, H (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Anim Populat Ecol, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",feldhaar@uni-bayreuth.de,"Otti, Oliver/AAH-2963-2021; Tragust, Simon/D-2927-2018; Feldhaar, Heike/AAB-8678-2020","Otti, Oliver/0000-0002-2361-9661; Tragust, Simon/0000-0002-3675-9583; Feldhaar, Heike/0000-0001-6797-5126",,,,39,5,6,1,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1672-9609,1744-7917,,INSECT SCI,Insect Sci.,JUN,2015,22,3,,,,,353,359,,10.1111/1744-7917.12224,,,7,Entomology,Entomology,CI8EV,WOS:000355003400004,25829258,,,,2021-09-24,

While it is recognized that evolution will play a role in determining how environmental changes directly affect species, the interactions among species force us to consider the coevolutionary responses of species to environmental changes. Methodology/Principle Findings: We use simple models of competition, predation, and mutualism to organize and synthesize the ways coevolution modifies species interactions when climatic changes favor one species over another. In cases where species have conflicting interests (i.e., selection for increased interspecific interaction strength on one species is detrimental to the other), we show that coevolution reduces the effects of climate change, leading to smaller changes in abundances and reduced chances of extinction. Conversely, when species have nonconflicting interests (i.e., selection for increased interspecific interaction strength on one species benefits the other), coevolution increases the effects of climate change. Conclusions/Significance: Coevolution sets up feedback loops that either dampen or amplify the effect of environmental change on species abundances depending on whether coevolution has conflicting or nonconflicting effects on species interactions. Thus, gaining a better understanding of the coevolutionary processes between interacting species is critical for understanding how communities respond to a changing climate. We suggest experimental methods to determine which types of coevolution (conflicting or nonconflicting) drive species interactions, which should lead to better understanding of the effects of coevolution on species adaptation. Conducting these experiments across environmental gradients will test our predictions of the effects of environmental change and coevolution on ecological communities.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Northfield, TD (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Ctr Trop Biodivers & Climate Change, Cairns, Qld, Australia.",tobin.northfield@jcu.edu.au,"Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X",USDA Postdoctoral fellowship [WISW-2010-05109],"TDN was supported by a USDA Postdoctoral fellowship (#WISW-2010-05109).

AimsTo investigate whether food limitation of House Sparrow population size during the winter varied spatially in relation to agricultural landscape intensification and farm management. MethodsWe experimentally increased the winter food supply for populations on farmsteads in replicated landscapes that differed in agricultural intensification (open plains versus mixed farming) and/or farm management (crop farming versus animal husbandry), and estimated possible differences in effects on winter population change. ResultsWe found no effect of supplementary winter feeding on changes in House Sparrow population sizes over the winter, irrespective of agricultural landscape type or presence of animal husbandry at the farm. However, we found a significantly larger winter population decline in mixed farmland and when farms contained animal husbandry. ConclusionsThe results suggest that House Sparrow populations in south Swedish farmland are not primarily limited by winter food availability. Alternatively, supplemental winter feeding may augment interspecific competition or attracts predators, offsetting any positive effect on population change. However, the stronger population decline in landscapes in which more breeding resources may be available (animal husbandry farms, mixed farmland), suggests stronger intraspecific competition during the winter in line with the resource separation hypothesis.","[Von Post, Maria; Stjernman, Martin; Smith, Henrik G.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Sect, Lund, Sweden; [Smith, Henrik G.] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden","Von Post, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Sect, Lund, Sweden.",maria_von.post@biol.lu.se,,,"Stiftelsen Oscar och Lilli Lamms minne; FORMAS (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning)Swedish Research Council Formas; Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet; SYSAV Natur- och Viltvard","We would like to thank all the farmers that were involved in this study and that helped out filling up the stations.

In addition to direct predator-prey relations, many other interactions (competition, facilitation, inhibition, etc.) may be key to the structure and functioning of communities. Such interactions often occur between species belonging to the same trophic level, and have already been demonstrated between species of bacterial-feeding nematodes, but the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Hence, iris difficult to predict their outcome under changing environmental conditions like pollution. Scientists and policy makers have come up with standardized tests to establish environmentally acceptable levels of pollution. In this experiment, we demonstrate how sublethal levels of contaminants can affect not only the fitness of two nematode species but also the way in which these species interact. We performed monospecific and combined culture experiments with two species of soil bacterivorous nematodes, Acrobeloides nanus and Plectus parvus, under optimal conditions and compared the outcome with trials in which the nematodes were exposed to a series of sublethal cadmium concentrations. By evaluating fitness and outcome of interspecific interactions based on their abundance, our results (a) confirm the considerably higher tolerance of A. nanus than that of P. parvus to Cd: (b) demonstrate mutual facilitation between both species: (c) highlight that differential tolerance to pollution between bacterivorous species may affect the balance and outcome of their interactions leading to counterintuitive results such as a higher population fitness of one species (A. nanus) under increased pollution.

We identify 7 long-term studies of population changes in Myodes in North America. Using autoregressive and spectral analysis, we found that only 2 of the 7 show 3- to 5-year cycles like those found in some Eurasian populations. There was no relationship between latitude and cycling. The general lack of cyclicity is associated with two key aspects of their demography that act in tandem: first, poor overwinter survival in most years; second, chronically low densities, with irregular outbreak years. Eight factors might explain why some Myodes populations fluctuate in cycles and others fluctuate irregularly, and we review the evidence for each factor: food supplies, nutrients, predation, interspecific competition, disease, weather, spacing behavior and interactive effects. Of these eight, only food supplies appear to be sufficient to explain the differences between cyclic and non-cyclic populations. Irregular fluctuations are the result of pulsed food supplies in the form of berry crops (M. rutilus) or tree seeds (M. gapperi) linked to weather patterns. We argue that, to understand the cause for the patterns in the respective hemispheres, we must know the mechanism(s) driving population change and this must be linked to rigorous field tests. We suggest that a large-scale, year-round feeding experiment should improve overwintering survival, increase standing densities, and flip non-cyclic Myodes populations into cyclic dynamics that would mimic the patterns seen in the cyclic populations found in parts of Eurasia.","[Boonstra, Rudy] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Krebs, Charles J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Boonstra, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",boonstra@utsc.utoronto.ca; krebs@zoology.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We dedicate this paper to the memory of William (Bill) A.

Theoretical models predict that genetic or phenotypic variance within species can alter interspecific interactions, and experiments have shown that genotypic diversity in clonal species can impact a wide range of ecological processes. To extend these studies to quantitative trait variation within populations, we experimentally manipulated the variance in body size of threespine stickleback in enclosures in a natural lake environment. We found that body size of stickleback in the lake is correlated with prey size and (to a lesser extent) composition, and that stickleback can exert top-down control on their benthic prey in enclosures. However, a six-fold contrast in body size variance had no effect on the degree of diet variation among individuals, or on the abundance or composition of benthic or pelagic prey. Interestingly, post-hoc analyses revealed suggestive correlations between the degree of diet variation and the strength of top-down control by stickleback. Our negative results indicate that, unless the correlation between morphology and diet is very strong, ecological variation among individuals may be largely decoupled from morphological variance. Consequently we should be cautious in our interpretation both of theoretical models that assume perfect correlations between morphology and diet, and of empirical studies that use morphological variation as a proxy for resource use diversity.","[Ingram, Travis] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ingram, Travis] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Ingram, T (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",ingram@zoology.ubc.ca,"Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015","Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296",David and Lucille Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1300426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by a David and Lucille Packard Foundation grant to DIB, and TI was funded by a National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGS-D3 award.

We hypothesized that in response to artificial illumination A. cahirinus will decrease its activity and A. russatus will increase its activity, and thus temporal overlap and interspecific competition could increase. Our study took place in 4 field enclosures: the 1st and 3rd months were controls with natural light, and in the 2nd month artificial illumination, simulating low levels of light pollution, was set for the first 3 h of the night. We implanted temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters to monitor mouse activity, and individual identification tags with automonitored foraging patches were used to track foraging behavior. A. cahirinus decreased activity and foraging with artificial lighting, restricting movement particularly in less-sheltered microhabitats, probably because of increased predation risk. Because illumination restricted both activity time and space, intraspecific encounters of A. cahirinus over foraging patches increased during and following the illuminated hours. However, diurnal A. russatus did not expand its activity into the illuminated hours, possibly due to the presence of competing A. cahirinus, or to nonfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, overt interspecific competition was not affected by experimental light pollution. Light pollution had a negative influence by reducing overall activity and producing a relatively underexploited temporal niche, which may promote invasion of alien species that are less light sensitive; and by increasing intraspecific overlap in foraging A. cahirinus.","[Rotics, Shay; Dayan, Tamar; Kronfeld-Schor, Noga] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Rotics, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",shayroti@post.tau.ac.il,"Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/AAU-3792-2020","Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/0000-0002-5224-3341",,,,59,57,58,1,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

Fouling epifauna are generally believed to reduce the settlement of interspecific larvae through competitive exclusion and predation. Studies of these interactions, however, often utilize artificial settlement panels, which can exhibit different recruitment patterns to those observed on natural substrates. Native (Crassostrea virginica) and non-native (Crassostrea ariakensis) oyster larvae were exposed to reef-collected shells, each supporting a single species of reef-associated fauna, over a series of laboratory microcosm studies. The presence of adult bryozoans (Membranipora tenuis) had little effect on rates of larval settlement or mortality. The boring sponge (Cliona sp.) significantly decreased oyster larval settlement, and generally increased oyster mortality. Barnacles (Balanus improvisus) typically facilitated settlement. Barnacle molds and empty barnacle tests, intended to mimic the surface area and rugosity of live barnacles, did not significantly affect settlement. In some trials, adult barnacle bathwater enhanced settlement of oyster larvae, highlighting the importance of waterborne cues. Barnacle bathwaters, adult clam worm (Neanthes succinea) bathwaters and bathwaters created using adult oysters were all found to cause oyster larval mortality. Predation by clam worms, which were observed at very high densities on field-collected oyster shells, caused significant oyster larval mortality in these experiments. The combined effects of positive and negative interactions between oyster larvae and resident invertebrate reef fauna require enumeration under field conditions. The results from this study highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of settlement behavior and mortality sources of recruiting oyster larvae. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the degu, Octodon degas. Although we detected small transitory effects of predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of principal small mammal species such as O. degas and the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Nino events) which trigger ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment. in 1997-2000 verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts to other important community components including birds and insects in order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and that more frequent El Ninos in conjunction with global climatic change may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident.","[Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile; [Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas, La Serena, Chile; [Meserve, Peter L.; Previtali, M.

Many stress types acting on the intensity of intracellular protein can induce expression of heat shock proteins. Here, we studied changes in expression level of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), one of the best investigated stress proteins, in response to five potential stress factors in the planarian flatworm Schmidtea polychroa: (1) homogenized planarian tissue, which releases an alarm substance that signals predation injury, (2) physical damage by puncturing, (3) a simulation of ecological competition by adding a mixture of naturally co-occurring species: one Dendrocoelum and two Polycelis flatworms, one Asellus water louse and one leech, and (4) magnesium chloride, which inhibits regeneration ability. We found that alarm substance (1), physical harm (2), and magnesium chloride (4) led to increased expression of Hsp70, while interspecific competition (3) did not result in elevated Hsp70 expression. There was no difference between the experimental negative control and two temporal controls immediately after collection and just before the experiment. Results show that Schmidtea polychroa is not sensitive to sampling and lab maintenance. However, planarian homogenate, magnesium chloride and physical harm all caused Hsp70-inducing stress. We conclude that Hsp70 quantification is appropriate to study the current stress level in planaria in response to specific conditions.","[Navarro, Beatriz Sanchez; Michiels, Nico K.; D'Souza, Thomas G.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Fac Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Koehler, Heinz-R.] Univ Tubingen, Fac Biol, Inst Evolut & Ecol, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany","Navarro, BS (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Fac Biol, Morgenstelle 28, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",beatriz.sanchez-navarro@uni-tuebingen.de,"Michiels, Nico K/A-2045-2009; D'Souza, Thomas/A-2284-2009; Kohler, Heinz-R./AAL-1350-2021","Michiels, Nico K/0000-0001-9873-3111; ",German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [MI 482/11]; Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen,"We thank Milosz Olczak and Gregor Schulte for collecting flatworms and Nadine Timmermeyer for the assistance during the experiment.

In the common buzzard Buteo buteo, the 3 color morphs vary in lifetime reproductive success (LRS), but the proximate mechanisms leading to these differences are unknown. We first confirmed the stability of the fitness differences found previously, using a greatly extended LRS data set. To find potential causes for these differences, we experimentally studied variation in aggressive behavior of the morphs, both against an interspecific predator and intraspecific competitors. The morphs showed substantial variation in aggressive behavior. Light-colored males were most aggressive toward an interspecific predator, followed by intermediate and dark males. In females, this pattern was reversed, resulting in sex-related differences of aggression in 2 morphs. When defending their territory against intraspecific competitors, no absolute difference in aggression was found, but the morphs reacted strongest toward intruders of a morph similar to their own. This suggests that aggression differs both between and within morphs, leading to a complex pattern on the population level. Coupled with the strong fitness differences, our results suggest that the genetic basis of the polymorphism has far-reaching behavioral consequences.","[Boerner, M.; Krueger, O.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England","Boerner, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",mb549@cam.ac.uk,,,European Trust scholarship; Royal Society Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London,European Trust scholarship to M.

We conducted an experiment to evaluate how pond hydroperiod affected the ability of two larval anuran species (Hyla squirella and Bufo terrestris) to interact with intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Pond hydroperiod altered how an increase in the abundance of intraspecific competitors affected fitness components of B. terrestris but not for H. squirella. Specifically, an increase in intraspecific abundance caused a reduction in B. terrestris survivorship in short hydroperiod ponds but had no effect on fitness components of B. terrestris in long hydroperiod ponds. Interspecific competition did not occur between these species in either short or long hydroperiod ponds. Our study highlights the point that the strength of density-dependent processes operating in the aquatic environment can depend on pond hydroperiod. Consequently, the extent to which processes operating in the aquatic environment contribute to the regulation of population and metapopulation size for amphibians will also likely depend on pond hydroperiod.","[Rogers, Tracy Noel; Chalcraft, David R.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Chalcraft, DR (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",chalcraftd@ecu.edu,,"Chalcraft, David/0000-0002-2165-0948",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716558],"This work was completed in partial fulfillment of the degree requirements for a Master of Science degree at East Carolina University.

This study investigated the interaction between egos of the lizard Mabuya longicaudata Hallowell and two species of ant: a lizard egg commensalist (Paratrechina longicornis Latreille), and an egg predator (Pheidole taivanensis Forel). The ecological interaction between P. longicornis and lizard eggs was tested, and it was predicted that when the interaction was removed, lizard eggs would be attacked by P. taivanensis. 2. Field observations showed that both ant species actively searched for lizard eggs, and that P taivanensis typically found new lizard nests earlier than P. longicornis did. Left undisturbed, P taivanensis predation dramatically reduced lizard egg survival. While P. longicornis usually found nests later, they were able to displace P taivanensis. As a result, proportional egg survival was higher in nests with P. longicornis (0.95 +/- 0.04 eggs) compared to nests without either ant species (0.65 +/- 0.09 eggs), or nests occupied by P. taivanensis (0.07 +/- 0.02 eggs). 3. When P. longicornis ants were experimentally excluded from lizard nests, the proportion of eggs surviving significantly decreased because of increased P. taivallensis predation. Paratrechina longicornis benefits from water that condenses on the eggs. When this resource disappears P. longicornis abandons the nest, leading to predation of the eggs by P. taivanensis.","[Huang, Wen-San] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, 1 Kuan Chien Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan; [Huang, Wen-San] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Huang, WS (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, 1 Kuan Chien Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",wshuang@mail.nmns.edu.tw,,"Huang, Wen-San/0000-0003-0073-3557",,,,15,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The responses of Moina micrura (Cladocera) to slight salinity increases (up to 6.0) were evaluated through laboratory manipulative experiments and field observations at Cabiunas lagoon (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). From the field data, a positive relationship between M. micrura density and salinity was observed, whereas the opposite was found for other co-occurring microcrustaceans. Life-table observations from laboratory experiments showed better performance of individuals exposed to control conditions (no salt addition) and 1.0 and 2.0 of salinity. The difference between field and laboratory results may be explained considering possible direct and indirect effects of salinity on M. micrura populations. Salinity may have direct negative physiological effects in individuals. However, under natural conditions, M. micrura might benefit from reduced invertebrate predation and interspecific competition. This balance between negative and positive effects of salinity is probably more positive under natural conditions, explaining the success of M. micrura in Cabiunas lagoon under mild salinity conditions. Although salinity negatively affects many species living in freshwater systems, slight increases may be beneficial for some species under natural conditions.","[Santangelo, Jayme M.; Bozelli, Reinaldo L.; Rocha, Adriana de M.; Esteves, Francisco de A.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Esteves, Francisco de A.] Nucleo Pesquisas Ecol & Desenvolvimento Socioambi, BR-28970 Macae, RJ, Brazil","Bozelli, RL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373,POB 68020, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",bozelli@biologia.ufrj.br,"Santangelo, Jayme M/B-5922-2011; Bozelli, Reinaldo/S-6414-2019; Bozelli, Reinaldo L/G-1805-2012","Bozelli, Reinaldo L/0000-0001-9916-1629",CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CNPq-PeldConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); PetrobrasFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Amapa (FAPEAP)Petrobras; Pronex; FaperjFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ),"The authors thank the staff of the Laboratorio de Limnologia da UFRJ and NUPEM/UFRJ, especially Joao Marcelo Souza for field assistance.

Although less well documented, nest raiding by invasive ants may also contribute to the extirpation of native ants. In coastal southern California, for example, invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) commonly raid colonies of the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex subnitidus. On a seasonal basis the frequency and intensity of raids vary, but raids occur only when abiotic conditions are suitable for both species. In the short term these organized attacks cause harvester ants to cease foraging and to plug their nest entrances. In unstaged, one-on-one interactions between P. subnitidus and L. humile workers, Argentine ants behaved aggressively in over two thirds of all pair-wise interactions, despite the much larger size of P. subnitidus. The short-term introduction of experimental Argentine ant colonies outside of P. subnitidus nest entrances stimulated behaviors similar to those observed in raids: P. subnitidus decreased its foraging activity and increased the number of nest entrance workers (many of which labored to plug their nest entrances). Raids are not likely to be the result of competition for food. As expected, P. subnitidus foraged primarily on plant material (85% of food items obtained from returning foragers), but also collected some dead insects (7% of food items). In buffet-style choice tests in which we offered Argentine ants food items obtained from P. subnitidus, L. humile only showed interest in dead insects. In other feeding trials L. humile consistently moved harvester ant brood into their nests (where they were presumably consumed) but showed little interest in freshly dead workers. The raiding behavior described here obscures the distinction between interspecific competition and predation, and may well play an important role in the displacement of native ants, especially those that are ecologically dissimilar to L. humile with respect to diet.","Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Art & Design, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Holway, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dholway@ucsd.edu,,,,,,29,27,28,0,19,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0020-1812,1420-9098,,INSECT SOC,Insect.

Traditionally, spatial segregation is predicted to occur when species differ in the habitat in which they are either superior at competing for resources or less susceptible to predation. However, predictions from a behavioural model demonstrate that spatial segregation and coexistence can also occur in the absence of such interspecific trade-offs in competitive ability and vulnerability to predation. Unlike other models of competitor coexistence this model predicts that when species rank both habitat productivity and 'riskinesses' similarly, but differ slightly in their habitat-specific vulnerabilities to predators, they will tend to segregate across habitats, with the species experiencing the higher ratio of mortality risk across the habitats occurring primarily in the safer habitat. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that intraspecific trade-offs between resource availability and mortality risk can lead to spatial segregation of competing species by (1) documenting the spatial (i.e. intertidal) distribution of two marine snails, Littorina sitkana and L. subrotundata and (2) performing field experiments to quantify growth and mortality rates of each species at 'low' and 'high' intertidal heights. Our results indicate that both species agree on the rankings of habitat riskiness and productivity, experiencing higher predation and higher growth in low- than in high-intertidal habitats. However, L. sitkana and L. subrotundata experienced differences in their habitat-specific mortality risks and growth rates. Despite both species being similarly at risk of predation in high-intertidal habitats (where mortality was lower), L. subrotundata was subject to significantly higher mortality than L. sitkana at the low-intertidal height. In contrast, growth rate differences between habitats were greater for L. sitkana than for L. subrotundata. Whereas both species grew at the same rate at the high-intertidal level (where growth was lower), L. sitkana individuals grew more rapidly than L. subrotundata snails at the low-intertidal level. As predicted by the behavioural model, the species that experienced the higher ratio of mortality across habitats (i.e. L. subrotundata) occurred exclusively in the safer, high-intertidal habitat. Taken together, these results provide support for the hypothesis that spatial segregation, and potentially competitor coexistence, can occur in the absence of interspecific trade-offs in resource acquisition ability or vulnerability to predation.","Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Rochette, R (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, POB 5050, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada.",rochette@unbsj.ca,,"Rochette, Remy/0000-0003-3390-8413",,,,35,5,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2004,105,3,,,,,512,524,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12367.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,821CT,WOS:000221438100007,,,,,2021-09-24,

In this paper, I describe how the competitive interaction between two species of gall forming fly, Lipara lucens and L. rufitarsis, is modified as a consequence of interactions with a host plant and natural enemies. The results of field experiments and observations of wild populations show that the two species compete strongly for stems of the common reed, Phragmites australis. L. lucens is competitively inferior, having significantly increased mortality in the presence of heterospecifics. No lasting negative effects of interspecific competition on L. rufitarsis could be found. In fact, the results show that L. rufitarsis can benefit from the presence of heterospecifics. It can usurp the galls of L. lucens, and experiences reduced mortality and increased fecundity as a result. Thus, L. rufitarsis can be described as a kleptoparasite. Kleptoparasitism in this system is mediated by the host plant and by the principal parasitoid of L. rufitarsis. L. rufitarsis can only benefit from the presence of its competitor because L. lucens induces P. australis to form a large, robust gall that repels the attacks of the ichneumonid wasp Endromopoda phragmitidis. These results show how facultative kleptoparasitism can modify the ecological consequences of interspecific competition for both individuals and populations.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England","Reader, T (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",,"Reader, Tom/B-5518-2008","Reader, Tom/0000-0001-7586-8814",,,,50,15,16,0,16,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2003,103,1,,,,,101,112,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12575.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,735LZ,WOS:000186118000011,,,,,2021-09-24,

These systems exhibit considerable regional variability in percentage cover and in the strength of interspecific interactions, which may be due largely to effects of varying larval supply. In Oregon and Washington, experimental studies of space allocation among sessile invertebrates have emphasized the role of benthic processes such as competition and predation. In contrast, studies in central California have emphasized the importance of larval supply. In this article, we identify a gradient in per centage cover in the middle and upper intertidal zone that is consistent with an oceanographically based explanation for these differences: percentage cover of mussels and barnacles is much higher in Oregon, where nearshore circulation promotes high recruitment, than in California, where strong offshore currents inhibit recruitment. A mathematical model incorporating larval transport and interspecific competition for space offers an explanation for the one violation of the hypothesis-higher percentage cover of Chthamalus spp. in California.

Environmental factors facilitating early growth and survival of shad plus potential interspecific competition for zooplankton may reduce growth and survival of YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), another common species in reservoirs. We hypothesized that fewer YOY bluegill moving from the limnetic zone to the littoral zone in late spring probably slows or prevents the ontogenetic switch to piscivory by YOY largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), reducing their oversummer growth, overwinter survival, and hence recruitment to their second year. To determine whether shad and bluegill abundances indeed vary inversely in reservoirs, we quantified densities of YOY shad and bluegill in four reservoirs across several years (1987-1994; N = 22 reservoir-years). To assess how YOY bluegill abundance influenced the ontogenetic dietary switch to fish by largemouth bass, we conducted experiments with differing levels of realism and control (4-m(2) littoral cages, 4.5-m(2) outdoor pools, and 0.33-m(2) laboratory aquaria). In reservoirs, peak YOY bluegill density declined weakly in the limnetic zone but strongly in the littoral zone when peak limnetic YOY Dorosoma spp. exceeded 10 individuals/m(3). In pools and aquaria, largemouth bass grew more rapidly at greater than or equal to 3 than at zero bluegill per largemouth bass. Using known temperatures and largemouth bass growth in a bioenergetics model, we discovered that YOY largemouth bass in pools and aquaria ate less than or equal to 65% of their maximum daily consumption potential (in grams of wet mass) at greater than or equal to 6 bluegill per largemouth bass. In cages, largemouth bass consumed only 40% of their maximum and grew less at bluegill abundances similar to those in pools and aquaria, probably because dense vegetation and depletion of bluegill inhibited predatory success. In reservoirs with abundant shad, reduced littoral bluegill density likely compromises first-year growth and recruitment of largemouth bass. However, variable abiotic and biotic factors may modify YOY bluegill abundance and hence invalidate our predictions for largemouth bass recruitment success. To better predict fish community structure and develop management actions for reservoir ecosystems, multi-scale experimentation should be combined with whole-system manipulations (e.g., via adaptive management) to bound these variable interactions.","Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Zool, Columbus, OH 43212 USA","Garvey, JE (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Zool, 1314 Kinnear Rd, Columbus, OH 43212 USA.",,"Garvey, James/AAO-5698-2021; Garvey, Jim/A-4919-2012","Garvey, Jim/0000-0001-5393-9351",,,,116,42,44,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We chose Oecophylla longinoda, the best known dominant species and two other Formicinae accepted on its territories: Polyrhachis laboriosa, a sub-dominant species: and P. weissi, a non-dominant species. We experimented in nature and on colonies reared on shrubs cultivated in planters. During dyadic encounters, foragers of the three species generally ignored each other. Aggressive interactions were rare and limited to intimidating postures such as opening the mandibles and raising the gaster. However, the need for protein leads arboreal ants sharing territories to prey robbing. The expected dominance hierarchy did not hold true at all levels as both O. longinoda and P. weissi rob prey from P. laboriosa. Also, foragers of P. weissi were able to follow the recruitment trails of P. laboriosa. As a result, predatory behavior is broken down into two tasks in the latter species: workers carving the prey that tolerate the presence of interspecific intruders, and other workers acting as guards. P. laboriosa guards limit the activity of the competitors thanks to allomones released during marking rounds, by drumming the gaster on the substrate, and through dissuasive postures such as opening the mandibles, raising the gaster, bending the gaster and an outstretched posture described here for the first time. We concluded that a code containing chemical and behavioral information working at the interspecific level enables ants sharing territories in the arboreal ant mosaic to defuse potentially volatile situations without the loss of individuals. These behaviors can be compared to true ritualized displays (i.e. intraspecific), and work here at the interspecific level, implying a co-evolutionary process as selective pressure.","Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, Lab Ethol & Pharmacol Comportement, F-37200 Tours, France; Univ Paris 13, CNRS, UPRESA 7025, Lab Ethol Expt & Comparee, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France","Mercier, JL (corresponding author), Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, Lab Ethol & Pharmacol Comportement, Parc Grandmont, F-37200 Tours, France.",,,"Dejean, Alain/0000-0002-3561-2248",,,,26,14,14,0,9,UNIV ESTADUAL FEIRA SANTANA,FEIRA DE SANTANA,"AV TRANSORDESTINA S N NOVO HORIZONTE, FEIRA DE SANTANA, BAHAI CEP44036-900, BRAZIL",0361-6525,,,SOCIOBIOLOGY,Sociobiology,,1998,32,1,,,,,139,150,,,,,12,Entomology,Entomology,ZW865,WOS:000074456100012,,,,,2021-09-24,

Results showed that spatial overlap (Lloyd's index and spatial distribution) was higher among adults of both species at the lower tidal elevation of l'Anse-a-l'Orignal (north-east oriented). Results also suggest weaker interspecific interactions among juveniles of both species because of limited spatial overlap, In Baie-du-Ha!Ha! (south-west oriented), spatial overlap was greater than that observed in 1'Anse-8-l'Orignal and appeal-ed important in adults as well as in juveniles. Levins' directional measure of competition indicated an asymmetric spatial overlap between N. virens and N. caeca in Baie-du-Ha!Ha! and a symmetric overlap in l'Anse-a-l'Orignal. The intraspecific encounter values, estimated from Lloyd's mathematical expression, were significantly higher than values of interspecific interactions only in l'Anse-a-l'Orignal. Moreover, no vertical stratification was found inside the sediment, with no effect of the densities and individual body weights of the polychaetes. Juveniles of both species mainly inhabited the organic-rich upper portion of the sediments (O to 12 cm), while adults colonised greater depths( > 25 cm) where organic matter content was lower. A complementary field experiment was conducted in 1993 to investigate interspecific interactions (predation and competition) existing between N. virens and N. caeca. Results from this experiment depend on which species was first-introduced and showed an important variation in mortality rates between allopatric and sympatric conditions. The influence of competition and predation on the structure of these populations is also discussed in relation to their spatial overlap.","UNIV LAVAL,GIROQ,DEPT BIOL,ST FOY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA; MUSEUM NATL HIST NAT,LAB MARITIME,F-35801 DINARD,FRANCE","Caron, A (corresponding author), UNIV QUEBEC,DEPT OCEANOG,CTR OCEANOG RIMOUSKI,310 ALLEE URSULINES,RIMOUSKI,PQ G5L 3A1,CANADA.",,,,,,,83,13,17,1,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

During the growing season of 1990, plots with average densities of 10-11 grasshoppers per m(2) were treated with carbaryl bran bait (carbaryl plots) or bran bait without carbaryl (control plots). The grasshoppers fed particularly heavily on alfalfa, driving the percent cover of this species to essentially zero by mid-August. Application of carbaryl significantly reduced the densities of three of the four major grasshopper species present (Oedaleonotus enigma, Melanoplus sanguinipes, and M. packardii),and slowed the rate with which these insects consumed the standing crop of alfalfa. In contrast, densities of the fourth major grasshopper species present, M. bivittatus, were not reduced by application of carbaryl but instead were greatly elevated. This population response may have arisen in large part as adults of M. bivittatus aggregated in carbaryl plots in response to the reduced rate of defoliation of alfalfa by other species. Greater numbers of M. bivittatus nymphs also occurred in 1991 in plots treated with versus without carbaryl in 1990 (no carbaryl was applied in 1991), as did greater numbers of O. enigma nymphs (despite there having been fewer adult females present in these plots the previous year). But the densities of grasshoppers of all species were low in all plots in 1991 (approximately 1 per m(2) by mid-summer), and no differences in percent cover of alfalfa or other Vegetation were detected in plots treated the previous year with versus without carbaryl. The striking positive response of M. bivittatus to application of carbaryl bran (and associated reductions in population sizes of competing grasshopper species) strongly suggests that intense interspecific interactions occurred at the study site in 1990.",,"EVANS, EW (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,33,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1995,73,1,,,,,73,78,,10.2307/3545727,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH161,WOS:A1995RH16100010,,,,,2021-09-24,

The environment of an individual vole can be considered to be predictable when the risks of predation and intra- and interspecific competition change with the cycle, such that both are high during the population highs of voles. The risk of predation is also high during the vole crash. After the crash, the vole population is characterized by low intra- and interspecific competition and low predation pressure. The main predators affecting voles during the crash are the small mustelids, least weasel and stoat. The density of these specialist predators declines drastically during the winter after the vole crash. We studied experimentally the impact of the perceived presence of stoats on the breeding and mating behaviour of voles. In a series of breeding experiments with bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, both old and young females suppressed breeding when exposed to the odour of stoats, Mustela erminea. The weights of females decreased in both experimental and control groups, but more among the voles under odour exposition. It seems that females actively avoided copulations under high predation risk and that breeding suppression is mediated by a change in female mating behaviour. There was no change in male behaviour or physical condition between the experimental and control treatments. An alternative mechanism for the observed breeding suppression could be the one caused by decreased feeding in females mediated with low energy intake which does not allow breeding. Regardless of its mechanism, delay of breeding should increase the probability of non-breeding females to survive to the next breeding season. The females surviving the crash should gain a strong selective advantage in a predator-free environment of the subsequent breeding season, which could explain the adaptive function of this antipredatory strategy.","UNIV JYVASKYLA,KONNEVESI RES STN,SF-Y0351 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND","YLONEN, H (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA,DEPT BIOL,POB 35,SF-Y0351 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND.",,,,,,,47,85,89,0,18,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

I investigated the hypothesis that the shortfin molly caused the decline of the Moapa dace through competition or predation on larvae, pressures not experienced by the Moapa White River springfish. Relative interspecific competition was analyzed by contrasting the ranges of spatial and dietary overlap among larval, juvenile, and adult life stages. There appeared to be moderate to low spatial overlap between the various life stages of native and nonnative fishes. Overlap in diet was highest between adult Moapa White River springfish and shortfin mollies. Laboratory experiments suggested that shortfin mollies prey vigorously upon fish larvae. In terms of spatial habitat use, Moapa White River springfish larvae were less available to adult shortfin mollies for consumption than were Moapa dace larvae.

The efficacy of the two predatory mites appeared to be strongly affected by various factors (grape variety, presence of macropredators, climatic condition, interspecific competition, phytoseiid strain). The phytoseiid mites Amblyseius aberrans (Oud.) and Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten were released at three different density levels in two vineyards (A, B) infested by Eotetranychus carpini (Oud.). One strain of A. aberrans and two strains of T. pyri were used for the experiments. In vineyard A, Panonychus ulmi (Koch) was recorded in the second and subsequent years of the experiments and became dominant over E. carpini from the third year onwards. The presence of anthocorids in the same vineyard increased the complexity of the system and gave us the possibility of comparing two very different situations. Release of low numbers of A. aberrans gave a satisfactory control of spider mite populations in both vineyards. These results were even obtained on a variety non preferred by phytoseiids (Merlot) and with the continuous presence of anthocorids (vineyard A). After 5 years, A. aberrans was observed in 53 % of the plots in vineyard A and in all plots of the other vineyard (B). Results of experiments in which T pyri was released were similar to those obtained in the experiments with A. aberrans, but only in the first year of the study. In vineyard A, the T pyri populations declined dramatically from the second year onwards; the use of a non-preferred variety (Merlot) and the continuous presence of anthocorids seemed the most important factors causing the decline of predatory mite density. In vineyard B, T pyri was capable of controlling spider mites even in the second year of the experiments. A very low density of macropredators and a preferred grape variety (Raboso) positively affected control. The density of T pyri in vineyard B decreased at the end of the second year because of adverse climatic conditions (high temperatures in combination with a low relative humidity). The decrease of T pyri allowed the displacement of this species by A. aberrans in all plots of vineyard B.

In clearly sublittoral areas S. entomon has no principal invertebrate competitors for food, but in shallow water regions odonata larvae may play a similar regulatory role on the benthic community. Against this background, the structuring role of S. entomon for the benthic infauna in shallow brackish waters was tested in relation to (a) one major invertebrate food competitor (Libellula quadrimaculata; Odonata), and (b) prey species of varying ecological origin (marine or estuarine, exemplified by Macoma balthica and Corophium volutator, and limnic, e.g. Asellus aquaticus and larval chironomids). Field and aquarium experiments illustrated that S. entomon is technically capable by predation to exhibit a regulatory pressure on all prey items offered, but that the effects at community level are difficult to distinguish from the natural variation within the ecosystem. On shallow bottoms S. entomon exhibits similar predatory effects to the larvae of the dragonfly L. quadrimaculata.

These detrimental nontarget effects motivate the use of alternative pest management strategies such as host plant resistance and intercropping. However, when alternative pest management strategies effectively suppress primary pests, they also have the potential to promote secondary pest populations via competitive release. The potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae) is a key pest of alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant cultivars are being widely adopted by growers in the Midwest and Northeast United States. We conducted a field experiment comparing leafhopper-susceptible alfalfa, leafhopper-resistant alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant alfalfa intercropped with orchardgrass. Leafhopper-resistant alfalfa reduced potato leafhopper abundance and protected the crop from protein loss, but there was no benefit of intercropping leafhopper-resistant alfalfa with orchardgrass. Importantly, the abundance of a secondary pest, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), was twice as high in the leafhopper-resistant plant treatments compared to the leafhopper-susceptible treatment. Field sampling and microcosm experiments confirmed that the increase in pea aphids was caused, at least in part, by release from competition with leafhoppers. These results suggest that, when host plant resistance against insects is employed, efforts to monitor and manage secondary pest populations are warranted.","[Straub, Cory S.] Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA; [Faselt, Jamie A.] AmeriCorps VISTA, Glacier Natl Pk,POB 125, East Glacier, MT 59343 USA; [Keyser, Erich S.] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Traugott, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Mt Agr Res, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Straub, CS (corresponding author), Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA.",cstraub@ursinus.edu,,"Straub, Cory/0000-0002-2776-1817",AFRI-USDA-NIFA [2013-02482]; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank Matthew Wismer of Northern Star Farm for planting and managing the field experiment and Mark Sulc for advice on establishing the experimental plots.

It has been postulated that recent introduction of the brown marmorated stinkbug (Halyomorpha halys (Stal)) represents an evolutionary trap for native parasitoids, as they accept H. halys egg masses as a host but produce no viable progeny. Interspecific interactions between European egg parasitoid, Trissolcus cultratus (Mayr), and an Asian parasitoid, Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead), were assessed by providing egg masses to T. cultratus at various time intervals following the initial parasitization by T. japonicus. The suitability of the host for the parasitoid development was re-assessed by providing T. cultratus with fresh and frozen egg masses of various ages. The likelihood of T. cultratus being able to attack previously parasitized egg masses was determined by assessing the duration of egg mass guarding behavior by T. japonicus following parasitization. The results of experiments examining the interspecific interactions between a native European egg parasitoid, T. cultratus, and an Asian parasitoid, T. japonicus (a candidate for the biological control of H. halys), showed that the native species can act as facultative hyperparasitoid of the exotic one. Although this is only possible during certain stages of T. japonicus development, the presence of the introduced parasitoid may reduce the impact of the evolutionary trap for indigenous parasitoid species. There is a possibility that the occurrence of facultative hyperparasitism between scelionid parasitoids associated with stinkbugs is common. This resulting intraguild predation could promote conservation and stabilization of natural communities by impacting the diversity and population dynamics of native stinkbugs and their parasitoids (e.g., by allowing native parasitoids to avoid wasting reproductive effort on unsuitable hosts), or reduce success of biological control programs (e.g., by reducing the population size of the exotic parasitoids).","[Konopka, Joanna K.; McNeil, Jeremy N.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Konopka, Joanna K.; Gariepy, Tara] Agr & Agri Food Canada, London Res & Dev Ctr, London, ON, Canada; [Konopka, Joanna K.; Haye, Tim] CABI Europe Switzerland, Delemont, Switzerland; [Mason, Peter] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Gillespie, David] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Agassiz Res & Dev Ctr, Agassiz, BC, Canada","Konopka, JK (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada.",jkonopk@uwo.ca,"Konopka, Joanna/AAL-8589-2020","Konopka, Joanna/0000-0002-0350-2757",NSERC PGS ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ESC Research Travel Scholarship,NSERC PGS Scholarship; ESC Research Travel Scholarship.,,34,22,22,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We examined how four life-history traits in Daphnia ambigua have evolved during community assembly in a recently created lake. Microfossils, preserved in sediments, suggest that D. ambigua was one of the original zooplankton colonizers, followed by Daphnia dentifera and Daphnia pulicaria. We used water column collections and dormant eggs from sediment cores to isolate 45 isofemale lines into laboratory culture, representing four time periods of lake colonization. We measured size at birth, size and time to maturity, clutch size, and juvenile growth rate and found significant differences among time periods in two of the traits, size at maturity and first clutch size. Although isofemale lines from the founding and recent population are known to differ in their competitive ability, we found no evidence that these temporal populations differ in measured life-history traits, sensitivity to resources or population growth rate. Nevertheless, our experimental results note rapid and non-directional evolution of two life-history traits, closely tied to fitness, during the assembly of this community.","[Crawford, John Williams; Redlinski, Izabella; Steiner, Christopher F.; Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Crawford, JW (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, 515 Morrill Hall,505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jwcrawf2@illinois.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0237438, DEB-0947314, DEB-1120804]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (DEB-0237438 to C.E.C., DEB-0947314 to C.E.C., and DEB-1120804 to C.E.C.).",,63,0,0,1,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

Under conditions of abundant fruit, A. spatulata was the dominant exploiter at the population level, as shown by its ability to infest the largest number of fruits of the three herbivores and substantially displace its moth competitors. In a separate experiment, when resource-partitioning species were excluded, A. spatulata infested twice as many fruits as the two moth species (44.3%). Field observations examined the ability of A. spatulata to locate suitable fruits. We found that, the variation in fruit characters influenced fruit suitability in relation to its size (4.1261 +/- 0.0272 mm [mean +/- SE]) and weight (0.0618 +/- 0.0005 mg [mean +/- SE]).

The influence of body size on coexistence is well studied under the exclusive resources framework, but has received less attention under the shared-resources framework. We investigate body-size-dependent allometric extensions of a classical MacArthur-type model where two consumers compete for two shared resources. The equilibrium coexistence criteria are compared against the general predictions of the alternative framework over exclusive resources. From the asymmetry in body size allometry of resource encounter versus demand our model shows, counterintuitively, and contrary to the exclusive resource framework, that a smaller consumer should be competitively superior across a wide range of supplies of the two resource types. Experimental studies are reviewed to resolve this difference among the two frameworks that arise from their respective assumptions over resource distribution. Another prediction is that the smaller consumer may have relatively stronger control over equilibrium resource abundance, and the loss of smaller consumers from a community may induce relatively stronger trophic cascades. Finally, from satiating consumers' functional response, our model predicts that greater difference among resource sizes can allow a broader range of consumer body sizes to coexist, and this is consistent with the predictions of the alternative framework over exclusive resources. Overall, this analysis provides an objective comparison of the two alternative approaches to understand species coexistence that have heretofore developed in relative isolation. It advances classical consumer-resource theory to show how body size can be an important factor in resource competition and coexistence.","[Bagchi, Sumanta] Texas A&M Univ, Deparment Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Bagchi, Sumanta; Ritchie, Mark E.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Bagchi, Sumanta] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, India","Bagchi, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Deparment Ecosyst Sci & Management, 325 Anim Ind Bldg, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",sumanta@ncf-india.org,,,"National Science Foundation (DDIG)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0608287, DEB-0543398]; National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; Wildlife Conservation Society; Rufford Maurice Laing Foundation","Support was received from National Science Foundation (DDIG DEB-0608287 to SB and DEB-0543398 to MER) and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (to MER) while preparing this manuscript.

These species periodically reach outbreak densities, but it is unknown if they impact the population dynamics of later developing egg-overwintering grasshopper species. Two experiments were conducted in a northern mixed-grass prairie to examine the effects of herbivory by nymph-overwintering grasshoppers on survival of an egg-overwintering grasshopper, Ageneotettix deorum. When very high densities of nymph-overwintering grasshoppers reduced grass biomass by 80%, survival of A. deorum nymphs was significantly reduced. There was no effect of early season herbivory at a lower density of 16/m(2) on survival of A. deorum nymphs. The effects of early season herbivory appear consistent with exploitative competition. Although a strong reduction in peak grass biomass caused by early season herbivory negatively affected late season grass-feeding grasshopper densities, additional research is needed to examine the potential importance of early summer herbivory on population dynamics of later developing grasshoppers.","ARS, USDA, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Branson, DH (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, No Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",dave.branson@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,28,4,5,0,10,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,ANNAPOLIS,"3 PARK PLACE, STE 307, ANNAPOLIS, MD 21401-3722 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

To shed further tight on the topic, the present work investigated the capacity of soil. microarthropods to colonise defaunated soil in the presence and absence of earthworms. Microcosms composed of plastic boxes were prepared with a central cage containing two endogeic earthworms (Hormogaster elisae). In one experiment, the cage contained defaunated natural, soil white that outside was non-defaunated. In a second experiment, the soil outside the cage was defaunated white that inside the cage was non-defaunated. All microcosms were kept at 13 degrees C with 20% soil-water content for 21 days before extracting microarthropods for enumeration by standard methods. In the first experiment, the majority of microarthropod groups were not able to colonise the defaunated soil containing earthworms, but did colonise it when earthworms were absent. In the second experiment, nearly all the microarthropod groups left the central cages containing earthworms, white in the controls without earthworms the majority stayed inside. The results indicate that different microarthropod taxa are affected unequally by the presence of the earthworms. Due to their greater mobility Tarsonemidae and sometimes Gamasida were able to colonise the defaunated soil even when earthworms were present. In contrast, Oribatida, members of which disperse slowly and are very sensitive to soil perturbations, were generally unable to colonise the soil whether earthworms were present or not. However, the presence of H. elisae had a negative effect on the numbers of most groups of microarthropods and on their ability to colonise new environments. Physico-chemical perturbations produced by endogeic earthworms acting as ecosystem engineers, competition for organic matter and passive predation are discussed as possible causes of this negative effect.

Bark beetles Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. frontalis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are known to have common pheromone components, except for exo-brevicomin, which is produced by D. brevicomis. We predicted that D. frontalis would not respond to exo-brevicomin outside of the zone of sympatry with D. brevicomis. We conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of exo-brevicomin on attraction of D. frontalis and associated species in Mississippi. We determined whether D. frontalis pheromone production differed inside and outside the sympatric zone and compared the pheromone profiles with D. brevicomis within the sympatric zone. Trapping studies revealed that D. frontalis can perceive and respond positively to exo-brevicomin, an aggregation pheromone of a sympatric congener (D. brevicomis), at locations hundreds of kilometers outside the sympatric zone. Qualitative pheromone profiles showed that both species emit similar pheromone components: frontalin, endo-brevicomin, exo-brevicomin, trans-verbenol, verbenone, and myrtenol. Although not previously reported, D. frontalis males from Arizona produced exo-brevicomin. The predator Thanasimus dubius did not discriminate traps baited with exo-brevicomin and was most attracted to traps with frontalin. Hylastes beetles were significantly attracted to traps baited with exo-brevicomin in combination with other compounds. Our results raise new practical and evolutionary questions on the role of exo-brevicomin in the behavioral ecology of D.frontalis. The addition of exo-brevicomin to the current lure might increase the efficiency of trapping programs in the southeastern United States.","[Hofstetter, Richard W.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Pureswaran, Deepa S.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Sullivan, Brian T.] USDA, US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Pineville, LA 71360 USA","Hofstetter, RW (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Box 15018, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",rich.hofstetter@nau.edu,"Pureswaran, Deepa/G-8074-2019",,,,,69,19,20,1,5,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Yet, the roles of controphic species of mosquito larvae in affecting mosquito populations have received little attention. Published empirical evidence, although scarce, suggests that controphic species such as zooplankton and anuran larvae compete with mosquito larvae, can positively affect mosquito larvae by consuming bacteria that are pathogenic to mosquito larvae, reduce predation on mosquito larvae by serving as alternative prey, and ultimately cause increased predation on mosquito larvae by causing a numerical response in the predator.

To investigate the efficacy of different behavioral tactics adopted for their acquisition (locomotion, attendance at shell-supplying sites, interactions with conspecifics in aggregation) we conducted observations and experiments at a salt marsh in New England (USA). Locomotion, fast and meandering, significantly increased the chances of encountering empty shells and conspecifics. However, shell exchanges were rare. Simulated gastropod predation sites quickly attracted a larger number of hermit crabs than the other shell-supplying sites tested (live and dead conspecifics, live snails) and induced the rapid occupancy of all the empty shells offered, usually by the first crabs arriving at the site. Aggregations seemed not to function as shell exchange markets, as previously suggested for several other species. In the short run, exploitation seems to be more efficient for the acquisition of new shells by Pagurus longicarpus. In the long run, it is the density of nondestructive gastropod predators that regulates the availability of new shells of good quality in the pool available to this hermit crab species.","Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet Leo Pardi, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Gherardi, F (corresponding author), Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet Leo Pardi, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",francesca.gherardi@unifi.it,,,,,,66,29,29,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Experiments were carried out in 260-1 mesocosms set up outdoors in a forest. These pond simulations were designed to mimic conditions that occur in palustrine temporary wetlands in cen central Pennsylvania. No animals reached metamorphosis in the short hydroperiod (56 days). However a greater proportion (66%) of tadpoles of R. sylvatica survived to the end of the 56-day treatment than the 84- or 158-day treatments (29 and 14%, respectively), from which all survivors metamorphosed. In contrast, neither of the salamanders metamorphosed by 84 days; survival to metamorphosis at 158 days was 15% for A. jeffersonianum and 10% for A. maculatum. Average instantaneous growth rates for A. jeffersonianum decreased with each increase in hydroperiod. Growth of R. sylvatica was greater in the 56-day hydroperiod than in hydroperiods of 84 or 158 days. Initial amphibian density had no effect on growth or survival of any species. It appears that salamander larvae were predatory on tadpoles, since survival of R. sylvatica was negatively correlated with survival of A. jeffersonianum in 84-day treatments and with growth of A. maculatum in 158-day treatments.","PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802",,,"Rowe, Christopher/D-5271-2012","Rowe, Christopher/0000-0001-9502-9225",,,,42,94,97,5,41,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1995,102,4,,,,,397,403,,10.1007/BF00341351,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RG164,WOS:A1995RG16400001,28306882,,,,2021-09-24,

Crabs reaching a site of a recent predatory event may not only find the shell empty but also encounter a predator. The attendance at sites where gastropods are decomposing may be less risky, but the use of these shells will depend on the crab's ability to extract the flesh. We tested the responses of two coexisting species of hermit crabs to chemical cues of potential empty shells at different levels of predatory risk and constraints to occupy it. The crabs were exposed in a Y-maze to chemical odors simulating gastropods in decomposition vs. a control, freshly predated gastropods vs. control, and gastropods in decomposition vs. predated gastropods. We also tested the ability of each species to extract the flesh of a dead snail. Contrary to expectation, individuals of both species avoided the two odors of shells. When the crabs were presented with the two chemical cues, Calcinus californiensis approached more to odors from gastropods in decomposition, whereas Clibanarius albidigitus approached more to odors from predated snails. The behavioral response of C. californiensis agrees with its greater ability to extract the flesh, which may allow it to obtain a new shell at relatively low risk. The lower ability of C. albidigitus to remove the flesh matches its preference for cues of predated gastropods rather than decomposed gastropods. Our results show that the flesh of gastropods needs not to he an obstacle to the use of their shells. The exploitation strategy sets the resource partitioning in these hermit crabs. The ability to remove the flesh, feed on dead gastropods, and occupy the shell makes hermit crabs exceptional as they exploit a limited resource as refuge and food.","[Alcaraz, Guillermina; Kruesi, Karla] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico; [Burciaga, Luis M.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico","Alcaraz, G (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico.",alcaraz@ciencias.unam.mx,,,"Posgrado en Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia, UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","We thank Sebastian Zuniga for his technical assistance.

In 2011 and 2013, experiments were conducted at Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines, to compare arthropod communities in rice plots and on levees with and without vegetation strips. Vegetation strips included spontaneous weeds, sesame and okra (2011), or mung bean (2013). The plots were treated with one of three nitrogen levels and in one experiment were planted with planthopper-resistant (IR62) and susceptible (IR64) rice varieties. Parasitoids and predators of lepidopteran pests and of the ricebug, Leptocorisa oratorius, were more abundant in high-nitrogen rice plots where their prey/hosts also had highest densities. Planthoppers and leafhoppers were more abundant in low-nitrogen plots. Weedy and sesame/okra bunds provided habitat for a range of natural enemies including spiders, parasitoids and predatory bugs, but did not have higher pest numbers than cleared bunds. Higher abundances of the predator Cythorhinuslividipennis and higher parasitism of planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) eggs by Anagrus sp. were associated with sesame/okra bunds in late season rice plots. Mung bean also provided habitat for key predators and parasitoids that spilled over to adjacent rice; however, mung bean was also associated with higher numbers of lepidopteran and grain-sucking pests in the adjacent rice, albeit without increased damage to the rice. For ricebug in particular, damage was probably reduced by higher parasitoid:pest ratios adjacent to the vegetation strips. Varietal resistance and mung bean strips had an additive effect in reducing abundance of the planthopper Sogatella furcifera and the leafhopper Nephotettix virescens. Reduced numbers of these latter pests close to vegetation strips were often compensated for by other plant-sucking bugs, thereby increasing the intensity of potentially stabilizing interspecific interactions such as competition. We highlight the benefits of diversifying rice landscapes and the need to optimize vegetation strips, e.g., by including lepidopteran trap-plants, for intensive rice production systems.","[Horgan, Finbarr G.; Crisol Martinez, Eduardo] EcoLaVerna Integral Restorat Ecol, Kildinan T56CD39, Cork, Ireland; [Crisol Martinez, Eduardo] COEXPHAL Assoc Vegetable & Fruit Growers Almeria, C Esteban Murillo 3, La Mojonera 04746, Almeria, Spain; [Stuart, Alexander M.; Bernal, Carmencita C.; de Cima Martin, Elena; Almazan, Maria Liberty P.] Int Rice Res Inst, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Fame Ramal, Angelee] Univ Philippines, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Los Banos 4030, Laguna, Philippines","Horgan, FG (corresponding author), EcoLaVerna Integral Restorat Ecol, Kildinan T56CD39, Cork, Ireland.",f.horgan@ecolaverna.org; eduardocrisol@googlemail.com; a.stuart@irri.org; c.bernal@irri.org; eledecima@gmail.com; m.l.almazan@irri.org; angelee.ramal@gmail.com,,"Horgan, Finbarr/0000-0003-3796-667X",Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP),This research was funded by the Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP) under the directorship of Achim Dobermann for research into optimizing ecosystem services in rice production landscapes.,,80,8,8,3,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,328,10.3390/insects10100328,,,28,Entomology,Entomology,JS8TI,WOS:000500573900022,31581452,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-24,

Biotic interaction data are rarely available, and when produced are seldom integrated into management plans due to their complexity of interpretation. Here we examine advances in our understanding of biotic factors that regulate behavior and life history in two rare insect species of conservation focus: the carrion-breeding American burying beetle, Nicrophorus americanus (Olivier) and the lek mating Gryllotalpa major (Saussure). Current recovery and conservation plans for both species are heavily weighted by abiotic habitat considerations, despite the likely regulation of populations by critical biotic interactions such as interspecies competition, symbioses, predation, and behavioral variation. Examples presented here support a more cohesive approach to constructing conservation management plans to prioritize the integration of ecological interaction data, and to incentivize related research leading to more effective species recovery outcomes.","[Howard, Daniel R.; Hall, Carrie L.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Biol Sci, 38 Acad Way, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Howard, DR (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Biol Sci, 38 Acad Way, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",daniel.howard@unh.edu,,"Howard, Daniel/0000-0002-4190-3746",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station; Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation; Nature Conservancy; Oklahoma Chapter,"We thank Kevin Stubbs and Anita Barstow of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Tulsa EFSO; Robert Hamilton and Jay Pruett of The Nature Conservancy of Oklahoma; Jann Hayman, Osage Nation Department of Natural Resources; and Mark Brian, Advance Ecology, Ltd. for their technical and logistical support of our work with the American burying beetle and the prairie mole cricket in Oklahoma over the past 15 yr.

However, plant quality may also be crucial in mediating herbivore interspecific interactions. This is especially true when competition occurs between distantly related herbivore species, given that small terrestrial herbivores (e.g., insect herbivores) appear to be more sensitive to alterations of plant quality than plant quantity. In this study, we first tested in the field whether large vertebrate herbivores (cattle Bos taurus) exerted a negative effect on smaller insect herbivores (grasshopper Euchorthippus unicolor) through their overlapping foraging preferences for a dominant grass Leymus chinensis. We measured changes in grass quantity, grass quality, and microclimatic conditions in response to vertebrate grazing and conducted additional manipulative studies in the field and the laboratory to identify potential mechanisms underlying the interaction. Our results showed that grazing by large herbivores caused a significant decline in grasshopper population density and individual performance (survival, size, and weight of both female and male E. unicolor), despite a 38% increase in grass nitrogen (N) content in grazed plots. Experiments manipulating N levels of L. chinensis in the field and the laboratory confirmed that enriching plant N had a negative effect on grasshopper individual performance and population size. Therefore, enhanced quality (N content) of plant resources appears to be an important driver in mediating the negative effect of vertebrate grazing on grasshoppers. Synthesis. We document that phylogenetic relatedness and trait similarity can be poor predictors of interaction strength in some cases, since distantly related herbivores of disparate size can interact indirectly via changes in plant quality. Counter-intuitively, the observed negative effect of cattle on grasshoppers was mediated, at least in part, by an increase in plant quality in cattle grazed areas. The implication is that light to moderate grazing, a common management strategy, may contribute to suppression of grasshoppers in the Eurasian steppe grassland system by altering plant nutrient supplies.","[Zhu, Yu; Zhong, Zhiwei; Wang, Deli; Ma, Quanhui; Hassan, Nazim; Zhu, Hui; Wang, Ling] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Sch Environm, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol,Minist Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yu] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pages, Jordi F.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Isle Of Anglesey, Wales; [Finke, Deborah] Univ Missouri, Div Plant Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Wang, D (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Sch Environm, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol,Minist Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wangd@nenu.edu.cn,"Pages, Jordi F/E-7107-2013; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Pages, Jordi F/0000-0001-9346-8312; Liu, Chen/0000-0002-9916-2346; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; ZHU, HUI/0000-0003-0348-5560","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500602]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230012, 31302012, 31700357]; Program for Introducing Talents to Universities [B16011]; Program for Innovative Research Team in University [IRT-16R11]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2412016KJ023]; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for WalesUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0500602; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31230012, 31302012 and 31700357; Program for Introducing Talents to Universities, Grant/Award Number: B16011; Program for Innovative Research Team in University, Grant/Award Number: IRT-16R11; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2412016KJ023; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales",,69,11,12,9,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, it cannot quantify the indirect effects of this approach and the long-term and system-level ecological consequences are hard to assess. Here we focus on the bloom areas of the Ulansuhai Lake in Inner Mongolia. Based on historic data, field monitoring and experimental data, we constructed a quantitative phosphorus cycle network model. Using Ecological Network Analysis (ENA), we evaluated how indirect flow influences dominant algal species and alters network control and utility relationships. Results indicate that: (1) Indirect flows have strong influence on the mutual and control relationships between blooming algae and its related functional groups in the Ulansuhai Lake; (2) Some opposite interspecific relationships between the blooming algae and other functional components have been found by ENA; (3) Key populations controlling the blooming algae are observed from the intuitive Zooplankton and Detritus to network-based Microorganisms, Zoobenthos, Zooplankton and Detritus(water).

Several hypotheses address the behavioral mechanisms driving the impacts of this mutualism, but relatively few studies have considered multiple ant species simultaneously as well as interspecific and intraspecific variation in ant behavior. In a series of field experiments that manipulated ant diet, this work examines the role of induced behaviors of forest ant species actively engaged in mutualism with Hemiptera. Based on other work in ant mutualisms, we predicted a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors towards prey and competitors by ants in the presence of honeydew-producing Hemiptera. We specifically compared Camponotus chromaoides and Formica neogagates (Formicidae), two abundant species in temperate forests of the northeastern U.S.A. After manipulating ant diet and interactions with sap-feeders experimentally, we observed 494 one-on-one interactions between ants and competitors, ladybird beetles and caterpillar prey. We found that C. chromaoides, exhibited behavioral dominance over F. neogagates, and C. chromaoides was more likely to attack ladybird beetles, competing ants, and caterpillar prey. However, contrary to other work in ant-Hemipteran mutualisms, we observed no evidence that food rewards provided by sap-feeders induced changes in ant behavior for either ant species examined. These results reveal the importance of considering interspecific differences in behavior as a mechanism underlying the ecological impacts of ant-Hemipteran protection mutualisms.","[Clark, Robert E.; Singer, Michael S.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA","Clark, RE (corresponding author), Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",rclark@wesleyan.edu,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1404177],"This work was supported by NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant DEB-1404177.

Biodiversity is expected to decline following habitat loss and isolation, potentially impeding ecosystem function. But because greater isolation usually accompanies habitat loss, the effects of habitat amount and isolation can be confounded. Moreover, the type or quality of the intervening matrix habitat can mediate amount and isolation effects on biodiversity. We used a landscape microcosm of oak leaf litter patches to examine the responses of bacterial communities and the ecosystem function of oak leaf decomposition to patch size, degree of isolation, and matrix habitat type (pine litter or bare ground). We found that oak patch size had no significant effect on bacterial communities or decomposition rates. However, bacterial richness increased with greater patch isolation and when oak litter patches were surrounded by a matrix of pine litter, rather than bare ground. The benefit of patch isolation for biodiversity runs counter to that expected by island biogeography theory, suggesting that spatially dependent interspecific interactions, such as predation or competition, may override direct dispersal effects. Higher bacterial richness in oak litter patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix indicated that spillover from neighboring matrix habitat can increase local richness. Instead of greater bacterial richness enhancing ecosystem functioning, leaf litter decomposition was negatively correlated with bacterial richness: Decomposition was slower in isolated oak litter patches and patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix. This negative relationship may be a result of spatial dynamics that can promote the persistence of bacteria from pine litter habitats that are not well suited to oak litter decomposition. Overall, our experiment indicates that effects of habitat loss, isolation, and matrix quality on richness and composition may depend on spatially constrained interspecific interactions, which can determine the functional ability of communities.","[Spiesman, Brian J.; Inouye, Brian D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Stapper, Andres P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Otolaryngol, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Spiesman, Brian J.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Spiesman, BJ (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Spiesman, BJ (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",brianspiesman@gmail.com,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1110738],"Tania Kim aided with the setup of the study and, along with Nora Underwood and Tom Miller, provided feedback on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

Here we use original data from a unique natural experiment to study some of the mechanisms by which African lions Panthera leo impact on African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Using a study site where wild dogs outnumbered lions for several years prior to lion population recovery, we aimed to investigate whether or not, and by which means, wild dog populations are regulated and influenced by lions. We used 38 pack-years of demographic and behavioural data across two 4-year periods where lion density differed 20-fold (pre-lion era: 1996-1999 and lion era: 2010-2013) to assess how lions may affect wild dog pack size and age structure, litter size and pup survival (n = 329 pups), as well as den site selection (n = 46 dens). Pack size was significantly greater during the pre-lion era. The pup to adult ratio was lower during the lion era and the change in pack composition was directly attributable to significantly greater lion-induced pup mortality. We also demonstrate a behavioural shift, with locations selected for the vulnerable denning period being in more rugged terrain and in areas with lower prey densities during the lion era, as compared with the pre-lion era. Lower adult recruitment into a population of an obligate cooperative breeder like the African wild dog can have complex consequences, including on feeding and defence of young, and mate finding.","[Groom, R.

However, little data exists on local- and broad-scale tree seed immigration and recruitment in these communities. Interspecific competition and seed predation are two major causes of recruitment failure for plants. In North American urban forests, these pressures may be exacerbated by an altered disturbance regime and prevalent invasive species combined with dense populations of rodents and browsers. Preliminary investigation in an urban forest on the eastern shore of Lake Erie indicated very low long-term tree seedling recruitment in the mature canopy stands. Our competing hypotheses were that seed establishment (habitat suitability) and seed limitations (seed availability) explained the tree recruitment failure. We tested seed establishment using field experiments (burning and vertebrate herbivore exclosures) and seed limitation by introducing native tree seeds. Moreover, we tested also seed limitation by examining local and regional seed input using seed traps. We found that seedling recruitment increased significantly with experimental reductions in predators and competitors, suggesting strong biotic establishment limitations in the urban forest. In addition, seed rain correlated significantly with immediately proximate parent plants, but no species arrived beyond what occurs within 50 m of the experimental plots. Essentially, then, the existing canopy species are not replacing themselves and extant seeds are not immigrating to replace them. At the patch scale, habitat quality, particularly seed predation and browsing, as well as competition from nonnative understory shrubs, constrained native tree recruitment in the urban forest. At the landscape scale, the evidence of poor long-term seed recruitment and the lack of long-distance seed input also suggest low native tree seed availability. The tree recruitment failure suggests that, in the absence of active management, this urban forest may eventually convert to an invasive-species dominated urban shrubland.","[Labatore, Adam C.; Potts, Daniel L.; Warren, Robert J., II] SUNY Buffalo State, Dept Biol, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA; [Spiering, David J.] Buffalo Museum Sci, Tifft Nat Preserve, 1200 Fuhrmann Blvd, Buffalo, NY 14203 USA","Warren, RJ (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo State, Dept Biol, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",hexastylis@gmail.com,,,,,,65,11,12,1,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,APR,2017,20,2,,,,,393,401,,10.1007/s11252-016-0601-x,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,ER7RP,WOS:000399011500012,,,,,2021-09-24,

There is no theoretical limit to the number of levels in a facilitation cascade, yet the existence of more than two has rarely been examined. We manipulated biogenic substrate produced by a primary facilitator (cockle shells) and a secondary facilitator (barnacles and their empty tests) in a space-limited subtidal community to test the hypothesis that solitary ascidians would be the third-level facilitator. In the field, most ascidians were found on barnacles, and most barnacles occupied cockle shells. To produce this pattern, barnacles could nurse ascidians (a longer 'facilitation chain') or outcompete them from cockle shells (a shorter chain). Experimental results clearly supported the nursing hypothesis providing evidence for a facilitation cascade with three hierarchical levels of foundation species. Our findings confirm that like predation and competition, positive interspecific interactions nest into multi-tier hierarchies with numerous levels. While the number of foundation species should increase community stability and resilience as it increases diversity and reduces environmental stress, facilitation chain length may have the opposite effect.","[Yakovis, Eugeniy; Artemieva, Anna] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia","Yakovis, E (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",eugene@yakovis.com,"Artemieva, Anna/AAD-9578-2019; Yakovis, Evgeny/M-8540-2019","Yakovis, Evgeny/0000-0003-3489-3671; Artemieva, Anna/0000-0002-1935-7021","Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [02-04-50020, 05-04-48927, 05-04-63041, 06-04-63077, 07-04-10075, 08-04-01373, 08-04-10109, 09-04-10092, 10-04-10094, 11-04-01248, 11-04-10031, 12-04-10059, 13-04-10178, 14-04-00972, 14-04-10124, 17-04-00651]","We thank Michael Fokin, Michael Smirnov, Vladimir Krapivin,.arina Varfolomeeva, Dmitry Grebelniy, Sergey Grebelniy, Vladislav Dzhurinskiy, Anna Kuritsina, Alexey Filinovitch, Nastasia Arkhipova, Anastasia Koval, Michael Yakovis, Natalia Shunatova and Alexey Grishankov for their assistance in the field.

Decomposition of dead organic matter is a key ecological process that ensures soil formation, nutrient availability, and carbon sequestration. To gain understanding of how biodiversity and ecosystems function together to control leaf-litter decomposition processes in a tropical rain forest (Yasuni National Park, Ecuador), we predicted the consequences of the decomposition process using a protocol in which we systematically disassemble the structural functionality of the soil macrofauna communities. We (1) describe the structure and function of the edaphic communities in detail and (2) explore the functional consequences of structural changes in these communities using a non-random exclusion experiment to simulate body size-related extinctions. To do this, we manipulated access of five size classes of soil invertebrates to eight types of plant leaf-litter resources. After measuring and identifying about 4400 soil individuals belonging to 541 morphospecies, 12 functional groups, and following the fate of about 2000 tree leaves in a 50-ha plot, we showed that (1) soil invertebrate communities were composed of a few common and many rare morphospecies that included mostly leaf-litter transformer groups, with the most morphospecies and the greatest abundance coming from Hymenoptera, Collembola, and Coleoptera; (2) our survey captured 63-74% of the total soil biodiversity of the study area (meaning there may be up to 860 morphospecies); (3) litter transformers covered the widest range of body volume, and all groups were evenly distributed at small and large spatial scales (i.e., we found no patterns of spatial aggregation); (4) changes in food web structure significantly altered biomass loss for only three of the eight leaf-litter treatments, suggesting the decomposition process was highly resistant to drastic changes such as size-biased biodiversity loss independent of resource quality. We conclude organic matter decomposition may depend on all non-additive effects that arise from multi-species interactions, including facilitation, interspecific interference competition, and top-down control that predators exert over detritivores at all body size ranges.","[Cardenas, Rafael E.; Argoti, Adriana; Dangles, Olivier] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Museo Zool QCAZ, Lab Entomol, Av 12 Octubre 1076 & Roca,Apdo 17-01-2184, Quito, Ecuador; [Cardenas, Rafael E.; Dangles, Olivier] LEGS CNRS, IRD, UPR 9034, UR 072, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Cardenas, Rafael E.; Dangles, Olivier] Univ Paris Sud 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Donoso, David A.] Escuela Politec Nacl, Inst Ciencias Biol, Av Ladron Guevara E11-253, Quito, Ecuador","Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Museo Zool QCAZ, Lab Entomol, Av 12 Octubre 1076 & Roca,Apdo 17-01-2184, Quito, Ecuador.; Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), LEGS CNRS, IRD, UPR 9034, UR 072, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.; Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), Univ Paris Sud 11, F-91405 Orsay, France.",recardenasm@yahoo.com,"Cardenas, Rafael E/AAY-9755-2020; Donoso, David A/A-2059-2016","Donoso, David A/0000-0002-3408-1457; Cardenas, Rafael E./0000-0002-0375-9384","French Institute for Research and Development (IRD); SENESCYT/ Prometeo Project [20140548BP]; PUCE [I13045, J13041]","The PUCE (codes I13045 and J13041) and the French Institute for Research and Development (IRD) supported this study through research grants.

Thus, it is difficult to determine the real ecological role of this group in ecosystems and how their communities are structured. In the present study, we analyzed the diet of six co-occurring Neotropical land planarians and their success in capturing prey, based on experiments in the laboratory, in order to determine how they share resources in the same environment. We also calculated indices of food niche breadth and food niche overlap for land planarians for the first time. The diet of Luteostriata abundans comprises only woodlice and the diets of Obamaficki and Obama ladislavii are composed only of gastropods, while Paraba multicolor and Obama anthropophila feed on both gastropods and other land planarians. An invasive species recently found in Western Europe, Obama nungara, showed the highest food niche breadth, feeding on gastropods, earthworms and planarians. We found the highest niche overlap between O. anthropophila and P. multicolor. The results suggest that land planarians are frequent predators of woodlice and land gastropods in the Neotropical ecozone and thus are important for the maintenance of native ecosystems and for the control of invasive species. The coexistence of several species in the same habitat is possible due to the use of different species as main prey, which reduces interspecific competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

However, increasing habitat structural complexity has been shown to reduce cannibalism through a reduction in encounter rates and the provision of more refuge and oviposition sites. This study investigated the use of different rearing media and its ability to mitigate cannibalism in the predatory mite Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman & McGregor). The rearing substrates tested were buckwheat husks, gorse husks, rice husks, vermiculite, and wheat bran, which were compared against a control treatment with no substrate. These laboratory experiments were done in two different relative humidities (70% and 85%) with both water and pollen (Typha orientalis Presl) supplementation. The rearing media had a strong significant effect on populations of A. limonicus while humidity did not. Rice husk was found to hold the highest populations of the predator, whereas the control and wheat bran treatments had the lowest. The higher populations associated with the rice husk treatment were attributed to a decrease in encounter rates, the provision of additional shelter and oviposition sites, and low mould infestation. Issues with sampling bias, effects of mould in the system, and potential applications of rice husk are discussed.","[Lee, Ming Hui; Zhang, Zhi-Qiang] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Zhang, Zhi-Qiang] Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland, New Zealand","Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.; Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland, New Zealand.",ZhangZ@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/L-6079-2019","Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/0000-0003-4172-0592","Core funding for Crown Research Institutes from Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE); Plant & Food Research (Christchurch)","This paper is part of the MSc thesis of MHL who thanks Landcare Research (Auckland) for providing all the necessary equipment and facilities.

In CNP, H. bimaculata occurs in the absence of other fish species and major invertebrate predators along an approximately 1000 m elevation gradient. This allowed for the examination of trait variation along the gradient without the confounding effects of interspecific interactions or habitat patchiness. Heterandria bimaculata exhibited traits characteristic of a low-predation environment: balanced sex ratio, slow growth, late maturity and large female size. Females produced more, smaller eggs from upstream to downstream, but overall reproductive allocation remained constant along the gradient. Maximum male length and annual growth rates increased from upstream to downstream, but female growth showed no trend. The patterns of growth and reproductive allocation tradeoff are consistent with predicted response to a longitudinally-increasing productivity gradient in which food resources become more abundant downstream. Macrobrachium and Bellastoma could have caused some predation, but were sparse and patchily distributed. Fish density remained fairly constant among elevations; if food resources were limiting in upstream habitats, per-capita resource availability would be lower and density-dependent competition would drive selection for larger but fewer, more competitive offspring. Future work should quantify longitudinal changes in productivity and conduct experiments to decouple the effects of stream order and fish density dependence.","[Olinger, Charles T.; Peoples, Brandon K.; Frimpong, Emmanuel A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Peoples, Brandon K.] Operat Wallacea, Wallace House, Spilsby PE23 4EX, Lincs, England","Frimpong, EA (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",colinger@vt.edu; bpeoples@vt.edu; frimp@vt.edu,,,Operation Wallacea,"This project was funded by Operation Wallacea.

However, emergent genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic evidence now challenges this role to be at best equivocal to other processess. Cnidaria are arguably the most ancient phylum of the extant metazoa that are venomous and such provide a definitive ancestral anchor to examine the evolution of this trait. Methods: Here we compare predicted toxins from the translated genome of the coral Acropora digitifera to putative toxins revealed by proteomic analysis of soluble proteins discharged from nematocysts, to determine the extent to which gene duplications contribute to venom innovation in this reef-building coral species. A new bioinformatics tool called HHCompare was developed to detect potential gene duplications in the genomic data, which is made freely available (https://github.com/rgacesa/HHCompare). Results: A total of 55 potential toxin encoding genes could be predicted from the A. digitifera genome, of which 36 (65 %) had likely arisen by gene duplication as evinced using the HHCompare tool and verified using two standard phylogeny methods. Surprisingly, only 22 % (12/55) of the potential toxin repertoire could be detected following rigorous proteomic analysis, for which only half (6/12) of the toxin proteome could be accounted for as peptides encoded by the gene duplicates. Biological activities of these toxins are dominatedby putative phospholipases and toxic peptidases. Conclusions: Gene expansions in A. digitifera venom are the most extensive yet described in any venomous animal, and gene duplication plays a significant role leading to toxin diversification in this coral species. Since such low numbers of toxins were detected in the proteome, it is unlikely that the venom is evolving rapidly by prey-driven positive natural selection. Rather we contend that the venom has a defensive role deterring predation or harm from interspecific competition and overgrowth by fouling organisms. Factors influencing translation of toxin encoding genes perhaps warrants more profound experimental consideration.","[Gacesa, Ranko; Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, London SE1 9NH, England; [Chung, Ray; Ward, Malcolm] Kings Coll London, Prote Facil, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London SE5 8AF, England; [Dunn, Simon R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reefs Ecosyst Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Weston, Andrew J.] UCL Sch Pharm, Mass Spectrometry Lab, London WC1N 1AX, England; [Jaimes-Becerra, Adrian; Marques, Antonio C.; Morandini, Andre C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Marques, Antonio C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Biol Marinha, BR-11600000 Sao Sebastiao, Brazil; [Hranueli, Daslav; Starcevic, Antonio] Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Sect Bioinformat, Dept Biochem Engn, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Dept Chem, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Brazil Inst, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Long, Paul F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Ciencias Farmaceut, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Long, PF (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",paul.long@kcl.ac.uk,"Morandini, Andre Carrara/A-9892-2012; Marques, Antonio Carlos/E-8049-2011; Morandini, Andre Carrara/AAC-2320-2020; Gacesa, Ranko/AAG-5358-2019; Starcevic, Antonio/AAB-9379-2021","Morandini, Andre Carrara/0000-0003-3747-8748; Marques, Antonio Carlos/0000-0002-2884-0541; Morandini, Andre Carrara/0000-0003-3747-8748; Gacesa, Ranko/0000-0003-2119-0539; ","United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC grant) [G82144A]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/50174-7, 2011/50242-5]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq grant)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [301039/2013-5]; Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP grant) [13.1.1502.9.8]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [1406848] Funding Source: researchfish","We are indebted to Dr. Walter C.

In marine ecosystems, segregation in feeding habits has been largely described as a common mechanism to allow the coexistence of several competing marine predators. However, little is known about the feeding ecology of most species of chondrichthyans, which play a pivotal role in the structure of marine food webs worldwide. In this study, we examined the trophic ecology of 3 relatively abundant chondrichthyans coexisting in the Mediterranean Sea: the blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus, the velvet belly lanternshark Etmopterus spinax and the rabbit fish Chimaera monstrosa. To examine their trophic ecology and interspecific differences in food habits, we combined the analysis of stomach content and stable isotopes. Our results highlighted a trophic segregation between C. monstrosa and the other 2 species. G. melastomus showed a diet composed mainly of cephalopods, while E. spinax preyed mainly on shrimps and C. monstrosa on crabs. Interspecific differences in the trophic niche were likely due to different feeding capabilities and body size. Each species showed different isotopic niche space and trophic level. Specifically, C. monstrosa showed a higher trophic level than E. spinax and G. melastomus. The high trophic levels of the 3 species highlighted their important role as predators in the marine food web. Our results illustrate the utility of using complementary approaches that provide information about the feeding behaviour at short (stomach content) and long-term scales (stable isotopes), which could allow more efficient monitoring of marine food-web changes in the study area.","[Albo-Puigserver, Marta; Navarro, Joan; Coll, Marta; Aguzzi, Jacopo; Saez-Liante, Raquel] CSIC, ICM, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Navarro, Joan] CSIC, EBD, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41092, Spain; [Coll, Marta] IRD IFREMER UM2, Lab Ecosyst Marins Exploites, UMR 212, F-34203 Sete, France; [Cardona, Luis] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Cardona, Luis] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Albo-Puigserver, M (corresponding author), CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",albo@icm.csic.es,"Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Cardona, Luis/AAL-1354-2021; Cardona, Luis/L-1680-2014; Puigserver, Marta Albo/F-5693-2016; Puigserver, Marta Albo/AAP-5800-2020; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012","Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Cardona, Luis/0000-0002-7892-1323; Cardona, Luis/0000-0002-7892-1323; Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868",FPI program (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness); Marie Curie GIC project BioWeb; Ramon y Cajal Program (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness); BioWeb project,"We thank Isabel Palomera for her en couragement and support and fishermen from Port de la Selva and Llanca for helping with sample collection.

Environmental variation is hypothesized to cause species-specific patterns of variation in germination, which then generates the storage effect coexistence mechanism. However, it has never been shown how sufficient species differences in germination patterns for multispecies coexistence can arise from a shared fluctuating environment. Here we show that nonlinear germination responses to a single fluctuating physical environmental factor can lead to sufficient differences between species in germination pattern for the storage effect to yield coexistence of multiple species. We derive these nonlinear germination responses from experimental data on the effects of varying soil moisture duration. Although these nonlinearities lead to strong species asymmetries in germination patterns, the relative nonlinearity coexistence mechanism is minor compared with the storage effect. However, these asymmetries mean that the storage effect can be negative for some species, which then only persist in the face of interspecific competition through average fitness advantages. This work shows how a low dimensional physical environment can nevertheless stabilize multispecies coexistence when the species have different nonlinear responses to common conditions, as supported by our experimental data.

In the present study we examined the ecological impact of its arrival in the Mediterranean region. The spider mite and phytoseiid mite assemblages in various crop and non-crop plants in three areas of Valencia (Spain) were studied a few months before and 10 years after the invasion of T. evansi. According to rarefaction analyses, the invasion of T. evansi did not affect neither the total number of species in the mite community examined (spider mite and phytoseiid species) nor the number of species when the two communities were examined separately. However, after the invasion, the absolute and relative abundance of the native Tetranychus species was significantly reduced. Before the invasion, T. urticae and T. turkestani were the most abundant spider mites, accounting for 62.9 and 22.8 % of the specimens. After the invasion, T. evansi became the most abundant species, representing 60 % of the total spider mites recorded, whereas the abundance of T. urticae was significantly reduced (23 %). This reduction took place principally on non-crop plants, where native species were replaced by the invader. Null model analyses provided evidence for competition structuring the spider mite community on non-crop plants after the invasion of T. evansi. Resistance to acaricides, the absence of efficient native natural enemies, manipulation of the plant defenses and the web type produced by T. evansi are discussed as possible causes for the competitive displacement.","[Ferragut, Francisco; Pekas, Apostolos] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Valencia 46022, Spain","Ferragut, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",fjferrag@eaf.upv.es,"Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017","Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882; Ferragut, Francisco/0000-0003-1545-6011","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [AGL2003-0541, AGL2006-13232]",This work was supported by the projects AGL2003-0541 and AGL2006-13232 of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science.,,73,30,32,0,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

I conducted a series of enclosure experiments to: (1) determine if salamanders use earthworm burrows, and (2) examine the potential influence of earthworm burrow use and indirect effects on salamander intra- and interspecific competition, predator avoidance, and seasonal performance. I found that one species of woodland salamander, Plethodon cinereus, used earthworm burrows 50% of the time when burrows were present. Neither adults nor juveniles of the congeneric P. glutinosus used earthworm burrows. Intraspecific, but not interspecific, competition by P. cinereus affected salamander behavior when earthworms were absent, with P. cinereus found under cover objects > 70% of the time when alone or with a P. glutinosus, but only 40% of the time when with another P. cinereus. When earthworms were present, the behavior of P. cinereus was similar across salamander treatments. Earthworms decreased the amount of leaf litter and microinvertebrates, although this did not affect salamander mass. In subsequent experiments using only P. cinereus, the refuge provided by earthworm burrows increased the survival of P. cinereus over the winter and allowed P. cinereus to avoid being consumed by the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis). Because earthworm burrows provide a refuge for P. cinereus during intraspecific encounters, in the presence of a predator and over the winter, they may serve as an important belowground-aboveground linkage in eastern forests where salamanders are common.","Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Ransom, TS (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",tsr6a@virginia.edu,,,MLBS Station; Runk Fellowship,"I thank H.

Although the basic causes are clearing, fragmentation and degradation of these woodlands, several ecological processes are involved. These include: difficulties in dispersing among remnants, interspecific competition, increased nest predation, and decline in key resources, including food. Many bird species declined during the recent long drought in south-eastern Australia. Research over the last decade has strongly emphasised effects at the landscape level. It is now clear that more native vegetation in the landscape leads to more bird species. There is stronger evidence that aggressive and nest-predatory birds contribute to the decline of many woodland birds. Several studies have linked the presence of individual bird species to key habitat features, such as high or low density of trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris. The main priorities for the conservation of woodland birds to reverse these declines are: (1) detailed studies on the population dynamics of a variety of declining woodland birds under different management regimes; (2) experiments that closely monitor the response of woodland birds to manipulation of competitors, predators and habitat features; and (3) broad-scale implementation of management based on science to aim to reverse the fortunes of woodland birds on regional and national scales.","Univ New England, Zool & Res Ctr Behav & Physiol Ecol, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia","Ford, HA (corresponding author), Univ New England, Zool & Res Ctr Behav & Physiol Ecol, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",hford@une.edu.au,,,,,,92,70,89,0,45,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0158-4197,1448-5540,,EMU,Emu,,2011,111,1,,,,,1,9,,10.1071/MU09115,,,9,Ornithology,Zoology,723TI,WOS:000287529500002,,,,,2021-09-24,

Mosquitoes able to monopolize treeholes with optimal resources may be over-represented in the community. Aedes sierrensis, which is well adapted for the Mediterranean climate of California, has evolved in the absence of interspecific competition, so oviposition should reflect resource quality to a large extent. Artificial oviposition traps mounted at four canopy heights facing north or south on trees in a mixed-oak forest at four elevations of the Pacific Coastal Range were used to assess vertical ovipositional preferences by the western treehole mosquito. Natural dispersal of the ciliated protozoan parasite Lambornella clarki was similarly monitored. Gravid Ae. sierrensis showed no vertical stratification during egg laying in traps. Lambornella clarki were naturally dispersed at relatively low frequency into traps and persisted unless eliminated by larval predation. Aedes sierrensis is not currently constrained into occupying a subset of treeholes. However, invasion of its native range by competitive species may alter oviposition patterns.

Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either (1) niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or (2) impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host-parasitoid or plant-animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as 'specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that 'dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species 'depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised.

Craspedolepta nebulosa and C. subpunctata were studied on their shared host plant Epilobium angustifolium along an altitudinal transect in the Hardangervidda area of southern Norway. 2. The following was investigated: whether (a) the altitudinal distribution and abundance of each psyllid species was determined by summer heat budgets, acting directly on rates of insect development and/or through their host plant and (b) whether parasitism, predation, and interspecific competition played any role in restricting the distribution of the two species. 3. Craspedolepta nebulosa extended to higher elevations than C. subpunctata but within their ranges neither species showed a clear altitudinal trend in abundance per plant. However, the former species grew to a smaller size with increasing elevation. 4. There was little evidence for interspecific competitive effects and observed levels of parasitism and predation were negligible across the transect. 5. Development and distribution of both species mirrored significant differences in the phenology, size, leaf number, and reproductive output of E. angustifolium with increasing altitude. 6. Distributions were related to available heat budgets acting on psyllid/plant development rates, with C. nebulosa developing more efficiently at lower heat availability. 7. Population transplant experiments supported the overall conclusions, with neither psyllid species able to establish viable populations above their current upper altitudinal range limit, despite the presence of their host plant.","Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Biol & Earth Sci, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England","Hodkinson, ID (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Biol & Earth Sci, Byrom St, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",i.d.hodkinson@livjm.ac.uk,,,,,,51,19,21,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability. 2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature. 3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change. 4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.","NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland","Hulme, PE (corresponding author), NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland.",pehu@ceh.ac.uk,"Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011","Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474",,,,92,254,271,1,237,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Natural enemies (e.g., predators, parasites, and herbivores) are ubiquitous in food webs and are predicted to have significant impacts on phenotypic diversity and on speciation, and extinction rates of their prey. Spurred by the development of a theoretical framework beginning in the late 1970s, there is now a growing body of literature that addresses the effects of enemy-prey interactions on the evolution of prey. A number of theoretical models predict that enemies can produce phenotypic divergence between closely related species, even in the absence of interspecific competition for resources. Effects on diversification of prey are more variable, and enemies may either enhance or depress speciation and extinction rates of their prey. Empirical evidences from a number of study systems, notably those involving predators and prey in aquatic environments and interactions between insects and flowering plants, confirm both predictions. There is now considerable evidence for the role of enemies, especially those that are size-selective or use visual cues when identifying suitable prey, on phenotypic divergence of sympatric and allopatric taxa. Enemies may spur diversification rates in certain groups under some circumstances, and hinder diversification rates in other cases. I suggest that further research should focus on the role of enemies in diversification of prey, with significant insights likely to be the product of applying traditional experimental approaches and emerging comparative phylogenetic methods.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Vamosi, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",smvamosi@ucalgary.ca,"Vamosi, Steven/C-8126-2009","Vamosi, Steven/0000-0003-3903-5000",,,,175,107,111,0,69,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

First, a field survey was carried out where different habitat variables and the densities of both species were quantified and subjected to principal components analysis. Then the abundance of stone loach was related to the scores of the retained axes (eigenvalues >1). The abundance of stone loach was positively correlated to substrate particle size, amount of shade, temperature, discharge and current velocity, but negatively correlated to brown trout abundance. Secondly, a month-long field enclosure experiment in a stream was performed to test for any negative effects of brown trout on stone loach growth. Four treatments were used: intraspecific competition (stone loach at double density), interspecific competition (stone loach + small trout), predation (stone loach + large trout) and a control (stone loach alone). The results showed that large trout tended to have negative effects on final stone loach biomass. The absence of a negative effect of large trout on resource density suggests that nonlethal effects rather than resource competition caused this trend.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limnol.lu.se,,,,,,37,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Given the importance of shell refuge to their post-settlement ontogeny, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began constructing intertidal plots of oyster shell in the Grays Harbor estuary, Washington, to enhance recruitment and mitigate losses of subtidal C. magister entrained and killed during extensive dredging efforts. When shell habitat was newly constructed, settlement and survival of C. magister were high, and expectations for the mitigation project were met. During the first several years (1992-1997), plots greater than 1 yr postconstruction were colonized by yellow shore crabs, Hemigrapsus oregonensis (often greater than or equal to 75 crabs m(-2)), and abundance of EBP C. magister was reduced to nearly zero. While some predation of settling megalopae by H. oregonensis does occur, the relationship between these species is characterized by density-dependent competitive interactions. Laboratory observations of competition for shell habitat indicate that H. oregonensis are dominant over EBP C. magister and can evict C. magister from refuge spaces. Field experiments show that high densities of the former cause the latter to emigrate from shell, and suggest detection and avoidance of areas with high densities of H. oregonensis by settling C. magister megalopae. More recently (1998-2001), abundance of H. oregonensis has declined dramatically within plots of oyster shell, apparently due to recruitment failure, and patterns of C. magister abundance and production have returned to levels consistent with original expectations of the mitigation project. Both intraspecific and interspecific competition for space are significant factors effecting population regulation of C. magister when they are strongly dependent on refuge from predation. Efficacy of constructed oyster shell plots as a mitigation tool may hinge on the population dynamics of a species previously considered of little consequence to the target species.","Clarkson Univ, Ctr Environm, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Visser, EP (corresponding author), Clarkson Univ, Ctr Environm, Box 5717, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.",emmajoan@northnet.org,,,,,,98,8,8,1,31,ESTUARINE RESEARCH FEDERATION,PORT REPUBLIC,"2018 DAFFODIL, PO BOX 510, PORT REPUBLIC, MD 20676 USA",0160-8347,,,ESTUARIES,Estuaries,AUG,2004,27,4,,,,,699,715,,10.1007/BF02907654,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,849HC,WOS:000223528300011,,,,,2021-09-24,

We documented important top-down predation effects on some small-mammal species, and small-mammal effects on some plant species resulting from experimental exclusions. However, periodic El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events caused several high rainfall episodes during this interval, resulting in large bottom-up increases in both plants and animals. Therefore, we suggest that instead of exclusive top-down or bottom-up control, this system undergoes shifting control, with relatively greater importance of biotic interactions in wet years and of resource limitation in dry ones.

Larvae of cased caddisflies (Limnephilidae and Phryganeidae) are among the most abundant and conspicuous invertebrates in northern wetlands. Although species replacements are often observed along permanence gradients, the underlying causal mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper, we report on the distributional patterns of caddisflies in permanent and temporary high-altitude ponds, and how those patterns reflect differences in life history characteristics that affect desiccation tolerance (fundamental niches) versus constraints related to biotic interactions (realised niches). 2. Species (Hesperophylax occidentalis and Agrypnia deflata ) that were encountered only in permanent ponds are restricted in distribution by life history (no ovarian diapause, aquatic oviposition, and/or inability to tolerate desiccation). Although the egg masses of H. occidentalis tolerate desiccation, the larvae leave the protective gelatinous matrix of the egg mass because adults oviposit in water. 3. Three species (Asynarchus nigriculus, Limnephilus externus and L. picturatus ) have life history characteristics (rapid larval growth, ovarian diapause and terrestrial oviposition of desiccation-tolerant eggs) that should facilitate the use of both permanent and temporary habitats. However, A. nigriculus is rare or absent in most permanent ponds, and L. externus and L . picturatus are rare or absent in most temporary ponds. Experimental data from a previous study on the combined effects of salamander predation and interspecific interactions among caddisflies (e.g. intraguild predation) suggest that biotic interactions limit each species to a subset of potentially exploitable habitats. 4. Many wetland invertebrates exhibit species replacements along permanence gradients, but few studies have separated the relative importance of the effects of drying per se from the effects of biotic interactions. Our results emphasise the complementary roles of comparative data on life histories and experimental data on competition and predation for understanding invertebrate distributions along permanence gradients.","Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Wissinger, SA (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",swissing@allegheny.edu,"Jannot, Jason/ABD-5400-2020","Brown, Wendy/0000-0002-7237-1797; Jannot, Jason/0000-0002-9231-1337",,,,58,56,60,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Many simple theories predict that complex speciose communities should be less stable than simple ones. In contrast, stability of collective community attributes, such as functional groups, may be greater in more complex communities. We used aquatic microcosms containing microbial food webs to generate an experimental gradient of species richness. Biweekly counts of population samples permitted estimation and comparison of density, persistence time, and temporal variation in density for populations and trophic functional groups embedded in communities of varying richness. Densities of nearly half of the species declined as species richness increased, demonstrating broad community-wide density compensation that resulted from more abundant competitors and predators in species-rich communities. Persistence time, a measure of population stability, also declined with increasing species richness. Another measure of population stability, temporal variation in density, indicated that abundances of most species embedded in diverse communities varied no more than in less diverse communities. In contrast to results for individual species, temporal variation of entire functional groups composed of multiple species decreased as species richness increased. The stability of individual populations was not predicted by that of functional groups. Interspecific interactions and statistical averaging may both contribute to the reduced temporal variability of functional groups created by aggregating multiple species.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","McGrady-Steed, J (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",pjmorin@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,67,108,123,1,54,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2000,81,2,,,,,361,373,,,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,279ZM,WOS:000085077200007,,,,,2021-09-24,

Despite their distribution overlap, the differences in the distribution patterns of the species along the depth gradient were clear, with Plesionika ensis and Polycheles typhlops occurring at greater depths than Parapenaeus longirostris and Plesionika heterocarpus. Stomach content analysis revealed that all species were active predators of benthic invertebrates, while scavenging activity became more important at depths below 500 m. The species exhibited highly diverse diets, but dietary diversity was higher for those inhabiting shallower depths. Ontogenetic dietary shifts were pronounced, although dietary patterns were also significantly affected by season and depth. Interspecific dietary overlap was less than intraspecific overlap between size classes and between months. Feeding intensity was associated with the distribution patterns of the species and decreased with depth, thus it was significantly lower for the species at the deepest depths, P. typhlops and P. ensis. Dietary patterns of the species examined were quite similar and differences noted were more consistent with depth-related changes in available food resources than with changes in the position of the species in the food web. Since dietary overlap among the species when they co-occur was high, it is possible that competitive trophic interactions accounted for the low overlap in the bathymetrical distribution of the species examined. Such interactions may be of fundamental importance on the deep-sea bottoms in the Eastern Mediterranean since environmental parameters such as temperature and salinity are rather constant.","Univ Crete, Dept Biol, GR-71409 Iraklion, Crete, Greece; Inst Marine Biol Crete, GR-71003 Iraklion, Crete, Greece","Labropoulou, M (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Marine Res, Agios Kosmas, GR-16604 Iraklion, Greece.",mlabro@posidon.ncmr.gr,,,,,,63,31,32,0,4,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) populations in the Galapagos exhibit 10-fold differences in body mass between island populations. There is also strong sexual size dimorphism, with males being about twice as heavy as females. To understand the evolutionary processes shaping body size in marine iguanas, we analyzed the selection differentials on body size in two island populations (max. male mass 900 g in Genovesa, 3500 g in Santa Fe). Factors that usually confound any evolutionary analysis of body sizes-predation, interspecific food competition, reproductive role division-are ruled out for marine iguanas. We show that, above hatchlings, mortality rates increased with body size in both sexes to the same extent. This effect was independent of individual age. The largest animals (males) of each island were the first to die once environmental conditions deteriorated (e.g., during El Ninos). This sex-biased mortality was the result of sexual size dimorphism, but at the same time caused sexual size dimorphism to fluctuate. Mortality differed between seasons (selection differentials as low as -1.4) and acted on different absolute body sizes between islands. Both males and females did not cease growth when an optimal body size for survival was reached, as demonstrated by the fact that individual adult body size phenotypically increased in each population under favorable environmental conditions beyond naturally selected limits. But why did marine iguanas grow ''too large'' for survival Due to lek mating, sexual selection constantly favored large body size in males (selection differentials up to +0.77). Females only need to reach a body size sufficient to produce surviving offspring. Thereafter, large body size of females was less favored by fertility selection than large size in males. Resulting from these different selection pressures on male and female size, sexual size dimorphism was mechanistically caused by the fact that females matured at an earlier age and size than males, whereafter they constantly allocated resources into eggs, which slowed growth. The observed allometric increase in sexual size dimorphism is explained by the fact that the difference between these selective processes becomes larger as energy abundance in the environment increases.

Tundra vole and singing vole populations were negatively associated, probably because of their very different habitat preferences. At low densities, experimental manipulation of food, cover and competing species on the same 18 grids revealed different effects on the arvicoline species. Abundance of tundra voles increased with supplemental food, but singing voles and collared lemmings showed no significant responses. Singing vole populations had a clear negative response, but tundra voles and collared lemmings had no significant response to removal of shrub cover. Similarly, collared lemmings showed no response to removal of tundra voles or singing voles, and tundra voles showed no response to removal of singing voles, but singing voles showed a negative response to removal of tundra voles. The apparent mutualistic relationship between tundra voles and singing voles probably resulted from an indirect effect via predation, i.e., more predation on singing voles when tundra voles were removed.

Model results show the importance of managing shellfish predators, as well as selected groups of fouling species that may function as larval predators or competitors or both with juvenile shellfish life stages. While the modeling approach is limited by the lack of estimating intensities of interspecific interaction, it allows first-order insight into the relative importance of different types of interactions on shellfish populations and which variables are likely to be the most important in affecting shellfish abundance. Coupled with rigorous experimental hypothesis testing, the qualitative modeling approach provides assistance regarding which life stages of a shellfish species or interacting species needs to be managed in order to maximize shellfish productivity.

Hard clams emigrated more in the presence of G. gemma than in its absence in both laboratory and field experiments. The overall effect of reduced food was increased emigration. Presence of G. gemma in sand enhanced hard clam growth while not affecting survival, but in muddy sand growth and survival decreased. Hard clams grew best in muddy sand without gem clams. In further experiments hard clams grew faster in shallower sediments and slower with addition of G. gemma biodeposits. We conclude that undisturbed post-settlement M mercenaria grow more slowly than they are capable of because they spend part of the time buried, presumably to avoid surface predators. Clams that are kept near the sediment surface, either because of sedimentary properties or interaction with spatial competitors, grow considerably faster than undisturbed clams in sand. This interpretation implies a trade-off between opposing selective pressures such that clams partition time between the necessary risk of feeding and the safe but energetically unprofitable sub-surface refuge from predation.","SUNY, MARINE SCI RES CTR, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA; KOREA OCEAN RES & DEV INST, POLAR RES CTR, SEOUL 425600, SOUTH KOREA; OREGON STATE UNIV, OREGON SEA GRANT INST, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,38,15,15,0,2,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Benthivorous perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked over a range of natural densities (no fish, low, and high densities) into enclosures with or without dense submerged vegetation. The biomass of macroinvertebrate prey decreased over time in the presence of perch and was always higher in enclosures with vegetation present than in enclosures lacking vegetation. The increase in mass of perch was positively related to the abundance of macroinvertebrate prey and negatively related to perch density and the density of vegetation. In the treatments lacking vegetation, the proportion of zooplankton in the diet of perch increased, and the growth rate of perch decreased over time. In the vegetation treatments, the proportion of zooplankton in the diet was low throughout the experiment and the growth rate of perch was constant over time. As a consequence, initial increase in mass was considerably higher in the treatments lacking vegetation than in the vegetation treatments, whereas no such pattern was observed in the second half of the experiment. In the absence of vegetation, perch are apparently able to forage efficiently, but this may reduce the availability of macroinvertebrate prey to the extent that perch are forced to include less profitable zooplankton prey into their diet. In vegetated habitats, the foraging efficiency of perch is reduced, which possibly prevents over-exploitation of macroinvertebrate prey and consequently may allow for a moderate, but relatively constant, consumption of macroinvertebrates by perch. The density-dependence of growth rates in both vegetated and unvegetated habitats can only partly be explained by resource competition, which suggests the presence of an additional mechanism of density-dependence. In natural lake communities, efficient predation from benthivorous fish should keep the biomass of macroinvertebrate prey in structurally simple habitats below the high levels initially present in my experiment. In these communities, submerged vegetation may be an equally profitable habitat for juvenile perch as are open areas. Through its effects on the feeding efficiencies of juvenile perch and other benthivorous fish, submerged vegetation may affect individual growth rates and the size structure of perch populations, which may contribute to explain differences in fish community structure among lakes differing in submerged vegetation cover.",,"DIEHL, S (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051",,,,70,86,87,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1993,67,3,,,,,403,414,,10.2307/3545353,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LN449,WOS:A1993LN44900003,,,,,2021-09-24,

In northern Wisconsin lakes, the introduced crayfish Orconectes rusticus is replacing two ecologically similar resident congeners, O. virilis and O. propinquus. In laboratory experiments, we compared growth and mortality of individually maintained crayfish offered one of five ad libitum diets: invertebrates, macrophytes, dentritus, periphyton or all items combined. Mortality was highest for 0. virilis and lowest for 0. rusticus. Macrophyte diets yielded the highest mortality. All three species grew best on invertebrate and combination diets but grew little or not at all on diets of periphyton, detritus or macrophytes. 0. rusticus and 0. virilis grew more than 0. propinquus. 0. rusticus grew more quickly and/or was better able to survive overall than its congeners. Therefore, 0. rusticus would probably have advantages over 0. virilis and 0. propinquus in competitive interactions, reproductive success and avoiding size-selective fish predation.

The gall's position on H. spinosa is verv specific, reflected in the fact that the gall maker attaches principally to the basal floral buds of the inflorescence, and in the lower sector of the plant. We labelled inflorescences with and without galls in order to (quantify goat herbivory and gall predation. The goat feeds both on plants and infructescences with or without galls, resulting in gall destruction and larval death (phenotypic selection). The browsing behaviour of goat was influenced by the general stunted growth of the plant, as well as by the abundance of spiny stems. This fact allows chalcids to escape goat herbivory on a very fine spatial scale. Gall survival strongly depends on gall position in the inflorescence, being greater in the lower position. Furthermore, galls situated in the lower sector of the plant have a greater survival chance than galls situated in the upper sector. The goat acted as a true predator of the gall maker wasp, becoming a potential selective agent conditioning the reproductive success of Systasis. The relationship between goat and gall-maker is an asymmetrical hierarchy mediated by size differences, the bigger one conditions the smaller one, but the reverse does not occur. We propose that under low herbivore pressure, the gall makers (and similar invertebrate sessile forms) will show a spatial oviposition preference which is less selective that under strong herbivore pressure.",,"ZAMORA, R (corresponding author), UNIV GRANADA,FAC CIENCIAS,DEPT BIOL ANIM & ECOL,E-18001 GRANADA,SPAIN.",,"Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017; Zamora, Renato/ABE-6898-2020; Zamora, Regino/B-3179-2010","Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664; Zamora, Renato/0000-0002-2223-3361; Zamora, Regino/0000-0002-5049-9968",,,,33,25,26,0,11,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1993,66,2,,,,,223,228,,10.2307/3544808,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KJ535,WOS:A1993KJ53500006,,,,,2021-09-24,

Arthropods, spiders in particular, were most abundant in upper tree parts and in the outer sections of branches. There was a high correlation between food abundance and bird density, based on proportional use of foraging sites over eight sections of spruce suggesting that food distribution is a major factor influencing the segregative distribution of the four bird species. However, the distribution of the bird species cannot be explained solely by food abundance. In outer tree parts there were fewer birds than expected from arthropod biomass. A possible explanation is that the risk of predation by Pygmy Owls Glaucidium passerinum is higher there, reducing the net benefit of foraging in the tree parts with highest food abundance. A further support for the impact of predation comes from the fact that it is the socially least dominant species, the Goldcrest and the Coal Tit P. ater, that use the outer tree parts. Crested Tits P. cristatus are highest in dominance rank, but they mainly forage in the inner tree parts. Willow Tits P. montanus are second in the dominance, but have the lowest food abundance in their foraging sites. Both interspecific competition over food, and the site-dependent risk of predation, seem to govern the ways in which the four bird species select their foraging sites in spruce in winter.","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT WILDLIFE ECOL,S-75007 UPPSALA,SWEDEN; UNIV UPPSALA,DEPT ZOOL,S-75122 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","SUHONEN, J (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA,DEPT BIOL,KONNEVESI RES STN,YLIOPISTONKATU 9,SF-40100 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND.",,,"Hoglund, Jacob/0000-0002-5840-779X",,,,44,38,39,0,23,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-5693,,,ORNIS SCAND,,OCT-DEC,1992,23,4,,,,,467,474,,10.2307/3676678,,,8,Ornithology,Zoology,KA562,WOS:A1992KA56200006,,,,,2021-09-24,

Furthermore, our view of phytophagous insect populations is probably biased by the more frequent attention given to economic pests whose dynamics might be expected to be somewhat exceptional. Herein, we report on the population dynamics and community-level features in a diverse, native fauna of phytophagous insects associated with goldenrod (Solidago altissima), a native perennial plant that forms a dominant, long-persisting element in old-field succession. The data consist of censuses taken in six consecutive years at 16 old fields in the Finger Lakes Region of New York; five additional stands were followed for four consecutive years. Our analyses address two questions: (a) to what extent is the functional structure of the community (as reflected in such attributes to the herbivore load, guild spectrum, and dominance hierarchy) maintained by compensatory changes in the densities of the member species and (b) are certain traits associated with a species' tendency to fluctuate in density or to dominate the community? In general, populations of goldenrod insects fluctuated less than those of insects reported in the literature. Few were abundant; only 7 of the 138 species in the goldenrod fauna ever reached densities at which their biomass exceeded 0. 1% of the leaf biomass. The functional structure of the community, as reflected in the total herbivore load and the proportions of that load contributed by various guilds, varied widely in space and time. A small subset of the fauna remained dominant throughout the study; these species, whose populations occasionally irrupted, retained their high rank in relative abundance even during those periods when their populations were waning. There was no evidence for compensatory changes in the densities of species within guilds, as would be expected if a relatively distinct set of limiting resources were available to insects with different feeding styles. Species were no more likely to exhibit negative correlations with their guild mates than they were with members of other guilds. There was also little evidence of sporadic or diffuse competition within the fauna as a whole; even during population outbreaks, the dominant species rarely engendered decreases in the biomass or diversity of the remaining species, and increases in the total herbivore load were seldom associated with losses of species from the community. Several species were positively associated with one another on the basis of similar habitat requirements or the use by one species of conditions created by the presence of another. The community was predictable only in the sense that dominant species remained dominant and rare species rare. The abundance and population variability of species were not correlated with such traits as body size, generation time, or host range. Taxon-related trends, on the other hand, stood out; coleopterans tended to be abundant whereas lepidopterans were rare, and hemipterans tended to fluctuate widely whereas dipterans remained relatively constant. Furthermore, species that were clumped in space (onto stems within fields) tended to be abundant and variable. The boom and bust dynamics of these aggregating species may be related to the ability of colonies to survive the inroads of generalist predators. The low degree of regional synchrony in the performance of populations at different sites suggests that large-scale, weather-driven fluctuations are uncommon. Our analysis of this well-developed, native insect fauna reveals a community that has a somewhat predictable structure that reflects the idiosyncracies of the component species. These species do not fluctuate in an integrated community-structuring manner, but as an outcome of each species performing at its individualistic' level, the community displays a characteristic dominance hierarchy. The members of this diverse fauna rarely achieve densities at which they compete with one another. Our results are consistent with Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin's hypothesis (1960) which predicts that terrestrial herbivores rarely deplete plant resources to levels at which there is widespread interspecific competition.",,"ROOT, RB (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, CORSON LAB, ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,93,138,139,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Economical damage (i. e. reduction of the yield) is usually confined to fish farms. Grey Herons may take some 0.4-8 % of the production of efficiently managed farms, whereas Cormorants can be responsible for losses of 20 % to > 50 % under certain circumstances. The influence of birds is often overestimated by fish farmers if they do not separate predation from other causes of mortality. Neither economical nor ecological damage (i. e. negative influence on the population resulting in long-term decline) have been reported from lakes, although total fish stocks were rarely assessed. In these cases, waterfowl took less than 5 % of the biomass of most fish species; under brackish conditions the maximum was 36 %. Commercial catches are often 10-20 times higher than the consumption by the main avian predators (tab. 1). Even on Central European lakes with high Cormorant densities, fishermen take 4-12 times as much as the Cormorants, and annual variations in the catch can amount to a multiple of the bird consumption (fig. 1). Moreover, waterbirds often prey upon commercially unimportant and abundant fish and may therefore reduce competitive pressure on commercial species. Predation rates in streams and rivers are usually higher than in lakes, but in most cases the avian predation does not seem to exceed the range of compensatory mortality. The few reports of waterbirds apparently responsible for added mortality (thus competing with fisheries), mostly refer to canalised rivers with inadequate structural properties for the high fish populations they are stocked with. Altogether predator-prey relationships between waterbirds and freshwater fish remain little studied. Possibilities of fishponds for conducting experiments have particularly been underused.",,"SUTER, W (corresponding author), SCHWEIZER VOGELWARTE SEMPACH,CH-6204 SEMPACH,SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,77,12,14,0,38,DEUTSCHE ORNITHOLOGIE-GESELL,FRANKFURT,"SENCKENBERGANLAGE 25, W-6000 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Most strikingly, regeneration beyond the range limit occurred almost exclusively when seeds were experimentally protected from predators. Regeneration from seed was depressed on soil from beyond the range edge when this soil was transplanted to sites within the range, with indirect evidence suggesting that fungal pathogens play a role. Non-climatic factors are clearly in need of careful attention when attempting to predict the biotic consequences of climate change.

We measured biotic interaction strengths between an invasive and a native endemic snail species in 2 streams in the western United States. The invasive freshwater New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, was the dominant snail in a 3(rd)-order order stream, and a closely related endemic snail, Pyrgulopsis robusta, was the dominant snail in a 1(st)-order tributary stream. We compared consumer-resource (C-R) and consumer-consumer (C-C) per biomass interaction strengths in both streams using field enclosure experiments. Consumer effects on algal resources were strong and equivalent for both snail species in both streams. Invasion success of P. antipodarum could not be attributed to an unusually high rate of resource acquisition at either site because the 2 snails exerted equivalent C-R interaction strengths. However, C-C interactions were asymmetric; the invasive snail significantly limited growth of the native snail, whereas the native snail facilitated growth of the invasive snail. These effects were stronger in the stream where P. antipodarum was dominant. Thus, per biomass interaction strengths indicated that asymmetric interactions could be contributing to patterns of dominance by invasive and endemic stream snails.","[Riley, Leslie A.; Dybdahl, Mark F.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99163 USA; [Hall, Robert O., Jr.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Riley, LA (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99163 USA.",leslie_riley@wsu.edu; dybdahl@wsu.edu; bhall@uwyo.edu,"Dybdahl, Mark/B-8649-2012",,"University of Wyoming/National Park Service Research Station; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 9907373, 0296049]","We thank B.

To help mitigate this problem, we review and synthesize the theoretical literature on TMIs and, in particular, on trait-mediated indirect interactions, TMIIs, in which the presence of one species mediates the interaction between a second and third species. (1) In models, TMIs tend to stabilize simple communities; adding further biological detail often reduces stability in models, but populations may persist even if their dynamics become mathematically unstable. (2) Short- and long-term changes in population density caused by TMIs depend even more on details, such as the curvature of functional responses and trade-offs, which have rarely been measured. (3) The effects of TMIs in multipredator communities depend in a straightforward way on the specificity of prey defenses. (4) Tritrophic and more complex communities are theoretically difficult; few general conclusions have emerged. Theory needs new kinds of experiments as a guide. The most critical needs are experiments that measure curvatures of trade-offs and responses, and experiments that (combined with theory) allow us to scale from short- to long-term responses of communities. Anecdotal evidence from long-term and large-scale studies suggests that TMIs may affect community dynamics at practical management scales; community models incorporating TMIs are necessary and require closer collaborations between theory and experiment.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Bolker, B (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",bolker@zoo.ufl.edu,"Krivan, Vlastimil/F-1709-2010; Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009; Krivan, Vlastimil/J-7015-2019","Krivan, Vlastimil/0000-0003-0971-1231; Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627; Bolker, Benjamin/0000-0002-2127-0443",,,,151,264,272,9,136,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2003,84,5,,,,,1101,1114,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1101:CTAESO]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700PN,WOS:000184120500003,,,,,2021-09-24,

Such uncertainty hampers prudent decision making about where and when to invest most intensively in species conservation programmes. Demystifying ecosystem responses to biodiversity alterations may he best achieved through the study of the interactions allowing biotic communities to compensate internally for population changes in terms of contributing to ecosystem function, or their intrinsic functional redundancy. Because individual organisms are the biologically discrete working components of ecosystems and because environmental changes are perceived at the scale of the individual, a mechanistic understanding of functional redundancy will hinge upon understanding how individuals' behaviours influence population dynamics in the complex community setting. Here, I use analytical and graphical modelling to construct a conceptual framework for predicting the conditions under which varying degrees of interspecific functional redundancy can be found in dynamic ecosystems. The framework is founded on principles related to food web successional theory, which provides some evolutionary insights for mechanistically linking functional roles of discrete, interacting organisms with the dynamics of ecosystems because energy is the currency both for ecological fitness and for food web commerce. Net productivity is considered the most contextually relevant ecosystem process variable because of its socioeconomic significance and because it ultimately subsumes all biological processes and interactions. Redundancy relative to productivity is suggested to manifest most directly as compensatory niche shifts among adaptive foragers in exploitation ecosystems, facilitating coexistence and enhancing ecosystem recovery after disturbances which alter species' relative abundances, such as extinctions. The framework further explicates how resource scarcity and environmental stochasticity ma!: constitute 'ecosystem legacies' influencing the emergence of redundancy by shaping the background conditions for foraging behaviour evolution and, consequently, the prevalence of compensator!: interactions. Because it generates experimentally testable predictions for a priori hypothesis testing about when and where varying degrees of functional redundancy ale likely to be found in food webs, the framework may be useful for advancing toward the reliable knowledge of biodiversity and ecosystem function relations necessary for prudent prioritization of conservation programmes. The theory presented here introduces explanation of how increasing diversity can have a negative influence on ecosystem sustainability by altering the environment for biotic inter actions and thereby changing functional compensability among biota - under particular conditions.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Johnson, KH (corresponding author), Univ Toledo, Dept Biol, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",khjohnson@netscape.net,,,,,,149,31,31,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

For example, animals eavesdrop on other animals to find profitable food resources, yet the types of cues they use and how these cues influence decisions to approach a resource remain poorly understood. In tropical systems, arthropods inadvertently flushed by army ant, Eciton burchellii, swarms are an important food resource for many bird species, which form mixed-species foraging aggregations at swarms. Competition at swarms is intense and birds vocalize to defend foraging areas, inadvertently producing acoustic social information about the swarm's location. Eavesdropping birds may use these acoustic cues, which provide information about the bird aggregation (i.e. species participating in the aggregation, the size of the aggregation and/or diversity of the aggregation) to assess potential benefits (food resources) and costs (competition for food) of joining an aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we used an acoustic playback experiment to simulate aggregations of birds foraging at ant swarms and we measured community-wide and guild-specific responses of forest birds to playbacks. We included three types of acoustic social information in playbacks that potentially interact to affect an eavesdropping bird's probability of attraction to a swarm: (1) aggregation size, (2) aggregation species richness and (3) degree of specialization on ant swarms for food of birds vocalizing in the aggregation (hereafter 'dependency'). Using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, we found that playbacks of obligate ant-following species elicited greater community-wide responses (i.e. attracted more individuals and species) to simulated aggregations compared to playbacks of other, less dependent guilds. We also found that interactions between dependency, species richness and aggregation size influenced the overall community response to playbacks and that species from one guild generally responded to the guild above them (i.e. from less to more specialized). Our results suggest that species evaluate multiple types of acoustic cues representing the costs and benefits of foraging in a mixed-species aggregation at a swarm. We hypothesize that species change from information receivers to information producers upon joining a swarm, ultimately producing an information cascade that further affects the dynamics of feeding aggregations at swarms.

Such tradeoffs are commonly observed in plant communities, particularly in relation to traits associated with resistance to herbivory. Indeed, global experiments show that interspecific tradeoffs are common between plant defense and growth or competitive ability; however, the positive effects of herbivory on plant diversity predicted by theories with trait-based tradeoffs are far less commonly observed. Moreover, both the overall and relative importance of these tradeoffs in promoting plant diversity are not well known. To disentangle the relationships among growth, competition, and defense in relation to plant community evenness, we built a model that describes the effects of a shared herbivore on two plant species with the potential to differ in each of these traits. While tradeoffs between plant defense and growth or competitive ability can increase plant diversity via evenness, this is not always the case nor is it a requirement for increased diversity. Herbivores may increase plant diversity even in the absence of defensive tradeoffs, preferentially consuming apparently maladapted species, by limiting the negative effects of interspecific interactions. Therefore, the importance of defensive tradeoffs in increasing diversity may not be as important, or as straightforward, as previously hypothesized.","[Mortensen, Brent; Danielson, Brent] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Abbott, Karen C.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Mortensen, B (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",bdm@iastate.edu,"Mortensen, Brent/AAD-2092-2021","Mortensen, Brent/0000-0002-4873-6127; Abbott, Karen/0000-0001-5143-0690",,,,51,3,3,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2018,127,1,,,,,63,72,,10.1111/oik.04300,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR5JF,WOS:000419102100007,,,,,2021-09-24,

In our experimental study, we assessed the behavioral response of individual workers of 4 subordinate ant species during their co-occurrence with workers of a single dominant species. Contrary to most classical experiments focused on aggressive interactions, we assessed workers' speed as a crucial factor in the outcome of co-occurrence. Generally, there was a large intraspecific variation in the speed of the studied specieseach had slow and fast individuals. Workers of all studied species moved faster just after interaction, suggesting that contact between 2 hostile workers is a stressful stimulus, generating a behavioral reaction of increasing speed. Also, the number of aggressive contacts experienced by a given individual positively affected its speed. Moreover, workers which were fast when exploring territory were also fast after interspecific interactions. The duration of aggression was significantly reduced by the speed and body size of a subordinate species workerthe more quickly a worker reacted and bigger it was, the shorter was the time of cumulative aggression. To our knowledge, this is the first study of this type to be conducted on ants and we conclude that speed is an overlooked and important characteristic of species and also individuals, therefore it should be considered as a driver of patterns of co-occurrence in ant assemblages.","[Slipinski, Piotr] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Zmihorski, Michal] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Zmihorski, Michal] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Krakow, Poland","Slipinski, P (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",piotrs@miiz.waw.pl,,"Slipinski, Piotr/0000-0002-7336-4134; Zmihorski, Michal/0000-0001-5137-1635; , Michal/0000-0002-2951-3462","Iuventus Plus - Ministry of Science and Higher Education [IP2011 064771]; Internal Grant for Young Scientists from the Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences","We are grateful for the helpful comments of 3 anonymous referees, which greatly improved the quality of this article.

Communities of organisms are shaped by a complex suite of positive and negative species interactions. Ecological phenomena like biological invasions typically evoke notions of negative effects on native communities. Yet, negative effects within specific food-web components can also have positive feedbacks that manifest elsewhere within the food web. 2. We designed an experiment to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of invasive bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis: Cyprinidae) on planktonic and benthic invertebrates and the growth and survival of juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus: Centrarchidae). 3. Our experiment indicated that the presence of bighead carp indirectly facilitated bluegill growth and survival. The underlying processes driving predator-predator facilitation stemmed from a combination of indirect interactions occurring through invertebrates in planktonic and vegetated habitats. Individual bluegill consumed more cladocerans and predatory macroinvertebrates in the presence of bighead carp. The presence of bighead carp appears to have indirectly influenced interactions among cladocerans, invertebrate predators, and bluegill. 4. Understanding the cumulative direct and indirect effects of bigheaded carp on aquatic ecosystems requires the documentation of both negative and positive effects. Although one taxon benefitted from the presence of an invader, our findings demonstrate that this response occurred because bigheaded carp caused imbalances within the food web. We urge that future studies consider a priori how positive and negative interspecific interactions shape the structure of food webs.","[Collins, Scott F.; Nelson, Kirsten A.; DeBoom, Corey S.; Wahl, David H.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA; [Nelson, Kirsten A.; Wahl, David H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL USA; [DeBoom, Corey S.; Wahl, David H.] Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL USA","Collins, SF (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA.",collscot@illinois.edu,,"Collins, Scott/0000-0002-9405-1495",,,,51,10,10,3,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Studies suggest that brood parasitism does not occur at random, but that parasitic females select nests with advantages such as higher physical stability, reduced predation risk, or lower ectoparasite infestations. However, this evidence is sparse and mainly correlative. By experimentally increasing the abundance of Carnus hemapterus (a common, generalist and widespread ectoparasitic nest fly of a multitude of bird species) in half of the nests, we show that parasitic Spotless Starlings (Sturnus unicolor) avoid conspecific nests infested by ectoparasites. Since Carnus ectoparasites impinge costs on their avian nestling hosts, this avoidance response would be adaptive for parasitic Starlings. Further, we suggest a mechanism by which parasitic females may assess the level of ectoparasite infestation to select host nests accordingly: by using parasite cues such as faeces and blood remains. Additionally, these cues may be used by parasitic females for synchronization with the reproductive cycle of host females because ectoparasite cues also indicate that incubation has already commenced. Whatever the functionality, the mechanism suggested here may be employed by intra- and interspecific brood parasites, so it might represent a widespread strategy in nature.","[Tomas, Gustavo; Martin-Galvez, David; Ruiz-Rodriguez, Magdalena; Soler, Juan J.] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Tomas, Gustavo] UTPL, Dept Ciencias Nat, Calle Paris S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador; [Martin-Galvez, David] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England","Tomas, G (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.; Tomas, G (corresponding author), UTPL, Dept Ciencias Nat, Calle Paris S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador.",gtomas@eeza.csic.es,"Martin-Galvez, David/H-3707-2011; Soler, J.

After preliminary calibration and quantification of detection errors, we recorded the interactions occurring between five male and four female brown trout in an artificial channel during one week of the spawning season. The 55,637 logs recorded allowed us to describe the encounter network and its fine scale evolution. In particular, the time spent with females varied a lot across males, from two to 24 h in a five-day period, and the males, which spent the most time with females tended to mate more. At the individual level, the temporal distribution of encounters reflected shifts in dominance status, with males sequentially taking over exclusive proximity with females before spawning. Beyond sexual encounters, the method presented here could be applied to many processes interesting to fish ecologists, such as predator-prey interactions, intra and interspecific competition or disease transmission.","[Tentelier, Cedric; Aymes, Jean-Christophe; Spitz, Basile; Rives, Jacques] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, ECOBIOP, INRA, F-64310 St Pee Sur Nivelle, France","Tentelier, C (corresponding author), Univ Pau & Pays Adour, ECOBIOP, INRA, F-64310 St Pee Sur Nivelle, France.",cedric.tentelier@univ-pau.fr,"Tentelier, Cedric/L-7195-2017; Tentelier, Cedric/AAH-6038-2019","Tentelier, Cedric/0000-0003-2178-4900; Aymes, Jean-Christophe/0000-0002-1181-3010",French national institute for agronomic research (INRA) through its Innovative projects program,We thank Stephane Glise for his help in running the Lapitxuri experimental facility and John Burt for his technical support on Encounternet.

Predaceous diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) are a model group for testing these potential coexistence mechanisms because they are abundant, interact in finite habitats, and are mobile among habitats. We focused on two morphologically similar species, Laccophilus fasciatus rufus (Aube) and Laccophilus proximus (Say), to determine if mechanisms exist that help to explain patterns of their coexistence. Behavioral observations and feeding trials in the laboratory, a field experiment, and a mesocosm experiment were used to determine if habitat use, prey consumption, or dispersal rates of these two species were inherently different or changed when in the presence of intra- or interspecific competitors. We found no difference between habitat use or prey consumption between species in constant depth aquaria, and no effect of intra- or interspecifics on their behaviors. In variable depth aquaria, L. proximus occupied significantly shallower habitat when compared with L. f. rufus; in the former this difference only occurred between conspecific treatments. Field collections confirmed that L. proximus occupied shallower habitats than L. f. rufus. In field mesocosms, L. proximus displayed higher dispersal rates than L. f. rufus. These species also do not appear food limited in the field, suggesting that adult competition for food is unlikely. L. f. rufus and L. proximus exhibit different habitat use and dispersal responses, but this does not seem to be in response to intra- or interspecific competitive interactions.","[Pitcher, K.

Here, we present a first quantification of the interaction structure of a herbivore-centered food web from the High Arctic. Targeting the Lepidoptera of Northeast Greenland, we introduce generalized overlap indices as a novel tool for comparing different types of indirect interactions. First, we quantify the scope for top-down-up interactions as the probability that a herbivore attacking plant species i itself fed as a larva on species j. Second, we gauge this herbivore overlap against the potential for bottom-up-down interactions, quantified as the probability that a parasitoid attacking herbivore species i itself developed as a larva on species j. Third, we assess the impact of interactions with other food web modules, by extending the core web around the key herbivore Sympistis nigrita to other predator guilds (birds and spiders). We find the host specificity of both herbivores and parasitoids to be variable, with broad generalists occurring in both trophic layers. Indirect links through shared resources and through shared natural enemies both emerge as forces with a potential for shaping the herbivore community. The structure of the host-parasitoid submodule of the food web suggests scope for classic apparent competition. Yet, based on predation experiments, we estimate that birds kill as many (8%) larvae of S. nigrita as do parasitoids (8%), and that spiders kill many more (38%). Interactions between these predator guilds may result in further complexities. Our results caution against broad generalizations from studies of limited food web modules, and show the potential for interactions within and between guilds of extended webs. They also add a data point from the northernmost insect communities on Earth, and describe the baseline structure of a food web facing imminent climate change.","[Roslin, Tomas; Wirta, Helena; Hopkins, Tapani; Hardwick, Bess] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Varkonyi, Gergely] Friendship Pk Res Ctr, Nat Environm Ctr, Finnish Environm Inst, Kuhmo, Finland","Roslin, T (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",tomas.roslin@helsinki.fi,"Varkonyi, Gergely/I-2310-2012; Hopkins, Tapani/U-6088-2019; Roslin, Tomas/E-8648-2016; Wirta, Helena/U-1892-2019","Varkonyi, Gergely/0000-0002-7977-2753; Roslin, Tomas/0000-0002-2957-4791; Wirta, Helena/0000-0002-4667-2166; Hardwick, Bess/0000-0001-5195-6115; Hopkins, Tapani/0000-0002-2256-0098",INTERACT under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme; University of Helsinki [788/51/2010]; Kone foundation,"Funding by INTERACT (http://www.eu-interact.org/; project QUANTIC) under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme, by the University of Helsinki (http://www.helsinki.fi/university/index.html; grant number 788/51/2010 to TR), and by the Kone foundation (http://www.koneensaatio.fi/en/, through a grant to HW) is gratefully acknowledged.

Here, we show that water flow has a net positive effect on the biodiversity of benthic invertebrate communities in three biogeographic regions. In Palau and Alaska, flow velocity predicted 55-91% of the variance in species richness in natural communities. In experimental communities in Alaska and Maine, enhanced water flow treatments resulted in higher levels of species density (+56%) and richness (+74%), which were predicted by the abundance of locally rare species. Additionally, the richness of recruitment was higher in experimentally enhanced flows (+46%). Thus, the data suggest that flow drives diversity by mediating the delivery of rare species in multiple biogeographic regions. Consequently, flow velocity should be included in future developments of diversity theory and conservation strategy.","[Palardy, James E.; Witman, Jon D.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Palardy, JE (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 80 Waterman St,Box G-W, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",palardy@gmail.com,"Palardy, James/L-9092-2019","Palardy, James/0000-0002-8347-7108",,,,50,41,42,4,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We studied the effect of the presence of conspecific larvae and their tracks on the oviposition site selection of an aphid- specific predator, Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer ( Diptera: Syrphidae), in two-choice experiments using a leaf disc bioassay. Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify the volatile chemicals released from odour extracts of E. balteatus larval tracks. The behavioural effects of these volatile substances on hoverfly females were also evaluated. Our experiments demonstrated that E. balteatus females were deterred from ovipositing when presented with a Vicia faba leaf with aphids and conspecific larvae. The oviposition-deterring stimulus was also active when females were presented with a leaf that contained conspecific larval tracks. A mixture of chemical compounds was found in the volatile pattern of odour extracts of larval tracks. The main volatile chemicals were 3-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, hexanoic acid and phenol. Females also laid significantly fewer eggs in response to odorant volatiles emitted from larval extracts. These results highlight that predatory hoverfly females avoid ovipositing in aphid colonies in which conspecific larvae or their tracks are already present, suggesting that this behaviour constitutes a strategy that enables females to optimize their oviposition site and reduce competition suffered by their offspring.

This kind of indirect effects has received little attention to date, although recent research suggest they may not be infrequent. Chytridiomycosis is an EID that is affecting amphibian assemblages worldwide. Here we present the first (to our knowledge) field evidence of its indirect effect on assemblage structure through the disruption of a biotic interaction. We have documented an expansion of the common toad (Bufo bufo) after chytridiomycosis nearly extirpated the midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) in Penalara Natural Park (Central Spain). Bufo bufo has significantly increased its number of breeding sites. All newly occupied breeding ponds were colonized once the large numbers of large, overwintering A. obstetricans tadpoles they had previously held disappeared. An experiment demonstrated that breeding B. bufo adults strongly avoided laying eggs in water containing A. obstetricans tadpoles, accounting for observed patterns of pond use. A second experiment failed to show any predation by large A. obstetricans tadpoles on B. bufo eggs, but other researchers have documented reductions in condition, growth and survival of B. bufo larvae caused by the presence of A. obstetricans tadpoles. In Penalara, chytridiomycosis attacks B. bufo too, but its effect on it has been quite less severe than on A. obstetricans. Our findings show how, besides any chytridiomycosis direct effects, interspecific differences in its impact may alter assemblage-influencing biotic interactions and, hence, assemblage structure in indirect ways.","[Bosch, Jaime; Rincon, Pedro A.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Bosch, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",bosch@mncn.csic.es,"Bosch, Jaime/H-3042-2011","Bosch, Jaime/0000-0002-0099-7934",,,,55,24,25,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Filter-feeding zooplankters, such as Daphnia, cope with resources fluctuations by adjusting their life-history as a function of balances in the energy allocation rules. Additionally, Daphnia populations often withstand interspecific competition within coexisting related species, and it is generally assumed that body size is a strategic trait conditioning exploitative ability and the related competitive advantage of species. The life-history responses of one Daphnia magna population and three Populations of Daphnia cf longispina to a discrete gradient of algae concentration were assessed. This experiment was focused on (i) how these distinct Populations regulate life-history when feeding over low, intermediate and high food-levels; and on (ii) whether the large-bodied D. magna can be better in exploiting resources over the gradient than can the smaller D. cf longispina populations. We found evidences that body size might not be the single trait influencing the exploitative ability of related species. The D. cf longispina populations were often better than D. magna in exploiting different levels of resources, and remarkable differences in fitness were found between these similar-sized individuals within food-level; indeed, these differences were frequently of higher scale than those found between the larger D. magna and any of the D. cf longispina populations.","[Pereira, J.

Here we dissect their contributions to community stability in a model herbivore-natural enemy interaction consisting of two aphid species (Acyrthosiphon pisum and Megoura viciae) and a specialist parasitoid (Aphidius ervi) that attacks only one of the aphids (A. pisum). In replicated cage experiments, we found that the two aphid species alone were unable to coexist, with A. pisunt competitively excluding M. viciae. We also found that the simple host-parasitoid interaction between A. pisum and the parasitoid was unstable. However, the three-species community persisted for at least 50 weeks. We constructed a series of models to explain the stability of the full community and conclude that it is due to a combination of density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect interactions. Parasitoid attack on the susceptible host reduces the interspecific competition experienced by the non-host (a density-mediated effect), and the presence of the non-host reduces the searching efficiency of the parasitoid (a trait-mediated effect).","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","van Veen, FJF (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",f.vanveen@imperial.ac.uk,"van Veen, Franciscus JF/H-2101-2013","van Veen, Frank/0000-0003-0708-5492",,,,44,50,51,0,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2005,86,12,,,,,3182,3189,,10.1890/04-1590,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,994YI,WOS:000234066700006,,,,,2021-09-24,

The indirect effects of predators on lower trophic levels have been studied without much attention to phenotypically plastic traits of key food web components. Phenotypic plasticity among species creates phenotypic diversity over a changing environmental landscape. 2. We measured the indirect effects of planktivorous larval walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) on phytoplankton biomass through their effects on the dominant herbivore species, Daphnia pulicaria and D. mendotae. 3. Fish had no effect on phytoplankton biomass or overall Daphnia density. We observed a compensatory response to predation by functionally comparable species within a trophic level in the form of shifting dominance and coexistence of Daphnia species. We hypothesized that this phenotypically plastic response to predation decoupled a potential trophic cascade in this freshwater pelagic system. Daphnia pulicaria density decreased over time with fish predation, but D. mendotae density increased over time with fish predation. 4. Phenotypically plastic life history trait shifts and reproductive rates differed between species in fishless and fish enclosures, accounting for population trends. Daphnia pulicaria were also proportionally higher in walleye larvae stomachs than in the enclosures, indicating that walleye preferred to feed on D. pulcaria over D. mendotae. The resultant shift in dominance may partially explain the overall benign effect of fish on grazers and supports the hypothesis that trophic level diversity can decouple a trophic cascade.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Bernot, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",bernot.1@nd.edu,,"Dodds, Walter/0000-0002-6666-8930",,,,64,6,7,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

On Prosecco, densities of Amblyseius andersoni, and to a lesser extent of Typhlodromus pyri increased when downy mildew symptoms occurred on a high number of leaves. On Pinot, A. andersoni was the dominant species and its densities markedly increased when downy mildew spread. A. andersoni populations were significantly larger on leaves with downy mildew symptoms than on leaves without symptoms and their densities were positively correlated to the extent of leaf surface showing symptoms. The effect of downy mildew on T pyri populations was less marked. There were no relationships between downy mildew spread and spider mite abundance (Panonychus ulmi). Untreated plots or plots treated with folpet to control downy mildew were monitored in an experimental vineyard colonized by A. andersoni. A. andersoni populations increased when downy mildew symptoms spread and their densities were significantly higher in the control than on folpet plots. In another experimental vineyard, T pyri densities were significantly higher in the control (severely infected by downy mildew) than on copper hydroxide plots. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF) was employed to detect downy mildew in mites and glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) was selected from among different enzymes. A stain corresponding to downy mildew in addition to the phytoseiid intrinsic stains was detected in a high proportion of A. andersoni and T pyri collected from infected leaves. Downy mildew stains were not detected in P. ulmi females collected from infected leaves. Most A. andersoni and T pyri females confined on symptomatic leaves became positive to IEF a few hours later.

But, despite the numerous studies on interspecific trophic interactions, few studies have evaluated their feeding strategy, especially by experimental approaches. In this study, we determined, in the absence of both intra and interspecific competitive interactions, the feeding preferences of the freshwater grass shrimp Palaemonetes antennarius for the most common potential resources in its habitat. Plant and animal items were offered as food to each adult shrimp in multiple-choice laboratory experiments. Resource selection was determined under conditions of low and high food availability and related to the shrimp body size. The role of microbial colonisation in favouring detritivory was also investigated. Results of these experiments showed that P. antennarius consumed only animal items, mostly preferring the isopod Proasellus coxalis. In addition, palatability of the unselected plant remains and non-living prey was not improved by the microbial enrichment. Shrimps also resorted to cannibalism at low ration. By contrast, at high ration they specialised on a narrower range of resources, directing more their feeding efforts towards isopods. The preference ranking of the selected food types was inversely related to the average mass of the prey and varied with the shrimp body size. In particular, the number of live isopods in the diet increased exponentially with the shrimp mass at food high ration, which resulted not to be limiting. In conclusion, food availability influences the food niche of P. antennarius whose feeding strategy in the laboratory is facultative specialisation on dead and live animals rather than omnivory.

The short time required to hatch and develop from egg to adult, usually in temporary pools, suggests a strategy which allows for exploitation of transient pools, thus evading predation and interspecific competition. Under these conditions intra specific competition could represent a major density-dependent source of larval mortality, but the relative importance of density-dependent regulation of mosquito populations has generated controversy. Therefore we examined the effects of larval density on basic population characteristics of Ae. albifasciatus in the laboratory. Larvae were obtained by synchronous hatching of eggs laid by field-trapped females. Emerging larvae (L1) were used to build cohorts of different initial densities, kept in plastic trays with 400 ml of distilled water, and food supplied daily during the first 10 days (0.1 g per larvae day(-)1). Age-specific development time and specific and relative mortality were estimated, and their relation to initial larval density was assessed through linear and non-linear regressions and correlation analysis. First hatching was registered 3 h after flooding the eggs. Higher levels of pre-adult mortality were detected in groups with higher densities. Specific mortality and average time to enter a stage of L1 to L3 could directly be related to initial larval density, but no significant relations were found for L4 and pupae. Results suggest that crowding could be a factor capable of regulating the density of natural populations of Ae. albifasciatus.","Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, Mendoza & Entre Rios, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina","Gleiser, RM (corresponding author), Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, Mendoza & Entre Rios, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina.",,"Gorla, David/AAX-3360-2020","Gorla, David/0000-0002-9323-9365",,,,17,22,25,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

The evidence that links observed responses of rodents to habitat variables is largely correlative, and theories on mechanisms of recovery are often simplified or speculative. Experimental manipulations of resources, competitive interactions and predation rates are proposed as the best way to clarify which factors are most influential upon individuals, populations and communities in the post-fire environment.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ Sydney, Inst Wildlife Res, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Sutherland, EF (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730",,,,84,107,118,1,37,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,1448-5494,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

On average 50% of foraging observations were in mixed-species foraging aggregations, but with extensive interspecific variation. The occurrence of mixed-species foraging aggregations was relatively constant from the end of May until early July, with no indication that the appearance of fledglings increased the frequency of aggregations. These mixed-species foraging aggregations consisted of a wide variety of species in terms of foraging niche: typical flycatchers, specialized arboreal insectivores, and generalists were observed foraging together. The titmice species (Parus spp.) seemed to be preferred as foraging companions. The sites where foraging aggregations were observed did not differ from an equal number of randomly chosen sites with respect to forest vegetation structure. The dispersion of individuals in study areas was analysed using a 50 m x 50 m quadrat as the sampling unit. Altogether, 96 quadrats were surveyed. The dispersion of individual birds with respect to individuals of other species was non-random, and significantly clumped within quadrats. We used two playback experiments to test whether the aggregations were due to active search for heterospecific companions. In the first experiment, 20 randomly assigned sites received two 10-min treatments: willow tit (Parus montanus) song and silence as control. In the second experiment, we had two control treatments at 30 playback sites for the willow tit sons, the song of the olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus borealis) and classical music. More species were observed during willow tit song than during any of the controls. This suggests that aggregated dispersion pattern and the existence of mixed-species foraging aggregations were due to active search for heterospecific companions, and also that recognition of neighbouring species was involved. We suggest that birds actively aggregate in mixed-species Foraging groups to gain protection against predators and/or enhance feeding efficiency. The results support the view that positive interactions have an importance in structuring northern breeding bird communities.","FINNISH GAME & FISHERIES RES INST,MELTAUS GAME RES STN,FIN-97340 MELTAUS,FINLAND","Monkkonen, M (corresponding author), UNIV OULU,DEPT BIOL,POB 333,FIN-90571 OULU,FINLAND.",,"Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011; Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,50,62,65,0,45,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1996,77,1,,,,,127,136,,10.2307/3545592,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VQ986,WOS:A1996VQ98600014,,,,,2021-09-24,

We compared the behaviour of birds that foraged in pairs (mono- or hetero-specific) and solitarily. The percentage of time spent foraging was higher when a Great Tit was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species rather than with another Great Tit or a member of the dominant species. When a bird was solitary, time spent foraging was less than when it was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species, and greater than when it was with one belonging to the dominant species. The proportion of time spent vigilant did not differ between Great Tits that foraged with an individual from a dominant species or a subordinate species or with a conspecific, but was higher for solitary birds. Vigilance time of solitary Great Tits, Nuthatches, and three other Parus species was not negatively correlated with interspecific dominance status. In these small passerines, vigilance does not seem to be directed towards the detection of a competitor species. Surveillance for predators and detection of competitor species may be synchronous, nonexclusive tasks. Scanning rate (number of scans per minute of feeding) was the same for Great Tits that fed either solitarily or in pairs, but mean scan duration was significantly shorter for individuals in groups than when solitary.

The feeding mode of both species and the tube-building of P. elegans are assumed to affect community structure by interactions with other species. The weight of tubes of P. elegans varied between 2 and 13 g DW/100 cm2 at the two stations investigated and during the year, which is equivalent to 230-1500 cm of tubes per 100 cm2 of sediment surface. Sediment stability may be affected directly or indirectly by the amount of tubes present. M. balthica shows a linear relation between the maximum size of particles which can be inhaled and animal length. In Kiel Bay, particles > 0.5 mm are out of the range of this species. In summer, the potential feeding area (PFA) of a P. elegans population at one station in Kiel Bay was 1.8 times the available surface area. The PFA of three different populations of M. balthica in Kiel Bay exceeded the available surface area by factors of 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2.

Here, we investigated the impact of norfloxacin (NOR) on the short-term (<= 6 days) dynamics of co-cultured Scenedesmusquadricauda-Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmusobliquus-C. vulgaris, and the long-term (<= 70 days) dynamics of co-cultured S.obliquus-C. vulgaris in experiments with or without grazer Daphnia magna at sublethal antibiotic concentrations (0, 0.5, 2 and 8 mg L-1). NOR increased the relative abundance of Scenedesmus species in the absence of grazers but exerted opposite effects when Daphnia was present in both short- and long-term experiments due to reduced colony size. Meanwhile, increasing NOR concentrations led to quickly increased total algal density in the initial stage, followed by a sharp decline in the long-term experiment in the absence of grazers; when Daphnia was present, population fluctuations were even larger for both prey and predator species (e.g., grazer extinction at the highest concentration). Thus, NOR affected the outcome of species interactions and decreased temporal stability of plankton ecosystems, suggesting that antibiotics have more extensive impacts than presently recognized.","[Pan, Ying; Dong, Jinyan; Wan, Lingling; Chang, Xuexiu] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying; Dong, Jinyan; Wan, Lingling] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Plateau Mt Ecol & Restorat Degrade, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying; Sun, Shucun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [MacIsaac, Hugh J.; Drouillard, Ken G.; Chang, Xuexiu] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9 B 3P4, Canada","Chang, XX (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Chang, XX (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9 B 3P4, Canada.",changxx@ynu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31670440]; Yunnan Province Key Research Program for Science and Technology [2018BC002, 32017BC041]; Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of China [S201910673095]","We thank Shiwei Yan, Guangdi Yi, Dan Liu, Jun Luo, Yuhe Wu, Deqin Gao, Han Yang, Guanwen Chen, Jie-xin Tan, and Zi-yong Cao for their help with data collection.

This Review gives a brief overview of a number of skills that the fish need to secure prey with their shooting technique. Archerfish are opportunistic hunters and, even in the wild, shoot at artificial objects to determine whether these are rewarding. They can detect non-moving targets and use efficient search strategies with characteristics of human visual search. Their learning of how to engage targets can be remarkably efficient and can show impressive degrees of generalization, including learning from observation. In other cases, however, the fish seem unable to learn and it requires some understanding of the ecological and biophysical constraints to appreciate why. The act of shooting has turned out not to be of a simple all-or-none character. Rather, the fish adjust the volume of water fired according to target size and use fine adjustments in the timing of their mouth opening and closing manoeuvre to adjust the hydrodynamic stability of their jets to target distance. As soon as prey is dislodged and starts falling, the fish make rapid and yet sophisticated multi-dimensional decisions to secure their prey against many intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Although it is not known why and how archerfish evolved an ability to shoot in the first place, I suggest that the evolution of shooting has strongly pushed the co-evolution of diverse other skills that are needed to secure a catch.","[Schuster, Stefan] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Physiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Schuster, S (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Physiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",stefan.schuster@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Schuster, Stefan/0000-0002-0873-8996","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Schu1470/1, Schu1470/3, Schu1470/6-11]","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Schu1470/1, 3, 6-11).",,91,2,2,0,11,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

Yet, in apparent defiance of the competitive exclusion principle, large numbers of species form natural communities while sharing a small number of limiting resources. Consumers not only coexist, but also show positive facilitative interactions among themselves. Since body size and functional responses may play important roles in these interactions, we investigate their joint effects on two consumers over a single resource. We find that two consumers with unimodal Type IV functional response can facilitate each other by increasing each other's intake rates. But, this facilitation does not necessarily impact their co-existence. When the consumers differ in their body sizes, the larger consumer receives greater absolute benefits, and the smaller consumer gains more relative benefits. These results are consistent with empirical observations, and do not require any additional assumptions over the parameters governing dynamics of resources to explain net positive interactions between consumers.

Repetition of experiments in space and time provides an estimate of this variability at specific scales, but does not explain how changes in variance generate structure in assemblages and the extent to which variance and mean intensity interact. This paper seeks to identify suitable procedures for empirical analyses on the influence of variance and mean intensity of predictor ecological variables on spatial and temporal patterns in natural populations. A survey of the ecological literature indicates that temporal variability in studies of disturbance and in analyses of consumer-resource interactions is generally expressed in terms of frequency of events. This is inappropriate, as frequency confounds the variance with the mean effect size of a process. A possible solution to the problem involves experimental designs in which levels of intensity and those of variability are chosen independently over explicit spatial or temporal scales and treated as fixed, orthogonal factors. Examples are offered for various scenarios of consumer-resource interactions along with indications for statistical tests of hypotheses. Such novel approaches have important ramifications for understanding variability in a wide range of ecological contexts and for predicting the response of assemblages to increased environmental fluctuations, including those expected under modified climate conditions.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","Benedetti-Cecchi, L (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, Via A Volta 6, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",bencecc@discuit.unipi.it,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/J-8225-2019","Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/0000-0001-5244-5202",,,,75,144,147,2,84,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2003,84,9,,,,,2335,2346,,10.1890/02-8011,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,719VQ,WOS:000185226100010,,,,,2021-09-24,

The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance. There was a high degree of uncertainty predicted and observed in the study system. Despite this, I show that the degree and the sources of uncertainty were predictable for each species. This suggests that the inverse community matrix offers a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the outcome of field press experiments.","YALE UNIV,CTR COMPUTAT ECOL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511","Schmitz, OJ (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH FORESTRY & ENVIRONM STUDIES,370 PROSPECT ST,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511, USA.",,,,,,,54,96,98,1,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1997,78,1,,,,,55,69,,,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD345,WOS:A1997WD34500004,,,,,2021-09-24,

Most ecological research has focused on negative species interactions, especially competition, predation and parasitism. Yet the relevance of positive interactions - mutualisms and commensalisms - have been brought to the fore in recent years by an increasing number of empirical studies exploring their impact on range limits. Based on a review of 73 studies from a Web of Science search, we found strong evidence that positive interactions can influence the extent of species' geographic or ecological ranges through a diversity of mechanisms. More specifically, we found that while obligate interactions, and especially obligate mutualisms, tend to constrain the ranges of one or both partners, facultative positive interactions tend to widen ranges. Nonetheless, there was more variation in effects of facultative interactions on range limits, pointing to important context-dependencies. Therefore, we propose that conceptual development in this field will come from studying ecological interactions in the context of networks of many species across environmental gradients, since pairwise interactions alone might overlook the indirect and environmentally-contingent effects that species have on each other in communities of many interacting species. Finally, our study also revealed key data gaps that limit our current understanding of the pervasiveness of effects that positive interactions have on species' ranges, highlighting potential avenues for future theoretical and experimental work.","[Stephan, Pauline; Mora, Bernat Bramon; Alexander, Jake M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland","Stephan, P (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",stephanp@student.ethz.ch,"; Alexander, Jake/P-2580-2014","Stephan, Pauline/0000-0002-5218-3852; Alexander, Jake/0000-0003-2226-7913",European UnionEuropean Commission [678841],We thank Thomas Stadler and students on the course `Ecology and Evolution: Term Paper' at ETH Zurich for suggestions that helped improve an early version of this manuscript.

Here, using two terrestrial Testudinidae (Stigmochelys pardalis and Kinbcys belliana) as study models, we (i) present basic demographic characteristics (sex-ratio, and density), (ii) describe correlates of their presence at two spatial scales (micro-habitat and macro-habitat), (iii) evaluate the effects of rainfall on their seasonal activity patterns, and (iv) analyze abundance patterns in relation to macro and micro-habitat characteristics. We also describe an experiment, using tortoise shells, that can allow to control, and eventually correct, the reliability of observed data by taking into account the detectability of the study species in the wild. On the basis of a suite of statistical analysis and GIS-based elaborations, we confirmed, and further uncovered, the remarkable ecological differences existing between S. pardalis and K. belliana. The habitat use was different interspecifically, with K. belliana being much more linked to dense vegetation spots, often nearby waterbodies, whereas S. pardalis being an habitat generalist, at both micro- and macmhabitat scale. Nonetheless, juveniles of both species were observed in areas with significantly higher % soil covered by vegetation taller than 200 cm than adults of both sexes. This different habitat selection is hypothesized to be due to antipredatory reasons. Overall, our data suggests that interspecific competition should be minimal between these species.","[Demaya, Gift Simon; Benansio, John Sebit] Univ Juba, Dept Wildlife, Juba, South Sudan; [Petrozzi, Fabio] Ecolobby, Via E Jenner 70, I-00151 Rome, Italy; [Di Vittorio, Massimiliano] Ecol Applicata Italia Srl, Termini Imerese, PA, Italy; [Fa, John E.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Div Biol & Conservat Ecol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Fa, John E.] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, CIFOR Headquarters, Bogor 16115, Indonesia; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, BP 6057, Lome, Togo; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, PMB 5080, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] IDECC Inst Dev Ecol Conservat & Cooperat, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, BP 6057, Lome, Togo.",gftsimon@yahoo.co.uk; sebitbenansio@yahoo.co.uk; fapetrozzi@gmail.com; divittoriomassimiliano@gmail.com; jfa949@gmail.com; l.luiselli@ideccngo.org,"Dendi, Daniele/AAO-8569-2020","Dendi, Daniele/0000-0003-1417-9091","Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund [172515472, 182518886]; Rainforest Trust; Turtle Conservation Fund [TCF-0687]; National GeographicNational Geographic Society [NGS-52320C-18]; Quarters for Conservation Award","This study was supported by Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (grant no. 172515472 and 182518886), the Rainforest Trust, Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF-0687), National Geographic (NGS-52320C-18), and Quarters for Conservation Award (all funds to L.

Assuming the size-dependency of patch departure behaviour, model-based approaches have shown size-mediated coexistence in systems of competing species. However, experimental evidence for the influence of body size on patch use behaviour is scarce. In this study, we explore whether allometric principles provide an underlying framework for interspecific patterns of resource use. To this end, we propose a meso-cosm approach using three species of gastropods differing in size as a model system and P-32 radio-isotopic techniques as a measure of resource use. Foragers of different size were placed in an artificial patch, provided with a limited amount of labelled resource and let them free to move as resources decrease and scarcity is sensed. We investigated the extent to which individual body size affects the exploitation of resources by examining Giving Up Density (GUD), Giving Up Time (GUT), resource absorption rate and exploitation efficiency as components of individual exploitation behaviour. To compare positive, constant and negative individual size scaling of population energy requirements, experimental trials with an equal numbers and equal biomass of differently sized foragers were carried out, and an experimental trial with equal metabolic requirements was simulated. We observed clear size dependency in the patch departure behaviour of the experimental organisms. Even under conditions of equivalent overall population energy requirements, larger foragers decided to leave the resource patch earlier and at a higher density of resources than smaller ones. Smaller foragers were able to prolong their presence and make more use of the resources, resulting in an inverse body-size scaling of resource exploitation efficiency.","[Cozzoli, Francesco; Ligetta, Giovanna; Vignes, Fabio; Basset, Alberto] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Ecol, Lecce, Italy","Cozzoli, F; Basset, A (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Ecol, Lecce, Italy.",francesco.cozzoli@unisalento.it; alberto.basset@unisalento.it,"Vignes, Fabio/G-9998-2011; Cozzoli, Francesco/K-1273-2019","Vignes, Fabio/0000-0003-0579-6629; Cozzoli, Francesco/0000-0002-6413-0977",ECOPOTENTIAL project (H2020) [641762]; LifeWatch - Italy network,"This work was supported by a grant from the ECOPOTENTIAL project (H2020, grant agreement No 641762) to FC and by LifeWatch - Italy network.

Overcompensation can contribute to the Hydra effect, wherein added mortality increases equilibrium population size. One hypothesis for overcompensation is that added mortality eases density dependence, increasing survival to adulthood (temporal separation of mortality and density dependence). Mortality early in the life cycle is therefore predicted to cause overcompensation, whereas mortality later in the life cycle is not. Another hypothesis for overcompensation is that threat of mortality (e.g., from predation) causes behavioral changes that reduce overexploitation of resources, allowing resource recovery, and increasing production of adults (prudent resource exploitation). Behaviorally active predation cues alone are therefore predicted to cause overcompensation. We tested these predictions in two experiments with larvae of two species of Aedes. As predicted, early mortality yielded greater production of adults, and of adult females, and greater estimated rate of population increase than did later mortality. Addition of water-borne predation cues usually reduced browsing on surfaces in late-stage larvae, but contrary to prediction, resulted in neither significantly greater production of adult mosquitoes nor significantly greater estimated rate of increase. Thus we have strong evidence that timing of mortality contributes to overcompensation and the Hydra effect in mosquitoes. Evidence that predation cues alone can result in overcompensation via prudent resource exploitation is lacking. We expect the overcompensation in response to early mortality will be common in organisms with complex life cycles, density dependence among juveniles, and developmental control of populations.","[McIntire, Kristina M.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",sajulian@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553; McIntire, Kristina/0000-0002-1387-5637","NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [1R15AI094322-01A1, 1R15AI124005-01]; Illinois State University's office of Research and Sponsored Programs; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322, R15AI124005] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank K.

The level of polyandry (defined by the lifetime number of male mates of a female) is an important determinant of the occurrence and intensity of sexual selection acting on male phenotypes. While the forces of sexual selection acting on phenotypic male traits such as body size are relatively well understood, sexual selection acting on phenotypic plasticity of these traits is unexplored. We tackled this issue by scrutinizing the link between polyandry and phenotypic plasticity of male body size in two sympatric plant-inhabiting predatory mite species, Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus. These two species are similar in life history, ecological niche requirements, mating behavior, polygyny and female body size plasticity but strikingly differ in the level of both polyandry and phenotypic plasticity of male body size (both lower in P. persimilis). We hypothesized that deviations from standard body size, i.e. the size achieved under favorable conditions, incur higher costs for males in the less polyandrous P. persimilis. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two experiments on (i) the effects of male body size on spermatophore transfer in singly mating females and (ii) the effects of mate sequence (switching the order of standard-sized and small males) on mating behavior and paternity success in doubly mating females. In P. persimilis but not N. californicus, small males transferred fewer but larger spermatophores to the females; in both species, females re-mated more likely with standard-sized following small than small following standard-sized males; in P. persimilis, first standardsized males sired a higher proportion of offspring produced after re-mating by the female than first small males, whereas in N. californicus the paternity success of small and standard- sized males was independent of the mating sequence. Based on our results and pertinent previous studies, which showed that females of P. persimilis, but not N. californicus, prefer mating with standard-sized over small males and allow them fertilizing more eggs, the lack of interspecific difference in female body size plasticity, and the absence of any clue pointing at a role of natural selection, we suggest that the interspecific difference in male body size plasticity is sexually selected. Our study provides an indication of sexual selection constraining plasticity of male phenotypes, suggesting that the level of polyandry may be an important co-determinant of the level of phenotypic plasticity of male body size.","[Schausberger, Peter] Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, Vienna, Austria; [Schausberger, Peter; Walzer, Andreas] Dept Crop Sci, Grp Arthropod Ecol & Behav, Vienna, Austria; [Murata, Yasumasa; Osakabe, Masahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan","Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, Vienna, Austria.; Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Dept Crop Sci, Grp Arthropod Ecol & Behav, Vienna, Austria.",peter.schausberger@univie.ac.at,"Osakabe, Masahiro/H-8587-2019","Osakabe, Masahiro/0000-0002-2246-3431; Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198","Austria Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 23504-617]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 25876, P 23504] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was financed by a grant from the Austria Science Fund (FWF; P 23504-617) to PS.

We examined intra- and interspecific variation in functional morphology and whole-organism performance in a sympatric lizard species pair, Iberolacerta horvathi and Podarcis muralis, in the area with a high potential for competition. 2. The biggest variation between species was found in two functional traits, bite force and climbing speed, linked with corresponding morphological traits. 3. The species with larger and taller heads, P. muralis, exhibited correspondingly stronger bite forces. The other species exhibited smaller and flatter head. Both traits may potentially promote segregation between species in trophic niche (stronger bites relate to harder prey) and in refuge use (flatter heads allow using narrower crevices, hence, influencing escaping from common predators). Stronger bites and larger heads also provide one species with a dominant position in interspecific agonistic interactions. 4. Females had longer trunks that impacted negatively on climbing speed, which may lower anti-predator escape abilities of the more trunk-dimorphic species, but positively influence reproductive effort. 5. Our results exemplify how the joint examination of morphological and functional traits of ecologically similar and sympatric species can provide a mechanistic background for understanding their coexistence, namely, syntopic populations that are frequent in the study area. 6. The identified roles of functional morphology in this system of sympatric rock lizards support the contribution of functional diversification for the complexity of community structure via coexistence.","[Zagar, Anamarija; Carretero, Miguel A.; Kaliontzopoulou, Antigoni] Univ Porto, InBIO, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Vrezec, A.

Species may reach oceanic islands by three mechanisms: (1) mating flights of reproductives, (2) rafting, and (3) human-assisted dispersal. Past land bridge connections may be important for continental shelf islands. Patterns of species accumulation may be similar even when primary mechanisms of dispersal differ. Colonizing propagules are limited primarily by the presence of suitable habitat and interspecific competition or predation from other ants. Although island area is usually a significant predictor of species richness, the diversity of habitat types is often a better predictor. Distance, or isolation, has often been found to be only a weak predictor of ant species richness, probably because many islands that have been studied are not very distant relative to most species' dispersal abilities. Interspecific competition appears to result in mutually exclusive distributions within islands for some of the more aggressive species, although the effects of habitat affinities have not been well studied. With the exception of very small islands, competition does not appear to result in exclusions of species from entire islands, and robust patterns of nestedness have been observed. Populations go extinct from and immigrate to small islands in ecological time, although such turnover appears to be relatively low compared with other arthropods. Only a few archipelagoes, however, have been the focus of turnover studies. Some species may reach extremely high population abundances on islands but subsequently decline. The exact mechanisms underlying these population fluctuations are not known with certainty, although the presence of honeydew-producing insects has often been associated with the most dramatic cases. Endemicity varies greatly and ranges from 0 to > 96%, peaking at intermediate distances in the Pacific and reaching the highest levels on islands in the Indian Ocean. Anthropogenic disturbances appear to present the greatest driver of change to insular ant communities and result in increasing numbers and abundances of exotic ant species, which may have deleterious effects on the rest of the community.","[Morrison, Lloyd W.] Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 S Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA","Morrison, LW (corresponding author), Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 S Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA.",LloydMorrison@MissouriState.edu,,,National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society,"Thanks to Nicholas Gotelli and Florian Steiner for inviting me to write this article, and to Ken Helms and an anonymous reviewer for their insightful comments.

We present 4 yr of observations and experiments that provide insight into the physiological plasticity of E. paradivisa: its low mortality rates at high light intensities, high competitive abilities, successful symbiont adaptation to the shallow-water environment, and tolerance to bleaching conditions or survival during prolonged bleaching. Despite its ability to survive under high irradiance in shallow water, E. paradivisa is not found in the shallow reef of the GOE/A. We suggest several factors that may explain the high abundance and exclusivity of E. paradivisa in the MCE: its heterotrophic capabilities; its high competition abilities; the possibility of it finding a deep-reef refuge there from fish predation; and its concomitant adaptation to this environment.","[Eyal, Gal; Eyal-Shaham, Lee; Ben-Zvi, Or; Loya, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Eyal, Gal; Eyal-Shaham, Lee; Cohen, Itay; Tamir, Raz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel; [Cohen, Itay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Tamir, Raz] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Life Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Sinniger, Frederic] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, R&D Ctr Submarine Resources, 2-15 Natsushimacho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Sinniger, Frederic] Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, Nishihara, Okinawa 90301, Japan","Eyal, G (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.; Eyal, G (corresponding author), Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel.",galeyal@mail.tau.ac.il,"Loya, Yossi/N-3060-2019; Loya, Yossi/J-3039-2012; Loya, Joseph/AAJ-9014-2020; Eyal, Gal/P-7884-2019","Loya, Yossi/0000-0001-6870-9444; Eyal, Gal/0000-0002-3028-8653; Sinniger, Frederic/0000-0002-4175-5931",Israel Taxonomy Initiative (ITI); Sciences Based Management (SBM); Israel Science Foundation (ISF)Israel Science Foundation [341/12]; USAID/MERC GrantUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) [M32-037],"We would like to thank the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences for making their facilities available to us.

However, resource acquisition often involves conflicting functional demands that may ultimately shape broader ecological patterns. For instance, termites play major roles in ecosystem functioning through their foraging and building activities. Yet, while experiments suggest improved foraging in sand, nest construction depends on clay. Hence, these functions may trade off, with species optima reflecting interspecific variation in building requirements. We investigated whether a foraging-building trade-off could affect termite populations by using three species differing in building requirements, namely Neocapritermes braziliensis, Anoplotermes banksi and Labiotermes labralis. We characterized their populations in relation to soil texture and food amount across a tropical rain forest landscape, and then compared the observed patterns. Colony density was unrelated to food amount in the three species. However, A. banksi was denser at balanced mixtures of sand and clay, consistent with a compromise between foraging and building demands. Further, the species building more mineralized nests (L. labralis) was more abundant on clayish soils, whereas the species relying less on soil for nest construction (N. braziliensis) was more abundant on sandy soils. Changes in colony density correlated with changes in size structure: in N. braziliensis and A. banksi, colony mass variability increased with density due to a sharp decrease in minimum colony mass, consistent with higher productivity and/or size-asymmetric competition. This study suggests a novel functional trade-off that may help drive population density and size structure both within and across termite species.","[Costa Lima Pequeno, Pedro Aurelio] Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Grad Program Ecol, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Franklin, Elizabeth] Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Biodivers Coordinat, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Venticinque, Eduardo Martins] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Bot Ecol & Zool, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Serrao Acioli, Agno Nonato] Univ Fed Amazonas, Inst Nat & Culture, BR-69630000 Benjamin Constant, AM, Brazil","Pequeno, PACL (corresponding author), Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Grad Program Ecol, Av Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",pacolipe@gmail.com,"Venticinque, Eduardo M/G-8961-2015","Venticinque, Eduardo M/0000-0002-3455-9107; Pequeno, Pedro/0000-0001-7350-0485","Brazilian state of Amazonas' Foundation for Research Support (FAPEAM); Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [470375/2006-0, 558318/2009-6]","We thank the staff of Fazenda UFAM, Jonatha P. da Silva, Rosinaldo C.

In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of the invasion mechanisms and ecological impacts of Gracilaria vermiculophylla, a red agarophyte native to Asia Northwest Pacific, which now has become a rapid and successful coastal invader in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Eco-physiological and chemical studies have revealed that some ecological traits, including survival in dark condition (e.g. the ballast water), tolerance to grazing and extreme salinities and temperatures, insensitive to UVR and light intensity and nutrient levels, adaptation to a wide diversity of habitats, and chemical defense to potential predators, may provide G. vermiculophylla an unmatched advantage during its global invasion. The rapid growth, flexible reproduction through fragmentation, efficient recruitment on hard substratum, seeding success on various vectors, and interaction with local community organisms may also contribute to its rapid increase in abundance and effects on the invaded coastal ecosystems. G. vermiculophylla showed both negative and positive impacts to the marine ecosystems through changing interspecific competition, increasing habitat diversity, altering the community complex, and transforming biogeochemical cycles and estuarine food webs. Future surveys such as marine exotic genomics, transcriptome sequencing and epigenetic variation between native and invasive entities may provide insightful promise on molecular mechanisms of seaweed invasion.","[Hu, Zi-Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zi-Min; Juan, Lopez-Bautista] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Hu, ZM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",huzimin9712@163.com,"Hu, Zi-Min/A-7938-2011","Hu, Zi-Min/0000-0002-1313-1785","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31000103]; US National Science Foundation Assembling the Tree of Life ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1036495, DEB-0937978]","We thank everyone who shared with us observations from both experimental and field surveys.

The species was first observed in North America near Delaware Bay (39 degrees N, 75 degrees W) in 1988, and a variety of evidence suggests initial introduction via ballast water early in that decade. The crab spread rapidly after its discovery, and breeding populations currently extend from North Carolina to Maine (35 degrees-45 degrees N). H. sanguineus is now the dominant crab in rocky intertidal habitat along much of the northeast coast of the USA and has displaced resident crab species throughout this region. The Asian shore crab also occurs on the Atlantic coast of Europe and was first reported from Le Havre, France (49 degrees N, 0 degrees E) in 1999. Invasive populations now extend along 1000 km of coastline from the Cotentin Peninsula in France to Lower Saxony in Germany (48-53 degrees N). Success of the Asian shore crab in alien habitats has been ascribed to factors such as high fecundity, superior competition for space and food, release from parasitism, and direct predation on co-occurring crab species. Laboratory and field observations indicate that H. sanguineus is a generalist predator with potential for substantial effects on sympatric populations of mollusks and crustaceans. However, broad ecosystem effects and actual economic impact are unclear. The literature on H. sanguineus is limited in comparison to better known invasive species like the European green crab (Carcinus maenas) and the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Nevertheless, there are substantial bodies of work on larval biology, trophic ecology, and interspecies competition. This paper presents a review of the biology and ecology of invasive populations of the Asian shore crab H. sanguineus in North American and European habitats. (c), 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the wide-spread use of amphibians as experimental model organisms, there is a limited understanding of how multiple abiotic and biotic factors affect the variation in metamorphic traits under natural conditions. The aim of our study was to quantify the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on spatial variation in the body size of tadpoles and size at metamorphosis of the European common toad (Bufo b. spinosus). Our study population was distributed over the riverbed (active tract) and the fringing riparian forest of a natural floodplain. The riverbed had warm ponds with variable hydroperiod and few predators, whereas the forest had ponds with the opposite characteristics. Spatial variation in body size at metamorphosis was governed by the interactive effects of abiotic and biotic factors. The particular form of the interaction between water temperature and intraspecific tadpole density suggests that abiotic factors laid the foundation for biotic factors: intraspecific density decreased growth only at high temperature. Predation and intraspecific density jointly reduced metamorphic size. Interspecific density had a negligible affect on body size at metamorphosis, suggesting weak inter-anuran interactions in the larval stage. Population density at metamorphosis was about one to two orders of magnitudes higher in the riverbed ponds than in the forest ponds, mainly because of lower tadpole mortality. Based on our results, we conclude that ponds in the riverbed appear to play a pivotal role for the population because tadpole growth and survival is best in this habitat.","[Indermaur, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Indermaur, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolut Biol & Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] KARCH, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Tockner, Klement] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schaub, Michael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6203 Sempach, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Indermaur, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",lukas.indermaur@eawag.ch,"Tockner, Klement/G-9265-2011; Schmidt, Benedikt R./B-8491-2008","Schmidt, Benedikt R./0000-0002-4023-1001; Tockner, Klement/0000-0002-0038-8151",MAVA Foundation (Switzerland),"We are grateful to Simone Blaser, Pascal Meuwly and Ursina von Planta for field data collection.

We studied whether the abundance of red wood ants Formica rufa -group is related to the breeding habitat selection, fecundity and offspring quality in the Eurasian treecreeper Certhia familiaris, an old-growth forest passerine. The nest-box occupancy data were gathered over a five-year study period, whereas the breeding performance analyses were based on a two-year data set. The abundance of wood ants, measured within 50 m around the nest-boxes, was not related to nest-box occupancy rate, fecundity or the physiological stress of nestlings. In contrast, the abundance of wood ants was negatively related to the offspring quality and life-history traits, such as lowered body mass, subcutaneous fat reserves, and tarsus length at fledging. Our results suggest that exploitative competition between distantly related taxa may have considerable and adverse influences on nestling quality as measured by body mass, subcutaneous, fat and tarsus length. Red wood ants may decrease the fitness of treecreepers as the lower body condition of nestlings has the potential to impair recruitment into the breeding population and, additionally, impair the future reproductive effort.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Finnish Fprest Res Inst, Kolari Res Stn, FIN-95900 Kolari, Finland","Jantti, A (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",markku.kuitunen@jyu.fi,"Sorvari, Jouni/I-5375-2014","Sorvari, Jouni/0000-0003-2668-7771",,,,38,18,18,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

Mosquitoes in the genus Culex are commonly described as foraging primarily by filtering the water column. This behavior contrasts with that of other container-dwelling genera, such as Aedes and Ochlerotatus, that are thought to forage primarily by browsing on container and detritus surfaces. We compared the feeding behavior of Cx. pipiens, Ae. albopictus, and Oc. triseriatus in a laboratory experiment in which we monitored behavior of individual mosquitoes in two different food environment treatments: food suspended in the water column only and food attached to leaf surfaces only. For each mosquito in each food environment, we quantified the time allocated by larvae to one of four positions and to one of three activities. The effect of treatment was significant, with individuals in Fluid Only environments spending more time resting-filtering at the surface, and individuals in Leaf Only environments spending more time browsing on walls. There were significant differences among species, with Cx. pipiens spending more time at the surface than the other species, which spent more time thrashing below the surface. There was no significant interaction of species and treatment, indicating that all three species modify their behavior in similar ways in these enviromnents. Contrary to current understanding, our data suggest that C-v. pipiens browse as frequently as do these potential competitors but show a greater concentration of foraging effort at the top of a container.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Yee, DA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793-04, R01 AI044793, R01-AI44793] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,41,56,56,0,20,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,SANTA ANA,"PO BOX 87, SANTA ANA, CA 92702 USA",1081-1710,,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

Chub preferred conspecific shoals over heterospecific ones with olfactory cues being more important than visual ones for shoal choice. This preference was consistent with measurements of length:flank area ratios and length:weight ratios which suggest that both species are similar in appearance. When presented with mixed-species shoals, chub increased the percentage time spent with stimulus shoals with increasing proportions of conspecifics. Feeding experiments suggest that the preference for conspecific shoals is driven by interspecific competition (with minnows out-competing similar-sized chub) and the oddity effect. The importance of this work in the context of species assortment in free-ranging shoals is discussed.","Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Ward, AJW (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Krause, Jens/C-2750-2011; Krause, Jens/J-4381-2013; Ward, Ashley/B-6227-2011","Krause, Jens/0000-0002-1289-2857; Ward, Ashley/0000-0003-0842-533X",,,,42,77,80,0,34,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Survey results indicated that wood frogs bred in both open- and closed-canopy ponds, whereas leopard frogs and toads did not, We conducted two experiments in 1.5-m(2) cages set in natural ponds to evaluate species' performance in open- and closed-canopy ponds, The first experiment was conducted in two open-canopy and two closed-canopy ponds and demonstrated that tadpole growth and survivorship for all three species were higher in open-canopy ponds, Wood frogs, however, also grew and survived well in closed-canopy ponds, whereas performance of leopard frogs and toads was very poor in closed-canopy ponds, Competition between species was asymmetrical; wood frogs affected leopard frogs, but the reverse effect was negligible. The second experiment was conducted in the two closed-canopy ponds with wood frog and leopard frog and indicated that food supplementation dramatically increased both survivorship and growth rate of leopard frogs, There was no effect of food addition on wood frog survivorship and a minimal effect on growth rate, Resource differences between open- and closed-canopy ponds therefore appear to have a strong influence on distributions of these species, Dissolved oxygen concentrations also were lower in closed- than in open-canopy ponds, which may interact with resource levels to influence species performance, Finally, we note the potentially widespread and important influence of forest and pond succession on the distribution of amphibian species.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Werner, EE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,41,179,189,0,32,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS,CHARLESTON,"UNIV CHARLESTON, GRICE MARINE LABORATORY, 205 FORT JOHNSON RD, CHARLESTON, SC 29412 USA",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 5,1999,,1,,,,,1,12,,10.2307/1447379,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,167TY,WOS:000078650400001,,,,,2021-09-24,

These differences give rise to different shell forms in different habitats. In those species which have non-planktotrophic development, differences in shell form among shores have been usually explained in terms of natural selection because exposure to waves supposedly favours light shells with large apertures, while predation by crabs on sheltered shores favours elongated, thick shells with smaller apertures. Differences in shell shape among species found at different heights on the shore have been explained in terms of resistance to desiccation and temperature. Such variables would tend to act on a relatively broad-scale, i.e. causing differences among heights on a shore or among shores. Rates of growth, which might vary at much smaller scales within a shore, have also been shown to affect the shapes of many shells. In this study, the shape and relative weight of shells of three species of co-existing littorinids (Littorina unifasciata, Bembicium nanum and Nodilittorina pyramidalis) were measured. These species all have planktotrophic development and they are found on many shores where there is no evidence that they are preyed upon by crabs. Before explanations of shell shape are proposed, it is necessary that patterns of variation, within different parts of a shore and among different shores are clearly documented. These patterns were measured at a number of different spatial scales within and among replicate shores with different amounts of wave exposure. Large and small specimens were included to allow intraspecific comparisons among snails of different sizes found at different heights on the shore. The results showed significant differences among shores in shape and relative weight of shells, but these differences could not be explained by exposure to waves. In addition, snails of different sizes and different species did not show the same patterns although they were collected from the same sites. Importantly, the shell shape of Littorina unifasciata varied significantly among sites at approximately the same height within a shore. These differences could not be clearly correlated with density, mean size nor exposure to waves. The only consistent pattern was a decrease in relative aperture size in specimens living higher on the shore. Models that have commonly been proposed to explain shape and relative weight of shells in other species of gastropods are not adequate to explain the small- and large-scale variation of the measurements described here. It is proposed that any selective advantage of shell morphology and the effects of any variables on the development of shell morphology in these species can only be identified after appropriately designed and replicated field experiments.",,"CHAPMAN, MG (corresponding author), UNIV SYDNEY,INST MARINE ECOL,MARINE ECOL LABS A11,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.",,"Chapman, Maura/B-2287-2008",,,,,70,35,35,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0260-1230,,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quantitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22% of the over 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90% of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52 %) and seed dispersal (31 %), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63 %) focused simply on identifying the mutualists of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners. Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or combinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.",,"BRONSTEIN, JL (corresponding author), UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,,,,171,359,372,6,208,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0033-5770,1539-7718,,Q REV BIOL,Q.

Interaction chains result from linked direct interactions between species pairs. Interaction modifications, emergent effects of a multispecies assemblage, result when a third species changes how a pair of other species interacts. Experiments and patterns of abundance in the upper zone of a rocky intertidal community provide examples of both types of indirect effects. By consuming limpets (Lottia digitalis), bird predators indirectly enhance acorn barnacle (Balanus glandula) abundance on horizontal rock benches because limpets dislodge or inadvertently consume young acorn barnacles, an example of an interaction chain. Because L. digitalis has a light-colored shell that is similar in color to barnacle shells, barnacles alter the bird-limpet interaction by changing the ability of birds to find limpets, an example of an interaction modification. Distinguishing between interaction chains and interaction modifications is important because interaction chains can be predicted with only a knowledge of pairwise species interactions while descriptions of interaction modifications require a knowledge of all species combinations involved, precluding a priori prediction. By classifying empirically determined indirect effects, the degree to which indirect effects can be predicted from a knowledge of pairwise interactions can be determined, and the mechanisms that cause interaction modifications can be identified to aid in future prediction.","UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT ZOOL, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,"Wootton, J.

Experiments were performed to test for effects of time of introduction of two later-breeding species (Phyllomedusa tomopterna or Epipedobates femoralis) on their own larval performance and on that of an earlier-breeding species (Osteocephalus taurinus). In experiment 1, I measured the response of the later species (P. tomopterna or E. femoralis in separate runs of the experiment) to variation in its time of introduction with respect to an early species (O. taurinus). In experiment 2, I tested for differential response of the late species introduced synchronously to different stocks of O. taurinus. Finally, in experiment 3, I measured the response of the early species (O. taurinus) to variation in introduction time of the late species. Neither late species had an effect on O. taurinus (the early species). Phyllomedusa tomopterna showed lower survival and growth when introduced late than when introduced earlier or in the absence of O. taurinus; this result indicates that breeding phenology affects the intensity of competition. In contrast, Epipedobates femoralis did poorly whenever it was reared with O. taurinus. These results indicate that the effects of variation in breeding phenology differ between species pairs.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA",,,,,,,,24,10,11,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1992,65,2,,,,,307,313,,10.2307/3545023,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JT280,WOS:A1992JT28000017,,,,,2021-09-24,

Two shrub species, Haplopappus ericoides and H. venetus var. sedoides, were found to have shallow root systems that occupied the same soil depths as those of C. edulis. In the presence of C. edulis, the normal rooting profiles of the shrubs were displaced downward, although partial overlap with C. edulis remained. Removal of C. edulis from around individuals of both shrub species resulted in higher predawn xylem pressure potentials in shrubs from the removal treatments as compared to controls, suggesting that the surrounding C. edulis was utilizing water that would otherwise have been available to these shrubs. In H. ericoides, predawn xylem pressure potentials of removal treatment shrubs remained higher than those of the controls throughout the remainder of the dry season even though these shrubs showed a marked increase in canopy area after removal of surrounding C. edulis. Removal of C. edulis from around H. venetus also initially led to higher predawn xylem pressure potentials in the removal shrubs as compared to the controls and increased production of new leaves. After this initial period the predawn xylem pressure potentials of the removal shrubs were not significantly different from those of controls, suggesting that the demand for water by the increased leaf areas eventually matched the enhanced water availability resulting from C. edulis removal. Also, the morphology of H. venetus shrubs changed to that more typical of unaffected individuals. Thus, C. edulis significantly affected not only the water relations of these two shrub species but also their shoot sizes and overall morphologies.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT BIOL SCI,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106",,,,,,,,47,165,170,1,71,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,COLUMBUS,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210",0002-9122,,,AM J BOT,Am.

So far most studies have focused on antiparasite defenses operating at the egg and chick stages and neglected defenses that may work prior to parasite egg deposition. Here, we experimentally explore the possibility that hosts, as part of a front-line defense, might minimize parasitism costs through informed nest site choice based on perceived risk of cuckoo parasitism. We conducted a large-scale manipulation of visual and auditory cues potentially informing on the risk of great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius parasitism during the nest site choice period of the magpie Pica pica host to investigate its effect on host's nest settlement and individual year to year site fidelity. Early breeding magpies preferentially placed their nests in safe areas (i.e., in sites of low perceived risk of parasitism), and, this effect diluted with time elapsed since risk of parasitism was manipulated. Site fidelity of individual magpies decreased with risk of cuckoo parasitism, for those that were not parasitized in the previous year. Our results constitute the first strong evidence showing that hosts can minimize the costs of cuckoo parasitism through informed nest-site choice, calling for future consideration of defenses potentially operating prior to parasite egg deposition to achieve a better understanding of cuckoo-host coevolution.","[Exposito-Granados, Monica; Parejo, Deseada; Aviles, Jesus M.] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 Almeria, Spain; [Gabriel Martinez, Juan; Precioso, Marta; Molina-Morales, Mercedes] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Parejo, Deseada] Univ Extremadura, Dept Zool, Avda Elvas, E-06006 Badajoz, Spain","Exposito-Granados, M (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 Almeria, Spain.",moexposit@eeza.csic.es,"Parejo, Deseada/L-3953-2014; Aviles, Jesus/K-3332-2014; Molina-Morales, Mercedes/I-8397-2019; Martinez, Juan Gabriel/L-9471-2014; Exposito-Granados, Monica/K-1863-2019","Parejo, Deseada/0000-0002-7368-2378; Aviles, Jesus/0000-0002-1463-8393; Martinez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0001-5277-4620; Exposito-Granados, Monica/0000-0002-7996-2469; Molina Morales, Mercedes/0000-0001-8669-6624; Precioso, Marta/0000-0002-2030-5966","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Government of Extremadura [TA13002]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-051898]",This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDER (Projects CGL2011-27561/BOS and CGL2014-56769-P to D.P. and J.M.A.).

However, a problem arises for understanding coexistence of multiple species if they share critical resources too generally. Here, we employ an experimental framework grounded in nutritional physiology to show that closely related, cooccurring and generalist-feeding herbivores (seven grasshopper species in the genus Melanoplus; Orthoptera: Acrididae) eat protein and carbohydrate in different absolute amounts and ratios even if they eat the same plant taxa. The existence of species-specific nutritional niches provides a cryptic mechanism that helps explain how generalist herbivores with broadly overlapping diets might coexist. We also show that performance by grasshoppers allowed to mix their diets and thus regulate their protein-carbohydrate intake matched optimal performance peaks generated from nochoice treatments. These results indicate the active nature of diet selection to achieve balanced diets and provide buffering capacity in the face of variable food quality. Our empirical findings and experimental approach can be extended to generate and test predictions concerning the intensity of biotic interactions between species, the relative abundance of species, yearly fluctuations in population size, and the nature of interactions with natural enemies in tritrophic niche space.","[Behmer, Spencer T.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Joern, Anthony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Behmer, ST (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Heep Bldg,Room 509, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",s-behmer@tamu.edu,,"Behmer, Spencer/0000-0002-5038-1046",,,,52,161,169,1,104,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We investigated why surf-zone fishes, which are introduced to the island ponds during periodic wash-over events, are unable to persist for extended periods. We simulated over-wash events by collecting fishes from the shallow surf-zone and introducing them into 0.56 m(2) field enclosures. During summer months. surf-zone fishes typically died within 24 h. Levels of dissolved oxygen and temperature frequently exceeded the tolerance limits of the surf-zone fishes (demonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments), suggesting that these variables were responsible for fish mortality. In non-summer months, when dissolved oxygen and temperature stresses were ameliorated, surf-zone fishes could survive for months in the ponds. We conducted field-enclosure experiments at 3 fish densities in order to evaluate the survival and condition of a common surf-zone fish, Membras martinica (the rough silverside): (1) 8 M. martinica (14 fish m(-2)), (2) 16 M, martinica (28 fish m(-2)), and (3) 8 M. martinica + 8 Fundulus heteroclitus (28 fish m(-2)). After approximately 1 mo during the spring, fall and winter, survival and condition of fishes in Treatments 2 and 3 were significantly reduced, suggesting that biological interactions were an important cause of surf-zone fish mortality.

Simple quantitative models of predation suggest that plausible assumptions about prey densities, predator feeding rates, and duration of exposure of predator to prey can lead to very high estimates of predation mortality, in some instances approaching 100%. Indirect evidence from inter-Great Lake comparisons and inland lake examples also suggest that biotic factors may impede successful lake trout colonization. Our synthesis of the evidence leads to recommendations for research to better define field feeding rates of lake trout egg and fry predators and comparative studies of densities of potential egg and fry predators on lake trout spawning reefs. Management options should be designed to provide useful information as well as achieve short-term goals. From a management standpoint we recommend that: newly constructed lake trout reefs should be placed well away from concentrations of potential predators; offshore spawning reefs should be stocked; salmonine stocking, nutrient abatement, and commercial harvest of alewives should all be considered as options to enhance survival of young lake trout; hatchery lake trout should nor be stocked at sites where wild lake trout are showing signs of recovery; and exotic species expansions or introductions must be curtailed to maintain or improve on our recent successes in lake trout rehabilitation.","NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES SCI CTR,ANN ARBOR,MI 48105; ONTARIO MINIST NAT RESOURCES,MAPLE,ON L6A 1S9,CANADA; NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES SCI CTR,LAKE SUPERIOR BIOL STN,ASHLAND,WI 54806; LOYOLA UNIV,DEPT BIOL,CHICAGO,IL 60626; UNIV MICHIGAN,CTR GREAT LAKES & AQUAT SCI,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109; NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES CTR,LAKE ONTARIO BIOL STN,OSWEGO,NY 13126","Jones, ML (corresponding author), ONTARIO MINIST NAT RESOURCES,AQUAT ECOSYST RES,RURAL ROUTE 4,PICTON,ON K0K 2T0,CANADA.",,,"Hudson, Patrick/0000-0002-7646-443X",,,,80,45,46,1,27,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2200 BONISTEEL BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109-2099",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Lizards have much lower extinction rates than spiders, even for the same population sizes. Spiders naturally and experimentally become extinct more frequently in the presence than absence of lizards; islands with lizards have fewer spider species than no-lizard islands. The larger the island area, and (for no-lizard islands) the nearer to a potential source, the lower the extinction rate of spider species; both can be related to a tendency for smaller populations to become extinct more readily. Within particular spider species, population time series with higher variabilities in population size tend to have lower extinction rates. Mean population size of a series is positively correlated with temporal variability and negatively correlated with extinction rate; even when these correlations are taken into account in multiple regression, however, a negative relation of temporal variability and extinction rate often exists. A conceptual scheme including immigration and catastrophic mortality, in addition to normal stochastic birth and death rates, appears to accord at least qualitatively with these results. Insular spider populations in the Bahamas appear much closer to a BOORMAN-LEVITT metapopulation than to a LEVINS metapopulation, a similarity that seems to hold for organisms in general.

However, considering individual variation over short timescales can help us better understand the interaction between invaders and native species. We compared trophic traits of the non-native guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and the native Brazilian poeciliid Phalloceros harpagos using experiments simulating the early stages of an invasive process. We used short-term mesocosms to simulate an early invasion scenario, where the two species were placed together, and a pre-invasion scenario, where species were kept separated, and analyzed interspecific and intraspecific trophic variability. We also compared the foraging efficiency of species in laboratory experiments. We found no differences on the mean diet of both species between pre and early invasion treatments. At the individual level, in the early invasion scenario, individuals of both species reduced their trophic niche as a probable effect of the presence of the heterospecific. Phalloceros harpagos had higher consumption rates than guppies indicating greater efficiency in feeding on invertebrates. Our results suggest that non-native species were not intrinsically better consumers of high-quality resources. Instead, intraspecific variation might be playing an overlooked role in shaping interactions between species during the early stages of invasion.","[Amaral, Jeferson R.; Manna, Luisa R.; Mazzoni, Rosana; Neres-Lima, Vinicius; Marques, Piata S.; Zandona, Eugenia] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [El-Sabaawi, Rana W.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Cunningham Bldg 202, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada","Zandona, E (corresponding author), Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",eugenia.zandona@gmail.com,"Zandona, Eugenia/ABG-8207-2020; Neres-Lima, Vinicius/S-9152-2016","Zandona, Eugenia/0000-0003-4754-5326; Neres-Lima, Vinicius/0000-0003-3802-3438; Amaral, Jeferson Ribeiro/0000-0002-4454-1066","Prociencia UERJ [FAPERJ/CNE/E-26-202.762/2018, CNPq/Pq1D-301463/2017-4, FAPERJ JCNE E-26/203.213/2017, CNPq/Pq2-308261/2017-8]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [PrInt 88887.369182/2019-00, 001];  [FAPERJ E-26/202.782/2016];  [E-26/202.783/2016]","We thank field assistants from the Stream Ecology and Fish Ecology labs at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.

In 2014, recruitment of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was measured at high elevations in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the NW Atlantic coast in Nova Scotia, Canada. Values were considerably lower than previously reported for middle elevations in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the NE Atlantic and NE Pacific coasts. To determine if such differences in recruitment may have resulted from elevation influences, I did a field experiment in 2019 in wave-exposed intertidal habitats in Nova Scotia to test the hypothesis that recruitment is higher at middle than at high elevations, based on known environmental differences between both elevation zones. Based on data from 3 locations spanning 158 km of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, barnacle recruitment was, on average, nearly 200% higher (and recruits were larger) at middle than at high elevations. However, even with this increase, barnacle recruitment on this NW Atlantic coast is still lower than for comparable habitats on the NE Atlantic and NE Pacific coasts, and also lower than previously reported for wave-exposed locations farther south on the NW Atlantic coast, in Maine, USA. Therefore, barnacle recruitment in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia is moderate relative to other shores. This difference in the supply of barnacle recruits might influence the intensity of interspecific interactions involving barnacles.","[Scrosati, Ricardo A.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, RA (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",rscrosat@stfx.ca,"Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"I am grateful to Matthew J.

These species could serve as potential sentinels for the presence of xenobiotics in marine ecosystems. In this study, liver carboxylesterase (CbE) activity was determined for 20 species of chondrichthyans. Carboxylesterase activity, a known esterase involved in the metabolism of pesticides, lipids and certain drugs, was measured using two substrates: 4-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) and alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha NA). Rajiformes (rays and skates) showed higher CbE activity than sharks, and the order Chimaeriformes showed the lowest values. In vitro sensitivity to CbE inhibitors was assessed in the shark Scyliorhinus canicula. The substrate alpha NA was found to be the most adequate as it displayed the highest activity and was more sensitive to the organophosphate dichlorvos in the liver (IC50 = 2.37 mu M) and plasma (IC50 = 0.051 mu M). The high interspecific variation of CbE activity and its sensitivity to inhibition by fenofibrate suggest that this enzyme could contribute to species-specific differences in drug detoxification.","[Nos, David; Navarro, Joan; Barrie, Claudio; Sole, Montserrat] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Navarro, Joan] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Ave Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain","Nos, D (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",davidnosfrancisco@gmail.com,"Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Sole, Montserrat/C-7398-2013; Francisco, David Nos/AAA-3094-2019; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Barria, Claudio/J-8998-2017","Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Sole, Montserrat/0000-0002-9920-5051; Francisco, David Nos/0000-0002-9116-294X; Barria, Claudio/0000-0001-6769-4578","Andalucia Talent Hub Program (European Union's Seventh Framework Program); Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions; Andalusian Knowledge Agency, Spain) [291780]; CONICYT Becas ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness, Spain [CTM2011-26333]","We acknowledge Marta Coll and Raquel Saez for their help in the species collection and laboratory work.

Here, we compared seed dispersal fitness in two co-occurring plant species (Armeniaca sibirica and Amygdalus davidiana) that inhabit warm temperate deciduous forest in northern China. We tested the hypothesis that seed trait-mediated selection by rodents may influence mutualistic interactions with rodents and then seedling establishment of co-occurring plant species. A. davidiana seeds are larger and harder (thick endocarps) than A. sibirica seeds, but they have similar levels of nutrients (crude fat, crude protein), caloric value and tannin. More A. sibirica seedlings are found in the field. Semi-natural enclosure tests indicated that the two seed species were both harvested by the same six rodent species, but that A. sibirica had mutualistic interactions (scatter hoarding) with four rodent species (Apodemus peninsulae, A. agrarius, Sciurotamias davidianus, Tamias sibiricus), and A. davidiana with only one (S. davidianus). Tagged seed dispersal experiments in the field indicated that more A. sibirica seeds were scatter-hoarded by rodents, and more A. sibirica seeds survived to the next spring and became seedlings. A. sibirica seeds derive more benefit from seed dispersal by rodents than A. davidiana seeds, particularly in years with limited seed dispersers, which well explained the higher seedling recruitment of A. sibirica compared with that of A. davidiana under natural conditions. Our results suggest that seed dispersers may play a significant role in seedling recruitment and indirect competition between co-occurring plant species.","[Zhang, Hongmao] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Anim Behav Res Grp, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongmao; Yan, Chuan; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chang, Gang] Shaanxi Inst Zool, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Anim Behav Res Grp, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Zhang, HM; Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhanghm@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; yanc@ioz.ac.cn; snow1178@snnu.edu.cn; zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31372212, 31172102, 31330013]; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KJZD-EW-TZ-L01]","We thank Fusheng Wang, Wei Wang and Xianying Shang for assistance with seed collection and field studies.

Many examples of cannibalism have been reported in predacious phytoseiid mites. Furthermore, sib cannibalism avoidance is known in several species. However, whether females' actually prey upon their offspring under starved conditions has yet to be established. Here, female performance towards their offspring under no-prey-other-than-offspring, water-available and humidity-selectable conditions, was observed in four phytoseiid species, Amblyseius eharai, Amblyseius swirskii, Neoseiulus cucumeris and Typhlodromus bambusae. Typhlodromus bambusae females only survived for 4.14 +/- 0.42 days and there was a significant difference in survival duration between T. bambusae and the other three species (all survived more than 8 days). Neoseiulus cucumeris females survived longer than A. eharai and A. swirskii females, whereas there was no difference between A. eharai and A. swirskii females. On the other hand, the offspring (immature stages from egg to larva or protonymph) of A. eharai, A. swirskii and N. cucumeris died earlier in mother-presence than in mother-absence (egg alone) experiments, suggesting that cannibalistic interactions occur between mother and offspring. The survivorship of T. bambusae offspring in the mother-presence condition did not differ from the mother-absence condition, indicating that kin cannibalism is rare in this species. This must be related to the phenomenon that mothers tend to die before their offspring. The short longevity of T. bambusae mothers is one of the reasons why there is no significant difference in immature survival between the mother-presence and mother-absence experiments. Lastly, the reason(s) behind such variation in female phytoseiid performance towards their offspring is addressed in relation to the diet-specialization hypothesis.","[Zhang, Yanxuan; Ji, Jie; Lin, Jianzhen; Chen, Xia; Saito, Yutaka] Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Res Ctr Engn & Technol Nat Enemy Resource Crop Pe, Inst Plant Protect, Fuzhou 350013, Peoples R China","Saito, Y (corresponding author), Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Res Ctr Engn & Technol Nat Enemy Resource Crop Pe, Inst Plant Protect, Fuzhou 350013, Peoples R China.",yutsat@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,,,"Science and Technology Innovation Team of Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences [CXTD-2-13-13]; China Recruitment Program of Global Experts (Foreign Experts) [2012-323]; State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs Key Project for Introduction of Foreign Experts [SZ2013003]; Ministry of Science and Technology Fund for Transformation of Achievements [2009GB2C400173]; Ministry of Agriculture Special Fund for Scientific Research in the Public Interest [201103020]; 863 programNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2011AA10A201]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24570014, 23405005]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24570014] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank A.

Based on these predatory outcomes, the suitability of guilds in suppressing aphid pests is determined. The present study assesses the efficacy of 11 guilds, formed from both larval and adult stages of four locally abundant aphidophagous coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), while exploiting the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The observed antagonistic effects within these guilds are resultants of enhanced predator-predator interactions due to the size and diversity of guild predators. Smaller ladybird predators maintained their usual body mass, probably by increasing their conversion efficiencies to compensate for their reduced prey consumption. However, larger ladybirds reported loss in their body mass, owing to their higher energy needs. The overall guild conversion efficiencies and growth rates were reduced. Among the experimental guilds, the observed prey mortalities were relatively higher in two-predator guilds, and within these two-predator combinations, the higher prey mortalities were recorded in those guilds where Coccinella septempunctata was one of the predators.","[Omkar; Mishra, Geetanjali; Kumar, Bhupendra; Singh, Neha; Pandey, Garima] Univ Lucknow, Dept Zool, Ctr Excellence Biocontrol Insect Pests, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India","Omkar (corresponding author), Univ Lucknow, Dept Zool, Ctr Excellence Biocontrol Insect Pests, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India.",omkaar55@hotmail.com,"Mishra, Geetanjali/X-7796-2019; Kumar, Bhupendra/AAR-9719-2020","Mishra, Geetanjali/0000-0001-8976-4602; Kumar, Bhupendra/0000-0002-7602-9681","Government of Uttar Pradesh, India","The authors are thankful to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, India for providing funds in the form of Centre of Excellence in Biocontrol of Insect Pests and also to Head, Department of Zoology, University of Lucknow for laboratory facilities and encouragements.",,73,8,12,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0008-347X,1918-3240,,CAN ENTOMOL,Can.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Within the context of trophic cascades, various treatments using in situ mesocosms were established in a closed estuary to highlight the importance of predation in stabilizing estuarine plankton abundances. Through either the removal (filtration) or addition of certain planktonic groups, five different trophic systems were established. These treatments contained varied numbers of trophic levels and thus different predators at the top of the food chain. The abundances of zooplankton (copepod and polychaete), ciliate, micro-flagellate, nano-flagellate and bacteria were investigated in each treatment, over time. The reference treatment containing apex zooplanktivores (early juvenile mullet) and plankton at natural densities mimicked a natural, stable state of an estuary. Proportional variability (PV) and coefficient of variation (CV) of temporal abundances were calculated for each taxon and showed that apex predators in this experimental ecosystem, when compared to the other systems, induced stability. The presence of these predators therefore had consequences for multiple trophic levels, consistent with trophic cascade theory. Conclusions/Significance: PV and CV proved useful indices for comparing stability. Apex predators exerted a stabilizing pressure through feeding on copepods and polychaetes which cascaded through the ciliates, micro-flagellates, nano-flagellates and bacteria. When compared with treatments without apex predators, the role of predation in structuring planktonic communities in closed estuaries was highlighted.","[Wasserman, Ryan J.; Noyon, Margaux; Froneman, P.

Amphibians often use ephemeral ponds and have been shown to experience priority effects from interspecific competition. Pesticide exposure can impact amphibian species interactions like competition, and has been linked to declines. We investigated whether insecticide exposure interacted with colonization history to impact priority effects in Bufo americanus and Rana pipiens. We predicted that exposure to the insecticide carbaryl and colonization history would affect tadpole metamorphosis independently and interactively. Our results indicated that Bufo time to metamorphosis experienced priority effects: Bufo introduced early reached metamorphosis sooner when Rana were absent, but Bufo introduced late reached metamorphosis sooner when Rana were also late. Insecticide exposure eliminated differences in Bufo time to metamorphosis due to Rana colonization history. Rana survival and mass at metamorphosis were affected by intraspecific colonization history. Bufo had significantly fewer survivors and Rana had more survivors in insecticide-exposed treatments. Bufo did better when reared without Rana, but Rana was unaffected by Bufo presence. The effects on anuran metamorphosis occurred without any effects on periphyton abundance. We suggest that the effects of insecticide exposure on amphibian metamorphosis are not related to colonization history, although each factor alone can have substantial impacts. These results preliminarily suggest that managing pesticide applications with sensitivity to amphibians may be less complex than implied by traditional food web theory, although more research is needed.","[Distel, Christopher A.] Schreiner Univ, Dept Biol, Kerrville, TX 78028 USA; [Distel, Christopher A.; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Distel, CA (corresponding author), Schreiner Univ, Dept Biol, 2100 Mem Blvd, Kerrville, TX 78028 USA.",cadistel@schreiner.edu,,,U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0717088]; Miami University,"We wish to thank Nick Webber, Sarah Distel, Jennifer Purrenhage, Holly Puglis, Tamara McPeek, Mark Mackey, and Rodney Kolb for their valuable help on the execution of this project.

Sustainable strategies to manage grasshopper populations through habitat management require knowledge of the forces that regulate grasshopper populations. This experiment was undertaken to determine whether populations of Melanoplus borealis (Fieber), a common pest species in Alaska, are food-limited in Alaska. Cages were set up in a fallow field near Delta Junction, AK, in 3 yr (2007-2009). In 2007 and 2008, fertilizer was added to half the plots to increase primary production, and, in all years, cages within each plot were stocked with 0, 5, 9, or 13 fourth-instar M. borealis ( equivalent to 0, 20, 36, or 52 grasshoppers/m(2)). Grasshoppers in each cage were counted weekly. Near the end of the growing season, surviving female grasshoppers (approximate to 40% of the original number) were collected. Femur length was taken as a measure of adult size, and functional ovarioles were counted as a measure of current fecundity. If the grasshoppers were food limited, we expected to see significant effects of either density or fertilizer on grasshopper survival, size, or fecundity. The fertilizer treatment greatly increased primary production in both years. Neither fertilizer treatment nor grasshopper density had consistent effects on survival, size, or potential fecundity, leading us to conclude that food is seldom limiting to populations in the interior of Alaska at densities <50 m(-2).","[Fielding, Dennis J.] USDA ARS, Subarctic Agr Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zhang, Mingchu] Univ Alaska, Sch Nat Resources & Agr Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA","Fielding, DJ (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Subarctic Agr Res Unit, POB 757200, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",dennis.felding@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,42,11,11,0,7,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

However, quantifying habitat quality is problematic because it may comprise of abiotic components at different spatial scales and also be influenced by biotic processes. This study investigated the relationship between reef-associated Caribbean fishes and habitat quality at 2 spatial scales: (1) multiple characteristics of Montastraea annularis coral colonies (<1 m(2)) and (2) coral density in a 5 x 5 m plot around each microhabitat. Furthermore, the influence on habitat quality of 2 biotic factors (predation pressure and interactions between competitively superior territorial damselfishes and other species) was considered. A total of 102 M. annularis colonies within thirty 25 m(2) plots were surveyed on a Belizean forereef. Generalised linear mixed-effect models demonstrated that both damselfishes and other reef associated species were correlated with colony-scale habitat quality (more abundant on taller, refuge-rich colonies). Adult reef-associated species were also correlated with larger-scale habitat quality, being more abundant on colonies with high densities of other Montastraea colonies within 25 m(2) (probably higher quality home ranges). However, the presence of damselfishes was associated with reduced abundances of other reef-associated species on M. annularis colonies, reflecting the importance of both biotic and abiotic controls of habitat quality. On reefs, coral mortality will reduce the density of optimal colonies and potentially increase the proportion occupied by damselfishes. This may lead to smaller populations of inferior competitors as they are increasingly displaced onto sub-optimal microhabitats.","[Harborne, Alastair R.; Kennedy, Emma V.] Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Harborne, Alastair R.; Mumby, Peter J.; Ferrari, Renata] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Harborne, AR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Lab, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",a.r.harborne@ex.ac.uk,"Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Harborne, Alastair R/F-6155-2013; Ferrari, Renata/E-3109-2016; Kennedy, Emma V/M-3193-2014","Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; Harborne, Alastair R/0000-0002-6818-8615; Ferrari, Renata/0000-0002-5056-1178; Kennedy, Emma V/0000-0003-1821-9740",Global Environment Facility; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/F015704/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G017344/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This study was funded by the Global Environment Facility's Coral Reef Targeted Research, awarded to P.J.M.

We hypothesized that the willow's response following herbivory affects the entire arthropod community structure on the tree due to changes in plant quality. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated arthropod communities on three willow species, Salix gilgiana, Salix eriocarpa and Salix serissaefolia. In our common garden, cuttings were established in 2003 and experimental treatments were applied in 2005. Damage by a boring caterpillar of a swift moth (Endoclita excrescens) and artificial cutting of 25% stems were applied as partial herbivory within individual trees, and 100% cutting of stems was applied to represent severe herbivory to whole individual trees. These treatments stimulated lateral shoot production depending on damage intensity, resulting in full compensation for biomass loss. Positive relationships were detected between within-tree variation in foliar nitrogen content and overall abundance/species richness of herbivores. Moth boring and 25% cutting increased herbivore abundance and species richness relative to controls. However, we found no significant differences in herbivore abundance and species richness between 100% cut and control trees. Community composition of herbivore species was significantly different between the following three groups: (i) bored and 25% cut; (ii) 100% cut; and (iii) control trees. Changes in community structure of herbivores were likely due to changes in plant quality depending on the intensity of damage. Although total predator abundance and species richness were not significantly different among treatments, community composition of predator species was significantly different among treatments. These results indicate that herbivore-induced willow responses can largely determine the entire arthropod community structure of multitrophic levels due to changes in plant quality. We suggest that heterogeneous resource conditions induced by herbivory within and among plant individuals increase the species diversity of arthropods.","[Utsumi, Shunsuke; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nakamura, Masahiro] Hokkaido Univ, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan","Utsumi, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",shun@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","COEMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","The authors thank A.A.

Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.","[Wyshynski, Sarah A.; Nudds, Thomas D.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Nudds, TD (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",tnudds@uoguelph.ca,,,Network of Centres of Excellence; The Canadian Forest Service and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources,"We thank Ian Thompson, James Baker, and John Fryxell for inviting our collaboration with the Marten Project in Ear Falls.

Grasshopper populations respond to interacting extrinsic and intrinsic factors, with yearly and decadal weather patterns and the timing of precipitation all potentially important. The effects of initial and increasing grasshopper densities on grasshopper survival and reproductive correlates were examined at a northern mixed-grass prairie site through manipulations of grasshopper densities inside 10-m(2) cages. High-quality grass growth occurred after a 9.1-cm mid-August rain. Reduced proportional survival was apparent in the two higher density treatments before the rain, indicative of food-limited density-dependent mortality. However, the large late summer rainfall event mediated the effects of exploitative competition on demographic characteristics because of the high-quality vegetation growth. This led to weaker effects of food limitation on survival and reproduction at the end of the experiment. The results indicate a direct link between weather variation, resource quality and grasshopper population dynamics led to a severe grasshopper outbreak and show that infrequent large precipitation events can have significant effects on population dynamics. Additional research is needed to examine the importance of infrequent large precipitation events on grasshopper population dynamics in grassland ecosystems.","USDA ARS, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Branson, DH (corresponding author), USDA ARS, No Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",dave.branson@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,63,35,42,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Accordingly, changes in potential feeding time may predict the direction and magnitude of differences between elevations in individual growth rates of sessile marine invertebrates. Oysters (triploid Crassostrea ariakensis) experimentally introduced at intertidal (MLW+0.05 m) and subtidal (MLW-0.25 m) elevations in racks provided a test of the ability to use duration of water coverage to predict changes in growth. During early-to-mid winter, a depression of 38-47% in shell growth of intertidal oysters matched the 36% reduction in available feeding time relative to subtidal oysters. In late winter as solar heating of exposed oysters increased, growth differences of 52-55% departed only slightly from the predicted 39%. In spring, however, duration of water coverage failed to predict even the correct direction of growth change with elevation as intertidal oysters grew 34% faster despite 39% less feeding time. Intense seasonal development of shell fouling by other suspension feeders like ascidians, mussels, and barnacles on subtidal (94% incidence) but not on aerially exposed intertidal (21-38% incidence) oysters may explain why duration of water cover failed to predict spring growth differences. Less intense fouling develops on intertidal oysters due to the physiological stress of aerial exposure on settlers, especially during higher temperatures and longer solar exposures of spring. Fouling by suspension feeders is known to reduce growth of the host through localized competition for food and added energetic costs. Thus, in springtime, indirect effects of aerial exposure providing a partial refuge from biological enemies overwhelmed direct effects of reduced duration of water coverage to reverse the expected pattern of slower intertidal growth of a marine invertebrate.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Bishop, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Gore Hill, NSW 2065, Australia.",Melanie.Bishop-1@uts.edu.au,,"Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500",,,,34,30,31,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2006,147,3,,,,,426,433,,10.1007/s00442-005-0273-3,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,017PT,WOS:000235706200005,16249896,,,,2021-09-24,

On the southern shore of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, the polychaetes Nereis virens (Nereidae) and Nephtys caeca (Nephtyidae) represent the main infaunal predators and are known to regulate (by predation) other populations within their community. For these animal populations, there is a high degree of spatial overlap in the horizontal dimension as well as vertically in the sediment column. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the feeding activity of N. virens and N. caeca in relation to several environmental factors. The feeding activity of N. caeca was further studied under natural and experimental conditions and a feeding experiment was carried out to evaluate how the food resource is subdivided in conditions of high spatial overlap. Finally, the prospecting activity of N. virens was described under natural conditions. N. virens and N. caeca exhibited a high degree of dietary overlap, particularly at the adult stage. This food resource overlap can easily influence the regulation of these species, even though they display different feeding responses to environmental stimuli. Tides and storm events can also influence the feeding behaviour. We conclude that different behavioural feeding responses likely favour the occurrence of these two species in the same trophic environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Shallow rock pools can dry out and be refilled repeatedly during a summer causing high mortality of immatures. In deeper pools, young nymphs face intense competition by older stages including cannibalism. The adult corixids move frequently between rock pools and are thus able to use currently available habitat for reproduction. In this dispersal behaviour, the ability to assess the local population density and hence select the more suitable low density patches would be advantageous. We studied the effect of local population density on the frequency of dispersive flights of Arctocorisa carinata (Sahlberg) and Callicorixa producta (Reuter) experimentally, using rock pools from which nymphs of both species were removed. The dispersal rates of marked C. producta adults were significantly lower from experimental rock pools than from normal density controls, leading to a concentration of C. producta adults in the experimental rock pools. Indications of immigration rate differences between the experimental and control pools were also observed. No clear differences were found in the superior competitor A. carinata.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Div Populat Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Anim Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Pajunen, VI (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Div Populat Biol, POB 65 Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,,,,,17,12,12,0,16,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR,2003,495,1-3,,,,,73,78,,10.1023/A:1025459905211,,,6,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,715TX,WOS:000184989300007,,,,,2021-09-24,
