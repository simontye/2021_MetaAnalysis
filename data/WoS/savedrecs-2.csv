We studied the influence of the shrubs Buxus sempervirens and Juniperus communis on Q. humilis establishment, and of Buxus on the growth of established Q. humilis individuals. 2 Percentage germination of experimentally planted Q. humilis was higher under shrubs than in nearby open areas and higher on the north than the south side of the canopy. Germination where part of the canopy has been removed was similar to that away from the shrubs, suggesting that the facilitation mechanism is related to changes in microclimate rather than to a soil effect. 3 When exposed to sheep for 1 month, 100% of 326 unprotected oak seedlings were grazed, causing 44% mortality. The presence of Buxus and Juniperus improved seedling survival by protecting them against sheep grazing and summer drought. Predation by rodents was however greater under shrub cover. 4 The highest leaf dry mass of oak seedlings was recorded under Juniperus where light conditions seem more favourable for growth than under Buxus (direct effect) or in grassland (indirect effect). The growth of naturally established individuals of Q. humilis (in terms of total leaf mass per annual branch and width of rings) was lower under Buxus than in grassland but the values became similar once the canopy was overtopped. 5 The balance between positive and negative interactions varied in relation to the life stage of Q. humilis and the two shrub species. Regeneration of Q. humilis in open grassland was prevented by grazing. The protection offered by shrubs continues to offset the negative interference on growth, particularly under Buxus, so that plants could survive to overtop the shrub canopy and reach maturity. The succession pathway therefore depends closely on the distribution of shrubs in the grassland.","Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UPR 9056, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Lepart, J (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UPR 9056, 1919 Route de Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,50,165,182,3,54,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Body reserves of Willow Tits as subordinate flock members were found to be dependent on the presence of dominant Crested Tits. At dusk, Willow Tits were heavier than Crested Tits. Body reserves of members of mixed-species flocks negatively correlated with dominance rank within both intraspecific and interspecific hierarchies. Removal experiments confirmed results of field observations, revealing a causal relationship between rank and ability to choose the safest fattening strategy. Body mass and fat reserves of Willow Tit alpha males decreased in the absence of Crested Tits. In contrast, body mass and fatness of dominant individuals of Crested Tits remained at the same level. To control for changes in body mass resulting from a higher rank and smaller flocks, the foraging height of remaining individuals of both species was recorded. Willow Tits responded to removal of Costed Tits by foraging closer to the top of the tree. No shifts were observed in groups with only Crested Tits. Fattening strategies dependent on social status represent a flocking cost to individuals belonging to a subordinate species. Further investigations should be done into the benefits of mixed-species flocking, which is a social behaviour common in parids.","Daugavpils Pedagog Univ, Dept Sci, LV-5407 Daugavpils, Latvia","Krams, I (corresponding author), Daugavpils Pedagog Univ, Dept Sci, LV-5407 Daugavpils, Latvia.",root@maknia.latg.lv,"Krams, Indrikis/B-5788-2017","Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108",,,,45,26,26,1,9,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,1998,75,1,,,,,19,26,,,,,8,Ornithology,Zoology,ZH886,WOS:000073157300002,,,,,2021-09-24,

The prevalence of models lacking any trait dynamics has led to methods of identifying and measuring indirect effects that are not valid when phenotypically or evolutionarily plastic traits affect interspecific interactions. When traits are dynamic, the number of links in a dynamic model can no longer be used to distinguish direct and indirect effects, and classifying interactions by a single sign denoting effect on equilibrium density becomes problematic. The presence of trait dynamics also changes the interpretation of manipulative experiments that have been used to measure indirect effects. Because both traits and population densities can transmit indirect effects, a given ordered series of species will often transmit several indirect effects, which may have opposite signs. Because some traits can change very rapidly, dynamic equations describing population growth rates may often include the densities of species that interact indirectly with the given species. Some of the conceptual problems in comparing magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are illustrated by simple models of a three-species food chain. Different methods of measuring effect magnitudes can give different conditions for when direct effects are larger than indirect effects. Other terminology related to indirect effects, including interaction modification and higher-order interaction, is critically discussed. Given the present paucity of information about trait dynamics, it may be premature to attempt to compare magnitudes of direct and indirect effects.",,"ABRAMS, PA (corresponding author), UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, 1987 UPPER BUFORD CIRCLE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X; ",,,,64,349,361,4,117,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

All the potentially limiting resources (seasonal time, diel time, habitat and food) are analyzed as single niche dimensions, and then the real multidimensional niche is calculated. Resource states are objectively defined, using an algorithm that groups the significant resource categories. The larvae were segregated by prey, season, habitat, and water depth, in order of decreasing importance; their overlap was very low when their complete multidimensional niche was considered, and therefore they have few opportunities for present-day competition. The adults were largely segregated by season and water depth, and to a lesser degree by habitat and prey; their multidimensional niches overlapped to a certain degree, thus leaving conditions for ongoing competition. Considering all the species and the life stages together, the order of importance for segregation was season, prey, habitat, water depth and diel activity, with a low overlap in the complete niche. Differences in prey size were probably due to morphological constraints; differences in diel activity had very little effect on segregation, except in separating larvae from the adults, and were likely promoted by need to avoid mutual predation and cannibalism. It remains to be tested whether seasonal, habitat, and water depth differences are due to competitive pressures or to ecophysiological constraints.","DIPARTIMENTO BIOL ANIM, PIAZZA BOTTA 9, I-27100 PAVIA, ITALY",,,,"FASOLA, MAURO/0000-0002-7366-5893",,,,34,33,33,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,JAN-MAR,1993,16,1,,,,,73,81,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1993.tb00060.x,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KP391,WOS:A1993KP39100009,,,,,2021-09-24,

Three levels of pH (4.3, 4.6, or 6.0) and three levels of density (0, 30 or 60 embryos) were arranged in a blocked design and replicated three times for Hyla gratiosa. At the end of this experiment the effects of pH (4.3, 4.6, or 6.0), density of H. femoralis (30 or 60), and prior use by H. gratiosa (at 0, 30, or 60 larvae per tank) on the survival and growth of H. femoralis, were examined. Higher density increased larval period and decreased size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa. Lower pH decreased survival rate and also decreased size at metamorphosis. Body sodium concentrations were lowest at the low pH values. Lower pH increased the susceptibility of H. gratiosa tadpoles to the adverse effects of higher densities. For H. femoralis higher density decreased survival, increased larval period and decreased size at metamorphosis. Hyla femoralis also had lower survivorship at low pH and exhibited decreased size at metamorphosis. However, unlike the results with Hyla gratiosa, there were no interactive effects between pH and density for any of the life-history traits studied. The effect of previous colonization by H. gratiosa on H. femoralis survival was facilitative. Body sodium concentrations of H. femoralis were lowest at the highest pH value. Metamorphs of the same size had much lower levels of sodium in H. femoralis than H. gratiosa. In general, H. femoralis was less affected by pH variation than H. gratiosa. These results demonstrate that abiotic factors can interact strongly with biotic effects such as density and they suggest that interspecific interactions can be strongly modulated by the background abiotic environment.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32306","WARNER, SC (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,MUELLER LAB 208,UNIV PK,PA 16802, USA.",,,,,,,45,51,54,0,25,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,88,3,,,,,331,339,,10.1007/BF00317575,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GP207,WOS:A1991GP20700005,28313793,,,,2021-09-24,

Associational effects (AE) can transpire through changes in herbivore or plant traits that affect herbivore movement, densities, and feeding behaviors to ultimately affect plant damage. While much work has focused on understanding the mechanisms that underlie associational effects, we know little about how these mechanisms are influenced by neighborhood composition, i.e., plant density or relative frequency which is necessary to make predictions about when AE should occur in nature. Using a series of field and greenhouse experiments, I examined how plant density and relative frequency affected plant damage to Solanum carolinense and four mechanisms that underlie AE; (i) accumulation of insect herbivores and arthropod predators, (ii) microclimate conditions, (iii) plant resistance, and (iv) specialist herbivore preference. I found a positive relationship between S. carolinense damage and the relative frequency of a non-focal neighbor (Solidago altissima) and all four AE mechanisms were influenced by one or multiple neighborhood components. Frequency-dependence in S. carolinense damage is most likely due to greater generalist herbivore load on S. carolinense (through spillover from S. altissima) with microclimate variables, herbivore preference, predation pressures, and plant resistance having relatively weaker effects. Associational effects may have long-term consequences for these two plant species during plant succession and understanding context-dependent herbivory has insect pest management implication for other plant species in agriculture and forestry.","[Kim, Tania N.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kim, Tania N.] Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kim, TN (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Kim, TN (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",tania.kim@wisc.edu,,,National Science Foundation Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1110460],"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology #1110460.

Amblyseius largoensis is considered a generalist due to its ability to feed on multiple food sources (e.g. phytophagous mites, small insects, plant exudates, nectar, and pollen). Specimens of A. largoensis sometimes attack each other in competitive situations. Thus, we hypothesized that intraspecific interactions, such as cannibalism, may occur when heterospecific prey are scarce. Experiments were conducted to determine whether, and to what extent, the availability of heterospecific prey, eggs of R. indica, influenced the tendencies of A. largoensis to cannibalise. Additionally, the oviposition of A. largoensis was measured in the presence and absence of both conspecific nymphs and R. indica eggs. Overall, in the absence of the heterospecific prey, A. largoensis consumed conspecific nymphs, and few eggs were produced, whereas in the presence of abundant herbivorous prey, cannibalism decreased, and oviposition increased. These results suggest that, similar to other phytoseiid mites, A. largoensis employs cannibalism as an adaptive survival strategy when heterospecific prey is absent or scarce.","[Mendes, Jairo A.; Barros, Maria E.

For wetland-dependent amphibians, forested buffers may mitigate timber-harvest impacts, but little empirical research has focused on buffers around lentic habitats. We conducted a landscape experiment to examine how spotted salamander and wood frog reproductive output (i.e., eggmass and metamorph production) respond to clearcutting mediated by buffers of different widths (i.e., uncut, 30 m buffer, 100 m buffer) at ephemeral pools in an industrial forest. We found complex interactions between buffer treatment and reproductive output, which were strongly mediated by hydroperiod. Overall, reproductive output was most sensitive at 30 m-buffer pools and for salamanders, but responses diverged across productivity metrics even within these categories. Notably, for both cut treatments over time, while salamander eggmass abundance decreased, metamorph productivity (i.e., snout-vent length [SVL] and abundance) tended to increase. For example, average metamorph SVLs were predicted to lengthen between 0.2 and 0.4 mm per year post-cut. Additionally, typical relationships between reproductive output and hydroperiod (as indicated by the reference treatment) were disrupted for both species in both cut treatments. For example, long-hydroperiod pools produced more salamander metamorphs than short-hydroperiod pools in both the reference and 30 m-buffer treatments, but the rate of increase was lower in the 30 m-buffer treatment such that a long-hydroperiod pool in the reference treatment was predicted to produce, on average, 24 more metamorphs than a similar pool in the 30 m-buffer treatment. From a conservation perspective, our results highlight the importance of evaluating both terrestrial and aquatic responses to terrestrial habitat disturbance, since responses may be reinforcing (i.e., exert similarly positive or negative effects, with the potential for amplification in the aquatic habitat) or decoupled (i.e., operate independently or be negatively correlated, with responses in the aquatic habitat potentially dampening or counteracting responses in the terrestrial habitat).","[Powell, Jessica S.

However, it remains generally unclear whether the production and exchange of metabolites incurs fitness costs to the producing cells and if so, which ecological mechanisms can facilitate a cooperative exchange of metabolites among unrelated individuals. We hypothesized that positive assortment within structured environments can maintain mutualistic cross-feeding. To test this, we engineered Acinetobacter baylyi and Escherichia coli to reciprocally exchange essential amino acids. Interspecific coculture experiments confirmed that non-cooperating types were selectively favoured in spatially unstructured (liquid culture), yet disfavoured in spatially structured environments (agar plates). Both an individual-based model and experiments with engineered genotypes indicated that a segregation of cross-feeders and non-cooperating auxotrophs stabilized cooperative cross-feeding in spatially structured environments. Chemical imaging confirmed that auxotrophs were spatially excluded from cooperative benefits.

Effects of neighbors on consumer-resource interactions (associational effects) occur in many systems, including plant-herbivore interactions, predator-prey interactions (mimicry), and plant-pollinator interactions. Unfortunately, we know little about how ecologically or evolutionarily important these effects are because we lack appropriate models and data to determine how neighbor effects on individuals contribute to net interactions at population and community levels. Here we supply a general definition of associational effects, review relevant theory, and suggest strategies for future theoretical and empirical work. We find that mathematical models from a variety of fields suggest that individual-level associational effects will influence population and community dynamics when associational effects create local frequency dependence. However, there is little data on how local frequency dependence in associational effects is generated, or on the form or spatial scale of that frequency dependence. Similarly, existing theory lacks consideration of nonlinear and spatially explicit frequency dependence. We outline an experimental approach for producing data that can be related to models to advance our understanding of how associational effects contribute to population and community processes.","[Underwood, Nora; Inouye, Brian D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Hamback, Peter A.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Underwood, N (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",nunderwood@bio.fsu.edu; binouye@bio.fsu.edu; peter.hamback@su.se,"Hamback, Peter A/A-8194-2008","Hamback, Peter A/0000-0001-6362-6199",Fulbright Foundation; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [621-2009-4943]; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0717221],"We thank Stockholm University and Florida State University for facilitating the discussions that led to this paper.

Young green crabs (25-35 mm carapace width), rock crabs (25-35 mm carapace width) and American lobsters (25-35 mm carapace length) were collected along with the prey species blue mussels (Mytilus sp.), rock barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides) and common southern kelp (Saccharina latissima) from the rocky intertidal of the southern section of Saco Bay in the Gulf of Maine. Claw measurements were taken, prey size and prey species preference was tested and caloric value of prey was determined. Morphological measurements indicated that all three decapod species had different sized chela relative to body size. In the laboratory, the three predators preferred similar sized mussels and barnacles, and had similar handling times for both of these prey species. None of the three predator species consumed measurable amounts of kelp. Rock crabs and lobsters preferentially selected mussels over barnacles, while green crabs consumed equal amounts of both prey species. The preferred mussel size was smaller than the calculated optimum while the optimal barnacle size was eaten. These results suggest that while green crabs, rock crabs and lobsters have differing claw morphologies, they select similar prey and consume prey at the same rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum Olive, which is specialised to the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima L., in its native range, has become a dominant species on the introduced tall goldenrod in Japan. How this exotic aphid influenced arthropod communities on the introduced tall goldenrod in aphid-present (spring) and aphid-absent (autumn) seasons was examined, using an aphid removal experiment. 2. In spring, aphid presence increased ant abundance because aphid honeydew attracted foraging ant workers. A significant negative correlation was found between the numbers of ants and herbivorous insects other than aphids on the aphid-exposed plants, but no significant correlation was detected on the aphid-free plants. Thus, the aphid presence was likely to decrease the abundance of co-occurring herbivorous insects through removal behaviour of the aphid-tending ants. There were no significant differences in plant traits between the aphid-exposed and aphid-free plants. 3. In autumn, the numbers of lateral shoots and leaves, and the leaf nitrogen content were increased in response to the aphid infestation in spring. Because of the improvement of plant traits by aphid feeding, the abundance of leaf chewers increased on aphid-exposed plants. In contrast, the abundance of sap feeders decreased on the aphid-exposed plants. In particular, the dominant scale insect among sap feeders, Parasaissetia nigra Nietner, decreased, followed by a decrease in the abundance of ants attending P. nigra. Thus, aphid feeding may have attenuated the negative impacts of the tending ants on leaf chewers. 4. Aphid presence did not change herbivore species richness but changed the relative density of dominant herbivores, resulting in community-wide effects on co-occurring herbivores through ant-mediated indirect effects, and on temporally separated herbivores through plant-and ant-mediated indirect effects. The aphid also altered predator community composition by increasing and decreasing the relative abundance of aphid-tending ants in the spring and autumn, respectively.","[Ando, Yoshino; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Utsumi, Shunsuke] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan","Ando, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome,Hiranocho, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",ando@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Frankel, Victor/F-7943-2011","Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A-15207003, B-20370010];  [A14];  [A06]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [10J09260] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank T.

Stranded macroalgae exported from adjacent coastal ecosystems supports abundant intertidal consumers on oceanic sandy beaches, including talitrid amphipods, which can be one of the numerically dominant invertebrates of the upper shore. The allochthonous nature of this donor-controlled food subsidy and its unpredictable delivery by waves and currents, results in highly variable and potentially limiting resource availability for these consumers. In Chile, adults of the talitrid amphipod, Orchestoidea tuberculata Nicolet, can influence the survival of juvenile conspecifics through cannibalism, a type of intraspecific interaction we hypothesized could be affected by the availability of macroalgal resources. We experimentally investigated the potential influence of food availability on cannibalism between age classes in O. tuberculata in laboratory mesocosms. Juvenile mortality in presence of conspecific adults was significantly higher when juveniles and adults were maintained without food. However, adult mortality was neither density dependent or food dependent. Further, juveniles did not influence adult mortality, either with or without food. The strong effect of food limitation on juvenile mortality from cannibalism by adults of O. tuberculata found here, supports our hypothesis that food resource availability on beaches can affect this intraspecific interactions. In addition these results provide evidence of the potential importance of biological interaction in the population dynamics of intertidal consumers on oceanic sandy beaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Intra-specific variation in plant defence traits has been shown to profoundly affect herbivore community structure. Here we describe two experiments designed to test whether similar effects occur at higher trophic levels, by studying pea aphid-natural enemy interactions in a disused pasture in southern England. 2. In the first experiment, the numbers and identity of natural enemies attacking different monoclonal pea aphid colonies were recorded in a series of assays throughout the period of pea aphid activity. 3. In the summer assay, there was a significant effect of clone on the numbers of aphidophagous hoverfly larvae and the total number of non-hoverfly natural enemies recruited. Clone also appeared to influence the attack rate suffered by the primary predator in the system, the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, by Diplazon laetatorius, an ichneumonid parasitoid. Colonies were generally driven to extinction by hoverfly attack, resulting in the recording of low numbers of parasitoids and entomopathogens, suggesting intense intra-guild predation. 4. To further examine the influence of clonal variation on the recruitment of natural enemies, a second experiment was performed to monitor the temporal dynamics of community development. Colonies were destructively sampled every other day and the numbers of natural enemies attacking aphid colonies were recorded. These data demonstrated that clonal variation influenced the timing, abundance, and identity of natural enemies attacking aphid colonies. 5. Taken together, these data suggest that clonal variation may have a significant influence on the patterns of interactions between aphids and their natural enemies, and that such effects are likely to affect our understanding of the ecology and biological control of these insect herbivores.","[Hazell, Steaphan P.; Fellowes, Mark D.

We assembled all possible food webs including one or more of the ciliate species and cross-classified them with four levels of enrichment of the bacterial medium. The qualitative outcome of food web interactions was independent of enrichment and always the same: Tetrahjrmena strongly depressed or excluded Colpidium, and Blepharisma strongly depressed or excluded both bacterivores. Consequently, in all sub-webs only the dominant ciliate species responded positively to enrichment. The total density of bacteria increased with enrichment irrespective of food web composition. In contrast, the response of singlecelled bacteria to enrichment depended on food web composition and was only weakly positive in most food webs with the omnivore. Enrichment had a positive effect on the relative success of (presumably more defended) bacterial aggregates. The outcome of interspecific interactions among ciliates could not be predicted from monoculture experiments and deviated from earlier experiments in which each bacterivore coexisted separately with the omnivore. As a potential explanation we suggest that changes in experimental protocol reduced spatial heterogeneity and increased attack rates. A simple, dynamical model shows that increased attack rates can indeed greatly decrease the upper limit and range of enrichment over which intermediate consumers can coexist with omnivores.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Limnol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Munich, Dept Biol 2, DE-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Liess, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Limnol, Norbyvagen 20, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",antonia.liess@ebc.uu.se,"Liess, Antonia/H-6789-2016; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Liess, Antonia/0000-0003-1556-3861; Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,53,15,15,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2006,114,1,,,,,15,26,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14516.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,070YP,WOS:000239563300003,,,,,2021-09-24,

The gradient in pond canopy cover strongly influences freshwater species distributions. This study tested the effects of canopy cover on the performance of two species of larval anurans, a canopy cover generalist (Rana sylvatica, the wood frog) and an open-canopy specialist (R. pipiens, the leopard frog), and tested which factors co-varying with canopy cover mediate these effects. 2. A field transplant experiment demonstrated that canopy cover had negative performance effects on both species. However, leopard frogs, which grow faster than wood frogs in open-canopy ponds, were more strongly affected by closed-canopy pond conditions. 3. Closed-canopy ponds had lower temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and food nutritional quality as indicated by carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C : N) analysis of field-sampled food types, and of gut contents of transplanted larvae. 4. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that higher temperature and food quality but not DO substantially increased larval growth. However, only food quality increased growth rates of leopard frogs more than wood frogs. 5. The strong correlation of growth rates to gut content C : N in the field, and the similarity of growth curves as a function of resource quality in the field and laboratory, strongly suggest that resources are of primary importance in mediating intraspecific, and especially interspecific differences in performance across the canopy cover gradient.","Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Schiesari, L (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Arts Sci & Humanities, EACH, Av Arlindo Betio 1000,Parque Ecol Tiete, BR-03828080 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lschiesa@usp.br,"Schiesari, Luis C/E-8624-2012","Schiesari, Luis C/0000-0003-0814-591X",,,,30,89,90,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

One explanation for this island rule is that shifts in morphology are an adaptation to facilitate ecological niche expansion. In insular passerines, for instance, increased bill size may facilitate generalist foraging because it allows access to a broader range of feeding niches. Here we use morphologically and ecologically divergent races of white-eyes (Zosteropidae) to test three predictions of this explanation: (1) island populations show a wider feeding niche than mainland populations; (2) island-dwelling populations are made up of individual generalists; and (3) within insular populations there is a positive association between size and degree of foraging generalism. Our results provide only partial support for the traditional explanation. In agreement with the core prediction, island populations of white-eye do consistently display a wider feeding niche than comparative mainland populations. However, observations of individually marked birds reveal that island-dwelling individuals are actually more specialized than expected by chance. Additionally, neither large body size nor large bill size are associated with generalist foraging behavior per se. These latter results remained consistent whether we base our tests on natural foraging behavior or on observations at an experimental tree, and whether we use data from single or multiple cohorts. Taken together, our results suggest that generalist foraging and niche expansion are not the full explanation for morphological shifts in island-dwelling white-eyes. Hence, we review briefly five alternative explanations for morphological divergence in insular populations: environmental determination of morphology, reduced predation pressure, physiological optimization, limited dispersal, and intraspecific dominance.","Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Natl Environm Res Council, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Scott, SN (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",i.owens@imperial.ac.uk,"Blomberg, Simone P/B-7613-2008; Clegg, Sonya/F-5504-2015; Clegg, Sonya M/A-8011-2013; Owens, Ian PF/F-1392-2010","Blomberg, Simone P/0000-0003-1062-0839; Clegg, Sonya/0000-0002-3092-3864; Owens, Ian/0000-0001-6080-3321",,,,70,69,73,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,SEP,2003,57,9,,,,,2147,2156,,,,,10,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,727TB,WOS:000185674500016,14575334,,,,2021-09-24,

The species responded differently to mixed-flocking. A change in feeding sites and/or techniques was found in six species, five of which increased their Feeding rates when foraging in heterospecific flocks. In mixed flocks, they tended to use similar substrates. That such interspecific convergence enhanced feeding rate might be explained by social learning, kleptoparasitism or a beating effect. Benefits gained through these effects were greatest in two species consistently acting as followers, Crested Drongo Dicrurus forficatus and Paradise Flycatcher Tersiphone mutata. Although as leaders, Newtonia Newtonia brunneicauda and Long-billed Greenbul Phyllastrephus madagascariensis often attracted other species, they also increased their Feeding rates through some mutualistic effects. Another leader, Rufous Vanga Shetba, rufa was the only species that neither changed foraging niche nor feeding efficiency in different social situations. Its participation in heterospecific associations probably resulted from other species exploiting the vanga's ability to detect predators. Therefore, the organization of multispecies flocks in Madagascar was mainly based on mutualism and commensalism which increased feeding efficiency.","Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyoto 612, Japan","Hino, T (corresponding author), Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyoto 612, Japan.",,,,,,,34,61,69,1,17,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0908-8857,,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

We studied the interaction between Aphis varians and Formica cinerea on fireweed(Epilobium angustifolium) in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. In 1988 we used two experiments to examine the interaction between ant tending and aphid density on the per capita growth of aphid populations at naturally occurring low aphid densities, and naturally occurring high aphid densities. In 1989, we conducted a similar experiment, but we manipulated aphid densities to include the full range from low to high. The results of these experiments were consistent: ant tending significantly improved the growth of small aphid populations, but the benefit from ant tending decreased or disappeared at higher aphid densities. We considered possible mechanisms for the density-dependent mutualistic effect by examining the relationships among aphid density, the number of ants tending, and predator abundance. We show that the relative number of ants tending declined as aphid density increased, and ant tending did not reduce predator abundance at any aphid densities. Therefore, the cause of the density-dependent mutualism is probably a decline in the direct effect of ants on aphids resulting from a decline in the relative number of ants tending aphids at higher aphid densities.

However, the indirect effects of toxicity may be a significant factor influencing the manner in which ecosystem structure and function respond to anthropogenic stressors. Subsequently, failure to incorporate indirect effects into risk assessment paradigms may be a significant source of uncertainty in risk estimates. The current paper addresses the importance of indirect effects in an ecotoxicological context. Laboratory, mesocosm, and whole ecosystem research into indirect effects is reviewed.

We compared annual censuses of orb-spider populations on 24 islands with diurnal lizards present, and on 20 islands with diurnal lizards absent, to rainfall over a 10-year period. A strong positive correlation (Pearson r=0.877) was found between mean spider density on nolizard islands and the number of days of rain that occurred 2 months prior to spider censuses; correlation coefficients declined with longer and shorter time periods prior to censuses. Correlation coefficients between mean spider density on lizard islands and rainfall showed a similar pattern but were generally lower than those for no-lizard islands. The strength of the impact of lizards on spiders, measured as the ratio of mean spider density on no-lizard islands to mean spider density on lizard islands, varied considerably and was positively correlated with rainfall; the correlation was highest with number of rain days 6 months prior to spider censuses (r-=0.741). Repeated-measures analysis of variance on the time series of spider densities showed that the lizard factor (present versus absent) varied significantly among years. Split-plot ANOVA with rainfall as a covariate indicated that spider density and the impact of lizards on spider density were both significantly correlated with rainfall.

However, there is a possibility that native species that occupy the same habitats may influence the population performance of Ae. albopictus, potentially affecting the establishment of this species in Australia. Cohabitation experiments were performed with the endemic Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse), which has been found occupying the same larval habitats as Ae. albopictus in the Torres Strait and is the most widespread container-inhabiting Aedes species in Australia. The influence of environmental factors and cohabitation between the two species was examined using different climates, food resource levels, food resource types, and species densities. Survivorship proportions and a population performance index (lambda') were calculated and compared. The consequences of increased Ae. notoscriptus densities were reduced survivorship and lambda' for Ae. albopictus. Despite this, the mean lambda' of Ae. albopictus and Ae. notoscriptus was consistently >= 1.06, indicating both species could increase under all conditions, potentially due to increasing conspecific densities negatively affecting Ae. notoscriptus.

Field surveys and manipulative experiments demonstrated that intraspecific density and sediment organic matter (SOM) content of sediments are among the factors that regulate the proportion of sand dollars that forage as deposit versus suspension feeders. High local density was associated with a lower proportion of deposit feeding animals in both field surveys and under controlled experimental conditions. Conversely, the proportion of deposit feeders was elevated in treatments in which SOM levels were subsidized, regardless of local density. These data fit Levinton's model of resource limitation in relation to deposit-and suspension-feeding communities, and expand the list of biological processes regulated through density dependence. Analyses of carbon stable isotope ratios (delta C-13) of sand dollars and their potential sources of primary production suggest individuals rely primarily on suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) or drift macroalgae. Sediment organic matter was not a substantial source of carbon for most individuals. There was a significant inverse relationship between size and delta C-13 values; smaller individuals depended to a greater extent on macroalgae. There was no consistent relationship between isotopic ratios, feeding mode and density, which may be due to the high mobility of the species, their ability to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions and the dynamic nature of their habitat. Our results suggest that biological interactions influence feeding mode of this species. This is a complementary mechanism to those described previously, in which physical factors such as flow and lift/washout have been shown to regulate sand dollar positioning. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We indicate as behavioral adaptation a mechanism, based on a kind of learning, which is not viewed in the evolutionary sense but is intended to occur over shorter time scales. We consider a competitive adaptive n species Lotka-Volterra system, n >= 3, in which one species is made ecologically differentiated with respect to the others by carrying capacity and intrinsic growth rate. The symmetry properties of the system and the existence of a certain class of invariant subspaces allow the introduction of a 7-dimensional reduced model, where n appears as a parameter, which gives full account of existence and stability of equilibria in the complete system. The reduced model is effective also in describing the time-dependent regimes for a large range of parameter values. The case in which one species has a strong ecological advantage (i.e. with a carrying capacity higher than the others), but with a varying growth rate, has been analyzed in detail, and time-dependent behaviors have been investigated in the case of adaptive competition among four species. Relevant questions, as species survival/exclusion, are addressed focusing on the role of adaptation. Interesting forms of species coexistence are found (i.e. competitive stable equilibria, periodic oscillations, strange attractors). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Although both seastars have similar size structures and generally overlapped in their spatial and temporal distribution, the degree of overlap varied in different sites and appeared to be related to prey abundance, substratum type and slope. Three general patterns were observed: (1) both species aggregating in shallow water and decreasing in numbers with depth; (2) the two species showing inverse depth distributions; and (3) both seastars occurring in low numbers across the subtidal zone. Temporal changes in availability of the preferred prey of the two seastars, the mussel Mytilus edulis, appeared to be a major factor affecting their abundance and distribution. The two seastars occurred together in dense aggregations on mussel beds in shallow water. They consume similar-sized mussels until the number of mussels becomes reduced when A. vulgaris, but not L. polaris, begins to select larger mussels. Once a mussel bed is decimated, the seastars appear to move away, possibly in search of other beds. Intensive seastar foraging limits the distribution of mussels to a few metres in depth. Below the mussel zone, the two seastars are spatially segregated at a small spatial scale (l m(2) quadrat) and select different alternative prey, L. polaris feeding mainly on the crevice-dwelling clam Hiatella arctica and A. vulgaris on the ophiuroid Ophiopholis aculeata. The size partitioning of the preferred prey in shallow water, and spatial segregation and selection of different alternative prey at greater depths may reflect mechanisms permitting the two seastars to coexist.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, GIROQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Gaymer, CF (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,81,56,59,2,42,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4221 USA",0025-3154,,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

In this study, differences in resource use between the two periods are presented together with their consequence on the partitioning of resources. A different approach is introduced into the calculation of niche breadth and niche overlap incorporating size-specific differences in resource use and interactions between resource dimensions. Comparison with conventional measures of niche breadth and niche overlap shows that conventional measures often misrepresent interactions between species. Condition and biomass were used as indicators of a species' fitness, and it is shown that fitness of most species is governed by the availability of resources and partitioning of these resources is an important mechanism allowing potential competitors to coexist.

The model provides insights into the manner in which self- and pathogen regulation combine in determining the coexistence or otherwise of hosts and the structure of biological communities generally. A number of outcomes are possible: coexistence of both hosts with the pathogen, coexistence of both hosts without the pathogen, the predictable elimination of one host by the other, which then remains with the pathogen, and the elimination of either host by the other, contingent on initial densities. However, whereas without self-regulation coexistence of both hosts with their shared pathogen can only be achieved by the partitioning of enemy-free space, with self-regulation there is a wider range of paths, including coexistence mediated by the hosts' resources (analogous to exploiter-mediated coexistence), coexistence mediated by interspecific transmission, and coexistence arising when elements of these other mechanisms are combined. Also, a more affected, regulated-alone host can eliminate a less affected, nonregulated-alone host, but not vice versa; whereas without self-regulation only the opposite outcome is possible.

Depending upon the environmental context, saltmarsh plants can facilitate or suppress mangrove recruitment. A field study was conducted within a mosaic saltmarsh at the edge of a mangrove forest fringing Tampa Bay, FL, USA, to investigate whether mangrove recruitment is influenced by the species composition of saltmarsh patches within which mangroves develop. Propagules of Avicennia germinans were emplaced into experimental plots at the same tidal elevation representing 3 saltmarsh treatments: (1) Distichlis littoralis in monoculture, (2) Sporobolus virginicus in monoculture, and (3) polycultures containing D. littoralis, S. virginicus, and at least one other species. Significantly fewer seedlings established in S. virginicus monocultures than in D. littoralis monocultures. Seedling establishment within the saltmarsh polyculture was intermediate to the grass monoculture treatments. Herbivory was the most commonly observed source of mortality for mangrove propagules, and propagules were more susceptible to herbivory within monocultures of S. virginicus relative to D. littoralis monocultures. Our results suggest that patch-scale heterogeneity in saltmarsh groundcover may influence spatial patterns of mangrove herbivory and recruitment at landward forest margins. This study builds on prior investigations and demonstrates that interactions between the same mangrove and saltmarsh species may differ between sites. Understanding these context-dependent interactions among saltmarsh plants and mangrove recruits can be useful for forecasting distributional shifts of mangrove populations and for implementing mangrove restoration.","[Peterson, Jennifer M.; Bell, Susan S.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Bell, SS (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",sbell@usf.edu,,,,,,94,4,4,2,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Aside from the unequal sample sizes involved with using this abundance-limited method, confounding factors potentially associated with levels of social interactions may also be introduced. The alternative, volume-limited method, i.e., varying the volume while maintaining equal numbers of animals, can provide a test for the presence of potentially confounding factors. Using tadpoles of Fowler's Toad, Anaxyrus fowleri, we examined the effect of density on growth rate, timing of metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis in both abundance-limited and volume-limited experiments. We found no difference in tadpole growth rate or timing of metamorphosis between these two methods, but the metamorphs emerging from abundance-limited low density treatments were significantly smaller when compared to those in volume-limited low density treatments. Because toad tadpoles may naturally form social aggregations and schools, this suggests that the actual number of animals present may be important for normal social behavior and optimizing feeding rate. If volume-limited and abundance-limited methods of manipulating density are not equivalent, treatment method may itself be a factor that can differentially affect growth variables.","[Yagi, Katharine T.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21111 Lakeshore Rd,Ste Anne Bellevue, Quebec City, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Yagi, Katharine T.; Green, David M.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada","Green, DM (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada.",katharine.yagi@mail.mcgill.ca; david.m.green@mcgill.ca,,,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF); Wildlife Preservation Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Financial support for this research came from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF), Wildlife Preservation Canada, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grants to DMG).

Since its inception, the GUD approach has been applied successfully to a vast range of foraging species and foraging scenarios. However, its application is not simple, as anyone who has tried to use it for the first time might attest. Limitations of the technique were noted at its conception, yet only the artificiality of the patches, the appropriateness of the food resource, and the possibility of multiple visiting foragers were identified. Here we show the current uses of GUD and outline the practical benefits as well as the often overlooked limitations of the technique. We define seven major points that need to be addressed when applying this methodology: (1) the curvilinearity between harvest rate and energy, (2) the energetic state of the forager, (3) the effect of group foraging, (4) food quality and substrate properties, (5) the predictability of the patch, (6) behavioral traits of the forager, and (7) nontarget species. We also suggest how GUD experiments can be enhanced by incorporating complementary methods (such as cameras) to better understand the foraging processes involved in the GUD itself. We conclude that the benefits of using GUD outweigh the costs, but that its limitations should not be ignored. Incorporating new methods when using GUD can potentially offer novel and important insights into the study of foraging behavior.","[Bedoya-Perez, Miguel A.; Carthey, Alexandra J.

Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz. Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464. 5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels [dB]) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with >= 2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites. Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training.

Such multispecies interactions can give rise to trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed. Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils. Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established populations.","[Swope, Sarah M.; Parker, Ingrid M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Swope, Sarah M.] ARS, USDA, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, Albany, CA 94710 USA","Swope, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",swope@biology.ucsc.edu,"Parker, Ingrid M./ABH-2014-2020","Parker, Ingrid M./0000-0002-4847-1827",USDA's Exotic and Invasive Weeds Research Unit; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0808337],"We thank Marci Beitch and Laurel Warddrip for their diligent work in the field.

Introduced plants generally have lower generalist herbivore loads than native plants. Herbivores may be avoiding a potentially edible food source (Behavioural Constraint Hypothesis) or defences of introduced plants may be unusually toxic (Novel Defence Hypothesis). 2. To examine these hypotheses, acridid grasshoppers (Melanoplus angustipennis and Orphullela pelidna) were enclosed in a Texas grassland. Each enclosure contained native prairie vegetation and a seedling of either introduced Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) or native Celtis laevigata (hackberry). Sapium invades many ecosystems in the south-east U.S.A. Celtis seedlings also establish in these ecosystems. 3. Although grasshoppers usually feed sparingly on Sapium, in field enclosures they fed heavily on this introduced tree species, supporting a role for behavioural avoidance. In laboratory feeding trials, M. angustipennis grasshoppers preferred Sapium foliage over the foliage of three native tree species. In a greenhouse experiment, M. angustipennis individuals fed more on Sapium in prairie mesocosms if they were conditioned on Sapium. 4. In another field experiment with single seedlings in enclosures, grasshoppers consumed similar amounts of Sapium from its introduced (Texas, U.S.A.) and native (China) ranges, suggesting that Sapium may have been a suitable host plant since it was introduced. Behavioural avoidance by generalist herbivores may contribute to Sapium's low herbivore load in its introduced range.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Siemann, E (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol MS 170, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",siemann@rice.edu,"Lankau, Richard A/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard A/0000-0001-9995-328X",,,,45,59,69,2,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

This causes problems with data complexity, sampling (level) and independence. Many ecological programmes are currently conducting multi-scale investigation of organismal trends (e.g. diversity). In this study, by contrast, the assemblages analysed were the resources used by animals (rather than animals per se). Variability in shell use was studied in 5 members of a taxon (hermit crabs) from global to site spatial levels. The novel adaptation of an existing technique used 1-factor, 3-level ANOVA of Bray-Curtis similarity values based on 'centroids' for each scale. Similarity in the number of shells used, the proportional usage of shell types, shell diversity and other variables were examined at site (> 10 m apart), locality (> 1 km apart) and region levels (> 1000 km apart). There was significant variability amongst scales and between regions in shell use of all species. For some species, observed variability differed with location, while in others the trend was similar in all 3 regions. Between 18 and 3 shell types were used by different study species with diversity (Shannon H') values ranging from 2.54 to 0.1 and evenness values from 0.99 to 0.1. Shell use by hermit crabs was less similar (to each other) between regions than between the study hermit crab species. No significant spatial effects at any level were found on the proportion of damaged shells used by different species. The numbers of shell types used by hermit crabs had both a taxon-specific component and a global pattern. Data from the literature in combination with that from the present study showed Dardanus, Diogenes and Pagurus species used fewer shell types than Coenobita, Clibanarius and Calcinus species. No inter-oceanic patterns were evident in any genus. Shell numbers used by Clibanarius and Calcinus species both, however, exhibited distinct latitudinal clines.

The seasonal activity patterns and food habits of these tortoises are studied in the present paper. K. erosa and K. homeana have similar activity patterns, with peaks occurring during the wet season. Kinixys belliana was found only during the wet months. There was no evidence of any specific effect of humidity of the air on their activity intensity, and it seems likely that, more than absolute values of air humidity, the crucial factor to force tortoises into high activity is the sudden change between dry days and very wet days at the onset of the rainy season (end of March - early April). K. homeana was significantly more active in the early phase of the wet season. Common items, which were consumed by all three predator species, were: plant matters, fruits and berries, fungi, Oligochaeta, and Gastropoda Pulmonata, whereas Araneidae were also consumed by all species, but much more rarely. Common prey items, which were consumed by K. homeana and not by K. erosa were: Coleoptera larvae, Dermaptera, and termites. K. homeana appeared more generalist than K. erosa, and the respective diets diverged considerably both in dry and in wet seasons. On the other hand, the diets of K. erosa and K. belliana were more similar (at least in wet season).","FIZV, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-00198 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), FIZV, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,58,21,21,0,11,NATURALIS BIODIVERSITY CENTER,LEIDEN,"DARWINWEG 2, LEIDEN, 2333 CR, NETHERLANDS",1383-4517,1875-9866,,CONTRIB ZOOL,Contrib.

How natural selection has resulted in variation in adaptive strategies between species, however, is not well studied, and few empirical studies attempt to determine if changes in survival rate drive changes in reproduction, or if the causality is the other way around. I propose that a profitable approach to resolve this problem would be to compare life-history traits in different geographic populations of the same species. Variation in fecundity and adult survival rates across fourteen populations of Blue Tits Parus caeruleus are as large as those among eleven tits Parus spp., so that comparisons among these populations can help identify selective factors that influence reproduction and survival. In a set of populations of Great Tit Parus major and Blue Tit there exists a significant inverse relation between productivity (number of young fledged per female per season) and adult annual survival rates, but not between fecundity and survival rates. I discuss experiments that help to address the question of cause and effect, and conclude that variations in productivity cause variations in survival rates. I finally present different scenarios that propose evolutionary pathways illustrating how populations could evolve from one set of life-history traits to another.","Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Dhondt, AA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",aad4@cornell.edu,"Dhondt, Andre/A-8292-2008","Dhondt, Andre/0000-0002-4946-1401",,,,43,29,29,0,27,NEDERLANDSE ORNITHOLOGISCHE UNIE,ZEIST,"C/O PAUL STARMANS, OUDE ARNHEMSEWEG 261, 3705 BD ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0373-2266,2213-1175,,ARDEA,Ardea,,2001,89,1,,,SI,,155,166,,,,,12,Ornithology,Zoology,444ZF,WOS:000169431700016,,,,,2021-09-24,

I then identified, characterized, and tabulated occurrences of the different types of community organization. In ten years of Ecology, there were 66 instances of habitat partitioning accompanied by experimental demonstrations of how the patterns were formed. Shared preferences and distinct preferences were most commonly cited as producing patterns of partitioning (34 and 17 times, respectively), but there were also 8 examples of one-sided preferences, 4 examples of centrifugal organization, and 3 instances of niche contraction. This indicates that a variety of community organizations can produce patterns of partitioning and that shared preferences may occur more frequently in nature than generally thought. The presence of particular types of organization was influenced by the kind of study organism, with shared preferences occurring more frequently than distinct preferences among autotrophs and among different-aged individuals of the same species. Distinct preferences occurred when species were partitioned on different hosts rather than along gradients, suggesting that the kinds of resources that species use in a habitat may also influence how patterns of partitioning are formed.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Wisheu, IC (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",,,,,,,149,61,64,1,47,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1998,83,2,,,,,246,258,,10.2307/3546836,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,137XJ,WOS:000076942100005,,,,,2021-09-24,

Furthermore, data on small mammal assemblage composition in two different environmental types (i.e. woodland and grassland) were drawn from previous studies performed in the study areas. The three owls preyed chiefly upon small mammals, while birds were occasionally eaten. The trophic niches of A. otus in the three study areas were significantly narrower than that of T. alba and S. aluco. These latter species varied the size of their prey between the three localities, while A. otus preyed upon similarly sized prey in the three study areas. By using data on small mammal occurrence we tried to estimate the environmental type where the owls conducted their predatory activity: principal component analysis revealed that A. otus was linked to the cultivated fields as foraging habitat, while S. aluco and ir: alba were less selective in the choice of hunting habitat. Furthermore, discriminant analysis indicated that species dietary habits maintained their distinguishing features also in distant localities. However, it appeared that owls did not use foraging resource with an exclusive strategy: evidences from this study are consistent with the hypothesis of a selective use of the trophic resource by A. otus, while diets of T. alba and S. aluco showed differences between the three localitites.","Ist Nazl Fauna Selvat, I-40064 Ozzano Emilia, Italy; Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sci Biol, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; Inst Ecol, CNF, Calabar, Cross River Sta, Nigeria","Capizzi, D (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Fauna Selvat, Via Ca Fornacetta 9, I-40064 Ozzano Emilia, Italy.",me3176@mclink.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020; CAPIZZI, DARIO/O-6431-2019","Capizzi, Dario/0000-0003-0871-9602",,,,67,9,10,1,15,SOC NATL PROTECTION NATURE ACCLIMATATION FRANCE,PARIS 5,"57 RUE CUVIER, 75005 PARIS 5, FRANCE",0249-7395,,,REV ECOL-TERRE VIE,Rev.

We tested the effects of food, in the form of leaf litter, and density on population growth and fitness correlates of the tree hole mosquito Aedes triseriatus. Our field experiment used a 2 x 2 randomized block design, with three holes as blocks. In cages within three holes, we manipulated densities of Aedes triseriatus larvae, and presence of leaf litter. Our laboratory experiment used a 2 x 3 factorial design in which we also manipulated densities of larvae and availability of leaf litter within similar cages (inside, outside, or absent). For both experiments we determined effects on survival, days to and mass at eclosion of both sexes, and a composite index of population performance lambda', that estimates finite rate of increase. 2. In the field experiment, we found significant and large effects of leaf litter and of density on the performance of A. triseriatus. The effect of density did not depend on leaf litter availability. We documented significant variation among tree holes for most correlates of fitness. Often, the effects of treatments varied significantly depending on the tree hole tested. 3. In the laboratory experiment we found significant effects of density and litter, and that direct browsing on leaf litter is necessary for the effect of litter on performance of A. triseriatus. In the laboratory, the negative effect of increased density was dependent on leaf litter availability. 4. Our results demonstrate that leaf litter has important effects on population performance of tree hole mosquitoes in natural tree holes, Direct browsing on the surface of leaf litter is the most likely mechanism by which litter enhances population growth. The impact of litter on populations varies among tree holes.","ILLINOIS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,ECOL GRP,NORMAL,IL 61790",,,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",,,,36,92,95,1,27,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Although simulated pond communities offer unusually attractive properties for evaluating the effects of xenobiotics on aquatic ecosystems, this approach has received only limited attention as a potential model system for studying the effects of toxicants on amphibian communities. We provide a summary of results and experimental designs from past studies in order to illustrate the general protocols used and complex interactions between biotic and abiotic variables that can be simulated in artificial pond communities. We recommend that community ecologists who make use of this system generally become more aware of the importance of abiotic factors in pond simulations, and that they model the abiotic parameters of the particular system that they are attempting to simulate. We strongly recommend the use of this experimentally tractable system for aquatic community ecotoxicological research, since it is through such a multispecies, top-down simulation approach that we can begin to understand the processes by which xenobiotic factors impact more complex natural systems.

There was a tendency toward increased settlement of hard clam larvae with increasing density of gem clams. Microscopic examination showed that increased settlement did not result from trapping or entanglement in sticky secretions from gem clams. Enhanced settlement in the presence of gem clams was persistent in both gently aerated and recirculated waters, and in both sand and muddy sand, suggesting that M mercenaria larvae could recognize settlement cues associated with G. gemma in various habitats and hydrodynamic conditions. Preferential settlement in sediment previously exposed to gem clams indicates that gem clams alter sediment in some way to make it attractive for larval settlement. In addition, increased settlement in the presence of empty gem clam shells in sediment suggests that settlement cues are properties of the shell, although the nearly significant settlement with gravel particles suggests that physical cues, such as grain size and bottom roughness, may play a role. Thus, this study demonstrates dense assemblages of small suspension feeders can enhance larval settlement of another bivalve species.","SUNY, MARINE SCI RES CTR, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA; KOREA OCEAN RES & DEV INST, POLAR RES CTR, SEOUL 425600, SOUTH KOREA; OREGON STATE UNIV, OREGON SEA GRANT INST, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,51,10,10,0,1,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In a greenhouse experiment, thrips reduced root biomass of seedlings, but not shoot biomass. No correlation was found between density of thrips and change in aboveground area of plants after monitoring for 3 yr in the field. Thrips fed on the phyllaries and corollas of flower heads, as well as on leaves, and were particularly damaging to ray petals. Placed in artificial arrays, flower heads with rays damaged by thrips were less likely to be visited by pollinators than were undamaged flower heads. Plants in a common garden were subjected to three seasons of feeding by either spittle-bugs, plume moth caterpillars, both, or neither. Survival, growth, and flower production were measured for those 3 yr and for an additional 3 yr following the herbivory treatments. Plant survival was unaffected by these insect herbivores, although gophers (Thomomys bottae) were a major source of mortality. Plants with caterpillars produced more rosettes than those without moths. By consuming apical buds the caterpillars released axillary buds, thereby causing plants to produce more side rosettes. This difference in architecture did not result in an increase in flower production. Plants that had experienced 3 yr of spittle-bug or caterpillar attack produced fewer flower heads than controls during their 3rd yr. One year later, and after the herbivory treatments were discontinued, plants that had been damaged by spittlebugs (but not plume moth caterpillars) still produced fewer flowers than those in other treatments. Thereafter, no long-term effects of herbivory could be detected. All three herbivores were found to adversely affect some components of plant growth and reproduction.

This scale was large enough to allow line-transect estimates of lizard abundance, which were related to quantitative (and when possible multivariate) measurements of the structure and floristic composition of vegetation, the abundance of arthropod prey, the relative density of other lizard species, and the climatic data obtained from nearby meteorological stations. Neither the climate not the abundance of other lizards seemed to condition the quantitative distribution of the species. The positive influence of broad-leaved forests on the abundance of P. algirus appeared to be a consequence of structure attributes more directly related to the ecology of lizards than floristic composition per se. Thus, population levels were most highly correlated with the cover of shrubs over 20 cm in height, and once this structural requirement was met, they increased with the abundance of potential prey (itself conditioned by vegetation cover at the ground level and litter cover). We suggest that our results should be interpreted in the context of thermoregulatory, predator avoidance and movement minimization strategies whose influence on survival, and hence abundance, could probably be applied to other insectivorous lizards from temperate zones.","CSIC,MUSEO NACL CIENCIAS NAT,UEI VERTEBRADOS,E-28006 MADRID,SPAIN","DIAZ, JA (corresponding author), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,FAC BIOL,DEPT BIOL ANIM VERTEBRADOS,E-28040 MADRID,SPAIN.",,"Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Diaz, Jose A./H-5559-2015; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016","Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Diaz, Jose A./0000-0001-6047-5065; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531",,,,53,77,81,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

For different studies on life history plasticity to be comparable, there must be clearly defined and commonly agreed transition points, but it is unclear how consistently this is being performed in studies using anuran amphibians. In a review of 157 published studies, I found considerable variation in defining the end point of the larval phase. While a slight majority used the emergence of the forelimbs as the conclusion of the larval phase, some used a period within the developmental phase of metamorphic climax and others used the resorption of the tail. Studies included in this review, that assessed the same life history variable at two different developmental stages, reported some differences in results depending on which developmental stage was used. Recent evidence also shows that metamorphic climax is itself a period which can vary with environmental conditions, but, even in studies that included part or all of metamorphic climax in the larval phase, the treatment of individuals during metamorphic climax was not reported. Therefore, I argue that life history studies on anuran amphibians should distinguish the following phases: larval, metamorphic climax, juvenile, adult; that the end of the larval phase is best defined in ecological studies by forelimb emergence and that conditions under which individuals undergo metamorphic climax should be fully described.","[Walsh, Patrick Thomas] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Walsh, PT (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews KY16 9JP, Fife, Scotland.",Patrick.Walsh@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland,"I thank Roger Downie, Pat Monaghan, Sue Healy, Richard Griffiths and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on this manuscript.

To infer the process of facilitation at a large scale, the spatial distribution of Q. humilis was studied in relation to acorn sources and the type of plant cover in grazed and ungrazed sites. Abundant recruitment up to 80 m from the wood margins and from isolated oak trees in grassland shows that acorns are dispersed effectively. At the three study sites, the density of Q. humilis individuals was higher under shrubs than in grassland, suggesting that facilitation may occur. This density difference was much higher in the grazed sites than in the ungrazed site. Moreover, before grazing by livestock, the distribution of first-year seedlings is independent of vegetation cover. Thus, shrubs improve Q. humilis regeneration by protecting individuals from grazing. The high density of individuals at the northern edge of shrubs suggests that a second facilitation mechanism may exist, probably related to improved germination conditions. Facilitation by shrubs appears to be very important for Q. humilis dynamics.","CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Lepart, J (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,55,81,86,1,30,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,UPPSALA,"BOX 25137, S 752 25 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Correlations between body size and the use of foraging sites in trees are well described for European tits. Our results indicate that similar correlations exist in this Korean guild. There were significant differences among species in frequency of use of five foraging site categories in trees: trunks, branches, twigs, leaves, needles. The larger the species, the more often it used trunks and branches for foraging. There was a positive correlation between body-size difference and the difference in the foraging sites between species, indicating that species of similar body sizes foraged in similar sites in trees. For four species not specialized in using conifers (Parus varius, P. major, P. palustris, Aegithalos caudatus), there was a negative correlation between body size difference between species and the difference in the frequency of foraging in conifers, suggesting that birds of similar body sizes foraged in different tree species. We suggest a possible role of dominance in creating this relationship. This is one of the few reports of foraging niche differences among tits in temperate forests in Asia. This report is important in that it shows, for the first time, foraging niche differences in a previously unstudied guild of tits, and that the differences are correlated with size differences, just as in the well studied guild of tits in Europe.","Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland; Korea Environm Inst, Seoul 156090, South Korea","Jablonski, PG (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland.",piotrjab@manduca.neurobio.arizona.edu; Leesd@keins.kei.re.kr,"Jablonski, Piotr/K-4231-2012",/0000-0002-8333-0106,,,,50,13,13,0,10,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,1999,76,1,,,,,17,23,,,,,7,Ornithology,Zoology,214XT,WOS:000081353400002,,,,,2021-09-24,

Biogeographical processes that influence speciation and extinction rates determine the size and composition of this regional species pool. Community ecologists are beginning to recognize the importance of these biogeographical processes in influencing diversity patterns among local communities, but the potential for local interactions to influence biogeographical processes, especially speciation, has been little considered. In this paper I discuss one mechanism by which variation in the strengths of local interactions can influence the potential for population differentiation and thus for influencing speciation rates in the allopatric model of speciation. When more than one selective agent acts on the phenotype, the shape of the overall fitness surface depends critically on the relative strengths of the various selective agents. If one selective agent, which imparts strong selection, acts in all populations of a species, population differentiation via adaptation to local ecological conditions or via differentiation of sexual systems is retarded because the overall fitness surface in all populations strongly resembles the shape of the strongest selective agent. Consequently, the potential for speciation is reduced. Alternatively, if selective agents in various populations impart relatively equitable strengths of selection, the potential for differences in the overall fitness surfaces among populations is enhanced, which will enhance the potential for population differentiation and thus speciation. Analogous results obtain when multiple selective agents impact genetically correlated characters. Because the strength of selection generated by a species interaction should increase with the strength of the interaction, and because fewer species can usually coexist when the strengths of interactions are greater, the number of coexisting species and the potential for speciation in component taxa may covary among communities. This analysis indicates that the relative strengths of interactions can be as important to diversification in communities as the number of niche dimensions along which differentiation can occur.",,"McPeek, MA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

If indirect effects have strong ecological effects, then they must also have strong evolutionary effects through natural selection. We consider how indirect effects, both positive and negative, combine with positive and negative direct effects to influence evolution between interacting species. Any one species can evolve in response to direct interactions with other species by changing its ''response'' to the presence of the other species or changing its ''effect'' on the species. We argue that the direction (positive or negative) of the direct and indirect effects will determine whether traits related to ''response'' or ''effect'' are most likely to be subject to natural selection. Further, covariance patterns of species in the same community should increase when direct and indirect effects between species act in the same direction, resulting in greater compartmentalization of such communities.",,"Miller, TE (corresponding author), FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, B-157, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA.",,,,,,,56,79,80,3,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1996,77,5,,,,,1329,1335,,10.2307/2265530,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UX396,WOS:A1996UX39600003,,,,,2021-09-24,

An important potential consequence of adaptive behavioral responses is higher-order interactions among species (e.g., in which the presence of a third species qualitatively alters the nature of the interaction between two other species). To illustrate this potential, I examine two broad classes of adaptive behavioral responses, choice of activity level and of habitat. I review evidence that suggests that in many organisms these behaviors are mediated by trade-offs between resource acquisition and mortality risk. This trade-off provides a conceptual foundation on which to predict individual behavior, and since the trade-off changes with size, marked behavioral allometries may occur over an individual's ontogeny. I present evidence that these sorts of behavioral responses create strong higher-order interactions. I argue that theory at the individual behavioral level affords the opportunity for a rich interaction between theory at the individual and population levels by providing a mechanistic basis for species interaction theory. Because behavioral responses are occurring on the same time scale as direct effects, ecologists will need explicitly to include adaptive behavioral mechanisms in the theory to understand species interactions in many systems. Finally, I discuss how behavioral allometries may contribute to selection on features of the life cycle.",,"WERNER, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT BIOL, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,132,160,163,1,29,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Such assemblages may be organized at the level of guilds rather than at the finer species level. In a ten-year study of assemblages of fish at One Tree Reef, Great Barrier Reef, we found species composition and the number of fish on a given lagoonal patch reef vary greatly across time (Sale and Douglas 1984; Sale et al. in preparation). The mean average proportional similarity of a reef's assemblage to itself at different times (censuses) is usually low at a value of around 0.5. This apparent variability may be ecologically irrelevant noise if organization is at the higher guild level. We have recast our database at the guild level to test this possibility. Thirteen guilds were defined by the diets, foraging habitats and times of the individual species comprising them. Similarity of an assemblage to itself at successive censuses was re-calculated using the number of individuals in each guild instead of the numbers in each species. This analysis yielded significantly higher levels of similarity (P<0.01) among censuses. To test whether this increase in similarity was due solely to the smaller number of categories used to calculate the similarity indices, 5 sets of randomly generated guilds were constructed using a Monte Carlo approach. No significant difference (P>0.05) was found between the average similarity among censuses when assemblages were classified into these null guilds and when they were classified according to the real guilds. These results indicate that shifting to the larger taxonomic scale of guilds does not reveal a significantly more persistent assemblage structure than that revealed when analysis is at the smaller scale of species. There is no evidence of an underlying organization of these assemblages at the guild level.","UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE, CTR MARINE BIOL, DURHAM, NH 03824 USA","SALE, PF (corresponding author), UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE, DEPT ZOOL, DURHAM, NH 03824 USA.",,"Sale, Peter/AAM-5414-2020",,,,,55,23,23,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,SEP,1992,11,3,,,,,147,154,,10.1007/BF00255469,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,JR082,WOS:A1992JR08200007,,,,,2021-09-24,
