However, what actually drives social affinity between species in the wild will depend on the characteristics of the species available to group. Here we first present an agent-based model that predicts trait-related survival benefits from mixed-species group formation in a multi-species community and we then test the model predictions in a community-wide field study of African savannah herbivores using multi-layered network analysis. We reveal benefits from information transfer about predators as a key determinant of mixed-species group formation, and that dilution benefits alone are not enough to explain patterns in interspecific sociality. The findings highlight the limitations of classical ecological approaches focusing only on direct trophic interactions when analysing community structure and suggest that declines in species occupying central social network positions, such as key informants, can have significant repercussions throughout communities.","[Meise, Kristine; Bro-Jorgensen, Jakob] Univ Liverpool, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Inst Integrat Biol, Neston CH64 7TE, England; [Meise, Kristine; Franks, Daniel W.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Franks, Daniel W.] Univ York, Dept Comp Sci, York YO10 5GH, N Yorkshire, England","Bro-Jorgensen, J (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Inst Integrat Biol, Neston CH64 7TE, England.",bro@liv.ac.uk,,"Franks, Daniel Wayne/0000-0002-4832-7470","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L007185/1, NE/L007266/1]","We are grateful to the Kenyan National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation, the Narok County Government, the Chief Park Warden of the Masai Mara National Reserve, and the Kenya Wildlife Service for permission to conduct the fieldwork.

Despite recent growth in shellfish aquaculture in British Columbia, Canada, the impacts of common practices on non-target species are poorly understood. Two practices employed on clam farms to increase production of the exotic clam Venerupis philippinarum include the addition of juvenile 'seed' clams to the sediment and covering seeded clam beds with protective netting, ostensibly to exclude large mobile epibenthic predators. 2. We expected the effects of predator exclusion to be most evident among other bivalves, which made up more than 80% of the infaunal macrobenthos at all sites surveyed. A field study across three regions collected infaunal bivalve density and biomass data. We compared species richness, composition and abundances of communities between clam farms and reference sites, paired on the basis of physical characteristics such as sediment type, slope and aspect. 3. Venerupis philippinarum was the only species found in higher abundance on farm sites in low intertidal areas (227 +/- 241.6 clams m(-2), P = 0.02; 872.9 +/- 792.9 g m(-2), P = 0.037). Farmed sites showed no difference in mid-intertidal areas, nor in density of the other 25 bivalve species, although an increase would be expected if netting excluded important predators. Although statistically non-significant, there were indications that biomass of species other than V. philippinarum may have been lower on farm sites. 4. Bivalve species composition was not significantly different between farm and reference sites. Nevertheless, farm sites were more similar to each other as a group than reference sites, leading to a loss of regional distinctness that was evident among reference sites. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings support the hypothesis that predation and competition play minor roles in structuring communities in soft-bottomed environments. Given the potential for cumulative effects of seeding and netting at large scales, a precautionary approach is recommended in future development of intertidal clam aquaculture.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Bendell-Young, L (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",bendell@sfu.ca,,"Whiteley, Jonathan/0000-0002-2994-9258",,,,52,22,22,0,16,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Negative effects of invasive species are often manifested in alterations of food web structure and through competition with and predation upon native species. The Illinois River, Illinois, USA harbors invasive, planktivorous bighead, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and can be a model ecosystem to test for their effects on zooplankton communities. We tested for bighead and silver carp effects on zooplankton communities pre- and post-establishment within one reach of the Illinois River and among river reaches that varied in abundances of these invasive fishes. The establishment of bighead and silver carp was associated with increased rotifer abundances, while cladoceran and copepod abundances were reduced relative to pre-establishment. Cladoceran and copepod abundance and biomass were negatively associated with bighead and silver carp abundances among reaches. Total zooplankton and rotifer abundance and biomass were positively associated with bighead and silver carp abundances. Our results suggest that bighead and silver carp have changed the zooplankton community of the Illinois River which may have implications for the food web, native species, and other ecosystems poised to be invaded, such as the Laurentian Great Lakes.

We used radio telemetry to investigate habitat partitioning during the active period by the introduced American eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) and the native European hare (Lepus europaeus) in sympatric conditions. Home ranges of cottontails varied from 1.1-2.2 ha in autumn to 3.0-3.6 ha in summer. In hares, home ranges were 30.5-33.8 ha in summer and increased to 49.5-85.9 ha in winter. Both species used an overall area composed of about 27% of natural habitats (i.e., meadows, woodlands, shrubby habitats, shores, and uncultivated land) and over 70% of field crops. The coexistence of the two species appeared to be facilitated by habitat partitioning. Habitat use of cottontails was characterized by a preference for natural habitats at the study area level as well as within the home ranges, while hares showed a preference for crop fields at both spatial scales and a seasonal selection of meadows within home ranges. Habitat overlap measured with the Pianka index was 0.57-0.64 in autumn and winter, and increased in summer and spring to 0.73-0.78. Our results provide evidence of different resource selection strategies adopted by these two sympatric lagomorph species. Hare populations are often found in agricultural landscapes at low-densities, while cottontails are currently spreading throughout Northern Italy to such an extent that an eradication programme appears unfeasible. In this situation, conservation measures for hares and other species should also take into consideration the presence or possible arrival of cottontails. Habitat restoration measures that would increase the amount of fallow lands and shrublands may favour cottontails more than hares. In areas where introduced lagomorphs are present, the necessity of natural open landscapes for hares may be better faced by increasing the presence of meadows, that are seasonally used by hares and not by cottontails.

In eastern deciduous forests of the United States, a single ant genus (Aphaenogaster) appears ecologically dominant with high abundance and opportunistic foraging. However, Aphaenogaster ants are not particularly behaviorally aggressive toward co-occurring ants, making it unclear as to how they might sustain dominance. We offered myrmecochorous seeds and termite carrion at bait stations and quantified ant aggression, food selection and recruitment. We conducted the experiments throughout the natural seed-release window to determine how the abundance of low- and high-quality food items impacted behavior. We found evidence that Aphaenogaster ants dominate the retrieval of both seeds and insect carrion (dead termites). Aphaenogaster foraging dominance did not appear driven by superior fighting or recruitment abilities but simply by having more foragers on the ground, essentially achieving control of different types of food resources through numerical dominance. Moreover, though they are the dominant effective seed dispersers in the system, A. picea exhibited a much greater affinity for termites than seeds, and the desirability of termites decreased in the presence of seeds. Overall, our results suggest that high numbers of foragers-as opposed to aggressive territoriality-can be an effective ecological strategy for sustaining ecological dominance through resource acquisition.","[Warren, R.

Preferences may improve only specific fitness metrics at particular spatial scales, with variation across time or between sexes. Preferences sometimes even reduce fitness. We investigated the context specificity of adaptive habitat selection, studying dickcissels (Spiza americana)-a polygynous songbird-as a model. From 2014 to 2015, we measured male and female habitat preferences at two scales (territories and landscape patches) on 21 grassland patches in Ringgold County, Iowa, USA. We tested whether preferences improved four fitness metrics-polygyny, avoidance of brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), fledgling productivity, and offspring condition. Both sexes preferred territories where offspring attained superior condition and patches where parasitism was infrequent. Females preferred patches where nests produced more fledglings, and in 2014, males on preferred (i.e., early-established) territories attracted more mates and produced more fledglings. However, males on non-preferred (i.e., late-established) territories were more successful in 2015. This inconsistency may have arisen because females were abundant and nest-predation rates were low in May-June 2014, allowing early-settling males to produce many young. In 2015, however, females were more abundant and nests more successful later in the breeding season. Our results show that habitat preferences do not uniformly improve fitness, and some benefits differ between sexes. Moreover, preference-fitness relationships only manifest at specific scales, and annual variation in population and predation dynamics can limit consistency. Detecting adaptive habitat selection thus requires multi-year measurements and careful consideration of relevant scales.","[Nelson, Scott B.; Coon, Jaime J.; Miller, James R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Nelson, Scott B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Miller, James R.] Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Nelson, SBM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Nelson, SBM (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",snelson47@wisc.edu,,,"Competitive State Wildlife Grants program [U-D F14AP00012]; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [ILLU-875-918]; Frances M.

Least weasels (Mustela nivalis) hunt in dense plant cover, whereas kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) hunt in habitats with sparse plant cover. Field voles (Microtus agrestis), the main food of weasels and kestrels, prefer open country with a high grass layer. We simulated a multipredator environment in an aviary (3.0 x 4.8 x 2.2 m) to find out whether predator facilitation plays a role in the interactions between voles, small mustelids, and raptors. In each replicate, we placed a field vole in a pen including sides of high and low grass layers (cover and open). In a predator-free situation, voles preferred cover but shifted to open when a weasel was introduced to cover. In the presence of a kestrel, voles occupied cover and decreased their mobility In the presence of a kestrel plus a kestrel, voles behaved as under the kestrel risk alone. Therefore, in these aviary circumstances, voles perceived the kestrel risk as greater than the weasel risk. Predator facilitation in the assemblage of predators subsisting on rodent prey may contribute to the crash of the four-year vole cycle: microhabitat shift due to an avoidance of weasel jaws may drive voles to raptor talons.",,"Korpimaki, E (corresponding author), UNIV TURKU, DEPT BIOL, ECOL ZOOL LAB, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND.",,,,,,,40,89,96,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

This is particularly relevant to classical biological control of cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar) (Tetranychidae) in Africa, as this pest mite is shared by several natural enemies in the Neotropics (its area of origin), two of which have been introduced and established widely in Africa. We conducted two screenhouse experiments using the two neotropical phytoseiid predatory mites, Typhlodromalus aripo DeLeon and Typhlodromalus manihoti Moraes, to determine the effects of single and two-predator species on population dynamics of the two predators and on suppression of M. tanajoa populations. The two predators are thought to be complementary in their impact on their shared prey M. tanajoa, due to similarities in their preference for this prey and to differences in their spatial distribution and foraging activities on cassava. The two predator species were released alone or together at low and at high initial densities of M. tanajoa. In all cases, predator releases resulted in significant suppression of M. tanajoa, but the degree of suppression did not differ among single and two-species releases with one exception: at high initial density of M. tanajoa, releases of T. aripo alone had less impact than that of either T. manihoti alone or of the two species together. Typhlodromalus aripo also appeared to be inferior as a competitor of T. manihoti: at low initial density of M. tanajoa, the proportion of T. aripo in the two-predator release treatments gradually declined and was strikingly lower than in the single species release, probably due to intraguild predation on its larvae by T. manihoti. However, T. aripo persisted longer than T. manihoti after elimination of M. tanajoa . On the basis of this study under semi-natural conditions, it appears that either species is sufficient for controlling M. tanajoa populations, with T. manihoti being more efficient at high initial prey densities and T. aripo at low initial prey densities. At high prey density, T. manihoti increased to large numbers and outcompeted T. aripo. Relevance of these findings to larger spatial scale and under natural conditions is discussed.","Int Inst Trop Agr, Biol Control Ctr Africa, Cotonou, Benin; Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hanna, R (corresponding author), LW Lambourn & Co, IITA Benin, 26 Dingwall Rd, Croydon CR9 3EE, England.",r.hanna@cgiar.org,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,36,18,21,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-3157,1360-0478,,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

These responses are common in aquatic organisms and are particularly notable in larval anurans, which tend to develop deeper tails under sit-and-wait macroinvertebrate predation threat. Although trade-offs between defense and growth have been well-studied, trade-offs with internal organ sizes have rarely been considered. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of predation and competition on trade-offs associated with total length (body + tail), tail size and internal organ size (gut, pancreas, liver and fat body) in two larval anurans, red-eyed treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) and gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor). In two separate experiments, we reared larvae in outdoor mesocosms with and without competition in the presence and absence of a caged predator. We subsampled larvae from each mesocosm and measured tail and internal organ sizes. Both competition and predation exerted strong effects on total length and morphology, although each experiment produced unique results. Competition increased gut size in both species, supporting a previously reported trade-off between gut and tail size. Competition also reduced total length in both experiments: Gray treefrogs balanced total length with lipid deposition, and red-eyed treefrogs favored total length at the expense of lipid reserves. Predation threat elicited an increase in tail depth but a reduction in tail muscle size in gray treefrogs, which may have allowed larvae to maintain pancreas size and total length. Conversely, red-eyed treefrogs developed larger tails with more muscle area, allocating resources in a way that sacrificed both liver and pancreas size, as well as total length. Although the specific tail response was different, both species prioritized larger guts over tail modifications when faced with both competition and predation, as large gut sizes were maintained in competitive environments even when predators were present.","[Neptune, T.

The invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridisPallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is implicated in declines of native ladybirds with intraguild predation identified as an underlying mechanism, however, less studied are the effects on non-coccinellid predators. Intraguild predation between Anthocoris nemoralisFabricius (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) and H. axyridis and the relative effects of inter- and intraspecific competition on predators on potted Tilia cordata Mill. was investigated, at two aphid densities. 2. Intraguild predation was unidirectional in favour of H. axyridis in Petri dishes although a low level of ladybird egg predation by A. nemoralis occurred. However, on trees intraguild predation was rare. 3. A positive effect of aphid density on H. axyridis weight gain, and increased survival when reared with A. nemoralis on potted trees indicated stronger effects of intraspecific competition on H. axyridis. Consistent suppression of aphids by ladybirds revealed their superior competition for aphids. 4. Anthocoris nemoralis weight gain was reduced when reared with H. axyridis on potted trees, indicating a potential for a sublethal effect through interspecific competition. Survivorship of A. nemoralis did not differ between con- and heterospecific treatments, but high aphid density enhanced A. nemoralis survival. Overall, high mortality among nymphs across treatments suggested effects related to both inter- and intraspecific competition for resources. 5. Results provide evidence of a sublethal effect by invasive H. axyridis through resource competition, suggesting that where these predators co-occur, competitive interactions for shared prey are more likely to affect A. nemoralis populations than intraguild predation by H. axyridis.","[Howe, Andy G.; Ravn, Hans P.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Ransijn, Johannes] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Disturbance Ecol, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany","Howe, AG (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",andy@ign.ku.dk,"Howe, Andy G./A-8259-2015","Howe, Andy G./0000-0002-7460-5227",University of Copenhagen; Villum Fonden,"We thank four anonymous reviewers for their insightful suggestions to improve an earlier version.

In long-lived plants, however, lifetime patterns and mechanisms of density dependence are difficult to study. Here, we examine effects of intraspecific and community density on the lifetime fecundity of two long-lived shrub species from South African Fynbos: Protea repens (animal-pollinated, hermaphroditic) and Leucadendron rubrum (wind-pollinated, dioecious). Both species are serotinous, retaining seeds in cones until fire kills the mother plant. We measured lifetime fecundity as the product of cone number, proportion of cones that are not damaged by predation and seed set (fertile seeds per intact cone). Intraspecific and community densities were quantified by counting individuals of target species and all Proteaceae in small- and large-scale neighbourhoods (10 m and 50 m radius) around each focal individual. Additionally, we determined the age and size of focal individuals. We found that lifetime fecundity of the wind-pollinated L rubrum is density independent. In contrast, the lifetime fecundity of the animal-pollinated P. repens increases with large-scale intraspecific density and shows a hump-shaped relationship to large-scale community density. Community density has a hump-shaped effect on seed set (probably through partial absence of generalized pollinators at low and competition for pollinators at high densities) and negatively affects cone number per individual. For both species, plant age decreases seed set while increasing lifetime fecundity. The qualitative differences in the density dependence of lifetime fecundity may arise from differences between animal and wind pollination. In particular, interactions with generalized animal pollinators may cause community-level Allee effects with profound consequences for the future dynamics of long-lived plant populations and communities.

We examine interactions between the introduced New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) and native estuarine invertebrates and predators through experiments and field studies. A widely held management concern is that when P. antipodarum, which has low nutritional value, becomes abundant, it replaces nutritious prey in fish diets. We tested two key components of this view: (1) that fish consume, but get little direct nutritional value from P. antipodarum; and (2) that P. antipodarum has an indirect negative effect on fish by reducing the energy derived from native prey. We also examined predation by the native signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus. Laboratory feeding trials showed that both crayfish and fish consume P. antipodarum, a direct effect. Crayfish consumed and successfully digested higher numbers of snails than did fish [Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus), three spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and juvenile starry flounder (Platicthys stellatus)]. P. antipodarum occurred at low frequencies in the stomachs of wild-caught fish. More interesting were the indirect effects of this invader, which ran counter to predictions. P. antipodarum presence was associated with no change or an increase in the amount of energy derived from native prey by predators. The presence of P. antipodarum also led to increased consumption of and preference for the native amphipod Americorophium salmonis over the native isopod Gnorimosphaeroma insulare. This is an example of short-term, asymmetric, apparent competition, in which the presence of one prey species (snails) increases predation on another prey species (the amphipod).","[Brenneis, Valance E.

Because the results are difficult to transfer to natural conditions, the major purpose of this study was to test the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on tadpole populations in a natural environment. We stocked six ponds, created the previous year, with known numbers of Rana esculenta and R. lessonae tadpoles and followed their development over several months. When compared among ponds, tadpole density correlated positively with the nitrate:phosphate ratio. This suggests that water chemistry may have affected survival, either directly or indirectly via productivity. Within ponds, both species showed a clear preference for the shallow zone. This behavior probably reflects a preference for warm water close to the surface, rather than avoidance of predators, because relative densities of odonates also increased from deep to shallow zones. This study is one of few that not only considers the distribution of the anuran tadpoles but the distribution of their predators as well.","Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Reyer, HU (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,45,16,17,0,14,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0173-5373,,,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,Amphib.

Species invasions are a leading threat to native species and ecosystems. How populations of native species respond to the presence of invasive species will ultimately determine their long-term persistence. 2. In this study, we capitalise on a unique opportunity to compare the behaviour and growth of naive and experienced virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis Hagen) populations in the presence of invasive rusty crayfish (O. rusticus Girard). In behavioural trials, experienced O. virilis (coexisted with O. rusticus for > 30 years) showed more aggressive behaviour than their naive counterparts. Naive O. virilis retreated from aggressive interactions with O. rusticus 38% more often than experienced O. virilis. Experienced O. virilis spent 39% more time occupying shelter than naive O. virilis. 3. There were also differences in O. rusticus behaviour: O. rusticus spent 24% more time occupying shelter with naive O. virilis relative to experienced O. virilis. 4. In field mesocosm experiments with O. rusticus, naive O. virilis declined in body mass by 1% while experienced O. virilis' body mass increased by 6%, thus highlighting the potential population-level implications of the previously observed behavioural effects. 5. Our work demonstrates significant behaviour and growth differences between naive and experienced O. virilis in the presence of invasive O. rusticus. Whether this difference is the result of phenotypic plasticity or evolution by natural selection remains to be determined. Either way, this area of inquiry has implications for managing native populations and species in an increasingly invaded world.","[Hayes, Nicole M.; Butkas, Katrina J.; Vander Zanden, M.

However, others have reported results to the contrary and it remains unresolved what factors trigger, inhibit, and modulate fish-waterbird interactions. The present study was designed to test the effect of fish presence per se, with a minimum of variation in possibly confounding environmental variables. Thus, after stratifying for area, depth, altitude, pH, and total phosphorus we compared 13 lakes with and 12 without fish (mainly pike Esox lucius and perch Perca fluviatilis) with respect to (i) general species richness of waterbirds, (ii) species-specific utilization and breeding success of two dabbling ducks (mallard Anas platyrhynchos and teal Anas crecca) and a diving duck (goldeneye Bucephala clangula). General species richness of waterbirds was higher on fishless lakes. Overall use (bird days) and brood number of teal and goldeneye were higher on fishless lakes. The latter also had more benthic and free-swimming prey invertebrates compared to lakes with fish. Mallard use, mallard brood number, and abundance of emerging insects did not differ between lake groups. Generalized linear models including fish presence as factor and considering seven environmental variables as covariates, confirmed that all waterbird variables except mallard days and broods were negatively correlated to fish presence. There was also a residual positive relationship of lake area on general species richness, teal days, and teal broods. Our data demonstrate a stronger effect of fish presence on diving ducks and small surface feeding ducks than on large surface-feeding ducks. We argue that observed patterns were caused by fish predation on ducks rather than by fish-duck competition for common prey.","[Elmberg, Johan; Dessborn, Lisa] Kristianstad Univ, S-29188 Kristianstad, Sweden; [Dessborn, Lisa] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Englund, Goran] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Elmberg, J (corresponding author), Kristianstad Univ, S-29188 Kristianstad, Sweden.",Johan.Elmberg@hkr.se,"Elmberg, Johan/H-1868-2014","Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [V-162-05, V-98-04]; Swedish Research Council for Environment and Agricultural Sciences and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas","Per Wedholm, Stina Gustavsson, Jenny Lund, Joakim Norberg, Patrik Olofsson and Daniel Lussetti skilfully carried out the field work.

We investigated the impact of a predatory species of invasive ant, Pheidole megacephala, on the structure and function of a foundational mutualism between Acacia drepanolobium and its associated acacia-ant community in an East African savanna. Invasion by P. megacephala was associated with the extirpation of three extrafloral nectar-dependent Crematogaster acacia ant species and strong increases in the abundance of a competitively subordinate and locally rare acacia ant species, Tetraponera penzigi, which does not depend on host plant nectar. Using a combination of long-term monitoring of invasion dynamics, observations and experiments, we demonstrate that P. megacephala directly and indirectly facilitates T. penzigi by reducing the abundance of T. penzigi's competitors (Crematogaster spp.), imposing recruitment limitation on these competitors, and generating a landscape of low-reward host plants that favor colonization and establishment by the strongly dispersing T. penzigi. Seasonal variation in use of host plants by P. megacephala may further increase the persistence of T. penzigi colonies in invaded habitat. The persistence of the T. penzigi-A. drepanolobium symbiosis in invaded areas afforded host plants some protection against herbivory by elephants (Loxodonta africana), a key browser that reduces tree cover. However, elephant damage on T. penzigi-occupied trees was higher in invaded than in uninvaded areas, likely owing to reduced T. penzigi colony size in invaded habitats. Our results reveal the mechanisms underlying the disruption of this mutualism and suggest that P. megacephala invasion may drive long-term declines in tree cover, despite the partial persistence of the ant-acacia symbiosis in invaded areas.","[Palmer, Todd M.; Milligan, Patrick D.; Pietrek, Alejandro G.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA; [Palmer, Todd M.; Milligan, Patrick D.; Hays, Brandon R.; Pietrek, Alejandro G.; Goheen, Jacob R.] Mpala Res Ctr, Box 555, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Riginos, Corinna] Nature Conservancy, Lander, WY 82520 USA; [Riginos, Corinna; Hays, Brandon R.; Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Pietrek, Alejandro G.] Inst Bio Geociencias NOA IBIGEO, Salta, Argentina; [Maiyo, Nelly J.; Mutisya, Samuel; Gituku, Benard] Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Conservat Dept, Private Bag 10400, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Musila, Simon] Natl Museums Kenya, Mammal Sect, Nairobi, Kenya; [Carpenter, Scott] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Palmer, TM (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA.; Palmer, TM (corresponding author), Mpala Res Ctr, Box 555, Nanyuki, Kenya.",tmp@ufl.edu,,,U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF DEB 1556905];  [NACOSTI/P/19/4563/30035],"We thank the excellent management and staff at Ol Pejeta Conservancy for their capable assistance with the construction, maintenance and logistics associated with this project.

In contrast, there are few studies of snails and their predators in shallow ponds and marshes. Ponds often lack fish and crayfish but have abundant insect populations. Here we present the results of field surveys, laboratory foraging trials, and an outdoor mesocosm experiment, testing the hypothesis that insects are important predators of pulmonate snails. In laboratory foraging trials, conducted with ten species of insects, most insect taxa. consumed snails, and larval dragonflies were especially effective predators. The field surveys showed that dragonflies constitute the majority of the insect biomass in fishless ponds. More focused foraging trials evaluated the ability of the dragonflies Anax junius and Pantala hymenaea to prey upon different sizes and species of pulmonate snails (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta, and Stagnicola elodes). Anax junius consumed all three species up to the maximum size tested. Pantala hymenaea consumed snails with a shell height of 3 mm and smaller, but did not kill larger snails. P. acuta were more vulnerable to predators than were H. trivolvis or S. elodes. In the mesocosm experiment, conducted with predator treatments of A. junius, P. hymenaea, and the hemipteran Belostoma flumineum, insect predators had a pronounced negative effect on snail biomass and density. A. junius and B. flumineum reduced biomass and density to a similar degree, and both reduced biomass more than did P. hymenaea. Predators did not have a strong effect on species composition. A model suggested that A. junius and P. hymenaea have the largest effects on snail biomass in the field. Given that both pulmonate snails and dragonfly nymphs are widespread and abundant in marshes and ponds, snail assemblages in these water bodies are likely regulated in large part by odonate predation.","Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA","Turner, AM (corresponding author), Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA.",aturner@clarion.edu,,,,,,47,33,36,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2007,153,2,,,,,407,415,,10.1007/s00442-007-0736-9,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,205YD,WOS:000249150200020,17457617,,,,2021-09-27,

Unlike other top ant invaders that negatively affect larger fauna via chemical defensive compounds, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) does not have a functional sting. Nonetheless, it deploys defensive compounds against competitors and adversaries. We estimated levels of ant aggression toward 3 native terrestrial amphibians by challenging juveniles in field ant trails and in lab ant foraging arenas. We measured the composition and quantities of toxin inL. humileby analyzing pygidial glands and whole-body contents. We examined the mechanisms of toxicity in juvenile amphibians by quantifying the toxin in amphibian tissues, searching for histological damages, and calculating toxic doses for each amphibian species. To determine the potential scope of the threat to amphibians, we used global databases to estimate the number, ranges, and conservation status of terrestrial amphibian species with ranges that overlap those ofL. humile. Juvenile amphibians co-occurring spatially and temporally withL. humiledie when they encounterL. humileon an ant trail. In the lab, when a juvenile amphibian came in contact withL. humilethe ants reacted quickly to spray pygidial-gland venom onto the juveniles. Iridomyrmecin was the toxic compound in the spray. Following absorption, it accumulated in brain, kidney, and liver tissue. Toxic dose for amphibian was species dependent. Worldwide, an estimated 817 terrestrial amphibian species overlap in range withL. humile, and 6.2% of them are classified as threatened. Our findings highlight the high potential ofL. humilevenom to negatively affect amphibian juveniles and provide a basis for exploring the largely overlooked impacts this ant has in its wide invasive range.","[Alvarez-Blanco, Paloma; Cerda, Xim; Berto-Moran, Alejandro; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Christoph Liedtke, H.; Angulo, Elena] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Avda Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Hefetz, Abraham] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Boulay, Raphael; Lenoir, Alain] Univ Tours, Inst Rech Biol Insecte, CNRS, UMR 7261, Parc Grandmont, F-37200 Tours, France; [Billen, Johan] Dept Biol, Lab Socioecol & Social Evolut, Naamsestr 59,Box 2466, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Chauhan, Kamlesh R.; Bhagavathy, Ganga] ARS, USDA, BLDG 007,10300 Baltimore Blvd, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","Angulo, E (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Avda Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",elenaanguloaguado@gmail.com,"Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014; Angulo, Elena/AAF-8524-2020","Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471; Angulo, Elena/0000-0001-5545-4032","MINECO [BES-2013-064713, EEBB-I-15-09870, CGL2012-36181, CGL2013-43660-P]; Norman and Rose Lederrer Endowed Chair of Biology; FEDEREuropean Commission [CGL2012-36181, CGL2013-43660-P]; EBD (MINECO Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in R + D + I) [SEV-2012-0262]","We thank I.

Both competition and defense can reduce feeding opportunities, or otherwise strain prey energy reserves, even when the prey is not killed. This suggests that stress from competition and anti-predator defense might yield non-lethal harm that differs quantitatively rather than qualitatively. We examined this possibility for an herbivorous prey species, the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), feeding among differing numbers of intraspecific competitors while also avoiding predation by Nabis alternatus and Hippodamia convergens. In a field cage experiment, predators and intraspecific competitors similarly reduced the herbivores' larval survival. Yet, only exposure to predators heightened the risk of beetles later being killed by entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi, as the beetles pupated in the soil. This suggests that the threat of predation was exerting physiological harm to the prey, although it was also possible that a tradeoff existed where those beetles most resistant to predator attack were most susceptible to pathogen infection. In a second experiment, we found that regular touching of larvae by predatory Nabis or Hippodamia, in the absence of actual predation, consistently induced predator-avoidance behaviors by the larvae (e.g., rearing, vomiting, wiggling, etc.) that might be energetically costly. Indeed, only being touched by predators, but not by a wooden dowel as a disturbance control, led to greater susceptibility to entomopathogens as pupae. Altogether, our findings suggest that non-lethal interactions with predators might carry a particular cost to beetles in heightened pathogen susceptibility, not seen when facing competitors or simple disturbance. Additional work is needed to determine the specific physiological mechanism underlying this apparent synergism in the effects of predators and entomopathogens, which spans prey life stages.","[Miller, Tina; Crowder, David W.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Crossley, Michael S.; Meier, Amanda R.; Snyder, William E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Fu, Zhen] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Snyder, WE (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",wesnyder@uga.edu,,,USDA NIFA Organic Research and Education Initiative program [2015-51300-24155]; USDA NIFA Specialty Crops Research Initiative grant [2015-51181-24292],Preparation of this manuscript was supported by USDA NIFA Organic Research and Education Initiative program grant 2015-51300-24155 and Specialty Crops Research Initiative grant 2015-51181-24292.

These two hypotheses were experimentally tested in outdoor mesocosms with two Daphnia species of different body sizes grown in the absence or presence of fish that were allowed to feed for 2-3 h each evening. While each Daphnia quickly reached high density with reproduction halted by food limitation in the absence of fish, the populations stayed at much lower species-specific density levels, similar in low and high food concentrations, in the presence of fish. This suggests that our model offers a reasonable mechanistic explanation for the coexistence of large- and small-bodied zooplankton in proportions reflecting their body sizes throughout habitats comprising a wide productivity spectrum, with each species at a density level at which it becomes included in a predator's diet.","[Gliwicz, Z.

Understanding the factors underlying the abundance and distribution of species requires the consideration of a complex suite of interacting biotic and abiotic factors operating on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Larval mosquitoes inhabiting small human-constructed ponds represent a unique opportunity to investigate the relative importance of these structuring mechanisms while simultaneously generating applied knowledge on mosquito control. 2. A multi-year field survey of 32 stormwater ponds was conducted in central Illinois (Champaign County). From each pond, data were collected on pond structure type and hydroperiod, the presence/absence of cattails (Typha spp.), and measures of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon, and chlorophyll a. The communities of crustacean zooplankton and aquatic insects were characterised, and these taxa were assigned into two main groups: predators and competitors of larval mosquitoes. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the direct and indirect effects of these biotic and abiotic factors on larval density for three species of culicine mosquitoes (Culex pipiens, Culex restuans, and Aedes vexans). 3. Hydroperiod had an indirect negative effect on C. pipiens density. However, this effect was mediated by predator density; more permanent ponds had more predators, which therefore reduced the density of C. pipiens larvae. Aedes vexans density was positively correlated with predator density. No predictor variables were found that explained variation in C. restuans density. 4. This study show that the relative importance of these biotic and abiotic factors varies among species of culicine mosquitoes inhabiting stormwater ponds.","[Holmes, Christopher J.; Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Holmes, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave,515 Morrill Hall,MC-122, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cholmes@life.illinois.edu,,"Holmes, Christopher/0000-0003-3981-0759","United States National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1754115]; University of Illinois Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment; Department of Animal Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; School of Integrative Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","We first thank Andrew J.

We tested experimentally for interactions between mosquito larvae, Culiseta longiareolata, and green toad immatures, Bufo viridis, the two most abundant macrospecies of temporary pools in the Negev Desert, Israel. Since both appear to feed largely on periphyton, and since they co-occur in extremely high densities, competition for food may occur. 2. In artificial outdoor pools, we followed the fate of first-instar Culiseta larvae (50 per litre) and early-stage tadpoles (5 per litre) in the presence or absence of the other species over 1 month. These densities were well within the range of densities found in natural pools. We replicated each treatment five times. 3. Survival of neither species was affected by the other species. However, time to pupation in Culiseta was longer and pupal size was smaller in the presence of Bufo tadpoles. Similarly, tadpole weights were lower and the percentage of Bufo reaching metamorphosis by the end of the experiment was lower in the presence of Culiseta larvae. We attribute these mutual negative effects upon each other to interspecific competition. 4. Late-stage Culiseta larvae also preyed upon Bufo hatchlings in both field enclosure and laboratory experiments. This is the first demonstration of a mosquito larva as a natural predator of a vertebrate. The high predation rates indicate that Culiseta affects Bufo populations significantly via predation in nature. 5. These two surprising roles of a mosquito larva-a competitor and predator of a vertebrate-emphasize that how communities are organized may be misinterpreted by presuming particular roles for species based on taxonomic affiliation.","BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,BIOL CONTROL LAB,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL; UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUNITY ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","BLAUSTEIN, L (corresponding author), UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,COMMUNITY ECOL LAB,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,58,53,63,2,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Therefore, it can be predicted that certain species reduce aquaculture performance. Herein, the allelopathic ability of 123 different taxa of green, red, and brown algae have been summarized based on literature reports. Research on macroalgae and their allelopathic effects on other animal organisms was conducted primarily in Australia, Mexico, and the United States. Nevertheless, there are also several scientific reports in this field from South America and Asia; the study areas in the latter continents coincide with areas where aquaculture is highly developed and widely practiced. Therefore, the allelopathic activity of macroalgae on coexisting animals is an issue that is worth careful investigation. In this work, we characterize the distribution of allelopathic macroalgae and compare them with aquaculture locations, describe the methods for the study of macroalgal allelopathy, present the taxonomic position of allelopathic macroalgae and their impact on coexisting aquatic competitors (Cnidaria) and herbivores (Annelida, Echinodermata, Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Chordata), and compile information on allelopathic compounds produced by different macroalgae species.

Yearly population estimates of the green oak leaf roller moth, Tortrix viridana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and the winter moth, Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), were taken from the pedunculate oak, Quercus robur, from 1951 to 1966 in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, U.K. Larval mortality from parasitoids was recorded for both species over the same period. 2. Operophtera brumata population density fluctuated around a constant mean, whereas I viridana population density exhibited a linear decline over the sampling period. Population counts were subjected to time-series analysis after the linear decline was removed from the T. viridana data by detrending. Multiple regression models were built so that variation in the per capita rate of increase of each population could be partitioned among (a) current and previous population density, (b) current and previous population density of the second moth species, and (c) rates of larval parasitism. 3. Multiple regression analysis suggested that variation in the per capita rate of increase of O. brumata could be explained by negative feedback from O. brumata density at T-2 (32%), a negative relationship with I viridana density at T-l (18%), and a positive relationship with parasitism suffered by I viridana at T-l (24%). 4. The I viridana population time-series was dominated by a rapid feedback process such that per capita rate of increase at time T was negatively related to population density at time T-l, explaining 53% of variance in population growth rate. Per capita rate of increase was unrelated to larval parasitism or densities of O. brumata. 5. In light of previous life-table and experimental studies on O. brumata and I viridana, the current analyses suggest that pupal predation (data not presented) and interspecific competition are significant determinants of O. brumata population growth rates in Wytham Woods. In contrast, T. viridana population growth rates appear to be dominated by rapid negative feedback consistent with intraspecific competition.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Hunter, MD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",mhunter@sparc.ecology.uga.edu,,,,,,28,14,16,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

A long-term field experiment to determine what forces structure and maintain the large-bodied zooplankton assemblages in ponds which lack visual predators was undertaken at the Toolik Lake Research Station in arctic Alaska. Predatory copepods, Heterocope septentrionalis, were introduced to a pond that lacked both fish and invertebrate predators, but contained small- to medium-sized zooplankton, Bosmina longirostris, Daphnia pulex, and Diaptomus pribilofensis. A second pond, which also lacked any predators but had a population of B. longirostris, but no other abundant species, served as a reference population for B. longirostris. 2. The introduction of H. septentrionalis caused the extinction of D. pulex within 1 year and drove B. longirostris to extremely low densities within 4 years. The population of B. longirostris in the reference pond fluctuated throughout the study period, but remained above five individuals per litre. This experiment demonstrates that H. septentrionalis, under natural conditions, made a numerical response to abundant prey and had the capacity to eliminate or reduce vulnerable prey populations of small- to medium-sized zooplankton.","Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","O'Brien, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",wjob@falcon.cc.ukans.edu,,,,,,37,16,16,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Reciprocal facilitation by associates, often involving multiple species, can be important for the maintenance of the host species. As with other multi-species interactions (e.g. multiple predator effects), non-additive relationships may be common among these associates, yet relatively few studies have examined potential interactions among multiple facilitator species. We combined field surveys and a mesocosm experiment to examine the independent and interactive effects of two co-occurring facilitator species, ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa and fiddler crabs Uca pugilator, on their host salt marsh plant species, cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. We also experimentally examined how these relationships varied across different host plant genotypes. Overall, facilitator effects increased with increasing facilitator density. There was a significant interaction between mussel and fiddler crab presence, indicating that the effects of each species on cordgrass were dependent on the presence of the other facilitator species. In addition, there were strong interactions among mussels, fiddler crabs, and plant genotype, with greater variation in the performance of individual genotypes when fiddler crabs were absent. Our work reinforces the importance of considering multiple responses when assessing the functional redundancy of co-occurring facilitators, as species are seldom completely redundant across the range of services they provide. It also highlights that the strength and direction of species interactions can vary due to genetic variation within the interacting species.","[Hughes, A.

We have excluded vertebrate predators (raptors and mammalian carnivores), and larger small mammal herbivore/competitors (i.e., degus, Octodon degus) from replicated 0.56-ha plots, and monitored small mammal population and plant responses over more than ten years. Repeated measures ANOVAs on minimum number known alive (MNKA) estimates of small mammals for a six-year period (1990-1996) spanning an El Nino event in 1991-1992 showed strong responses of some species to predator exclusions (e.g., O. degus; Darwin's leaf-eared mouse, Phyllotis darwini; the chinchilla-rat, Abrocoma bennetti). However, responses varied in time with significant effects during pre-El Nino (1990-1992) and El Nino (1992-1994) periods (i.e., 0. degus), or pre-El Nino and post-El Nino (1994-1996) periods (P. darwini. A. bennetti). Other species showed no responses to predator exclusions (e.g., olivaceous field mouse, Akodon olivaceus; long-haired field mouse, Abrothrix longipilis; long-tailed rice rat, Oligoryzomys longi caudatus). Some effects of competitor (degu) exclusions were detected (e.g., A. bennetti during the El Nino and post-El Nino periods; O. longicatrrlntus during the El Nino). Top-down, factors (i.e., biotic interactions) appear to have greater effects on core species (i.e., P. darwini, O. degus) which persist in the thorn scrub. Other species (e.g., A. longipilis, O. longicaudatus) are transitory residents or opportunistic with lesser effects of biotic interactions, and their populations may be controlled by source-sink dynamics.

However, temperature and prey abundance are other factors that could be affecting Cercopagis. First, we examined all these factors on Cercopagis population abundance, life history traits and spatio-temporal distribution. In addition, we examined vertical spatial overlap between these species and determined predation rate of Bythotrephes on Cercopagis. Linear mixed effects analysis of spatial-temporal data showed that biomass of B. longimanus had the strongest effect, which was significantly negative on biomass, proportion of fecund females and mean clutch size of Cercopagis. Fecundity increased significantly with density of potential prey zooplankton, whereas Cercopagis total biomass increased significantly with the mean epilimnion temperature. Cercopagis and Bythotrephes overlapped vertically in the epi- and metalimnion, and neither of them showed any appreciable diel vertical migration. In predation experiments, Bythotrephes consumed Cercopagis at the same rate as Daphnia mendotae, a known preferred prey, when offered at equal concentrations. Overall, this observation, together with vertical overlap of Cercopagis with Bythotrephes implies that Bythotrephes predation has a strong influence on Cercopagis distribution; however, prey availability, temperature, and competition may be important secondary factors. These results imply that invasion success of Cercopagis may be limited by prior invasion by Bythotrephes. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Juvenile C. maenas utilize rocks, shell, and other cover, and their arrival on the west coast places them in potential competition for these resources with an abundant native grapsid, H. oregonensis, Similarly, H, sanguineus use intertidal shelter on the east coast, thus placing C. maenas in possible competition with grapsids both as an invader on the west coast and as 'resident' on the east coast, having been established there for more than 150 yr. Field sampling and laboratory experiments testing competition for space between C. maenas and Hemigrapsus spp. of equal carapace width were conducted on both coasts, as were videotaped feeding trials to examine and quantify agonistic interactions between species. When competing for food (a single damaged, anchored bivalve), C. maenas dominated over H. oregonensis, while H. sanguineus were overwhelmingly dominant over C. maenas. Within-quadrat, stratified sampling of rocks and sand revealed striking differences in habitat utilization by C. maenas living in the presence or absence of Hemigrapsus, Only similar to20% of juvenile C. maenas occurred under rocks in areas occupied by either Hemigrapsus species, while north of the present distribution of H. sanguineus (in Maine) >97% of the C. maenas were found beneath rocks. This pattern was reflected in laboratory trials as well, where both species of Hemigrapsus consistently dominated in contests for shelter. Given the importance of intertidal cover for small crabs, such competitive interactions will likely affect patterns of habitat use by C. maenas on the east coast and may have important implications for the ultimate distribution and impact of this species in the northeastern Pacific.","Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Jensen, GC (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",gjensen@u.washington.edu,,,,,,77,125,130,1,99,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

A field study was conducted to: (i) assess feeding habit changes of two predatory stoneflies following the loss of larval black fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) prey from two streams; and (ii) determine the relative importance of black fly larvae as prey for these and other selected predatory benthic macroinvertebrates. 2. Acroneuria lycorias and Paragnetina media (Plecoptera: Perlidae) diets were monitored in response to local reductions in larval black fly populations caused by Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (B.t.i.) in two Michigan streams. These predators were collected from B.t.i.-treated and control sections of the streams, and their foreguts inspected for prey. 3. Black flies were the major dietary component of both predators collected from the control sections, but the number of black flies ingested was significantly less for predators collected from B.t.i.-treated habitats. Total number of prey ingested significantly decreased for A. lycorias, but not for P. media, and non-black fly prey consumption significantly increased for P. media, but not for A. lycorias, following B.t.i. applications. 4. In prey choice trials conducted in experimental channels, A. lycorias and P. media showed no preference between prey types (black flies and mayflies). Body mass gain of individual A. lycorias nymphs was measured, and was similar for nymphs in black fly-rich and black fly-poor environments. Conversely, Isoperla signata and I. dicala (Plecoptera: Perlodidae) ingested significantly more Simulium vittatum (Diptera: Simuliidae) than Baetis flavistriga (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) or Epeorus vitrea (Heptageniidae) prey. Boyeria vinosa (Odonata: Aeshnidae) ingested significantly more B. flavistriga than S. vittatum prey. 5. Reducing black fly densities in these streams, using B.t.i., indirectly and differentially affected predators. In black fly-poor environments, feeding habits of specialist predators were most affected, and generalist predators least affected because the latter consumed alternative prey. Predator-predator and predator-prey interactions, and prey community structure may be affected indirectly by disturbances such as B.t.i. applications by reducing food resources and forcing predation onto less preferred prey.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,E LANSING,MI 48824",,,,,,,,31,21,21,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

This is especially true for animals recruiting in patchy landscapes because heterogeneity in habitat quality in combination with habitat choice can obscure patterns expected from density dependence. Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) typically experience strong density dependence when larvae compete for food, however, effects vary across species and contexts. If populations experience intense intraspecific density-dependent mortality then overcompensation can occur, where the number of survivors declines at high densities producing complex endogenous dynamics. To seek generalizations about density dependence in a widespread species of Arctic mosquito, Aedes nigripes, we combined a laboratory experiment, field observations, and modeling approaches. We evaluated alternative formulations of discrete population models and compared best-performing models from our lab study to larval densities from ponds in western Greenland. Survivorship curves from the lab were the best fit by a Hassell model with compensating density dependence (equivalent to a Beverton-Holt model) where peak recruitment ranged from 8 to 80 mosquitoes per liter depending on resource supply. In contrast, our field data did not show a signal of strong density dependence, suggesting that other processes such as predation may lower realized densities in nature, and that expected patterns may be obscured because larval abundance covaries with resources (cryptic density dependence). Our study emphasizes the importance of covariation between the environment, habitat choice, and density dependence in understanding population dynamics across landscapes, and demonstrates the value of pairing lab and field studies.","[DeSiervo, Melissa H.; Ayres, Matthew P.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Culler, Lauren E.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Environm Studies, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Ayres, Matthew P.; Culler, Lauren E.] Dartmouth Coll, Dickey Ctr Int Understanding, Inst Arctic Studies, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [DeSiervo, Melissa H.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82072 USA","DeSiervo, MH (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.; DeSiervo, MH (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82072 USA.",mdesierv@uwyo.edu,,"DeSiervo, Melissa/0000-0002-6373-025X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0801490, 1506155, 1748137]; Dickey Center for International Understanding (McCullough fellowship)","This study was supported by three National Science Foundation awards to LEC and MPA (#0801490, #1506155, #1748137).

In an effort to improve our understanding of the life history characters that facilitated this unprecedented invasion, we performed a mark-release-recapture study with 36 tagged individuals to document life history characteristics of the Red Sea lionfish, Pterois miles, in its native habitat. Monthly growth rates of juveniles ranged from 4.0 to 10.8mmmonth(-1) independent of water temperature. Highest juvenile growth rates (>9.0mmmonth(-1)) occurred between May and August when water temperature increased from 22.5 to 28.0 degrees C, while growth rates dropped sharply between August and September when water temperature was consistently high. Adult lionfish had relatively constant growth rates of 4-6mmmonth(-1). Despite high site fidelity of some individuals, recapture success gradually declined from 83 to 3% during the 15-month study period. Thus, the consistent population density of 95 fish ha(-1) likely reflected a well-balanced exchange of individuals with adjacent reef habitats. To identify biotic constraints that may limit native lionfish populations, interactions with seven potential predatory and/or competitive grouper species were also investigated. Significantly, fewer lionfish were encountered in micro-habitats, where the Red Sea groupers Aethaloperca rogaa and Cephalopholis miniata resided. In addition, the presence of large groupers (>250mm TL) was significantly correlated with reduced numbers of lionfish, while small groupers (250mm TL) appeared to have no impact. Our field observations suggest that the biotic interactions (e.g., habitat competition, and depredation) between grouper species and lionfish may play a role in lionfish distribution. This study provides new insights into the growth and ecology of lionfish in their native habitats to help illuminate links to their documented success in the invaded range.","[Bos, Arthur R.] Amer Univ Cairo, Dept Biol, New Cairo 11835, Egypt; [Bos, Arthur R.; Sanad, Ashraf M.] Amer Univ Cairo, John D Gerhart Field Stn, El Gouna, Egypt; [Bos, Arthur R.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Grubich, Justin R.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Chicago, IL 66005 USA; [Sanad, Ashraf M.] Scuba House Red Sea, Hurghada, Egypt","Bos, AR (corresponding author), Amer Univ Cairo, Dept Biol, New Cairo 11835, Egypt.; Bos, AR (corresponding author), Amer Univ Cairo, John D Gerhart Field Stn, El Gouna, Egypt.; Bos, AR (corresponding author), Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",arbos@aucegypt.edu,"Bos, Arthur R./H-3090-2019","Bos, Arthur R./0000-0002-0708-314X",American University in CairoAmerican University Cairo,Expenses for preliminary field observations were partly covered by an internal research grant from the American University in Cairo (granted to A.R.

In central Oklahoma, two species of predaceous, pit-building ant lion larvae (Myrmeleon immaculatus and M. crudelis) coexist in a narrow, high-density (> 50 animals/m2) zone at the base of sandstone cliffs, where they are sheltered from rain and afternoon sun. Although larval movement is frequent and abundance within the zone varies seasonally, ant lions are rarely found > 2 m from the cliff base. I used field experiments and observations to test four hypotheses that could explain the maintenance of the ant lion zone: (1) zonation because of habitat availability; (2) zonation because of food availability; (3) zonation because of increased surface temperatures in exposed microhabitats; (4) zonation because of increased soil moisture and disturbance in exposed microhabitats. Ant lions are probably not limited to the cliffbase by the presence of rocks or vegetation, because there was no correlation between ant lion density and available habitat. The availability of prey also does not appear to limit ant lion distribution: ant abundance in pitfall traps was significantly higher outside the ant lion zone than within. Outside the ant lion zone, soil surface temperatures reach lethal levels in the afternoon sun. However, third-instar larvae of M. immaculatus transplanted in dry, sifted soil suffered little mortality over a 4-d period. Larvae transplanted into exposed sites gained significantly more mass than larvae transplanted into the ant lion zone, probably because of differences in food availability. Small-scale manipulations within the ant lion zone revealed that ant lion numbers decreased significantly over a 5-d period in response to both moisture (misting) and disturbance (pit-filling). In a recolonization experiment, the recovery time of patches exposed to a single ''rainfall'' treatment was extremely long: defaunated ''rainfall'' patches did not achieve the pit densities of defaunated control patches until after 84 d. Rainfall limits ant lion distribution through an interaction with temperature. Transplant experiments on natural substrata revealed the nature of this interaction. Within the ant lion zone, the soil remains dry and ant lion larvae bury themselves more rapidly in the sun than in the shade. Outside the ant lion zone, rainfall leads to the formation of a persistent soil crust. Larvae are unable to penetrate this crust, and they succumb to high temperatures in the sun. Because both species of ant lions are restricted to a narrow spatial zone, the probability of interspecific and intraspecific interactions (including competition, predation, and cannibalism) is increased. Such interactions may affect the density of both species within the ant lion zone. The abundances of M. crudelis and M. immaculatus were negatively correlated in quadrats from the center of the ant lion zone. Across the ant lion zone, the relative abundance of the two species also differed significantly, although the differences were not consistent among sites. Because of overriding abiotic constraints, neither species can achieve an ideal free distribution with respect to food resources. High-density predator aggregations may also affect prey community structure. Arthropod abundance was low within the ant lion zone, perhaps because of direct predation by ant lions or predator avoidance behavior by prey. Although the ant lion zone is caused by the interaction of abiotic factors, high-density predator aggregations have important biotic consequences for the population dynamics of the predators and the spatial distribution of their prey.","UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA",,,,,,,,48,85,89,0,29,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,226,237,,10.2307/1939517,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500023,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although these 2 concepts are frequently connected in terms of invasive predators and naive prey, other effects of invasive species, such the creation of novel habitats by invasive plants, may also have indirect effects on animal behavior and community dynamics. We used giving-up densities to examine foraging behavior of Peromyscus leucopus in forest habitats that were invaded or uninvaded by the exotic invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii, which forms a novel shrub layer in hickory oak forests in Missouri. We experimentally manipulated the presence or absence of an artificial cover over foraging trays and predicted that rodents would have less of a preference for artificial cover in invaded sites with high densities of invasive shrub cover. We found that the invasive shrub decreased perceived predation risk, but this effect was contingent on other environmental correlates of predation risk (i.e., clear, moonlit nights) and foraging cost (i.e., warm temperatures). Our results demonstrate that invasive plants can change animal behavior, which may benefit the invasive species by causing apparent competition and promoting further invasion. Our results have implications for further behavioral changes that could affect multiple trophic levels and suggest that plant invasions can have cryptic, interactive effects on animal behavior, aside from their commonly studied effects on other plant species.","[Mattos, Kaitlin J.; Orrock, John L.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Orrock, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, 1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",orrock@wustl.edu,,,Washington University,Portions of this work supported by research funds from Washington University.,,55,59,59,1,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Weak interaction and specific non-monotonic interactions have been proposed to be stabilizing mechanisms in maintaining persistence in more complex ecosystems, but it is unclear how they contribute to the high level of biomass or productivity of these systems. In this study, we examined the effects of various interactions, specifically dome-shaped (shifting from positive to negative effect with increase of density) and satiated interactions, on biomass and biomass flow with the increase of complexity in theoretical networks. Our results indicated that, as compared to linear or satiated interactions, dome-shaped interactions maintained both higher persistence and biomass or biomass flow in more complex networks, but resulted in larger variations of species biomass. However, variation of network biomass was much smaller than that of species biomass. Our results suggest that species interaction shifting between mutualism at low density and competition or predation at high density could be a driving force for maintaining high levels of persistence, diversity, biomass and biomass flow in natural ecosystems.","[Yan, Chuan; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31500347, 31330013]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB11050300]; Information Fund of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XHH13506-201]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31500347, 31330013), Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB11050300) and Information Fund of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XHH13506-201).

Here, we examine how the density of an IG predator can affect feeding group size, IG egg predation, and the growth responses of IG prey. We used laboratory feeding trials and outdoor mesocosm experiments to study interactions between a social intraguild predator (larvae of the wood frog; Rana sylvatica) and its prey (spotted salamander; Ambystoma maculatum). Larvae of R. sylvatica could potentially affect A. maculatum by consuming shared larval food resources or by consuming eggs and hatchlings. However, successful egg predation requires group feeding by schooling tadpoles. We established from five to 1,190 hatchlings of R. sylvatica in mesocosms, then added either 20 A. maculatum hatchlings to study interspecific competition, or a single egg mass to examine IGP. Crowding strongly suppressed the growth of R. sylvatica, and IGP was restricted to the egg stage. In the larval competition experiment, growth of A. maculatum was inversely proportional to R. sylvatica density. In the predation experiment, embryonic mortality of A. maculatum was directly proportional to the initial density of R. sylvatica and the mean number of tadpoles foraging on egg masses. IGP on eggs reduced A. maculatum hatchling density, which accelerated larval growth. Surprisingly, the density of R. sylvatica had no overall effect on A. maculatum growth because release from intraspecific competition via egg predation was balanced by increased interspecific competition. Our results demonstrate that the density of a social IG predator can strongly influence the nature and intensity of interactions with a second guild member by simultaneously altering the intensity of IGP and intra- and interspecific competition.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Petranka, JW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Hts, Asheville, NC 28804 USA.",petranka@unca.edu,,,,,,37,17,19,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,641,649,,10.1007/s00442-006-0398-z,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,056OG,WOS:000238533400011,16514532,,,,2021-09-27,

However, predator densities vary in time, and these effects may not be well represented by studies that use constant predator densities. Although studies have independently examined the importance of predator density, temporal variability, and timing of arrival (i.e., early or late relative to prey), the relative contribution of these different predator regimes on prey abundance, diversity, and composition remains poorly understood. The hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), a carnivorous coral reef fish, exhibits substantial variability in patch occupancy, density, and timing of arrival to natural reefs. Our field experiments demonstrated that effects of hawkfish on prey abundance depended on both hawkfish density and the timing of their arrival, but not on variability in hawkfish density. Relative to treatments without hawkfish, hawkfish presence reduced prey abundance by 50%. This effect increased with a doubling of hawkfish density (an additional 33% reduction), and when hawkfish arrived later during community development (a 34% reduction). Hawkfish did not affect within-patch diversity (species richness), but they increased between-patch diversity (beta) based on species incidence (22%), and caused shifts in species composition. Our results suggest that the timing of predator arrival can be as important as predator density in modifying prey abundance and community composition.","[Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Geange, Shane W.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Hanson, Kate M.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Bolker, Benjamin M.] McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Bolker, Benjamin M.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada","Stier, AC (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 4200-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",adrian.stier@gmail.com,,"Hanson, Katharine/0000-0002-3972-8520; Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272; Stier, Adrian/0000-0002-4704-4145; Bolker, Benjamin/0000-0002-2127-0443",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; 3 Seas teaching fellowships; Ocean Bridges; National GeographicNational Geographic Society; Fulbright fellowship; Division Of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1236905] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"Thanks to Z.

A clear prediction of food-based, density-dependent competition for large herbivores is decreasing juvenile survival with increasing density. However, competition for enemy-free space could also be a significant mechanism for density dependence in territorial species. How juvenile survival is predicted to change across density depends critically on the nature of predator-prey dynamics and spatial overlap among predator and prey, especially in multiple-predator systems. Here, we used a management experiment that reduced densities of a generalist predator, coyotes, and specialist predator, mountain lions, over a 5-year period to test for spatial density dependence mediated by predation on juvenile mule deer in Idaho, USA. We tested the spatial density-dependence hypothesis by tracking the fate of 251 juvenile mule deer, estimating cause-specific mortality, and testing responses to changes in deer density and predator abundance. Overall juvenile mortality did not increase with deer density, but generalist coyote-caused mortality did, but not when coyote density was reduced experimentally. Mountain lion-caused mortality did not change with deer density in the reference area in contradiction of the food-based competition hypothesis, but declined in the treatment area, opposite to the pattern of coyotes. These observations clearly reject the food-based density-dependence hypothesis for juvenile mule deer. Instead, our results provide support for the spatial density-dependence hypothesis that competition for enemy-free space increases predation by generalist predators on juvenile large herbivores.","[Hurley, Mark A.] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Boise, ID USA; [Hebblewhite, Mark] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Conservat, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Gaillard, Jean-Michel] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon I, CNRS, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, Villeurbanne, France","Hebblewhite, M (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Conservat, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",mark.hebblewhite@umontana.edu,"hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013","Hebblewhite, Mark/0000-0001-5382-1361; Gaillard, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-0174-8451",Safari Club International Foundation; Idaho Department of Fish and Game; Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration [W-160-R-37]; Mule Deer Foundation; Universite Lyon1; University of Montana,"Safari Club International Foundation; Idaho Department of Fish and Game; Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration, Grant/Award Number: W-160-R-37; Mule Deer Foundation; Universite Lyon1; University of Montana",,59,2,2,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, the mode of their interactions is not known to use these predators together in the field. Hence, we investigated on the possible interactions i.e., cannibalism, intraguild predation (IGP) and competition between the predators in the presence and absence of prey Planococcus citri. In the presence of prey, no cannibalism and predation were observed in both S. epius and C. montrouzieri larvae. A pair of S. epius larvae consumed significantly more number of mealybugs than one S. epius/C. montrouzieri larva or a pair of C. montrouzieri larvae. The predation of S. epius larva by C. montrouzieri larva was significantly more than the predation of C. montrouzieri by S. epius. Conspecific and interspecific egg predation was absent both in S. epius and C. montrouzieri. Cannibalism in C. montrouzieri was more than that in S. epius. The study indicated that C. montrouzieri larvae can be used as an additive along with voracious S. epius larvae under abundant prey population. IGP was asymmetric between the two predators in the absence of prey. Both S. epius and C. montrouzieri larvae can maintain a stable coexistence when prey is abundantly available, however, in the complete absence of prey C. montrouzieri may dominate the guild. This study provides an insight into the possible complex inter- and intraspecific predatory phenomena in the field to use these two predators in the biological control of mealybugs.","[Dinesh, A.

We conducted two experiments to examine priority effects of the Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) on the Upland Chorus Frog (Pseudacris feyiarum). Wood frogs hatch before upland chorus frogs and could potentially function both as intraguild predators and competitors of the latter. In a laboratory experiment, R. sylvatica did not prey on P. feriarum hatchlings that were greater than 1-day old. In a mesocosm experiment in which food level and the density of X sylvatica hatchlings were manipulated, R. sylvatica engaged in stage-structured intraguild predation on egg masses of P. feriarum The number of P. feriarum embryos surviving to hatching was inversely related to the initial density of R. sylvatica, but was independent of food level. Growth rates of P.feriarum hatchlings were inversely related to P, sylvatica density, suggesting strong interspecific competition. Collectively, these results illustrate that the density of an intraguild predator may mediate the strength of both stage-specific intraguild predation and interspecific competition. Our findings suggest that food webs in many seasonal pond communities are more complex than previously thought and need to be revised to incorporate intraguild predation by anurans.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Petranka, JW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Hts, Asheville, NC 28804 USA.",petranka@unca.edu,,,,,,46,8,9,0,21,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 28,2007,,1,,,,,131,139,,10.1643/0045-8511(2007)7[131:IPACMS]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Zoology,Zoology,141YK,WOS:000244614900011,,,,,2021-09-27,

Such characteristics promote distinct ecological conditions that support the existence of unique communities. In this work, we studied seven caves in the Presidente Olegario municipality, Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil, to determine their richness of predatory species, to understand how they are spatially distributed in the cave and whether their distribution is influenced by competition and/or predation. We carried out five surveys of the caves, with each cave divided into sampling plots. We collected fauna within the plots using a manual search method. The collected animals were fixed in 70% ethanol for later identification. We performed a canonical correspondence analysis to verify the spatial distribution and substrate preference of each species, and selected five species for agonistic interaction testing in the laboratory. We found a great richness of predators in the caves, with 79 species distributed among 22 families of spiders, five families of pseudoscorpions, three families of chilopods, two families of opilionids and one family each of scorpions and heteroptera. Spiders were the most species diverse and abundant of all arthropods we found in the caves. We recorded evidence of competition among some pairs of species but, in general, the spatial distribution of the predatory community in the interior of the caves seems to be unrelated to interspecies competition. The laboratory pairings support our field observations that most species merely share space, rather than exhibiting aggressive or predatory behaviour.","[Resende, L. P. A.; Bichuette, M.

Otter trawl (4.9 m, 6 mm mesh) collections were dominated by young-of-the-year of most of the 49 species encountered. Species richness and abundance appeared greatest in the ocean, decreased (with an increase in inter-station variability) in the bay, and appeared to increase again towards the uppermost river stations. The same areas contained three non-discrete, but identifiable, fish assemblages based on Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Members of the Triglidae and Stromateidae characterized the ocean and bay, whereas representatives of the Percichthyidae and Ictaluridae characterized the river. Several species, including Anchoa mitchilli and Cynoscion regalis, exhibited a ubiquitous distribution across the sampling area. Further analyses with Canonical Correspondence Analysis identified salinity and geographic distance, among the variables examined, as the most important determinants in shaping the assemblages. Other contributors included habitat heterogeneity and water depth. In summary, these observations indicate that large-scale patterns in the structure of this estuarine fish assemblage are primarily a result of individual species' responses to dominate environmental gradients, as well as ontogenetic migrations, whereas smaller-scale patterns appear to be the result of habitat associations that are most likely driven by foraging, competition, and/or predator avoidance.

In the present study we examined the process of web-site selection and web-site tenacity by adult females of this species in a winter wheat field, Spiders were selective in their choice of web-site. Different immigration rates into various manipulated web-sites, in field and laboratory, suggested that structural support and suitable micro-climate (high humidity) are the most important factors in the selection. Small holes dug in the ground were the most favoured web-sites. Web-site occupation was influenced by the presence of other conspecific spiders. Territorial contests occurred between spiders attempting to occupy the same web, these almost invariably led to the take-over of the web when the intruder was heavier. interference, but also a certain level of tolerance, between spiders within the same web-site but in different webs was suggested by direct and indirect evidence. Many holes supported two or even three spiders in vertically stratified webs. Leaving probability of marked spiders was significantly higher in multiply occupied holes than in holes with a single web. Comparison with the results of a no-interference stochastic model showed that multiple occupancy in nature is less frequent than predicted by the model. There was further evidence for weak extra-web-interference between spiders in that multiple occupancy was even less frequent and overall occupancy was lower in web-sites which were packed close to each other. However, a level of tolerance for crowding is shown by the fact that closely packed hole colonies supported a spider density 13 times higher than in natural web-sites in the field. A marking experiment was carried out to gain information on web-site tenacity (i.e. the length of time a spider spends in a web-site) and abandonment. The average duration of tenacity was less than 2 days. A random loss function gave a good fit to the tenacity distribution and suggested that spiders abandoned web-sites randomly with a fixed leaving probability of e. 0.5. individual webs were often used consecutively by more than one spider, and some spiders built more than one web in the same web-site. Calculations showed that abandonment is the most frequent leaving mode, while take-over by contest between spiders and disappearance due to destruction were somewhat less frequent and equally likely modes of ending tenacity. It is suggested that the apparent contradiction be tween the selectiveness and competitiveness of spiders for web-sites and the relatively short tenacity observed can be resolved by hypothesising that spiders leave web-sites soon because they apply the strategy of spreading risk: spiders by frequently moving from one web-site to another distribute their reproductive efforts across several localities. This hypothesis is further supported by changes in web-sire preference and ballooning behaviour at the onset of the reproductive stage in L. tenuis.","HORT RES INT,WELLESBOURNE CV35 9EF,WARWICK,ENGLAND; NATL ENVIRONM RES INST,DK-8410 RONDE,DENMARK","Samu, F (corresponding author), HUNGARIAN ACAD SCI,INST PLANT PROTECT,POB 102,H-1525 BUDAPEST,HUNGARY.",,"Samu, Ferenc/B-2827-2011; Topping, Christopher J/A-9167-2009","Samu, Ferenc/0000-0002-6591-2284; Topping, Christopher J/0000-0003-0874-7603; Topping, Christopher/0000-0003-2304-1916",,,,62,64,66,2,22,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1996,106,2,,,,,228,239,,10.1007/BF00328603,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UJ219,WOS:A1996UJ21900012,28307648,,,,2021-09-27,

During 2002-2006, we radio-monitored 42 gray foxes and estimated space use, habitat selection and survival within a managed longleaf pine forest. Sizes of home ranges and core areas were greater in winter than during other seasons, but were similar between males and females. Industrial agriculture field and residential areas were important. to foxes when selecting home ranges, but hardwood forest stands were selected when establishing core areas and were consistently used more than other habitats. Despite being captured within the longleaf pine community, most foxes either consistently were found outside of this system in other habitats, or used habitats along the periphery of the longleaf pine system. Mean annual survival was 0.61, and human-induced factors (vehicle collisions and trapping) accounted for most (63%) fox mortalities. Longleaf pine forests did not appear to be important to gray foxes in this study, which is significant because natural ecosystems are often important for predator species. We provide evidence that sources of gray fox mortality are influenced by habitat selection patterns.","[Temple, Danielle L.; Chamberlain, Michael J.] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Conner, L.

In central Oklahoma, the predaceous ant lions Myrmeleon crudelis and M. immaculatus live in dense aggregations at the sheltered bases of cliff ledges. Three larval instars of each species act as predators and competitors of one another. In controlled field experiments, mortality of second and third instars increased with density, although intra-and interspecific effects were indistinguishable. The presence of third-instar larvae did not affect recruitment or survivorship of first-instar larvae. In all experiments, mortality was predictable on the basis of body mass and larval density, but not species identity. Increased food supply shortened development time and increased adult body mass but did not affect mortality. Larvae near the front of the ant lion aggregation grew faster due to greater food availability but suffered greater mortality in the pupal stage. Although food and space were limiting, neither species was excluded because (1) intra-and interspecific effects were similar; (2) third-instar larvae could not suppress the recruitment of first-instar larvae; and (3) recruitment was patchy in time and space.

The population dynamics of freshwater rotifers have been well researched in this aspect. However, their spatial variations have attracted less attention and have not been studied by simultaneously considering both predation and food supply. We studied spatial variations of rotifer abundance among 34 Canadian boreal lakes. A large part of the variance of rotifer abundance was associated with variables related to trophic status including chlorophyll a and total phosphorus. However, abundances of mesozooplankton such as potential predators and competitors did not correlate with rotifer abundance and did not explain the residual of the regression between rotifer abundance and chlorophyll a. The results of the present study indicated that variation in rotifer abundance among lakes was caused by 'bottom-up' forces related to food supply and not by 'top-down' predatory interactions. This provides a contrast to previous empiric and experimental studies that reported that temporal variations of rotifer abundance were mainly regulated by 'top-down' interactions. This discrepancy suggests that overall differences in rotifer abundance among lakes are mainly determined by 'bottom-up' forces while temporal changes in single lakes are shaped by 'top-down' forces. Meanwhile, the composition of rotifer species was correlated with mesozooplankton abundance as well as trophic status. Rotifer species with long spines or rigid loricae were found in the lakes where mesozooplankton were abundant, which suggests that defensive morphology could have affected the rotifer species distribution among the study lakes.","Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan; Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Yoshida, T (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Yoshida, Takehito/O-9983-2014; Yoshida, Takehito/ABB-2490-2020; 张, 楠/B-1010-2010; Elser, James/A-7082-2008; Urabe, Jotaro/ABI-7692-2020; Urabe, Jotaro/A-6256-2012","Yoshida, Takehito/0000-0001-9178-3634; Yoshida, Takehito/0000-0001-9178-3634; Elser, James/0000-0002-1460-2155; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X",,,,52,54,73,2,34,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

This work describes behavioural interactions between necrophagous larvae under a predator-prey perspective, using as a model the predatory species Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and three species of prey: Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann) (Calliphoridae), Synthesiomyia nudiseta (Wulp) (Muscidae) and Peckia (Peckia) chrysostoma (Wiedemann) (Sarcophagidae). Using experimental arenas, we observed behavioural acts, such as escape, avoidance and prey discrimination in three experiments, which also incorporated predator density. We demonstrate that the number of escapes, avoidance and predation varies according to the type of prey. Lucilia eximia and P. chrysostoma are able to avoid and/or escape the predator more frequently when compared to S. nudiseta. At least 70% of larvae of both species successfully evaded from C. albiceps attack. Low frequency of escape, associated with strong ability to counterattack, was observed for S. nudiseta. Peckia chrysostoma and L. eximia were the preferred items in the experiment of prey discrimination in both 2- and 3-choice tests. Predation occurs quickly, and the minimum predation time varied according to the prey species and predator density. Remarkably, prey handling varied with the species: whilst individual larvae chased and killed L. eximia, 75% of predation of P. chrysostoma occurred in groups of two or more C. albiceps larvae. Differential intraguild predation has implications for reducing populations of carrion insects-consequently affecting the likelihood of sampling necrophagous larvae in human cadavers.","[Barbosa, Taciano Moura; Jales, Jessica Teixeira; Medeiros, Jucelia Rossana; Gama, Renata Antonaci] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Lab Insects & Vectors, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Barbosa, Taciano Moura; Vasconcelos, Simao Dias] Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Zool, Lab Insects Forens Importance, Recife, PE, Brazil","Barbosa, TM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Lab Insects & Vectors, Natal, RN, Brazil.; Barbosa, TM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Zool, Lab Insects Forens Importance, Recife, PE, Brazil.",tacianomoura7@gmail.com,"Barbosa, Taciano/L-3789-2019; Antonaci, Renata/AAI-6067-2021","Barbosa, Taciano/0000-0002-5495-258X",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"We thank the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) for the scholarships granted to JTJ (PhD) and TMB (PNPD), and Larissa Martins for the support in the behavioural experiments.",,35,0,0,2,4,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC BRASIL,"LONDRINA,","CAIXA POSTAL 481, 86001-970 LONDRINA,, PR, BRAZIL",1519-566X,1678-8052,,NEOTROP ENTOMOL,Neotrop.

Until recently, the only North American records were based on two single specimens, both from the 1930's in southeastern Canada. In 2008, this species was found at thirteen different sites in five counties in northwestern Oregon. As of the end of 2010, it has been found in thirty-four different sites in ten Oregon counties, with a north-south range of similar to 150 km and an east-west range of similar to 90 km. It was also detected in 2010 in southwestern Washington (Vancouver), just north of Portland and the Columbia River. The ecological amplitude of N. brevicollis in Oregon rivals that of the most eurytopic native carabid species, e.g., Pterostichus algidus LeConte and Scaphinotus marginatus (Fischer von Waldheim). It has been found in highly degraded heavy industrial sites, agricultural fields, city parks, gardens, second growth woodlands, mature conifer forests, montane rock gardens, and otherwise pristine stands of old growth noble fir, with elevations ranging from essentially sea level to 1,249 meters. Climates at these locales vary from that of the Mediterranean Willamette Valley floor, where snow rarely occurs and summers are hot and dry, to the summit of the Oregon Coast Range, where deep snow may be present from November through April and summers are cool. The c,arabid communities in which N brevicollis has been found range from those predominantly of fellow exotic species, e.g., at heavily perturbed sites, to those where it is the only exotic species, such as at the Coast Range summit. Nebria brevicollis is clearly an invasive species in that it is not restricted to anthropogenic habitats, is rapidly expanding its North American range, and can be abundant in essentially pristine settings. What is not yet clear is whether it is or will become a damaging species. Although it is already the most abundant carabid species in some settings, based upon pitfall catches, it is unknown whether this represents competitive superiority, trap vulnerability, or utilization of previously untapped or non-limiting resources. Deleterious ecological effects could include not only competition with other predators (including other carabid species) in agricultural and natural settings but also predation upon non-adult stages of threatened and endangered species of butterflies.","Oregon Dept Agr, Plant Div, Salem, OR 97301 USA","LaBonte, JR (corresponding author), Oregon Dept Agr, Plant Div, 635 Capitol St NE, Salem, OR 97301 USA.",jlabonte@oda.state.or.us,,,,,,36,7,8,0,9,PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,SOFIA,"GEO MILEV STR 13A, SOFIA, 1111, BULGARIA",1313-2989,,,ZOOKEYS,ZooKeys,,2011,,147,,,SI,,527,543,,10.3897/zookeys.147.2119,,,17,Zoology,Zoology,882VQ,WOS:000299592400020,22371674,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-27,

The concept that competitive exclusion does not act within soil communities is reviewed in light of these findings, which are placed in the context of the wider literature relating to earthworm, enchytraeid, collembolan and mite diversity, and factors that influence these, with particular reference to land management. The second half of the paper reviews laboratory and field C-13-tracer studies, carried out under the programme, that assess linkages between specific biota and ecosystem processes. The concept of functional redundancy in soil food webs is discussed in the context of these studies. We conclude that competitive interactions occur most widely amongst soil macrofauna, and that competitive exclusion amongst mesofauna is potentially limited by both fine-scale spatial heterogeneity and predation. The most profound impacts of soil fauna on soil properties at Sourhope appeared to be due to the presence of macrofauna in soil communities. There was also evidence for functional redundancy at the species level amongst soil biota, but this was dependent upon which ecosystem process was measured. We conclude that it is likely that functional redundancy at the species level occurs most widely in species rich faunal groups with generalist feeding behaviour. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The recent (2007) discovery and rapid explosion of populations of green crab in predominantly cold water ecosystems of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) provided an opportunity to investigate interactions with a potential, indigenous competitor, the rock crab, Cancer irroratus, under presumably adverse thermal conditions for green crab. We used a laboratory microcosm experiment with rock crab and green crab from NL to determine how changes in temperature (4 degrees C and 12 degrees C), body size (small, medium, and large), and the loss of one chela affect the ability of one rock crab to compete with one large, intact green crab for one blue mussel. Mytilus edulis. Green crab was first to grasp the mussel in >90% of trials, regardless of temperature. In cold water, large, intact rock crab held the mussel as frequently as green crab and 25- and 12-fold more frequently than small, intact rock crab and large rock crab missing one chela, respectively. Changes in temperature and relative body size did not affect the number of contests between species, although strong physical interactions occurred similar to 20% more often in contests with large than small rock crab. Large, intact rock crab initiated contests with green crab more frequently than smaller conspecifics in warm water only, while winning 5-fold more contests than small rock crab, regardless of temperature. The ability of large rock crab to win contests was not affected by chela loss. Small and medium rock crab spent at least threefold more time buried in sediments or inside a shelter than large crab, regardless of chela loss. This study suggests that the recent introduction of green crab to NL reduces foraging in rock crab, especially in competitive interactions between green crab and smaller rock crab, and that this effect is exacerbated during warmer times of year.

We used a biogeographic approach to compare foraging and antipredator behavior across a reciprocal invasion (in which each species invaded the native range of the other) of virile (Faxonius virilis) and rusty crayfish (F. rusticus). We hypothesized that the invasion process would select for individuals that invest more in foraging and less in defense than their native counterparts. We used laboratory experiments to examine crayfish boldness, activity, and foraging voracity and mesocosm experiments to examine antipredator behavior in response to fish. Non-native virile crayfish (Indiana, USA) were less bold, active and voracious than native virile crayfish (Wisconsin, USA), and they exhibited more antipredator behavior. Non-native rusty crayfish (Wisconsin) were more active in mesocosms and exhibited less antipredator behavior than native rusty crayfish (Indiana). Combined, these findings suggest a growth/mortality trade-off. Counter to our hypothesis, relative investment in foraging versus predator avoidance differed across regions and was not consistently associated with native or invasive populations. Thus, the substantial divergence in behavior we observed may by driven by local adaptation.","[Reisinger, Lindsey S.] Cent Michigan Univ, Inst Great Lakes Res, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Glon, Mael G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH USA; [Pintor, Lauren M.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH USA; [Reisinger, Lindsey S.] Univ Florida, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, 7922 NW 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA","Reisinger, LS (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, 7922 NW 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.",lreisinger1@ufl.edu,,,OSU School of Environment and Natural Resources; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; CMU Institute for Great Lakes Research,"For help with crayfish collection and husbandry, we thank 2016 Central Michigan University (CMU) Great Lakes Summer Research Program students, students in the Pintor Lab at The Ohio State University (OSU), the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Trout Lake Station Staff, and Y Guy and R Zhu.

The interactive phenomena among individuals may be size-dependent, since body size is a major factor that may alter prey consumption rates and ultimately the dynamics and structure of food webs. A study was initiated in order to evaluate the effect of mutual interference in the prey-specific attack rates and handling times of same size class predators, incorporating variation in consumer size. For this purpose, laboratory functional response experiments were conducted using same age predators, that is, newly hatched (first instar) or mature (fifth instar) nymphs of the polyphagous mirid predator Macrolophus pygmaeus preying on Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs. The experiments involved four predator density treatments, that is, one, two, three, or four predators of same age, that is, either first- or fifth-instar nymphs, which were exposed to several prey densities. The Crowley-Martin model, which allows for interference competition between foraging predators, was used to fit the data. The results showed that mutual interference between predator's nymphs may occur that affect their foraging efficiency. The values of the attack rate coefficient were dependent on the predator density and for the first-instar nymphs were significantly lower at the highest predator density than the lower predator densities, whereas for the fifth-instar nymphs in all density treatments were significantly lower to that of the individual foragers' ones. These results indicate that mutual interference is more intense for larger predators and is more obvious at low prey densities where the competition level is higher. The wider use of predator-dependent functional response models will help toward a mechanistic understanding of intraspecific interactions and its consequences on the stability and structure of food webs.","[Papanikolaou, Nikos E.; Dervisoglou, Sofia; Giakoumaki, Valmari; Perdikis, Dionysios] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Crop Sci, Lab Agr Zool & Entomol, 75 Iera Odos Str, Athens 11855, Greece; [Papanikolaou, Nikos E.] Hellen Minist Rural Dev & Food, Dept Plant Protect Prod & Biocides, Athens, Greece; [Fantinou, Argyro] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Crop Sci, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, Athens, Greece; [Kypraios, Theodore] Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Univ Pk, Nottingham, England","Papanikolaou, NE (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Dept Crop Sci, Lab Agr Zool & Entomol, 75 Iera Odos Str, Athens 11855, Greece.",nikosp@aua.gr,,,European Culture,Foundation for Education and European Culture,,68,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In this study, we show that the coral Oculina arbuscula persists on reefs in temperate North Carolina where seaweeds are common by harboring the omnivorous crab Mithrax forceps, which removes seaweeds and invertebrates growing on or near the coral. In the field, corals from which crabs art: experimentally removed develop a dense cover of epibionts, exhibiting reduced growth and increased mortality relative to corals with crabs, which remain epibiont-free. This crab is unusual in that it readily consumes all local seaweeds in laboratory choice assays and is not deterred by chemical defenses that suppress feeding by local fishes, sea urchins, and other crabs. This allows Mithrax to defend corals from overgrowth by chemically noxious seaweeds like Dictyota and Sargassum that are avoided by most local herbivores. However, further field manipulations under reduced light conditions demonstrate that the outcome of the crab-coral interaction is context-dependent: crabs only benefit corals in well-lit areas where seaweeds are abundant. Field observations and tethering experiments show that, by living in association with Oculina, Mithrax gains a refuge from predation. Additionally, crabs grow faster when associated with live corals than with structurally equivalent dead corals, apparently because they are able to consume lipid-rich coral mucus. This mucus provides a dietary supplement that may help corals attract and retain low-mobility symbionts such as Mithrax, securing for the coral long-term and predictable protection against competitors. Structurally complex but competitively inferior organisms. like some corals and coralline algae, provide the biogenic habitat complexity upon which many other species depend. Because these sessile organisms may be dependent on symbionts to remove superior competitors, mutualisms can play an important, but currently underappreciated, role in structuring marine communities where biotic interactions ape intense. In this study, the mutualism between Oculina and Mithrax promotes the persistence of both species in habitats from which they might otherwise be excluded by competition and predation.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Stachowicz, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, 1084 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA.",,"Hay, Mark E/D-9752-2011","Hay, Mark E/0000-0002-6130-9349",,,,99,81,85,0,60,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1999,80,6,,,,,2085,2101,,10.2307/176680,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,233CQ,WOS:000082408300023,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

To investigate this relationship at a proximate level and explore which factors mediate it, we conducted audio playback experiments examining how wild dogs responded to the simulated proximity of either lions or hyenas. The principle finding was that wild dogs consistently moved directly away from lion roars, but when played hyena whoops either stood their ground or, later, moved off in a random direction. These results suggest that lions represent an immediate high-level threat to wild dogs that is invariably best avoided, whilst the threat from hyenas may not be so great or perhaps is simply unavoidable. Wild dogs appeared to make some assessment of ambush risk during interactions with lions, illustrated by the varying latency to their retreat in habitats of differing vegetation density (and hence ambush potential). Additionally, packs with younger pups were more likely to alarm call and exhibited a slower rate of retreat in the hour following exposure to lion roars. Other variables investigated (competitor group size, lion sex, presence of pups) failed to explain variation in wild dogs responses.","[Webster, Hugh; McComb, Karen] Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England; [Webster, Hugh; McNutt, John W.] Botswana Predator Conservat Program, Maun, Botswana","Webster, H (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England.",hughwebster1@googlemail.com,,,Botswana Predator Conservation Program; San Diego Zoo; Philadelphia Zoo; Sussex University; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BBS/S/K/2004/11263],"We thank the Botswana Government and Department of Wildlife and National Parks for permission to conduct the research.

In this set of field experiments, we evaluated the interactive, dynamic effects of limited food supply and predation from wolf spiders (Lycosidae) on mortality in Ageneotettix deorum, a common grasshopper (Acrididae) from North American sandhills grasslands. We attempted to determine whether the combined effects of food availability and spider predation on mortality were (1) noncompensatory, with the effects of each factor summing to determine ultimate population size, or (2) compensatory, where the effect of one mortality factor alters the impact of subsequent factors so that the ultimate population size changes little, despite variation in specific sources of mortality. We also investigated whether changes in nutritional quality encountered by grasshoppers would result in different dynamic responses to predation in the context of noncompensatory vs. compensatory responses. Both food availability and predation risk contributed to mortality rates. Individuals of A. deorum were food limited. Survival of grasshoppers feeding on fertilized plants was 50% higher than that of grasshoppers feeding on unfertilized plants over a 31-d period. Most of the mortality due to limited food occurred 12-14 d into the experiment. Predation from lycosid spiders decreased the numbers of individuals by 49% in the first 10-15 days of the experiment. Either noncompensatory or compensatory responses resulted from the combined effects of food availability and predation on population size, depending upon the nutritional status of host plants. At ambient-level food quality (no fertilizer), spider predation and food limitation were compensatory; the same numbers of grasshoppers were recovered in treatments with and without spider-predation risk after 31 d. However, with higher food quality (N fertilizer), spider predation reduced the numbers of surviving individuals as compared with the no-spider-predation treatment, a noncompensatory response. In separate, preplanned experiments, individuals surviving spider-predation treatments lived longer than did individuals protected from spider predation when they were caged individually over vegetation of ambient quality. Combined, these experiments emphasize the importance of food quality as a determinant of how this predator-prey system responds, and the results suggest a mechanism underlying the response. After predation, survivors are likely to encounter more food per capita and to exhibit higher individual quality, which promotes longevity, presumably from reduced competition. This leads to a compensatory response. Under high food quality regimes, predation and food probably act in a noncompensatory fashion because grasshoppers are less food limited, and the release of additional food on a per capita basis by predation has less effect on the subsequent number of survivors.","Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Joern, A (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,101,46,50,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2000,81,1,,,,,66,77,,10.2307/177134,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,277BT,WOS:000084913400007,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

What is not known is whether such coexistence would occur if organisms dispersed non-randomly, using cues such as density and habitat quality to gauge fitness differences between habitats. Here, I conduct a comparative analysis of random and non-random dispersal strategies in a foodweb with a basal resource, top predator, and two intermediate consumers that exhibit a trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility. I find a striking contrast between density- and habitat-dependent dispersal in their effects on spatial coexistence. Dispersal in response to competitor and predator density facilitates coexistence while dispersal in response to habitat quality (resource productivity and predator pressure) inhibits it. Moreover, density-dependent dispersal changes species' distribution patterns from interspecific segregation to interspecific aggregation, while habitat-dependent dispersal preserves the interspecific segregation observed in the absence of dispersal. Under density-dependent dispersal, widespread spatial coexistence results in an overall decline in the abundance of the inferior competitor that is less susceptible to predation and an overall increase in the abundance of the superior competitor that is more susceptible to predation. Under habitat-dependent dispersal, restricted spatial coexistence results in species' abundances being essentially unchanged from those observed in the absence of dispersal. A key outcome is that when the superior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the inferior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is possible in both resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. However, when the inferior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the superior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is precluded in resource-poor habitats and greatly reduced in resource-rich habitats. This suggests that species-specific differences may play an important role in driving spatial coexistence patterns. The comparative framework yields predictions that can be tested with experiments that manipulate the relative mobilities of interacting species, or observational data on relative abundances and distribution patterns.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",amarasek@ucla.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717350],This research was supported by NSF grant DEB-0717350.

Rather, the differences that promote stable coexistence can be those which cause each species to experience stronger intraspecific than interspecific competition. Recent approaches have established how to detect the demographic signature of these competitive effects, but alone they cannot elucidate the ecological differences among species that yield these patterns. Here, we present a unifying experimental and observational framework that identifies potential ecological differences among species shaping their responses to intra- and interspecific competition. We first describe a conceptual model establishing why the strength of intra- and interspecific competitive interactions should vary along environmental gradients related to species ecological differences. We then show how to apply the framework using Enallagma damselflies, a diverse group of predatory aquatic insects. To determine how species responded to intra- and interspecific competition along environmental gradients, we experimentally manipulated the relative abundances of three species and replicated this across five lakes which varied in environmental conditions affecting larval damselfly per capita growth and mortality rates-key vital rates regulating their populations. Results suggest Enallagma are ecologically differentiated in ways that in some communities can result in intraspecific competition exceeding interspecific competition. However, in many cases the opposite was true, or the effects of intra- and interspecific competition were equivalent via growth and mortality responses. Moreover, these effects tended to be weak and asymmetrical among competitors, which suggests that differential responses of larval growth and mortality to intra- and interspecific competition may not contribute strongly to the maintenance of Enallagma diversity. Different environmental factors appear to shape these demographic responses to competition, providing insight into the ecological mechanisms regulating damselfly assemblages. This framework can be broadly applied to identify the ecological differences among species that may promote coexistence, advancing knowledge of the mechanisms underlying coexistence and overcoming some limitations of purely phenomenological approaches.","[Ousterhout, Brittany H.; Serrano, Mabel; Bried, Jason T.; Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Ousterhout, Brittany H.] Natl Great Rivers Res & Educ Ctr, East Alton, IL USA; [Bried, Jason T.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Siepielski, AM (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",amsiepie@uark.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021; Bried, Jason/AAF-9492-2021","Bried, Jason/0000-0002-8659-9848",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1748945],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB1748945",,83,5,5,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Four structures, each containing a shaded and an illuminated surface, were exchanged every 3months for 2years. The number of recruits was quantified on each plate. In the laboratory, larvae of P.magna were placed in half-shaded Petri dishes and the number of settlers in each side was counted after 24h.

Recruits occurred in greater abundance on shaded surfaces than on illuminated surfaces, and the larvae were negatively phototactic in vitro. Despite the possible influence of other factors in the recruitment of sponges (such as sedimentation, competition and predation), the prevalence of P.magna in shaded habitats may also be related to larval choice.","[Padua, Andre; Lanna, Emilio; Zilberberg, Carla; de Paiva, Paulo Cesar; Klautau, Michelle] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Lanna, Emilio] Univ Fed Bahia, Ist Biol, Dept Biol Geral, Salvador, BA, Brazil","Klautau, M (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",mklautau@biologia.ufrj.br,"Klautau, Michelle/I-2041-2012; de Paiva, Paulo Cesar/N-1234-2019; Lanna, Emilio/K-3323-2012; Zilberberg, Carla/G-9176-2015; Padua, Andre/O-8287-2018; Zilberberg, Carla Carla/AAO-4746-2020; Padua, Andre/AAD-7779-2019","Klautau, Michelle/0000-0002-5959-0776; de Paiva, Paulo Cesar/0000-0003-1061-6549; Zilberberg, Carla/0000-0002-9796-5030; Padua, Andre/0000-0002-6284-7739; Padua, Andre/0000-0002-6284-7739",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); PIBIC/UFRJ; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); FAPERJFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ),"We thank Augusto C.

In an attempt to understand how the young of marine species successfully invade communities of permanent estuarine residents we studied potential interactions between two of the most abundant decapod crustaceans in nekton assemblages of the southeastern United States. Three years of quantitative samples from an intertidal marsh on Sapelo Island, Georgia showed that densities of the resident daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio were reduced during the time that juvenile white shrimp Penaeus setiferus us used the estuary as a nursery. Results of a field enclosure experiment showed that white shrimp had no significant lethal or sublethal effects on adult grass shrimp. However, they did reduce survival of both juvenile and larval grass shrimp in laboratory experiments, suggesting the potential importance of a stage-dependent predator-prey interaction between the two shrimp species. The mortality rate of young grass shrimp in the presence of white shrimp was unaffected by grass shrimp density, but larvae (2.6-3.0 mm) suffered higher mortalities than did juveniles (5.0-15.0 mm); We suggest that the vulnerability of grass shrimp to predation by white shrimp is related to their molting cycle. The 'window of vulnerability' opens more often for younger grass shrimp because they molt more frequently. When combined with losses due to other predators and competitors, the impact of early white shrimp cohorts on grass shrimp larvae and juveniles may prevent the resident species from maintaining its population at high densities, thereby freeing resources in the nursery for subsequent cohorts of juvenile white shrimp.","UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT ZOOL, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA","KNEIB, RT (corresponding author), UNIV GEORGIA, INST MARINE, SAPELO ISL, GA 31327 USA.",,,,,,,49,29,30,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,1995,103,4,,,,,425,434,,10.1007/BF00328680,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RV953,WOS:A1995RV95300004,28306990,,,,2021-09-27,

Separating the effects of local and regional processes on community richness requires combining small-scale experiments with broad surveys. I examine limitations to the number of aquatic insect species per treehole at the scale of a single woodland, and between eight biogeographic regions. Variation in species richness at the woodland scale can largely be explained by small-scale differences between treeholes in drought disturbance, as shown for British treehole insects for 2 years. At the global scale, drought disturbance is a relatively poor predictor of patterns in the local richness of treehole mosquitoes. Instead, regional differences in the species pool explain most of the variation in local mosquito richness. Treeholes in at least the most species-poor regions appear to be unsaturated with mosquito species. In this system, therefore, local processes do not necessarily scale to global patterns.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Srivastava, DS (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",srivast@zoology.ubc.ca,,,,,,63,25,25,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2005,145,2,,,,,205,215,,10.1007/s00442-005-0061-0,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,969GT,WOS:000232223300005,15891844,,,,2021-09-27,

However, these behavioral interactions within (intraspecific) and between (interspecific) species are costly as they can be energetically expensive and cause injury or death. To avoid these agonistic interactions, numerous species alter their behaviors and resource requirements. Spatial variation in nest site competition allows for investigation of concurrent variation in territorial defense behavior. Further, among species with bi-parental nest defense, behavioral similarity in territorial defense may benefit pairs. Here, we studied territorial aggression between two eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) populations (North Carolina and Alabama, USA) that differ in avian community structure; those in North Carolina have recently begun to experience strong interspecific competition for nesting cavities by tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a competitive pressure that is relatively new for North Carolina bluebirds (similar to 35-40 years) and is absent in Alabama populations. We found that bluebirds in North Carolina are more aggressive to simulated territorial intrusions compared to their Alabama counterparts. Behavioral similarity (here, in aggression) between partners is strong and similar in both populations. These results suggest that bluebirds in North Carolina may have to maintain higher baseline aggression during territory establishment and nest construction to co-occur with highly aggressive tree swallows, but that, in both populations, behavioral similarity between partners may be adaptive. Finally, we acknowledge the preliminary nature of this study and the need for expanding the behavioral studies to other sites in the southeastern United States. Greater regional coverage would exclude the possibility of alternative drivers of the observed behavioral differences between the North Carolina and Alabama populations.","[Albers, Alexandria N.; Jones, John Anthony; Siefferman, Lynn] Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Jones, John Anthony] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Siefferman, L (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Biol Dept, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",sieffermanlm@appstate.edu,,"Jones, John/0000-0003-2615-1248","Appalachian State University, Office of Student Research","We thank Wendy Hood for logistical assistance at the Alabama population.

In the first experiment, first instar Drosophila tripunctata larvae (brown-eyed mutants) were placed on Agaricus bisporus mushrooms at five densities (0, 10, 20, 40 and 80/mushroom). Mushrooms were placed in ''ant-access'' and ''ant-exclusion'' treatment cups for six days, and native metamorphs that emerged were sorted, counted, dried, and weighed. Predation had a significant effect on the number of metamorphs emerging, reducing fly abundance from 57.2 flies in the ant exclusion cups to 37.5 in the ant access cups. Larval density was also important; decreasing the number of metamorphs from 60.5 flies (10 larvae/mushroom) to 20.5 flies (80 larvae/mushroom). In the second experiment, halves of native boletoid mushrooms were placed in the ant treatment cups for six days and metamorphs were sorted. Predation reduced the number of flies emerging by 60%. In both experiments, however, there were no significant effects on species richness or Berger-Parker dominance. Likewise, there were only slight compensatory increases in mean fly mass in the ant-access treatments.

Sticky cards have shortcomings that prompted search for a replacement: cards are messy, require weekly replacement, are expensive to purchase, and accumulate large numbers of nontarget insects. Bactericera cockerelli on sticky cards also deteriorate enough that specimens cannot be tested reliably for the presence of vectored plant pathogens. A prototype trap constructed using 3D printing technology for monitoring Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Liviidae) was tested for monitoring B. cockerelli. The trap was designed to attract B. cockerelli visually to the trap and then funnel specimens into preservative-filled vials at the trap bottom. Prototype traps were paired against yellow sticky cards at multiple fields to compare the captures of B. cockerelli between cards and traps. The prototype trap was competitive with sticky cards early in the growing season when B. cockerelli numbers were low. We estimated that two or three prototype traps would collect as many B. cockerelli as one sticky card under these conditions. Efficacy of the prototype declined as B. cockerelli numbers increased seasonally. The prototype trap accumulated nontarget taxa that are common on sticky cards (especially Thysanoptera and Diptera), and was also found to capture taxa of possible interest in integrated pest management research, including predatory insects, parasitic Hymenoptera, and winged Aphididae (Hemiptera), suggesting that the traps could be useful outside of the purpose targeted here. We believe that 3D printing technology has substantial promise for developing monitoring tools that exploit behavioural traits of the targeted insect. Ongoing work includes the use of this technology to modify the prototype, with a focus on making it more effective at capturing psyllids and less susceptible to capture of nontarget species.","[Horton, David R.; Miliczky, Eugene R.; Lewis, Tamera M.] USDA ARS, 5230 Konnowac Pass Rd, Wapato, WA 98951 USA; [Wohleb, Carrie H.] Washington State Univ Extens, 1525 E Wheeler Rd, Moses Lake, WA 98837 USA; [Waters, Timothy D.] Washington State Univ Extens, 404 W Clark Ave, Pasco, WA 99301 USA; [Dickens, Anthony A.; Halbert, Susan E.] Florida Dept Agr & Consumer Serv, Div Plant Ind, 1911 SW 34th St, Gainesville, FL 32608 USA; [Ramadugu, Chandrika] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Jensen, Andrew S.] Northwest Potato Res Consortium, 95873 E Goldmohr Lane, Lakeview, OR 97630 USA","Horton, DR (corresponding author), USDA ARS, 5230 Konnowac Pass Rd, Wapato, WA 98951 USA.",david.horton@ars.usda.gov,,,"Agricultural Research Service Federal-State Partnership Potato Research Grant; Washington State Potato Commission; United States Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Specialty Crop Research Initiative [2015-51181-24292]; United States Department of Agriculture Specialty Crops Research Initiative; United States Department of Agriculture Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops programme; National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2015-70016-22992]","We are grateful to Rodney Cooper and Joe Munyaneza for reviewing an earlier version of this paper.

In natural systems, the strength of biological interactions, including predator-prey dynamics, are often density or size-dependent. Hence, changes in the numbers or size of key taxa may be expected to influence biological interactions but their effects do not need to be identical. Here we compare the effects of biomass reduction in populations of the exploited limpet Patella candei. Biomass removal was experimentally achieved by either removing individuals (density reduction) or by replacing large by small individuals (size reduction), while controlling for total limpet biomass in a laboratory-based experiment. At the experiment's termination, biomass reduction led to proportional changes in area grazed. However, there was no difference whether this was achieved via changes in density or in size. Furthermore, no discernible effects of treatments were evident on different components of the algal assemblage. A field survey also revealed that P. candei biomass explained a greater proportion in variation in the area free of algae than density alone. Our results suggest that loss of biomass in populations of P. candei has quantitatively and qualitatively similar effects on algal cover regardless of whether it is caused by an equivalent (biomass) reduction in the numbers or size of individuals.","[Martins, G.

However, since no population is independent of its environment, progress is needed in predicting the efficacy of restoration in unstable ecological contexts. Here, by means of Population Dynamics P-system Models (PDP), we studied long-term changes in the population size of Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) inhabiting a Natural Park, northern Spain, to changes in the numbers of wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a keystone-species of Mediterranean ecosystems that have suffered >90% population decline after a hemorrhagic disease outbreak. Low availability of rabbit carcasses leads Egyptian vultures to extend their foraging activities to unprotected areas with higher non-natural mortality whereas growing numbers of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus), a dominant competitor, progressively monopolize trophic resources resulting in a focal population decrease. Modeling shows that, even if keystone-species populations recover in core protected areas, the return to the original studied population size may be unfeasible, due to both the high non-natural mortality rates in humanized areas and long-term changes in the scavenger guild structure. Policy decisions aimed to restore keystone-species should rely on holistic approaches integrating the effects of spatial heterogeneity on both producer and consumer populations as well as within-guild processes.","[Cortes-Avizanda, Ainara; Antonio Donazar, Jose] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Cortes-Avizanda, Ainara; Ceballos, Olga] CIBIO InBio, Infraestruturas Portugal Biodivers Chair, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Angels Colomer, Maria] Univ Lleida, Fac Life Sci & Engn, Dept Math, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Margalida, Antoni] Univ Lleida, Fac Life Sci & Engn, Dept Anim Prod, Div Wildlife, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Margalida, Antoni] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Cortes-Avizanda, A (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Americo Vespucio S-N, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",cortesavizanda@gmail.com,"Margalida, Antoni/AAG-5337-2020; Cortes-Avizanda, Ainara/C-6634-2013; Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011; CORTES-AVIZANDA, AINARA/O-3248-2019; Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011","Cortes-Avizanda, Ainara/0000-0002-9674-6434; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-0576-3993; CORTES-AVIZANDA, AINARA/0000-0002-9674-6434; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-7383-671X; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-3904-6212; Donazar, Jose Antonio/0000-0002-9433-9755",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BPD/91609/2012]; Ramon y CajalSpanish Government [RYC-2012-11867];  [CGL2012-40013-C02-01],"We gratefully acknowledge the staff of Bardenas Reales Natural Park, specially to Alejandro Urmeneta, for logistical support at field work and the Natural Computing Group at the University of Seville for their help with the design of the simulator.

We tested experimentally the roles of thinning the density of prey (lethality) in the absence of predator cues and density and trait mediated effects (lethality + intimidation) of predatory midge Corethrella appendiculata on competing native and invasive mosquito prey. Predator-mediated reductions in prey and density reductions in the absence of C. appendiculata resulted in lower percent survivorship to adulthood and estimates of the finite rate of increase (lambda') for invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus relative to that of controls. In most instances, thinning the density of prey in the absence, but not in the presence, of C. appendiculata cues resulted in lower survivorship to adulthood and lambda' for native mosquito Aedes triseriatus relative to that of controls. Together, these results suggested trait mediated effects of C. appendiculata specific to each species of mosquito prey. Release from intraspecific competition attributable to density reductions in the absence, but not in the presence, of C. appendiculata enhanced growth and lengthened adult lifespan relative to that of controls for A. albopictus but not A. triseriatus. These results show the importance of predator-mediated density and trait mediated effects on phenotypic traits and populations of invasive and native mosquitoes. Species-specific differences in the phenotypic responses of prey may be due, in part, to longer evolutionary history of C. appendiculata with A. triseriatus than A. albopictus.","[Alto, Barry W.; Malicoate, Jolene; Elliott, Scott M.; Taylor, Jacqueline] Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Vero Beach, FL USA","Alto, BW (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Vero Beach, FL USA.",bwalto@ufl.edu,,,"Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of FloridaUniversity of Florida; University of Florida Open-Access Publishing Fund","This study was supported by funds from the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida.

With continued globalization, species are being transported and introduced into novel habitats at an accelerating rate. Interactions between invasive species may provide important mechanisms that moderate their impacts on native species. 2. The European green crab Carcinus maenas is an aggressive predator that was introduced to the east coast of North America in the mid-1800s and is capable of rapid consumption of bivalve prey. A newer invasive predator, the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus, was first discovered on the Atlantic coast in the 1980s, and now inhabits many of the same regions as C. maenas within the Gulf of Maine. Using a series of field and laboratory investigations, we examined the consequences of interactions between these predators. 3. Density patterns of these two species at different spatial scales are consistent with negative interactions. As a result of these interactions, C. maenas alters its diet to consume fewer mussels, its preferred prey, in the presence of H. sanguineus. Decreased mussel consumption in turn leads to lower growth rates for C. maenas, with potential detrimental effects on C. maenas populations. 4. Rather than an invasional meltdown, this study demonstrates that, within the Gulf of Maine, this new invasive predator can moderate the impacts of the older invasive predator.","[Griffen, Blaine D.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Zool, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Guy, Travis] Albertson Coll Idaho, Dept Biol, Caldwell, ID 83605 USA; [Buck, Julia C.] Washington Univ, Dept Environm Studies, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Griffen, BD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",bgriffen@uga.edu,"Griffen, Blaine/AAC-6384-2021","Buck, Julia/0000-0003-3202-7665",,,,60,66,68,1,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

In coastal ecosystems, eutrophication and declines of large predatory fish are two common disturbances that can synergistically impact habitat-forming plants by benefitting ephemeral algae. In theory, density-dependent intraspecific plant facilitation could weaken such effects by ameliorating the amount of experienced stress. Here, we tested whether and how shoot density of a common aquatic plant (Myriophyllum spicatum) alters the response of individual plants to eutrophication and exclusion of large predatory fish, using a 12-week cage experiment in the field. Results showed that high plant density benefitted individual plant performance, but only when the two stressors were combined. Epiphytic algal biomass per plant more than doubled in cages that excluded large predatory fish, indicative of a trophic cascade. Moreover, in this treatment, individual shoot biomass, as well as number of branches, increased with density when nutrients were added, but decreased with density at ambient nutrient levels. In contrast, in open cages that large predatory fish could access, epiphytic algal biomass was low and individual plant biomass and number of branches were unaffected by plant density and eutrophication. Plant performance generally decreased under fertilization, suggesting stressful conditions. Together, these results suggest that intraspecific plant facilitation occurred only when large fish exclusion (causing high epiphyte load) was accompanied by fertilization, and that intraspecific competition instead prevailed when no nutrients were added. As coastal ecosystems are increasingly exposed to multiple and often interacting stressors such as eutrophication and declines of large predatory fish, maintaining high plant density is important for ecosystem-based management.","[Donadi, S.; Austin, A.

Fences and netting selectively excluded from large, replicated grids. Small mammal populations were censused monthly over >4 yr, and effects of predator and degu exclusions on numbers and survival of small mammals were assessed with repeated measures ANOVAs. Marginally significant predator exclusion effects were detected on O. degus, and highly significant year x predation interactions in both wet and dry seasons; degu survival (= persistence) was also significantly longer on exclusion grids. Predation had significant effects on numbers of Phyllotis darwini, and a significant month X predator interaction existed in the wet season; survival was also significantly higher on predator exclusion grids. There was a marginally significant year x competitor interaction in the dry season for this species. Akodon olivaceus had significant month x predator and month x competitor interactions in the wet season only; survival was significantly longer on degu exclusion grids. An irruptive species, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, showed no significant predator or competitor effects in 1991-1992; however, survival was significantly longer on predator + competitor exclusion (vs. control) grids. An uncommon species, Abrothrix longipilis, had marginally nonsignificant time x competitor interactions but no treatment differences in survival. Finally, a second uncommon rodent, Abrocoma bennetti (not analyzed numerically) had significantly longer survival on predator exclusion grids with degus. Degus and P. darwini were significantly overrepresented (relative to availability) in diets of culpeo foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and three nocturnal owls, respectively, whereas A. bennetti was significantly overrepresented in predator diets generally, Vertebrate predation has pervasive effects on some species that, however, may be related to their intrinsic demographic characteristics. Competition may be mediated by subtle behavioral interactions among assemblage members. Long-term studies are necessary to elucidate the role of biotic and abiotic factors in semiarid environments.","UNIV LA SERENA,DEPT BIOL,LA SERENA,CHILE; PONTIFICIA UNIV CATOLICA CHILE,DEPT ECOL,SANTIAGO,CHILE","Meserve, PL (corresponding author), NO ILLINOIS UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,DE KALB,IL 60115, USA.",,"Jaksic, Fabian M/G-1705-2014","Jaksic, Fabian M/0000-0003-0098-0291",,,,131,82,84,1,40,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1996,77,1,,,,,133,148,,10.2307/2265662,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TR079,WOS:A1996TR07900015,,,,,2021-09-27,

In addition, predator assemblages are changing due to overharvesting, habitat destruction and species invasions. Predator species composition and richness can influence prey community structure and these effects can cascade to influence plant abundance and composition. To test the effects of predator presence, composition and species richness on prey abundance, species richness and composition, we conducted three experiments in a subtidal marine food web. Experimental food webs were drawn from species pools of 5-7 predator species, 19-52 prey species, benthic micro-algae and 5 macro-algae. Predators reduced prey abundance in the mesocosm experiment, but this effect was diminished or absent in field experiments. Predator species differed in their effects on prey, but we found no effect of predator richness (via complementarity or selection) on any aspect of prey community structure. The absence of a predator richness effect could be due to several factors including potentially opposing effects of individual predator species, intraguild predation, or greater importance of colonization relative to competition in structuring prey assemblages. Although predators can have strong top-down effects in this system, selection or resource-use complementarity among predators do not affect prey community structure.","[O'Connor, Mary I.] Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [O'Connor, Mary I.; Bruno, John F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","O'Connor, MI (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",oconnor@nceas.ucsb.edu,"O'Connor, Mary I/F-2275-2010; O'Connor, Mary/R-2933-2019","O'Connor, Mary/0000-0001-9583-1592","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE0326983, OCE0327191]; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","This research was supported by NSF grants OCE0326983 and OCE0327191 to J.F.B., a GRF to M.I.O., and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Population responses to extrinsic mortality can yield no change in the number of survivors (compensation) or an increase in the number of survivors (overcompensation) when the population is regulated by negative density-dependence. This intriguing response has been the subject of theoretical studies, but few experiments have explored how the source of extrinsic mortality affects the response. 2. This study tests abilities of three functionally diverse predators, alone and combined, to induce (over)compensation of a prey population. LarvalAedes aegypti(Diptera: Culicidae) were exposed to predation byMesocyclops longisetus(Crustacea: Copepoda),Anopheles barberi(Diptera: Culicidae),Corethrella appendiculata(Diptera: Corethrellidae), all three in a substitutive design, or no predation. 3. Predator treatment had no significant effect on the total number of adult survivors, nor on numbers of surviving males or females. The female development rate and a composite index of performance (r ') were greater with predation relative to no-predator control. No differences were detected between diverse and single-species predator treatments. 4. Sensitivity analyses indicated predation effects on the number of female adults produced, despite not being affected significantly, was the largest contributing factor to significant treatment effects on the demographic indexr '. While predation did not significantly increase the production of adults, it did release survivors from density-dependent effects sufficiently to increase population performance. This study provides an empirical test of mechanisms by which predation may yield positive mortality effects on victim populations, a phenomenon predicted to occur across many taxa and food webs.","[Neale, Joseph T.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Neale, Joseph T.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Neale, JT (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",jn29@rice.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553; Neale, Joseph/0000-0003-1966-5726",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1R15AI124005-001]; Sigma Xi; Weigel grant; Mockford-Thompson fellowship from the Beta Lambda chapter of the Phi Sigma Biological Honour Society,"This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, grant no. 1R15AI124005-001 to SAJ, and Sigma Xi's grants-in-aid of research, and a Weigel grant and Mockford-Thompson fellowship from the Beta Lambda chapter of the Phi Sigma Biological Honour Society to JTN.

Model analyses show that the stability of population dynamics and food web persistence increase with the strength of interference competition. Despite this critical importance for community stability, little is known about how external factors such as the environmental temperature affect intraspecific interference competition. 2. We aimed to fill this void by studying the functional responses of two ground beetle species of different body size, Pterostichus melanarius and Poecilus versicolor. These functional response experiments were replicated across four predator densities and two temperatures to address the impact of temperature on intraspecific interference competition. 3. We generally expected that warming should increase the speed of movement, encounter rates and in consequence interference among predator individuals. In our experiment, this expectation was supported by the results obtained for the larger predator, P. melanarius, whereas the opposite pattern characterized the interference behaviour of the smaller predator P. versicolor. 4. These results suggest potentially nontrivial implications for the effects of environmental temperature on intraspecific interference competition, for which we propose an explanation based on the different sensitivity to warming of metabolic rates of both species. As expected, increasing temperature led to stronger interference competition of the larger species, P. melanarius, which exhibited a weaker increase in metabolic rate with increasing temperature. The stronger increase in the metabolic rate of the smaller predator, P. versicolor, had to be compensated by increasing searching activity for prey, which did not leave time for increasing interference. 5. Together, these results suggest that any generalization how interference competition responds to warming should also take the species' metabolic response to temperature increases into account.","[Lang, Birgit; Rall, Bjoern C.; Brose, Ulrich] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Lang, B (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Berliner Str 28, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",blang@gwdg.de,"Brose, Ulrich/I-3488-2014; Rall, Bjoern/G-1508-2013; Brose, Ulrich/AAT-7547-2020","Rall, Bjoern/0000-0002-3191-8389; Brose, Ulrich/0000-0001-9156-583X; Lang, Birgit/0000-0002-7514-4573","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [BR 2315/6-1, BR2315/8-1, BR2315/13]","We are grateful to Benjamin M.

Ecological theory suggests two main possible answers for this paradox: competitive superiority of exotic species over native species and opportunistic use of ecological opportunities derived from human activities. We tested these hypotheses in birds combining field observations and experiments along gradients of urbanization in New South Wales (Australia). Five exotic species attained densities in the study area comparable to those of the most abundant native species, and hence provided a case for the invasion paradox. The success of these alien birds was not primarily associated with a competitive superiority over native species: the most successful invaders were smaller and less aggressive than their main native competitors, and were generally excluded from artificially created food patches where competition was high. More importantly, exotic birds were primarily restricted to urban environments, where the diversity and abundance of native species were low. This finding agrees with previous studies and indicates that exotic and native species rarely interact in nature. Observations and experiments in the field revealed that the few native species that exploit the most urbanized environments tended to be opportunistic foragers, adaptations that should facilitate survival in places where disturbances by humans are frequent and natural vegetation has been replaced by man-made structures. Successful invaders also shared these features, suggesting that their success is not a paradox but can be explained by their capacity to exploit ecological opportunities that most native species rarely use.","[Sol, Daniel; Bartomeus, Ignasi] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Sol, Daniel] CSIC, Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB, Blanes 17300, Catalonia, Spain; [Griffin, Andrea S.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Psychol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia","Sol, D (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain.",d.sol@creaf.uab.es,"Sol, Daniel/A-5238-2008; Galef, Bennett G/A-5678-2008","Sol, Daniel/0000-0001-6346-6949; Griffin, Andrea/0000-0003-4624-9904; Bartomeus, Ignasi/0000-0001-7893-4389",DURSI (Generalitat de Catalunya)Generalitat de Catalunya; Proyecto de Investigacion [CGL2007-66257]; Spanish governmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CSD 2008-00040],"We are in debt towards Carme Pujol for her assistance in the field and encouragement during the entire project.

Lionfish (Pterois volitans), invasive in the western Atlantic, is a voracious generalist predator, so it is expected to have a significant trophic overlap with native fishes of comparable size and habits. The goal of this study was to determine the diets of potential competitors of the lionfish, in particular a grouper, Cephalopholis cruentata (Graysby), and a snapper, Lutjanus apodus (Schoolmaster), and to compare them to the diet of lionfish in Xcalak, southern Mexican Caribbean. Stomach contents were analyzed and electivity and diet overlap were estimated. The trophic overlap between the lionfish and the two putative competitors, especially the grouper, was high, including prey that was consumed by the predators in higher proportion than the relative abundance of the prey in the environment, and probably at the same time of day. Lionfish and grouper shared as important diet items Stegastes sp., Halichoeres sp., Brachyura, and Palaemonidae, and most full stomachs were found during the early morning. The hypothesis of competition between them for particular prey is supported, so we advise to continue the culling programs of lionfish and also to monitor the abundance of the possible native competitors.","[Iveth Murillo-Perez, Brenda; Jacobo Schmitter-Soto, Juan; Luis Herrera-Pavon, Roberto] Colegio Frontera Sur, Dept Sistemat & Ecol Acuat, AP 424, Chetmal 77000, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Cobian-Rojas, Dorka] Ctr Invest & Serv Ambientales, Parque Nacl Guanahacabibes, La Bajada, Pinar Del Rio, Cuba","Schmitter-Soto, JJ (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur, Dept Sistemat & Ecol Acuat, AP 424, Chetmal 77000, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",jschmitt@ecosur.mx,,"Cobian Rojas, Dorka/0000-0002-3290-9011; Schmitter-Soto, Juan/0000-0003-4736-8382",Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),"Fish captures were carried out under fishing permit No. PPF/DGOPA-053-15 by the Mexican National Fishery Commission (CONAPESCA) and authorization to work within the national marine park at Xcalak by the Mexican National Commission of Protected Areas (CONANP), for which we are grateful, especially to directors Maricarmen Garcia-Rivas and Jorge M.

Generalist predator interactions, such as intraguild predation (IGP) and competition, can alleviate predation pressure and weaken top-down control that predators have on lower trophic levels. Centipedes (Chilopoda) and carabid beetles (Coleoptera) are common deciduous forest floor generalist predators that may interact by competing for resources beneath rocks and logs on the forest floor, especially during dry periods when prey become confined to such microhabitats. We used laboratory and field studies to determine whether the carabid beetle, Pterostichus stygicus (Say), and the centipede, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus (Say) co-occur under artificial cover. Additionally, a laboratory mesocosm experiment was used to examine competitive interactions in intra- and interspecific trials. There was significant negative co-occurrence of beetles and centipedes beneath cover objects in the field and laboratory. Pairings of S. sexspinosus and P. stygicus within mesocosms resulted in high mortality of P. stygicus, and reciprocal but asymmetric IGP. Centipedes maintained weight within solitary, intra- and interspecific mesocosm treatments, however, beetles lost mass in all treatments. Scolopocryptops sexspinosus responded more favorably to intra- and interspecific competition than did P. stygicus. Analysis of the leaf litter mesofauna indicated that these predators consumed similar prey in laboratory mesocosms. Our results suggest that species with very different trophic morphology have the potential to compete for shared microhabitat and prey.","[Julian, Michele E.; Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA; [Julian, Michele E.] Front Range Community Coll, Dept Sci, 2190 Miller Dr, Longmont, CO 80501 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,"John Carroll University, University Heights, Ohio; Faculty Summer Research Fellowship","We would like to thank Harry Lee for helping with beetle identification and for being a valuable resource for information about ground beetles.

After 13 months of colonization, all 384 tiles were collected and their assemblages compared. A total of 53 744 individuals of 70 species/morphospecies were collected and identified.

Species differ in behaviors that influence nest predation risk, presenting a challenge to nest survival analyses at the nest guild level. At our study site in southeastern New York, previous findings have suggested rodent nest predator abundance strongly drives daily nest survival of the Veery (Catharus fuscescens), a ground or low shrub-nesting songbird. In cue playback experiments, the sympatric ground-nesting Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) shows a greater aversion to chipmunk vocalizations than Veeries. These behavioral differences suggest these two sympatric ground-nesters may be driven by different ecological mechanisms despite similarity in their nesting niche. We examined how nest predator abundance, regional songbird abundance, and timing of nest activity during the breeding season influence nest survival in two songbirds from the same nest guild by building competitive models for determining the extrinsic drivers of daily nest survival. Ovenbird nest survival was best described by nest activity date, where nest survival decreased later in the breeding season, and was positively influenced by conspecific density. Nest survival of Veeries was strongly and negatively influenced by both nest predator abundance and regional abundance of Veeries. Thus, the strong relationship between nest predator abundance and nest survival observed in Veeries does not extend to Ovenbirds. These sympatric ground-nesting songbirds differ in how nest predators influence nest survival, therefore highlighting the importance of considering species-specific differences within nesting guilds to better understand nest survival at multiple ecological levels.","[Kelly, Janice K.; Schmidt, Kenneth A.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, MS 3131, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Ostfeld, Richard S.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, NY USA; [Kelly, Janice K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Kelly, JK (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, MS 3131, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.; Kelly, JK (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jkkelly2@illinois.edu,,"Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0089588, DEB 0075277, DEB 0444585]","We thank the many assistants for their help in the field, and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies for their continued support of our research.

In communities in which predation is an important structuring process, and some predator species are commercially exploited, quantitative estimates of predation by different predator species within a guild are necessary to make even the simplest recommendations about conservation and resource management. Here, we evaluated per capita and population level components of predation intensity of three intertidal predators that feed on monospecific stands of barnacles and mussels at wave exposed sites in the rocky intertidal zone of central Chile. These prey species represent the two most distinctive stages of the mid-intertidal seascape, with mussels being competitively dominant. Our results showed that the commercially exploited gastropod Concholepas concholepas and the sea star Heliaster helianthus have similarly large per capita and population effects on the competitively dominant mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. Their per capita (by average size individual) and population effects on mussels were more than two orders of magnitude larger than those of Acanthocyclus gayi crabs and likely even larger than the effect of other predator species in this system (other crabs, whelks, birds, fish). The overall pattern of predation on barnacles was similar to that on mussels, but some differences occurred in the way different components of predation intensity were distributed across predator species. Despite the roughly similar pattern of population predation intensity between prey species, the expected consequences for the prey population, and hence the rest of the community, were acutely different for mussels and barnacles.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile","Navarrete, SA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",snavarre@genes.bio.puc.cl,"Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013",,,,,50,77,77,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2003,100,2,,,,,251,262,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.11996.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,660VN,WOS:000181854900005,,,,,2021-09-27,

We found no evidence for a negative interspecific density dependence in individual performance in either Arctic char or brown trout. In contrast, a negative intraspecific density dependence was present, especially in Arctic char. Furthermore, large brown trout condition showed a positive response to encounter rate with Arctic char (related to the density of small Arctic char). The most parsimonious interaction module to explain the Arctic char - brown trout interaction patterns in the studied system does therefore not need to include interspecific competition.

To perform such a study, in 2008 we introduced the lizard Leiocephalus carinatus, a predator (and possible food competitor) of the lizard Anolis sagrei, to seven islands having A. sagrei, with seven unmanipulated islands having A. sagrei as controls. Almost immediately, L. carinatus, which is larger and more terrestrial than A. sagrei, caused a major habitat shift in A. sagrei away from the ground and toward higher and thinner perches; focal behavioral surveys showed that on islands where its predator was introduced, A. sagrei had less conspicuous visual displays. The expected pattern for density of A. sagrei is that it would decrease markedly at first via predation from the larger lizard, but then it would increase as the habitat shift selected for individuals better able to live in higher vegetation. Data through 2015 show this pattern, but a return to previous densities (time-by-treatment interaction) was not yet significant. A previous within-generation selection study and comparative data suggest that short legs should evolve as the lizards adapt to better maneuver on the thin perches of higher vegetation. However, no indication of the expected morphological change in limb length was present through 2015. Previous studies showed A. sagrei producing many effects on lower levels of the food web, some quite large. In this study through 2012, we found significant differences only in spiders (web and ground). A possible complication is that the study site was hit by two major hurricanes in the last five years, decreasing population sizes of both lizard species and reducing the experimental perturbations. A benefit of the hurricanes, however, is that they eliminated lizards from some islands, providing the opportunity to monitor natural recolonization, the frequency of which has eco-evolutionary implications. Surveys of the 44 islands that lost lizards showed that recolonization is rather slow. To explore long-term patterns of morphological variation, we monitored morphology of 31 island populations for up to 19 years. Mean limb length oscillated across the 19-year period, both increasing and decreasing substantially, yet the net effect over that period is almost no change. In years following hurricanes, limb length increases significantly more than expected by chance.","[Schoener, Thomas W.; Spiller, David A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kolbe, Jason J.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Leal, Manuel] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Losos, Jonathan B.] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Losos, Jonathan B.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Schoener, TW (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",twschoener@ucdavis.edu; jjkolbe@uri.edu; lealm@missouri.edu; jlosos@oeb.harvard.edu; daspiller@ucdavis.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society,"We thank NSF and the National Geographic Society for support, the Bahamas government for permission to do this research, and B.

In northern Wisconsin lakes, the invading crayfish Orconectes rusticus is replacing O. virilis, the native, and O. propinquus, a previous invader. We tested the impacts of interspecific competition for food and of nonconsumptive effects of predation by largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, on growth and mortality of these three species. In competition experiments, O. virilis grew less, and O. propinquus suffered increased mortality in the presence of O, rusticus relative to single-species treatments. Orconectes rusticus was unaffected by the presence of congeners. In experiments testing nonconsumptive effects of predation, O. virilis growth declined substantially in the presence of largemouth bass, O, rusticus growth declined slightly, and O. propinquus growth was unaffected. Mortality of all three crayfishes increased in the presence of largemouth bass, with O. virilis experiencing the greatest and O. rusticus the least mortality. To explore how competition, predation, and their interaction influence species replacements, we compared a fitness index (mortality/growth = mu/g) among species across biotic interaction domains: no interaction, intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, predation by fish, fish predation with competition, and predation risk with competition. In three of six domains, O. virilis and O. propinquus had somewhat similar mu/g, but reversals in I mu/g rank between O. virilis and O. propinquus among domains occurred. These reversals are consistent with lack of unidirectionality of species replacements observed where O. virilis and O. propinquus distributions overlap. In all four interspecific interaction domains, O. rusticus had the lowest mu/g (indicating greatest fitness), which is consistent with observed unidirectional replacement of O, propinquus and O. virilis by O. rusticus. Whereas some fish management strategies might reverse the replacement of O. virilis by O. propinquus, no realistic interaction domain is likely to reverse replacement of the native species by O. rusticus.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Hill, AM (corresponding author), NE Louisiana Univ, Dept Biol, Monroe, LA 71209 USA.",,"Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021",,,,,72,143,151,4,68,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We studied the spatial distribution of four abundant spider species and three common groups of epedaphic Collembola prey in a beech-dominated (Fagus sylvatica) forest floor habitat and related the observed patterns to environmental heterogeneity, overall predator activity (all ground beetles and spiders) and prey availability (all Collembola) at the local scale. Spiders and epedaphic Collembola were sampled over 392 days in a spatially explicit design based on a regular grid of 25 pitfall traps (inter-trap distance 100 m). Environmental heterogeneity was characterized by cover of moss and litter as well as the amount of dead wood at each trap location. We first used the index of dispersion to characterize the spatial distribution of spider species and Collembola and then related the observed patterns to environmental heterogeneity, predator and prey availability while testing for spatial autocorrelation within the same models. All taxa were significantly more aggregated than expected from the assumption of random distribution. The distribution of spider species was positively (Coelotes terrestris) or negatively (Tenuiphantes zimmermanni and Tapinocyba insecta) related to the cover of moss and negatively related to litter cover (C. terrestris) or the local availability of prey (T. insecta). The distribution of Collembola was negatively related to local litter cover (Lepidocyrtus spp.) and positively related to the amount of medium deadwood pieces (all other Entomobryidae). Our study suggests that none of the spider species preferred areas of low overall predator activity density. Moreover, it does not indicate association of spider species to prey-rich areas at the analyzed scale of WO m. It further highlights the importance of environmental heterogeneity, as different habitat properties differentially affected the local activity density of spiders and Collembola and thus considerably contributed to the understanding of distribution patterns.

Eudiaptomus gracilis, which was not present in Italy before the 1980s, is becoming established in an increasing number of Northern Italian lakes, ultimately replacing the endemic E. padanus. Coexistence of the two species in Lake Candia lasted only 7 months, suggesting that species replacement was determined either by environmental changes or by strong competition. To assess whether the potential for interspecific competition existed and to identify species' traits which could explain the competitive superiority of E. gracilis, we examined field seasonal patterns, reproductive parameters and body size of the two species. E. padanus abundance was probably reduced by predation and parasitism, which favoured the displacement of the species shortly after invasion by E. gracilis. The temporarily underexploited niche provided an opportunity for the successful establishment of the invader. The reproductive patterns of the two species were found to be similar in most of their features, with the exception of a markedly larger clutch size and a smaller egg volume in the resident species. By contrast, the invader showed a higher adult:egg ratio and a lower death rate. Thus, despite the greater fecundity of E. padanus, the competitive success of the invader might be attributable to interspecific differences in developmental rates and/or juvenile mortality.","CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, I-28922 Verbania, Italy","Riccardi, N (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, Largo Tonolli 50, I-28922 Verbania, Italy.",n.riccardi@ise.cnr.it,"Riccardi, Nicoletta/G-1756-2013; Riccardi, Nicoletta Rita/ABD-3351-2020","Riccardi, Nicoletta/0000-0002-5297-3387; Riccardi, Nicoletta Rita/0000-0002-5297-3387",,,,58,13,14,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

More than 30% of all dipterocarp seedlings survived 1.5 y after mast fruiting. When all species were analysed together, we found that initial seedling height, canopy openness and conspecific seedling density affected dipterocarp seedling survival. Negative density dependence indicated that predators were not satiated, but dipterocarp seedlings rather suffered from host-specific natural enemies or intraspecific competition. Species-level analyses of seven dipterocarp species showed large variation in response to biotic and abiotic factors. These results suggest that interspecific differences in the relative importance of biotic and abiotic effects on seedling survival might contribute to species coexistence.","[Oshima, Chiaki] Nagoya Univ, Fac Agr, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Tokumoto, Yuji; Nakagawa, Michiko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Nakagawa, M (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",miko@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Tokumoto, Yuji/AAG-9495-2019","Tokumoto, Yuji/0000-0001-5934-026X","Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [D-04]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20687002, 23255002, 26660124]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [226034]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26660124] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank the Forest Department Sarawak and Sarawak Forestry Corporation for permitting research activities in Lambir Hills National Park, and researchers and local people for helping with field survey.

Trays provisioned with oat seed were set out in the field at dawn and dusk, and the amount of seed consumed (with re-provisioning) was determined over three consecutive nights and days. Experiments simultaneously evaluated the role of lunar phase, season, and microhabitat (shrub vs. open); additionally, artificial exclosures (similar to0.56 ha) were employed to evaluate the influence both of mammalian and avian predators and of a dominant competitor species, the large diurnal degu (Octodon degus). Other principal small mammals included Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini) and the olive field mouse (Akodon olivaceus). Trays were enclosed by hardware-cloth cages with either small or large holes in the side to exclude avian consumers and provide selective access to all small mammals (large holes) or to exclude the largest species (small holes). Small-mammal population sizes varied greatly throughout the study. Principal factors affecting seed consumption rates were population size, followed by season (winter > summer), and microhabitat (shrub > open). The role of the latter factors was relatively minor in 1999 and 2000 but amplified greatly in the final year of study when small-mammal numbers increased five-fold. In contrast to earlier work at this site, predation had minimal direct effects on foraging activities, although significant effects of microhabitat, lunar phase, and season suggest the importance of perceived predator risk. Both Phyllotis and Akodon foraged more in the absence of degus, and two- and three-way interactions further supported an important role for competition in this system. The combination of large-scale predator/ competitor manipulations with fine-scale foraging experiments and long-term replication illustrates the importance of utilizing such approaches to gain insights to behavior and foraging strategies in variable environments.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile","Kelt, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",dakelt@ucdavis.edu,"Self, Casey J/B-6871-2011",,,,,36,40,41,3,41,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2004,85,2,,,,,383,397,,10.1890/02-4065,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,801PV,WOS:000220108700010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Nevertheless, little is known about how mammals discriminate between apparently similar foods of different quality. Here, we compared the foraging behavior of Chinese white-bellied rats, Niviventer confucianus, and Edwards's long-tailed giant rats, Leopoldamys edwardsi, under natural conditions in the field and in a captive enclosure without predation/competition. We examined the behavioral processes involved in discriminating between sound (i.e., undamaged) and insect larvae-infested nuts of seguin chestnuts (Castanea seguinii) and demonstrated that both rats could discriminate nut quality, where nut examination improved the rats' success rate at selecting sound nuts. Despite similar extents of discrimination-derived benefit in both settings for each species, differences between species-specific discrimination processes were identified. Chinese white-bellied rats engaged in a higher relative frequency and longer duration of nut examination in the enclosure than in the wild. This indicates that they alter their feeding strategy to trade-off selection for nut quality in captivity for a quantity-driven strategy in the field. In contrast, giant rats showed a consistent relative frequency of nut examination in both experimental settings. Their fixed strategy balanced food quality and quantity primarily to maximize caloric uptake without compromise when faced with predation or competition risk. We posit that this behavioral difference in optimal foraging between rat species is mediated by their differing, size-dependent energetic requirements as well as the higher competition pressure and predation risk faced by the approximately 8 times smaller white-bellied rats.","[Chen, Wenwen; Sun, Shucun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, 163 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenwen; Zhang, Ze; Xie, Zongqiang; Zhou, Youbing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Buesching, Christina D.; Newman, Chris; Macdonald, David W.; Zhou, Youbing] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England","Sun, S (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, 163 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",shcs@nju.edu.cn,"Zhou, Youbing/S-6079-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31470491, 31500359]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos 31470491, 31500359).",,67,5,6,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The finding that the strength of interference may depend on resource density contradicts the hypothesis that the functional response is ratio-dependent (Arditi and Akcakaya 1990). The formulation for interference from Hassell and Varley (1969), and the models of Beddington (1975), Ruxton et al. (1992) and Holmgren (1995), also assume that the strength of interference is independent of resource density.

In the first experiment, combined effects of chlorpyrifos and different levels of intraspecific and interspecific interaction were assessed on Gammarus pulex survival using Asellus aquaticus as an interacting species. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions increased the time to extinction of G. pulex up to a factor of 2, most likely because of the cannibalistic nature of G. pulex and its intraguild predation on A. aquaticus under stress conditions. In the second experiment, combined effects of chlorpyrifos and intraspecific and interspecific interaction were assessed on Daphnia pulex abundance using Brachionus calyciflorus as a competing species and Chaoborus sp. larvae as a predator. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions significantly affected the D. pulex population structure, but they did not influence the total population size. Predation decimated D. pulex abundance; however, interacting effects of predation and chlorpyrifos exposure were less noticeable at high exposure concentrations because of the reduced predatory efficiency of Chaoborus sp. larvae. The present study shows that species interactions do not always increase the vulnerability of aquatic populations to chemical stress and that some interactions (e.g., cannibalism and intraguild predation) or reduced predator grazing pressure can alleviate competition and predation stress on population-level insecticide effects under food-limiting conditions.

Although spiders can colonise ecosystems by air, dispersal capabilities differ among spider species. Web-building spiders are thought to balloon at higher rates than hunting spiders. Spider success in agricultural systems may also depend on habitat preferences. Few studies have examined the success of aerially dispersing spiders in crop systems, and information about the dispersal capabilities of spiders in putative source habitats is limited. 2. Spiders were monitored in the air and on the foliage of vineyards and adjacent oak woodland in order to compare the aerial spider faunas between these disparate habitats and to determine whether highly dispersive species contributed disproportionately to the spider community in vineyards. 3. The results show that most aerially dispersing spiders in both habitats were web-building dwarf spiders, Erigone spp. (Linyphiidae), although hunting spiders were also well represented in the air, especially in oak woodland. Most woodland spiders in the air appeared to be residents of oak woodland and probably dispersed only short distances. 4. Conversely, only a subset of the aerial spider fauna established in vineyards in high numbers. Spiders that dominated the aerial fauna were under-represented on vineyard foliage, whereas several hunting spiders dispersed aerially at low rates but dominated vineyard spider composition. 5. These results suggest that aerial dispersal ability may allow spiders to reach crop systems, but that establishment depends on habitat preferences and/or competitive ability.","[Hogg, Brian N.] USDA ARS, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, 800 Buchanan St, Albany, CA 94710 USA; [Hogg, Brian N.; Daane, Kent M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Hogg, BN (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, 800 Buchanan St, Albany, CA 94710 USA.",brian.hogg@ars.usda.gov,,,van den Bosch Memorial Scholarship; American Vineyard Foundation; California Table Grape Commission; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0710434],"We thank landowners for access to sites, and Tian Hu for help with field and laboratory work.

Only the first two hypotheses have been fairly well studied. To test the predator-removal hypothesis as a force determining IGP in avian predators, we performed a field experiment to simulate the presence of an IG predator (eagle owl Bubo bubo dummy) in the surrounding of the nests of four potential IG prey (black kite Milvus migrans, red kite Milvus milvus, booted eagle Aquila pennata and common buzzard Buteo buteo). To discard the possibility that an aggressive reaction towards the eagle owl was not related to the presence of the IG predator, we also presented a stuffed tawny owl Strix aluco, which is a potential competitor but cannot be considered an IG predator of the studied diurnal raptors considered in the experiment. While almost always ignoring the tawny owl, raptors chiefly showed an interspecific aggressive behaviour towards their IG predator. Our results seem to support the predator-removal hypothesis, as the IG prey may take advantage of the diurnal inactivity of the IG predator to remove it from their territory. However, the recorded behaviour may be also considered as a special variety of mobbing (i.e. a prey's counter-strategy against its predator), where the mobber is sufficiently powerful to escalate predator harassment into deliberate killing attempts. In their turn, eagle owls can respond with an IG predatory behaviour aimed at removing IG prey species which are highly aggressive mobbers.","[Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo] Univ Evora, LabOr Lab Ornithol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Lourenco, Rui; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo] Univ Evora, Inst Mediterranean Agr & Environm Sci, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Lourenco, Rui; Penteriani, Vincenzo; del Mar Delgado, Maria] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Penteriani, Vincenzo] Univ Helsinki, Zool Museum, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [del Mar Delgado, Maria] Univ Helsinki, Metapopulat Res Grp, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Marchi-Bartolozzi, Michela] Bourne Bridge Cottages, Little Abington, Cambridge CB21 6AN, England","Lourenco, R (corresponding author), Univ Evora, LabOr Lab Ornithol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",ruifazendalourenco@gmail.com,"Lourenco, Rui F/B-7148-2012; Rabaca, Joao Eduardo/A-7851-2011","Lourenco, Rui F/0000-0001-7694-0478; Delgado, Maria del Mar/0000-0002-3009-738X; Rabaca, Joao E./0000-0002-2196-3709","Consejeria de Medio Ambiente, Junta de AndaluciaJunta de Andalucia [700/2005/M/00./]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [BD/27434/2006]; Ministry of Education and Science, C.S.I.C.

Host immunity is not only shaped by direct interactions among species, but also many indirect cascading effects. By reducing competition, predators in particular can affect resource acquisition necessary for hosts to mount energetically costly immune responses. However, identifying the links between predators and host immune responses determined by resource acquisition is a complex affair, because predators can (1) reduce host density and thus competition among hosts, (2) exert non-consumptive trait-mediated effects on host resource acquisition behavior, and (3) generate natural selection on host resource acquisition behavior. To examine the relative contributions of these potential predator driven density- and trait-mediated effects on a key aspect of immune function (total phenoloxidase activity, total PO), we conducted mesocosm and field experiments with larval damselflies (Enallagma signatum) and their dominant fish predator (Lepomis macrochirus). Although we expected to observe declines in total PO activity with increases in damselfly density, we found no relationship between density and total PO activity. We also found no support for the prediction that total PO activity would vary as a result of either non-consumptive trait-mediated effects or selection on damselfly foraging activity underlying resource acquisition. Despite the lack of trait- or density-mediated effects, we did find that total PO activity increased with damselfly prey density among lakes, implying resource limitation for this aspect of immune function. These unexpected results point to the need to better understand the ecological conditions whereby predators and competitors constrain immune functions necessary for species to defend themselves in complex food webs.","[Hasik, Adam Z.; Tye, Simon P.; Ping, Taylor; Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, SCEN 601,850 W Dickson St, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Hasik, AZ (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, SCEN 601,850 W Dickson St, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",azhasik@uark.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1748945]; Arkansas Biosciences Institute,This work was supported by NSF (DEB 1748945) awarded to AMS and by Arkansas Biosciences Institute.,,92,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Unglazed ceramic tiles were colonized by algae in grazer-free troughs for 30 d at slow (approximately 20 cm s-1) and fast (approximately 40 cm s-1) velocities before transfer to open troughs of similar velocity, where they were exposed to grazer densities ranging from ca 0.7 to 2.7 times natural streambed densities. At low velocity, algal biomass (chl-a and particulate C) and absolute densities of bacillariophytes, chlorophytes and cyanophytes declined as grazer density increased. Grazers also significantly altered algal assemblage structure by reducing the relative abundance of cyanophytes (mostly Anabaena cf. affinis) and chlorophytes (Ulothrix zonata) and increasing the relative abundance of some bacillariophytes (Cocconeis placentula, Fragilaria pinnata, F. vaucheriae, Melosira italica). The algal assemblage was effectively converted from a ''late-successional'' to an ''early-successional'' stage by grazers. By contrast, at high velocity, initial algal density was relatively low and grazers were less effective in inducing changes. As grazer density increased, total algal cell abundance (mostly bacillariophytes) declined, although the relative abundances of individual diatom species remained unmodified under increasing grazer densities. Grazers essentially maintained the ''early-successional'' nature of the algal assemblage under high velocity conditions. Further, for both current velocities, we tested a model that predicts algal biomass as a function of grazer density and time. Independent estimates of current-dependent grazing rate and algal growth rate were used in the model to generate predictions of particulate C along a gradient of grazer density at two current velocities. Algal biomass predicted by the model compared favorably with an empirical fit of the data under low and high velocities. These results suggest that the role of grazers in structuring algal assemblages may vary spatially with local current velocity in heterogeneous stream systems.","COLORADO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, FT COLLINS, CO 80523 USA",,,"Poff, Nathan L/C-1239-2009","Poff, N LeRoy/0000-0002-1390-8742",,,,49,54,54,1,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1995,72,2,,,,,179,188,,10.2307/3546220,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QN425,WOS:A1995QN42500003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Both snails and tadpoles feed on periphytic algae and, thus, there should be a large potential for competitive interactions to occur between these two distantly related taxa. In a field experiment we examined the relative strength of competition between two closely related snail species, Lymnaea stagnalis and L. peregra, and between L. stagnalis and tadpoles of the common frog, Rana temporaria. Snail growth and egg production and tadpole size at and time to metamorphosis were determined. Effects on the common food source, periphyton, were monitored with the aid of artificial substrates. Periphyton dry weight was dramatically reduced in the presence of snails and/or tadpoles. There were no competitive effects on growth or egg production of the two snail species when they were coexisting. Mortality of L. peregra was high (95%) after reproduction, but independent of treatment. Growth of L. stagnalis was reduced only at the highest tadpole densities, whereas egg production was reduced both by intraspecific competition and by competition with tadpoles. Differences in egg production were retained after tadpole metamorphosis. Tadpole larval period increased, weight of metamorphosing frogs decreased and growth rate was reduced as a function of increasing tadpole density. However, contrary to expectation, snails had a positive effect on tadpole larval period, weight and growth rate. Further, in experimental containers without snails there was a dense growth of the filamentous green alga Cladophora sp. We suggest that the facilitative effects of snails on tadpoles are due to an indirect mutualistic mechanism, involving competition between food sources of different quality (microalgae and Cladophora sp.) and tadpoles being competitively dominant over snails for the preferred food source (microalgae). In the presence of tadpoles snails will be forced to feed on low-quality Cladophora, increasing nutrient turnover rates, which results in enhanced productivity of microalgae, increasing tadpole food resources. Thus, tadpoles have a negative effect on snails through resource depression, while snails facilitate tadpole growth through an indirect enhancement of food availability.",,"BRONMARK, C (corresponding author), UNIV LUND,DEPT ECOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,78,77,80,1,48,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,87,1,,,,,8,18,,10.1007/BF00323774,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR962,WOS:A1991FR96200002,28313346,,,,2021-09-27,

Two lines of evidence from previous work suggest that L. triangularis affects populations of the native linyphiid spider Frontinella communis. First, F. communis individuals are relatively scarce in both forest and coastal habitat where L. triangularis is common, but more common where L. triangularis is at low density. Second, in field experiments, F. communis species are less likely to settle in experimental plots when L. triangularis is present, and F. communis disappears from study plots when L. triangularis is introduced. Here we test two mechanisms that may underlie these patterns. First, we tested whether L. triangularis invades and usurps the webs of F. communis. When spiders were released onto webs of heterospecifics, L. triangularis was more likely to take over or share webs of F. communis than the reverse. We also observed natural takeovers of F. communis webs. Second, we explored the hypothesis that L. triangularis reduces prey availability for native species. We sampled flying prey in areas with L. triangularis and those where it had been removed, and found no effect of spider presence on measured prey density. We also found no effect of prey supplementation on web tenacity in F. communis, suggesting that F. communis movements are not highly dependent on prey availability. We conclude that web takeover is likely more important than prey reduction in driving negative effects of L. triangularis on F. communis.","[Houser, Jeremy D.] Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Neurosci & Behav, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Ginsberg, Howard] Univ Rhode Isl, US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Coastal Field Stn, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Jakob, Elizabeth M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Psychol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Jakob, EM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Psychol, Tobin Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",ejakob@psych.umass.edu,,,NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; American Arachnological Society; National Park Service; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey,"We greatly appreciate helpful comments from reviewers of earlier versions of the manuscript: R.

Hence, an individual may be prey when juvenile, but as an adult, it may counterattack the juveniles of its childhood enemy. Earlier, we showed that juvenile predatory mites, Iphiseius degenerans, recognize adults of another predatory mite species that attacked and killed conspecifics of the juveniles. Upon becoming adult, these former juveniles showed an increase in attacks on juveniles of their enemy. Here, we tested whether adult females of I. degenerans show a similar response after witnessing attack on conspecific juveniles in the presence of suitable alternative food (i.e. pollen). We used three predatory mite species involved in reciprocal intraguild predation. We found mixed results: the rate of attack on juveniles of one species of predator, Neoseiulus cucumeris, did increase after witnessing the killing of conspecific juveniles, but the rate of attack on juveniles of another species, Amblyseius swirskii, did not increase after such an experience. Furthermore, we found no conclusive evidence for species-specific antipredator responses. It is unlikely that cues of previous predation events affected the behaviour of adult predatory mites, because the trials were conducted on new experimental arenas free of predation cues. We conclude that adult predatory mites can change their antipredator behaviour in response to having witnessed predation on vulnerable juvenile conspecifics.

However, few studies conducted in coastal marine habitats have evaluated whether the effects of landscape structure on species interactions and organismal behavior are consistent across the range of an organism, over which landscape context and the strength of species interactions typically vary. American lobster (Homarus americanus) juveniles seek refuge from predators within shallow rocky habitat but make short-distance movements to forage outside of shelter. We evaluated how the patchiness of cobble habitat influences juvenile lobster movement by conducting mark-recapture experiments on lobsters placed within patchy and contiguous cobble plots in three regions of New England among which risk of predation and intraspecific shelter competition vary (Rhode Island, mid-coast Maine, and eastern Maine, USA). We also evaluated whether habitat patchiness influenced lobster colonization of plots and whether lobster fidelity to individual shelters corresponds to variability in predator abundance and conspecific density among regions. Cobble patchiness reduced rates of lobster movement in all three regions in 2004 and in two of three regions in 2005, despite large differences in landscape context among regions. Region had much larger effects on lobster colonization than did patchiness, but patchy plots were colonized at higher rates than were contiguous plots where lobster densities were highest. Fidelity to shelter was higher in regions with low conspecific density (Rhode Island and eastern Maine) than in mid-coast Maine where conspecific density is high and where unmarked lobsters often occupied shelters vacated by marked lobsters. Our results indicate that cobble patchiness influences juvenile lobster movement at small scales, but that the effects of patchiness on movement were consistent across much of the range of the American lobster despite strong regional variation in predator abundance and conspecific density.","[Hovel, Kevin A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Wahle, Richard A.] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, Boothbay Harbor, ME 04575 USA","Hovel, KA (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",hovel@sciences.sdsu.edu,"Wahle, Richard/AAI-3047-2020",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Undersea Research Program,"We thank J.

Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina are major consumers of biomass in the eastern region of the Southern Ocean and have been declining in numbers since the 1960s. Previous studies have identified evidence for habitat and diet partitioning over a range of spatial and temporal scales between juveniles and adults in the Macquarie Island population. We first analysed the stable isotopes (SI) of 6 entire vibrissae from a dead adult female southern elephant seal from Kerguelen Islands to determine moult and growth patterns. Secondly we analysed the SI from the vibrissae of 102 juvenile southern elephant seals to investigate diet. The results from the growth pattern analysis indicated that vibrissae do not grow or moult simultaneously. However, it is likely that at least part of the vibrissae will have been produced sometime during the most recent trip to sea and will give a broad indication of diet. The subsequent SI analysis confirmed that juveniles are consuming greater proportions of fish species, and identified myctophids as the primary component of juvenile diet. Myctophids are also consumed by king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus which have greatly increased in numbers recently in the Macquarie Island area. This may have presented the juvenile southern elephant seals with increased competition and may influence survival.","[Newland, China; Field, Iain C.; McMahon, Clive R.; Hindell, Mark A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Antarctic Wildlife Res Unit, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Field, Iain C.] Macquarie Univ, Grad Sch Environm, Marine Mammal Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Cherel, Yves; Guinet, Christophe] CNRS, UPR 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Bradshaw, Corey J.

However, recovery success may be hampered by focusing on plant communities, rather than the complex suite of direct and indirect interactions among trophic levels that occur in natural systems. Through a factorial field experiment, we tested the effects of wetland restoration on egg and juvenile survival of a locally rare butterfly, Satyrodes appalachia, via tree removal and damming. Tree removal more than tripled S. appalachia host plant abundance, but neither restoration action directly affected S. appalachia egg and juvenile survival. Instead, we found strong indirect effects of habitat manipulation on S. appalachia egg and juvenile survival that were mediated through predation. The interaction of tree removal and damming significantly decreased predation of S. appalachia eggs relative to each treatment alone. Damming alone had a significant positive indirect effect on the survival of S. appalachia juveniles, likely because increases in standing water reduced predator access. Our results emphasize the need for experiments that evaluate the demographic responses of imperiled species to habitat restoration prior to management action and quantify potential indirect effects mediated through higher trophic levels.","[Aschehoug, Erik T.; Sivakoff, F.

The aims were to determine the: (i) current leopard density in Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS) and (ii) diet, prey selection and predation impact of leopard in SWS. The density, estimated using spatially explicit capture-recapture models, was 1.0 leopard/100km(2), 72% lower than an estimate from 2009 at the same site, and one of the lowest densities ever reported in Asia. Dietary analysis of 73 DNA confirmed scats showed leopard consumed 13 prey species, although ungulates comprised 87% of the biomass consumed (BC). The overall main prey (42% BC) was banteng (Bos javanicus), making this the only known leopard population whose main prey had adult weight greater than 500 kg. Consumption of wild pig (Sus scrofa) was also one of the highest ever reported (22% BC), indicating leopard consistently predated on ungulates with some of the largest adult weights in SWS. There were important differences in diet and prey selection between sexes, as males consumed mostly banteng (62% BC) in proportion to availability, but few muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis; 7% BC), whereas females selectively consumed muntjac (56% BC) and avoided banteng (less than 1% BC). Predation impact was low (0.5-3.2% of populations) for the three ungulate species consumed. We conclude that the Indochinese leopard is an important apex predator in SWS, but this unique population is declining at an alarming rate and will soon be eradicated unless effective protection is provided.","[Rostro-Garcia, Susana; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Kamler, Jan F.] Panthera, 8 West 40th St,18th Floor, New York, NY 10018 USA; [Crouthers, Rachel; Prum, Sovanna; In, Visattha; Pin, Chanratana] World Wide Fund Nat Cambodia, St 352,Boeun Keng Kang I, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Sopheak, Keo; Prum, Sovanna] Prov Dept Environm, Mondulkiri, Sen Monorom, Cambodia; [Caragiulo, Anthony] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Sackler Inst Comparat Genom, 79th St Cent Pk West, New York, NY 10024 USA","Rostro-Garcia, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.",rostro.susana@gmail.com,"Kamler, Jan F/F-8520-2011",,"Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund; People's Trust for Endangered Species; Taronga Foundation; Iris Darnton Foundation; WWF Cambodia; Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford; A Kirk Turner Scholarship","This study was conducted as part of a Post-diploma Scholarship for S.R.G. given by the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford.

One little-studied scenario is that invasive species affect parasite transmission to native hosts by altering the relative abundance of hosts needed in parasite life cycles, for example by predation on these hosts. Here we show that presence of an invasive crayfish species, Pacifastacus leniusculus, decreases the mean abundance of native parasites transmitted from snails and aquatic isopods to perch, Perca fluviatilis, in two large boreal lakes in Finland. In contrast, parasites transmitted to the fish from planktonic copepods or mussels, hosts not readily preyed on by crayfish, were not affected by crayfish presence. We suggest that the effect of crayfish on native parasite fauna of fish is mediated via complex effects on invertebrate populations. Hence, our study provides an example of how the indirect ecological effects of species introductions can extend beyond the generally anticipated direct effects, predation and competition.","[Pulkkinen, Katja; Ruokonen, Timo J.; Mykra, Marjut; Tambe, Gordon; Karjalainen, Juha; Hamalainen, Heikki] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Pulkkinen, K (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",katja.pulkkinen@jyu.fi,"Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015; Hamalainen, Heikki/V-7868-2019","Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174; Ruokonen, Timo/0000-0001-5970-4350; Pulkkinen, Katja/0000-0002-1480-2464",Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation; Finnish Game and Fisheries Institute; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural Foundation,"We thank Simo Jalli, Pasi Laulumaa, Juho Haatanen and Kimmo Sivonen for assistance with the field work and Markku Pursiainen from Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute for valuable support in planning the study.

In laboratory experiments, we determined if intraguild predation occurs between Typhlodromalus manihoti and Eusehis fustis, two phytoseiid mite predators of the cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa on cassava in Africa, and if the level of intraguild predation is affected by the availability of the primary prey, M. tanajoa, and maize pollen as alternative non-prey food. In the laboratory, the two predators attacked and killed heterospecific larvae but they did so only when prey mites and alternative food (maize pollen) were absent or scarce. On a diet of intraguild prey alone, the two predator species survived for several days but failed to reproduce. Addition of abundant levels of M. tanajoa and maize pollen increased survival and reproduction of the two predator species and reduced intraguild predation to very low levels. We then determined, on whole plants in pot experiments in a screenhouse, the effect of maize pollen (an alternative food) on the interactions between the two predator species and the impact of predator predator interactions on suppression of M tanajoa population densities. In single predator species treatments, both E fustis and T manihoti significantly reduced ill. tanajoa densities; but surprisingly, E fustis appeared to be superior to T manihoti. The co-presence of the two predators on the same cassava plant resulted in similar suppression of M tanajoa population densities, but greater suppression of M. tanajoa compared with T manihoti alone, regardless of presence or absence of maize pollen. The presence of the two predator species together reduced their respective abundance compared with single predator species treatments. Addition of maize pollen, however, significantly increased densities of the generalist predator E fustis, in both single and two predator species treatments; and tilted the balance of the interactions between the two predator species in favour of E fustis. The findings of our research underscore the role of generalist predators like E fustis in the suppression of M. tanajoa populations on cassava, and the potential role of alternative nonprey food in altering the interactions between co-occurring predators sharing the same primary prey (by favouring the generalist predators), and the effect of these interactions on suppression of population densities of the shared primary prey.

However, because of the difficulty or cost of evaluating these factors, habitat assessments may not include valuable information on important habitat attributes including the abundance and distribution of prey, predators, and competitors. Fishers (Pekania pennanti) are one of the most commonly reintroduced carnivores in North America, and they are a species of conservation concern in their western range. We examined the relative importance of landscape features and species interactions in determining habitat use of a reintroduced population of fishers in the southern Cascade Mountains, Washington, USA. We used detections of prey and predators at 134 remote camera stations, remotely sensed forest structure data, and telemetry locations of fishers in a resource selection function to assess the relative importance of prey, predators, and forest structure in fisher habitat selection. Fishers selected habitats based on forest conditions and activity levels of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), whereas bobcat (Lynx rufus) and coyote (Canis latrans) activity levels did not directly affect habitat selection. The probability of fisher use increased in older stands, close to recently disturbed stands, and in areas with intermediate levels of hare activity. Bobcat and hare activity levels were positively correlated, and fishers avoided areas with the greatest hare activity, suggesting that fishers may experience a food-safety tradeoff in the study area. Temporal activity patterns in photo detections indicate that fishers may mediate this danger by avoiding bobcats temporally. Our findings suggest that fishers in Washington prefer habitat mosaics of old and recently disturbed stands where they have greater access to resting structures and hares. Management that maintains mosaics of young and old forest across large landscapes is likely to support fisher recovery. Future reintroduction efforts would benefit from an assessment of prey and predator abundance in proposed reintroduction areas before project initiation.

While the predatory and competitive roles of NIS in aquatic environments are commonly studied, their role as a prey item for native predators is often overlooked. As the northern Baltic Sea lacks native crabs, the omnivorous estuarine Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) is a novel invader to the system and provides an opportunity to observe how the species enters the prey field of predatory fish. In fall 2013, 1185 stomachs from 17 fish species were dissected and analyzed for the presence of R. harrisii. Fishermen had previously reported finding crabs mostly in the stomachs of perch (Perca fluviatilis), a frequent catch in recreational and commercial fisheries, but our study also found large numbers of crabs in four-horned sculpins (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) and small numbers in other species' stomachs (Rutilus rutilus, Leuciscus ide, Gymnocephalus cernuus, and Blicca bjoerkna). In the study area occupied by R. harrisii, four-horned sculpins were the most frequent predator, with 83% having at least one crab in their stomach. In comparison, 7% of perch and roach had consumed R. harrisii. Most crabs eaten were 10-12 mm (carapace width), despite broader size range available (1-26 mm). Predation on R. harrisii in this system may be limited by the predators' gape size (i.e., physical feeding restriction). These results highlight the need to understand the role of novel invasive species as prey items for native species, ultimately increase understanding of whether native predators can control NIS populations.","[Puntila-Dodd, Riikka] Finnish Environm Inst, Marine Res Ctr, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Puntila-Dodd, Riikka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Aquat Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Loisa, Olli] Turku Univ Appl Sci, Fac Technol & Business, Lemminkaisenkatu 30, Turku 20520, Finland; [Riipinen, Katariina] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Fowler, Amy E.] George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, 4400 Univ Dr MS 5F2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Puntila-Dodd, R (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst, Marine Res Ctr, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland.",riikka.puntila-dodd@ymparisto.fi,,"Puntila, Riikka/0000-0002-9843-9112; Fowler, Amy/0000-0003-4876-597X",Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE); city of Turku; city of Kaarina; Maj and Tor Nessling's foundation; BONUS BIO C3 project; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Academy of Finland; Walter and Andree de Nottbeck Foundation Summer Research Fellowship,"Open access funding provided by Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE).

Although not yet studied in the field, the distribution and abundance of Andalusian toothcarp are thought to be strongly influenced by interspecific interactions. We analysed the abundance and microhabitat use of Andalusian toothcarp in two water courses, one in which several other fish species occurred (sympatric site) and one hypersaline stream in which toothcarp was the only species present (allopatric site). Fish were sampled using plastic minnow traps and results were analysed separately for three size categories. Toothcarps were clearly more abundant in the allopatric population than in the sympatric one, though the difference was less apparent in the smallest size category. In coexistence with other species, toothcarp occupied shallower microhabitats, but in both sites in the absence of shelter fish selected deeper positions than in its absence. While in the sympatric site sheltered microhabitats were used predominately by small individuals, in the allopatric ones they were used by larger ones. Observed patterns strongly suggest that predation is the main mechanism involved in the differences in abundance and microhabitat use between sites. Our results confirm that the presence or absence of coexisting species is an important habitat feature for Andalusian toothcarp populations.","Univ Girona, Inst Ecol Aquat, Girona 17071, Spain; Univ Huelva, Dept Biol Ambiental & Salud, Huelva 21007, Spain","Clavero, M (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Inst Ecol Aquat, Girona 17071, Spain.",miguel.clavero@udg.es,"PRENDA, JOSE/K-4994-2014; Clavero, Miguel/A-9040-2015","Clavero, Miguel/0000-0002-5186-0153; Prenda, Jose/0000-0002-1505-8331",,,,43,12,14,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Although the abundance of M. hirosei larvae increased year by year, becoming the most abundant sp. after the second year, the species composition of the larval community of the established habitat was different between the West and East because of environmental factors, Such as saline concentration and reed shoot density. M. hirosei larvae had expanded their distribution to the entire area of the established habitat in 2005, while the distribution of I. senegalensis had been restricted to several patchy areas in accordance with a decrease in their population. There was a negative relationship between the number of M. hirosei and I. senegalensis larvae. The prey-predator relationship and competitive relationship between the 2 spp. should have affected the Population dynamics and distribution of M hirosei. The odonate larval community and habitat environment that is optimal for M. hirosei conservation are discussed from the viewpoint of both biotic and abiotic factors.","[Iwata, S.] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; [Watanabe, M.] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan","Watanabe, M (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan.",shukoiwa@hotmail.com; watanabe@kankyo.envr.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,Pro Natura Foundation; AEON Environmental Foundation,"We would like to thank the local government of Mic prefecture for their hospitality at the study site and for giving us research permission.

Using a long-term laboratory mesocosm experiment, we quantified competition strength and the plasticity of foraging traits in a guild of generalist predators of arthropods with a range of foraging modalities. Each mesocosm contained eight passively foraging pink sundews, and we employed an experimental design where treatments were the presence or absence of a sit-and-wait foraging spider and actively foraging toad crossed with five levels of prey abundance. We hypothesized that actively foraging toads would outcompete the other species at low prey abundance, but that spiders and sundews would exhibit plasticity in foraging traits to compensate for strong competition when prey were limited. Results generally supported our hypotheses. Toads had a greater effect on sundews at low prey abundances, and toad presence caused spiders to locate webs higher above the ground. Additionally, the closer large spider webs were to the ground, the greater the trichome densities produced by sundews. Also, spider webs were larger with than without toads and as sundew numbers increased, and these effects were more prominent as resources became limited. Finally, spiders negatively affected toad growth only at low prey abundance. These findings highlight the long-term importance of foraging modality and plasticity of foraging traits in determining the strength of competition within and across taxonomic kingdoms. Future research should assess whether plasticity in foraging traits helps to maintain coexistence within this guild and whether foraging modality can be used as a trait to reliably predict the strength of competitive interactions.","[Jennings, David E.; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, 4202 East Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Krupa, James J.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Jennings, DE (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, 4112 Plant Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",david.e.jennings@gmail.com,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Jennings, David/0000-0001-7179-3069",American Arachnological Society Grant; Fern Garden Club Scholarship; Rutlish Foundation Grant; Sigma Xi GIAR; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM109499] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Our research was supported by an American Arachnological Society Grant, Fern Garden Club Scholarship, Rutlish Foundation Grant and Sigma Xi GIAR to DEJ.

The strong increase in several arctic geese populations, primarily due to changes in agricultural practices in temperate regions, can have severe direct impacts on tundra ecosystems through vegetation degradation. However, predator-mediated negative effects of goose overabundance on other tundra species can also be significant but are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that goose abundance negatively affects arctic-nesting shorebirds by increasing nest predation pressure. We used six years of data collected within and near a greater snow goose colony (Chen caerulescens atlantica) to evaluate the effect of geese on the spatial variation in (1) the occurrence of shorebird nest predators, (2) the nest predation risk (with artificial shorebird nests), and (3) the occurrence of nesting shorebirds. We found that the goose colony had a strong influence on the spatial distribution of nest predators and nesting shorebirds. Occurrence of predators decreased, while occurrence of nesting shorebirds increased with distance from the centroid of the colony. The strength of these effects was modulated by lemming density, the preferred prey for predators. Shorebird nest predation risk also decreased with distance from the colony. Overall, these results indicate that goose abundance negatively affects arctic-nesting shorebirds through shared predators. Therefore, we show that the current decline of some arctic shorebird populations may be in part mediated by a negative effect of an overabundant species.","[Lamarre, Jean-Francois; Legagneux, Pierre; Bety, Joel] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Lamarre, Jean-Francois; Legagneux, Pierre; Bety, Joel] Univ Quebec, CEN, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, 1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, CEN, 1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Reed, Eric T.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, 5019 52nd St, Yellowknife, NT X1A 2P7, Canada; [Lamarre, Jean-Francois] CHARS, Polar Knowledge Canada, 1 Uvajuq Rd, Cambridge Bay, NU X0B 0C0, Canada","Lamarre, JF (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.; Lamarre, JF (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, CEN, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.; Lamarre, JF (corresponding author), CHARS, Polar Knowledge Canada, 1 Uvajuq Rd, Cambridge Bay, NU X0B 0C0, Canada.",jflamarre@gmail.com,,,ArcticNet; Arctic Goose Joint Venture; Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies (FRQNT); Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Natural Resources Canada (Polar Continental Shelf Program); Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); W.

However, keystone species effects can be variable, and the role of other predators without the keystone predator is not well understood. We were interested in the effects of subordinate whelk predators (Nucella ostrina, N. canaliculata) on prey following SSWD, and whelk population responses to declines of their predator and competitor P. ochraceus. We hypothesized that whelks would limit M. californianus establishment by reducing prey species facilitating its recruitment. We also predicted that whelk populations would increase and shift downshore with reduced predation threat. We addressed our questions using a whelk removal experiment started before the SSWD outbreak peak, and surveys of whelk distribution, abundance, and size structure. In the absence of P. ochraceus, whelks weakly facilitated, rather than limited, the establishment of the competitively dominant mussel but had few effects on other prey abundance. One year after SSWD onset, surveys indicated no change in whelk vertical distributions but revealed diverging patterns in abundance of whelk species. Whelk size structure shifted to smaller individuals, indicating a potentially lagged population response. Our results suggest that subordinate predators may not have strong short-term impacts on prey communities after keystone species decline. However, poor prey recruitment may have limited any whelk effects and population changes. Our study provides important context for understanding community dynamics following one of the largest marine disease outbreaks recorded.","[Cerny-Chipman, Elizabeth B.; Sullivan, Jenna M.; Menge, Bruce A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Cerny-Chipman, EB (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",cernyche@oregonstate.edu,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012","Sullivan-Stack, Jenna/0000-0003-0114-1019",David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation [475]; Kingfisher Foundation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE14-48913]; endowments from the Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation,"We acknowledge the field assistance of Angela Johnson, Jonathan Robinson, Brittany Poirson, Jerod Sapp, Allison Barner, Chenchen Shen, Alissa Rickborn, Barbara Spiecker, Alexander Carsh, Dustin Hollabaugh, Joe Stack, Kathryn Cerny-Chipman, Lacey Schrock-Purkey, Silke Bachhuber, Lindsey Sadlou, Courtney Jackson, Melissa Linn, Melissa Britsch, Trevor Baley, Kaelie Sivihok, and Skylar Peven.

The effects of trahira density (treatment groups: addition, removal, and reference) in two habitat categories (open and macrophyte-covered areas) on attributes of the fish assemblage structure were evaluated (using rm-ANOVA) over 120 days. Reductions in species richness were recorded in all assemblages and were more pronounced at the end of the experiment within macrophyte-covered areas of the lakes where H. aff. malabaricus was removed. In these lakes, the number of fish was also significantly smaller and evenness was significantly higher than in those in which trahira were added or maintained at natural densities. The increase of the relative abundance of all size classes over the first 60 days on the assemblages where trahira was present, and the decrease of the small-sized fish where trahira was absent contributed to the lack of pronounced alterations in total biomass. The absence of the predator from its preferred habitat was found to negatively affect the less abundant species, which seemed to be highly sensitive to the effects of interspecific competition among prey species. In addition to the well-known effects of hydrological seasonality, the role played by native predators might be important in determining the persistence of local species in the fish assemblages of Neotropical floodplains.","[Petry, Ana Cristina] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-27910970 Macae, RJ, Brazil; [Gomes, Luiz Carlos; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio] Univ Estadual Maringa, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Piana, Pitagoras Augusto] Univ Estadual Oeste Parana, R Fac, BR-85903000 Toledo, PR, Brazil","Petry, AC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, R Rotary Club Sn,CP 119331, BR-27910970 Macae, RJ, Brazil.",ac_petry@yahoo.com.br; lcgomes@nupelia.uem.br; pitapiana@yahoo.com.br; agostinhoaa@nupelia.uem.br,"Agostini, Angelo/D-5888-2013; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Petry, Ana/J-6851-2012; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/S-1538-2019; Inau, Inct/J-9853-2013","Agostini, Angelo/0000-0002-4707-9444; Petry, Ana/0000-0001-9039-2738; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444; gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; Piana, Pitagoras Augusto/0000-0002-4666-6663",National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [142220/2001-9],"This study is part of the PhD dissertation of ACP, in the Program of Environmental Sciences, of the Maringa State University, in the long-term program PELD Site-6.

In a field survey, crayfish were scarce when fish were abundant, suggesting that predators can adversely affect these prey. In laboratory experiments, we examined underlying mechanisms for this inverse relationship; specifically, we tested how crayfish species, adult aggression, and habitat heterogeneity influenced the predator-prey interaction. In a laboratory stream, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) ate similar numbers of equal-sized O. rusticus and O. sanborni, but when sizes mimicked those in the field (i.e., O. rusticus 4 mm > O. sanborni), fewer O. rusticus were eaten. Fish also reduced juvenile activity and behaviors whereas adult aggression increased the frequency of these risky responses. More affected by adult crayfish, O. sanborni should suffer disproportional predation where adults and juveniles interact. Thus, fish predators should increase replacement rates and adult aggression should further accelerate this process. Manifested through crayfish size, both indirect and direct predator effects contribute to the replacement of O. sanborni by O. rusticus.","OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,AQUAT ECOL LAB,COLUMBUS,OH 43210",,,,,,,,73,82,85,0,19,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Previous studies indicated grazing showed various impacts on small rodents; however, most studies were conducted over 1-2 years without controlling for confounding factors such as immigration/emigration and predation in rodents. Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are generally recognized as pests because of food overlap with domestic herbivores, but are also important for biodiversity conservation because they provide nests or food to many birds. Fully understanding the ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010-2013 to assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population density of Brandt's voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandt's voles to livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year. As compared to the control group, sheep grazing had no effect on vole abundance in the first year but an overall negative effect on vole abundance in the following 3 years. Successive grazing caused decreases in survival and male body mass of voles, but had no significant effect on fecundity. Negative effects of grazing were associated with a grazing-induced deterioration in both food quantity (reflected by biomass and cover of less-preferred plants), and food quality (measured by tannin and total phenol content). Our findings highlight the urgent need for more flexible management of yearly rotational grazing to optimize livestock production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health.","[Li, Guoliang; Yin, Baofa; Wan, Xinrong; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Guoliang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yin, Baofa; Wei, Wanhong] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guiming] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Krebs, Charles J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",Zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,"Wang, Guiming/O-8925-2019; Wang, Guiming/E-4582-2011; Li, Guoliang/AAA-9738-2019","Wang, Guiming/0000-0001-5002-0120; Wang, Guiming/0000-0001-5002-0120; ",Ministry of Science and Technology [2007CB109100]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB11050000],We thank the Maodeng Pasture of Xilinhot City and the Grassland Station of Xilingol League for their kind help in our field experiments.

We have studied whether these effects could alter the probability of local extinction of three predatory mites naturally associated with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in citrus in Spain and, therefore, disrupt the biological control of this phytophagous mite. Laboratory and semi-field results provide evidence that the natural regulation of T. urticae in citrus can be seriously disrupted in a warmer future. On the one hand, T. urticae populations at conditions representative of future hotter and drier summers, could reach higher population densities than forecasted according to its demographic parameters. On the other hand, T. urticae regulation provided by its predators depended on the environmental conditions, was species-specific, and was affected by interspecific interactions. In some cases, one of the predatory mite species in the system could not be recovered. Because there is evidence that the composition of the community under scrutiny is highly sensitive to local habitat conditions, our results can be taken as evidence that local extinctions may occur more frequently in a warmer future and further contribute to an increasingly higher frequency of T. urticae outbreaks.","[Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina; Jaques, Josep A.] UJI, Unitat Associada Entomol UJI IVIA, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Campus Riu Sec,Ave Vicent Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Ibanez-Gual, Victoria] UJI, Dept Matemat, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Montserrat, Marta] Univ Malaga, Inst Hortofruticultura Subtrop & Mediterranea La, Consejo Super Invest Cient IHSM UMA CSIC, Avda Dr Weinberg S-N, Malaga 29750, Spain; [Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina] SAU, Dept Calidad Torres Hnos & Sucs, Pol Ind Agr 2, Almenara 12590, Spain","Jaques, JA (corresponding author), UJI, Unitat Associada Entomol UJI IVIA, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Campus Riu Sec,Ave Vicent Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",josep.jaques@camn.uji.es,"Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina/F-6359-2011; Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo/K-9298-2014; Montserrat, Marta/A-7625-2012; Jaques, Josep A./B-8352-2009; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/J-7922-2017; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/AAG-1438-2020","Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina/0000-0002-1070-3741; Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo/0000-0002-6995-5468; Montserrat, Marta/0000-0002-6859-4955; Jaques, Josep A./0000-0003-1353-1727; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/0000-0001-7043-8233; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/0000-0001-7043-8233","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, MINECO [AGL2011-30538-C03-01, AGL2014-55616-C3-3-R]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, MCINNSpanish Government [EEBB-I-14-08555]","This study was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, MINECO, (Grants AGL2011-30538-C03-01 and AGL2014-55616-C3-3-R) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, MCINN, (Grant EEBB-I-14-08555).",,83,4,4,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

In the sexually dimorphic bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica, females generally forage along the tideline, whereas the smaller (and subordinate) males generally forage across dry mudflats. On this basis we predicted that interference competition would occur within, rather than between, the sexes. We tested whether density-dependent aspects of foraging behaviour are indeed sex specific and additionally examined the roles of sex-specific prey types. With increasing conspecific densities, intake rates levelled off in females, but not in males. At increasing densities, both sexes engaged in more agonistic interactions, but females more than males. Consequently, females lost more foraging time than males. However, time lost to interactions could not explain the density-dependent decrease in their intake rate. As lugworms, Arenicola marina, contributed 71% to the energy intake of females and 18% in males, we experimentally tested whether the burying behaviour of lugworms explained the sex difference in interference. Both in the field and in the laboratory, lugworms responded to probes. In experimentally probed plots in the field, lugworms produced fewer casts per unit time, indicating a decrease in near-surface presence. In laboratory settings, increased experimental probing intensity resulted in deeper burying by lugworms. We therefore argue that prey depression is responsible for most of the reduction in intake rates of females foraging at high conspecific densities. The search for undisturbed shallow-living lugworms would explain why female bar-tailed godwits tend to forage along the moving tideline. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Based on the results of the monitoring populations of G. brimblecombei and their natural enemies in inland and coastal California in the field, P. bliteus or Anthocoris nemoralis (Fabricius) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae), alone or both species together were released into cages with G. brimblecombei to simulate predatory interference on the introduced parasitoid in the laboratory. Although coastal sites had higher densities of natural enemies as were percent parasitism and predation, the mean number of G. brimblecombei did not vary between inland and coastal sites. P. bliteus or A. nemoralis significantly reduced the psyllid densities in cages. However., when both species were together, the presence of A. nemoralis increased the parasitoid mortality relative to the mortality observed in the parasitoid-alone treatment. Moreover, the increase in parasitoid mortality was followed by the decrease in mortality of the psyllids. The current study also indicated that predation risk of parasitized hosts varies depending on the developmental stages of the psyllids. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The three species showed differing tendencies to prey on each other's motile immature stages. Euseius finlandicus females consumed more larvae and protonymphs than the females of T. pyri and K. aberrans. In cages without free water E. finlandicus ate a range of 6.51 larvae or 5.31 protonymphs of T. pyri and 5.27 larvae or 5.95 protonymphs of K. aberrans per female per day. Kampimodromus aberrans and T. pyri females exhibited a greater tendency to prey on heterospecifics than on conspecifics. When feeding on phytoseiid immatures and without free water, T. pyri females survived longer and laid more eggs than the females of E. finlandicus and K. aberrans. Adult females of E. finlandicus and T. pyri having free water and preying on heterospecific protonymphs were able to maintain egg laying during the whole experimental period of 12 days. The females of all three species had difficulties in piercing phytoseiid eggs, and the number of sucked eggs per female per day was low. Kampimodromus aberrans females ate 0.48 eggs of T. pyri daily, which was the highest recorded number. The great tendency to interspecific predation on motile immature phytoseiids by the females of E. finlandicus is discussed with regard to the dominance of this species on deciduous trees and bushes in Austria.",,"Schausberger, P (corresponding author), INST PHYTOMED,BUNDESAMT FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM LANDWIRTSCHAFT,SPARGELFELDSTR 191,A-1226 VIENNA,AUSTRIA.",,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",,,,53,130,142,0,6,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Intra-specific variation in plant defence traits has been shown to profoundly affect herbivore community structure. Here we describe two experiments designed to test whether similar effects occur at higher trophic levels, by studying pea aphid-natural enemy interactions in a disused pasture in southern England. 2. In the first experiment, the numbers and identity of natural enemies attacking different monoclonal pea aphid colonies were recorded in a series of assays throughout the period of pea aphid activity. 3. In the summer assay, there was a significant effect of clone on the numbers of aphidophagous hoverfly larvae and the total number of non-hoverfly natural enemies recruited. Clone also appeared to influence the attack rate suffered by the primary predator in the system, the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, by Diplazon laetatorius, an ichneumonid parasitoid. Colonies were generally driven to extinction by hoverfly attack, resulting in the recording of low numbers of parasitoids and entomopathogens, suggesting intense intra-guild predation. 4. To further examine the influence of clonal variation on the recruitment of natural enemies, a second experiment was performed to monitor the temporal dynamics of community development. Colonies were destructively sampled every other day and the numbers of natural enemies attacking aphid colonies were recorded. These data demonstrated that clonal variation influenced the timing, abundance, and identity of natural enemies attacking aphid colonies. 5. Taken together, these data suggest that clonal variation may have a significant influence on the patterns of interactions between aphids and their natural enemies, and that such effects are likely to affect our understanding of the ecology and biological control of these insect herbivores.","[Hazell, Steaphan P.; Fellowes, Mark D.

The potential effects of these changes on intertidal, meiofaunal assemblages were investigated using a mesocosm experiment. Artificial Substrate Units containing meiofauna from the extreme low intertidal zone were exposed for 60 days to eight experimental treatments (four replicates for each treatment) comprising four pH levels: 8.0 (ambient control), 7.7 & 7.3 (predicted changes associated with ocean acidification), and 6.7 (CO2 point-source leakage from geological storage), crossed with two temperatures: 12 degrees C (ambient control) and 16 degrees C (predicted). Community structure, measured using major meiofauna taxa was significantly affected by pH and temperature. Copepods and copepodites showed the greatest decline in abundance in response to low pH and elevated temperature. Nematodes increased in abundance in response to low pH and temperature rise, possibly caused by decreased predation and competition for food owing to the declining macrofauna density. Nematode species composition changed significantly between the different treatments, and was affected by both seawater acidification and warming. Estimated nematode species diversity, species evenness, and the maturity index, were substantially lower at 16 degrees C, whereas trophic diversity was slightly higher at 16 degrees C except at pH 6.7. This study has demonstrated that the combination of elevated levels of CO2 and ocean warming may have substantial effects on structural and functional characteristics of meiofaunal and nematode communities, and that single stressor experiments are unlikely to encompass the complexity of abiotic and biotic interactions. At the same time, ecological interactions may lead to complex community responses to pH and temperature changes in the interstitial environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It has spread rapidly since its discovery in the USA in 1988 and has become the dominant crab species in rocky intertidal habitats at many locations in the Middle Atlantic Bight and in the southern Gulf of Maine. The reproductive biology of H. sanguineus has received only cursory study in native east-Asian waters. Available information consists mainly of descriptions of the larval stages and general characterizations of the natural history of the species. This study examined the periodicity of larval release in an invasive population of H. sanguineus near its original site of introduction at the mouth of Delaware Bay. We investigated larval release at diel and tidal frequencies. Analysis of laboratory data showed that larval release always occurs near the time of nocturnal high tide. Field sampling confirmed the presence of stage I zoeae in waters near adult habitat at the expected time of larval release. This pattern of release minimizes the impact of visual predators on newly hatched zoeae and takes advantage of circulation at tidal frequency to transport zoeae away from intertidal habitats where conditions may not be favorable for larval development. However, H. sanguineus is not unique among intertidal crabs in releasing larvae near the time of nocturnal high tide. This pattern has been reported for a large number of species with wide representation among families. Thus, the pattern of release observed in H. sanguineus does not provide any special competitive advantages over co-occurring native species, and the remarkable success of the species in North American habitats may be attributable to competitive interactions occurring after settlement and metamorphosis.","Univ Delaware, Grad Coll Marine Studies, Lewes, DE 19958 USA","Epifanio, CE (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Grad Coll Marine Studies, 700 Pilottown Rd, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.",epi@udel.edu,"Park, Susan/D-5130-2011",,,,,35,12,13,1,6,NATL SHELLFISHERIES ASSOC,GROTON,"C/O DR.

When one of these impacts on diversity is large, such predators have been labeled keystone predators and keystone intimidators respectively. Here we demonstrate that some predators play both roles simultaneously. We studied the species for which the term keystone predator was originally coined, the ochre sea star Pisaster ochraceus. We observed non-consumptive effects that were not mediated through its well-known invertebrate prey, the competitive dominant mussel Mytilus californianus, but instead through whelks Nucella emarginata, another important intertidal predator. Whelks exposed to effluent from stars in the laboratory consumed significantly less, grew significantly less, and developed less reproductive and digestive tissue. Star presence also altered the feeding preferences of whelks. Results suggest these responses are non-linear with respect to the number of predators and thus predator presence may be a larger determinant of non-consumptive effects than density. A second experiment found, in agreement with previous field surveys, that these large non-consumptive effects occurred even though whelk mortality due to consumption by stars is extremely low. These results offer a new mechanism to explain previous field experiments that found whelks have little impact on mussel mortality in the presence of stars yet large effects when stars are absent. They demonstrate the potential for non-consumptive effects to play a major role in community regulation by a keystone predator. They also demonstrate that non-consumptive interactions may have large effects on species even when rates of consumptive mortality are exceedingly low.","[Gosnell, J.

To help mitigate this problem, we review and synthesize the theoretical literature on TMIs and, in particular, on trait-mediated indirect interactions, TMIIs, in which the presence of one species mediates the interaction between a second and third species. (1) In models, TMIs tend to stabilize simple communities; adding further biological detail often reduces stability in models, but populations may persist even if their dynamics become mathematically unstable. (2) Short- and long-term changes in population density caused by TMIs depend even more on details, such as the curvature of functional responses and trade-offs, which have rarely been measured. (3) The effects of TMIs in multipredator communities depend in a straightforward way on the specificity of prey defenses. (4) Tritrophic and more complex communities are theoretically difficult; few general conclusions have emerged. Theory needs new kinds of experiments as a guide. The most critical needs are experiments that measure curvatures of trade-offs and responses, and experiments that (combined with theory) allow us to scale from short- to long-term responses of communities. Anecdotal evidence from long-term and large-scale studies suggests that TMIs may affect community dynamics at practical management scales; community models incorporating TMIs are necessary and require closer collaborations between theory and experiment.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Bolker, B (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",bolker@zoo.ufl.edu,"Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009; Krivan, Vlastimil/J-7015-2019; Krivan, Vlastimil/F-1709-2010","Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627; Krivan, Vlastimil/0000-0003-0971-1231; Bolker, Benjamin/0000-0002-2127-0443",,,,151,264,272,9,136,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2003,84,5,,,,,1101,1114,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1101:CTAESO]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700PN,WOS:000184120500003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although many trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMII) are caused by changes in prey behavior, less is known about the effects of changes in predator behavior such as prey switching or multiple predator effects (MPE) on indirect interactions, especially in marine systems. We performed a series of field caging experiments off the Isles of Shoals, Maine (USA) from 2000 to 2002 to test for the presence of behaviorally mediated indirect effects in a shallow subtidal food web. Specifically, crab (Cancer borealis) predation on sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) was quantified in three habitats (Codium fragile algal beds, barrens, and mussel beds) representing differing combinations of food and shelter to examine the effects of prey switching by crabs. A second predator (the lobster, Homarus americanus) was added to the crab treatments to examine MPE effects. Urchin mortality was significantly lower in the mussel habitat than in the Codium. and barren habitats. Mussels produced a positive indirect effect on urchins by changing the behavior of crabs; crabs fed on mussels instead of urchins (prey switching). In the barrens, crab predation on urchins indirectly increased the abundance of the introduced ascidian, Diplosoma sp., whereas Codium density did not change among treatments. A significant risk reduction for urchins occurred in Codium and barren habitats, but not in mussel habitats when crabs and lobsters were combined. Lobsters also produced a positive indirect effect on mussels by reducing crab predation. Thus, lobsters modify crab behavior and dampen changes in community structure. Our results illustrate the importance of predator behavior and habitat context in modifying consumer pressure and community structure, and argue for the consideration of these factors in other multi-predator systems where habitats represent food and/or shelter.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Siddon, CE (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, SFOS, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.",Christopher.Siddon@uaf.edu,,,,,,36,103,106,1,77,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2004,85,11,,,,,2938,2945,,10.1890/03-0519,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,873EW,WOS:000225263500004,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, later demographic changes could be explained by within-community ecological processes, not detected in presence of human gatherers. Competition for food, predation and recruitment, were explanatory hypothesis for such changes, and they were tested at the study site for two species: Fissurella picta and Fissurella limbata. At present, F. limbata does not occur at areas protected of the north winds, and F. picta shows a decreasing density in exposed areas. The competition hypothesis was tested at the exposed area through enclosure experiments. Predation over adult individuals was examined by means of a diet analysis for five predator species, from our data base of the Marine Reserve and other studies in that area and from other localities of the Chilean coast. Recruitment failure was studied on a long-term basis, using data on size structure accumulated in our data base. No inter or intraspecific competition was detected between the two species in the enclosure experiment, since neither species affected survivorship or biomass of the other. No evidence of an alternative to man predator of adults was found, but only a very low predation exerted by Larus dominicanus, Sicyases sanguineus. Stichaster striatus and Rattus rattus. A recruitment failure was detected for F. picta at the exposed area, and we detected the entry of individuals smaller than 30 mm during the last three years in the protected area. F. limbata recruited mainly in the exposed area.

Arvicoline rodents have a typical, season-dependent, bimodal, age distribution of breeding individuals within a population. This distribution may influence population fluctuations. In this study, we measured effects of interspecific competition from field voles (Microtus agrestis) on various fitness components of female bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in an age-structured breeding population in large (0.25 ha) outdoor enclosures. We monitored survival, reproduction, and space use of experimental bank vole populations with females from two different age groups. Within the enclosures we manipulated the presence and absence of field voles. When coexisting with field voles, the year-born bank vole females had lower survival rates than the over-wintered ones did. Home ranges of bank voles were smaller in the presence of field voles than in their absence. Characteristics of litters of breeding females were not affected by the competition treatment. Reproduction of the youngest of the year-born females stopped earlier in the season than for over-wintered females although both age groups had reproduced prior to the trial. We did not observe indications of senescence, such as lower reproduction or survival of the over-wintered females in late summer. An earlier cessation of breeding in the younger females suggests an age-specific trade-off of summer reproduction and winter. survival for parous females. Inter- and intraspecific competition seemed to work additively on the year-born, females through direct interference. By selectively reducing survival of younger breeders, interspecific competition could influence age distribution and population growth of breeders toward the end of the breeding season. Because old, over-wintered females are not surviving to the next noribreeding season, the lower survival of young breeders through interspecific competition might impact greatly the structure of the breeding population at the start of the next breeding season, thus altering population growth patterns.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,,,,,,57,14,17,1,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2003,84,12,,,,,3284,3293,,10.1890/02-0220,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762LN,WOS:000187973500018,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we describe a case from a large lake in southern Norway, StorsjOen, where the illegal introduction of a small, predominantly planktivorous fish species, European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), has led to changes in the native fish community and lake food web. Survey fishing data collected before (2007) and after (2016) the introduction indicates that smelt has become the numerically dominant fish species both in benthic and pelagic habitats, with concurrent reductions in the relative abundance of native European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) populations. Stable isotope (C-13 and N-15) data indicate minor changes in the trophic niches of native whitefish and Arctic charr despite partly overlapping niches with the introduced smelt. In contrast, brown trout (Salmo trutta) showed an earlier shift to piscivory, a more pelagic niche and increased growth rate, likely because of the smelt induced increase in pelagic prey fish abundance. The main trophic pathway supporting top predators (i.e., large brown trout) in StorsjOen has, therefore, shifted from a littoral to a more pelagic base. Our study demonstrates that small-sized introduced fishes can alter lake food-web dynamics, with contrasting impacts on native fishes. This knowledge is vital for future evaluation and mitigation of potential impacts of smelt introductions on lake ecosystems.","[Eloranta, Antti P.; Sandlund, Odd Terje; Finstad, Anders G.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Dept Aquat Ecol, Trondheim, Norway; [Johnsen, Stein I.; Baerum, Kim M.; Museth, Jon] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Human Dimens Dept, Lillehammer, Norway; [Power, Michael] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Finstad, Anders G.] NTNU Univ Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, Norway; [Rognerud, Sigurd] Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, Ottestad, Norway","Eloranta, AP (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Dept Aquat Ecol, Trondheim, Norway.",antti.eloranta@nina.no,"Eloranta, Antti Pekka/AAA-1426-2020; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot/H-6519-2015","Finstad, Anders Gravbrot/0000-0003-4529-6266; Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135",hydropower company Glommens og Laagens Brukseierforening (GLB); municipality of Rendalen; Storsjoen Fishery Association (Storsjoen Fiskeforening); Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [243910],"We thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

This resource is spatially variable and frequently over-grazed, causing strong inter- and intra-specific competition among grazers. Most studies on intertidal grazing are about gastropod molluscs. We observed, however, damaged patches in intertidal biofilms that appeared to be associated with the herbivorous asterinid starfish Patiriella exigua (Lamarck). In contrast with predatory starfish, there have been few ecological studies about herbivorous starfish, even though they are often abundant. We demonstrated that these patches were caused by grazing by this starfish. We then used field-based remote-sensing methods to demonstrate that amounts of chlorophyll were reduced inside grazing marks, quantified these changes and measured their longevity. In experiments, starfish could graze up to 60% of the epilithic micro-algae beneath their everted stomach during a single feeding event lasting on average 22 min. Over 5 d, 2 caged starfish could remove nearly half of the available micro-algae from areas of 144 cm(2). Changes to the amounts of chlorophyll in grazing marks were persistent, remaining visible on sandstone substrata for several weeks. Amounts of chlorophyll on grazed areas of substratum were significantly different from ungrazed areas up to 28 d after being grazed. Recovering areas were demonstrated to be bio-equivalent to ungrazed areas after a similar period. Thus, P. exigua can have a large effect on the temporal and spatial distribution of micro-algal food, with numerous possible consequences for intertidal assemblages. The ecological importance of herbivorous starfish may be greater than previously perceived.","[Jackson, A. C.] Environm Res Inst, Thurso KW14 7JD, Caithness, Scotland; [Murphy, R. J.; Underwood, A.

A synthesis of existing evidence for 4 infraorders of large benthic marine decapods, Brachyura (true crabs), Anomura (king crabs), Astacidea (clawed lobsters) and Achelata (clawless lobsters), is presented here to gain insight into their ecological roles and possible ecosystem effects of decapod fisheries. The reviewed species are prey items for a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates. They are omnivorous but prefer molluscs and crustaceans as prey. Experimental studies have shown that decapods influence the structuring of benthic habitat, occasionally playing a keystone role by suppressing herbivores or space competitors. Indirectly, via trophic cascades, they can contribute to the maintenance of kelp forest, marsh grass, and algal turf habitats. Changes in the abundance of their predators can strongly affect decapod population trends. Commonly documented non-consumptive interactions include interference-competition for food or shelter, as well as habitat provision for other invertebrates. Anthropogenic factors such as exploitation, the creation of protected areas, and species introductions influence these ecosystem roles by decreasing or increasing decapod densities, often with measurable effects on prey communities. Many studies have investigated particular ecosystem effects of decapods, but few species were comprehensively studied in an ecosystem context. A simplified synthetic framework for interpreting ecosystem roles of decapods was derived from the available evidence; however, more experimental and long-term observational studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms and shed light on the long-term consequences of decapod fisheries.","[Boudreau, Stephanie A.; Worm, Boris] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada","Boudreau, SA (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",s.boudreau@dal.ca,,"Worm, Boris/0000-0002-5742-8716",National Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ecosystem Studies of Subarctic Seas; Dalhousie University,"We thank H.

We developed and applied a multi-species, individual-based model to examine the long-term effects of increasing number of reefs on fish weight, abundance, and biomass. The model simulated the population dynamics of three fish species for 50 years on a 2-dimensional spatial grid. Growth, mortality, and movement were computed each hour for individuals of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), a croaker-like species (Micropogonias chromis), and a pinfish-like species (Lagodon rhomboides). We also included individuals of two other species (bluefish - Pomatomus saltatrix and a generic jack-like species), but only simulated their hourly movement and their effects on prey and predation of the focal species. The densities of five prey groups were simulated independently in each cell. Our results showed that increasing the number of reefs generally produced higher biomass, but at the cost of slower growth, and smaller individuals. Abundance was higher under fixed-AR recruitment and maximum refuge treatments. In all treatments there were diminishing returns on abundance and biomass with increasing number of artificial reefs. Experiment 2 showed that model results based on regularly spaced reefs were consistent with a real layout of reefs currently being sampled in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Management strategies for determining the habitat-value of reefs in the Gulf of Mexico should consider the number of reefs and the local spatial layout of the reefs to ensure they are optimally arranged. Field experiments performed should assist in resolving how fish recruit to artificial reefs and help determine their roles as fish refuges.

Red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) have been introduced to wetlands throughout the world and have negatively impacted native species, particularly other species of turtles. In our controlled feeding experiments in mesocosms juvenile red-eared slider turtles negatively impacted the growth of juvenile red-bellied turtles (Pseudemys rubriventris), an IUCN near threatened species and a Pennsylvania threatened species, through exploitative competition for limited food. In mixed species experimental treatments, in which food resources were abundant, juvenile red-bellied turtles grew significantly faster and ate more food than juvenile red-eared slider turtles. In mixed species experimental treatments, in which food resources were limited, red-eared slider turtles ingested more food, gained mass faster, and maintained body condition while red-bellied turtles lost body condition. There were significant differences in growth rates seen between resource availability regimes. In treatments in which resources were abundant there were no significant differences between turtles housed in mixed species or single species groups. In limited resource treatments red-bellied turtle body condition was significantly different between single and mixed species groups while there were significant differences in mass and body condition for red-eared slider turtles. Our results suggest that one mechanism by which red-eared slider turtles detrimentally impact ecologically similar species is through competition for limited food resources. We hypothesize that growth of red-eared slider turtle populations will lead to population declines of native turtle species throughout their introduced ranges because they use limited food resources more efficiently for their growth and development than native species.

Competition between two species in a metapopulation involves each inhibiting the other's ability firstly to colonize an already occupied area and then to persist in it. Models for regional competition of this kind have 3-D dynamics, from which it has proved difficult to extract useful predictions except for special conditions. We introduce a 2-D general model for species that are equally vigorous at inhibiting the ability of others to remain in an occupied patch as to arrive there. The model covers the full spectrum of competitive interactions, from weak to strong and symmetrical to asymmetrical. Its Lotka-Volterra dynamics extend the general theory of competitive coexistence by generating clear predictions for community structure, amenable to cross-system comparisons and experimental manipulations. 2. Previous 2-D models of interactions between dominant and fugitive species are special cases of the 2-D general model. Moderately asymmetrical competition has two outcomes distinctly different from dominant-fugitive interactions, at both the scale of metapopulation and population: (i) slow growing and weak competitors coexist with faster growing superior competitors, albeit at reduced densities; and (b) habitat removal always yields relative gains in abundance for species with higher growth capacity, but the gains are absolute only for species subjected to competitive impacts that exceed within-species impacts. Extinctions of slow growing and weak competitors provide the most sensitive indication of habitat degradation, and their losses also have the least effect on community structure. 3. The 2-D general model further predicts that highly productive communities will tolerate differences between species in their capacity for population growth, whereas less productive communities will tolerate stronger competitive interactions between species. This prediction applies equally to a population of resource consumers as to a metapopulation of colonists. The model explicitly links local and regional population dynamics to r-K selection in community structure by predicting a prevalence of growth-orientated species in resource-poor habitats and competition-orientated species in resource-rich habitats.","Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Dept Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Doncaster, CP (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Bassett Crescent E, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England.",cpd@soton.ac.uk,"Doncaster, C.

However, recent reviews have shown that competitors, unlike predators and parasites, have rarely been documented to cause extinctions. There is a need for better understanding of competitive interactions between nonindigenous species and native competitors across systems where NIS reach high densities. In this paper we examine competitive interactions between the exotic, invasive New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and native estuarine invertebrates. P. antipodarum is often described as a freshwater snail but can occur in brackish water as well; it has been established in the Columbia River Estuary for over ten years. We addressed competition in this estuarine system using three approaches: field surveys of the benthic invertebrate community, stable isotope analysis of overlap in resource use by common invertebrates, and a laboratory competition experiment that tested the strength of competition between P. antipodarum and the isopod, Gnorimosphaeroma insulare, which overlap in resource use. We found no evidence of negative competitive impacts of P. antipodarum on native benthic invertebrates in this estuarine system. Densities of P. antipodarum and common native epibenthic invertebrates are positively correlated in the intertidal, likely due to shared habitat preferences. The competition experiment showed that the effect of interspecific competition from P. antipodarum on the foraging and survival of G. insulare was significantly less than the effect of intraspecific competition between isopods. The presence of the isopod G. insulare reduced foraging in P. antipodarum, but this change did not result in reduced survival and growth of snails. Hence, interspecific competition is weak despite high densities achieved by the invading species. Finally, we discuss several possible explanations for the observation that P. antipodarum does not have an obvious negative competitive impact on native benthic invertebrates.","[Brenneis, Valance E.

We compared natural enemy to pest ratios between field with hedgerows and fields with weedy margins by sampling beneficial insects and key pests of vegetables on sticky cards. We used biweekly vacuum samples to measure the distribution of key insect taxa among native perennial plant species with respect to the timing and intensity of bloom. Sticky cards indicated a trend that field margins with hedgerows support a higher ratio of natural enemies to pests compared with weedy borders. Hedgerow plant species hosted different relative densities of a generally overlapping insect community, and the timing and intensity of bloom only explained a small proportion of the variation in insect abundance at plant species and among hedgerows, with the exception of Orius spp. on Achillea millefolium L. and Baccharis pilularis De Candolle. Indicator Species Analysis showed an affinity of parasitic wasps, especially in the super-family Chalcidoidea, for B. pilularis whether or not it was in flower. A. millefolium was attractive to predatory and herbivorous homopterans; Heteromeles arbutifolia (Lindley) Roemer and B. pilularis to Diabrotica undecimpunctata undecimpunctata Mannerheim; and Rhamnus californica Eschsch to Hemerobiidae. Perennial hedgerows can be designed through species selection to support particular beneficial insect taxa, but plant resources beyond floral availability may be critical in providing structural refuges, alternative prey, and other attractive qualities that are often overlooked.","[Gareau, Tara L.

However, its effects on the physiology of wild animal populations are poorly known. We analyzed faecal glucocorticoids levels in wild common voles (Microtus arvalis) living in a farmland landscape to test whether living in degraded habitats, such as crops, is correlated with increased glucocorticoids. Other factors such as sex, reproductive status, and population density were also considered. We captured voles with Sherman traps in crops and in their field margins which were comprised of semi-natural vegetation. We collected fresh faecal samples from captured individuals and quantified their levels of faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) in the laboratory. The quantification of FCM concentrations was performed by competitive enzyme immunoassay. Individuals captured within the crops had higher levels of FCM than those in field margins; females and breeding individuals exhibited higher FCM levels. In addition, FCM concentrations positively correlated with abundance of voles. Our results suggest that degraded habitats in agricultural landscapes are associated with increased glucocorticoid levels on common voles likely caused by a higher disturbance from agricultural practices and a lesser vegetation cover in crops compared with field margins.

Population assessments based on overly simplistic vital rates can lead to erroneous conclusions. We estimated sex- and length-based annual apparent survival rates for white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias). We found evidence that annual apparent survival differed over ontogeny in a system with competitive foraging aggregations, from 0.63 (standard error (SE) = 0.08) for newly recruiting subadults to 0.95 (SE = 0.02) for the largest sharks. Our results reveal a potential challenge to ontogenetic recruitment in a long-lived, highly mobile top marine predator, as survival rates for subadult white sharks may be lower than previously assumed. Alternatively, younger and competitively inferior individuals may be forced to permanently emigrate from primary foraging sites. This study provides new methodology for estimating apparent survival as a function of diverse covariates by capture-recapture study, including when sex assignment is uncertain.","[Kanive, Paul E.; Rotella, Jay J.] Montana State Univ, Ecol Dept, 310 Lewis Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Kanive, Paul E.; Jorgensen, Salvador J.; Anderson, Scot D.] Monterey Bay Aquarium, 886 Cannery Row, Monterey, CA 93940 USA; [Chapple, Taylor K.; Block, Barbara A.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, 120 Oceanview Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Hines, James E.] USGS Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD 20708 USA","Kanive, PE (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Ecol Dept, 310 Lewis Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.; Kanive, PE (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium, 886 Cannery Row, Monterey, CA 93940 USA.",paul.kanive@montana.edu,,,Monterey Bay Aquarium; Stanford UniversityStanford University,"The Monterey Bay Aquarium and Stanford University funded this project.

Here, we demonstrate that phloem-feeding membracids (Publilia modesta) compete intraspecifically for the protective services of an ant mutualist (Formica altipetens). By experimentally increasing membracid densities in the field, we observed three negative effects due to competition for ants: (1) a 45%-59% reduction in the number of ants tending membracid aggregations, (2) a 63% increase in the abundance of a predatory salticid spider (Pellenes sp.), and (3) a 59% reduction in the mean number of membracid nymphs per plant. In total, the loss of protective services due to competition for mutualists translated into a 92% decrease in the production of newly eclosed membracid adults. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration that animal species compete for mutualists. In addition, our work indicates that mutualisms can be strongly influenced by the local biotic neighborhoods in which they occur and thus may be far more variable than previously thought.","NO ARIZONA UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, FLAGSTAFF, AZ 86011 USA","CUSHMAN, JH (corresponding author), MACQUARIE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,64,68,71,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

We investigated the natural history and predatory impact of one group of such mesopredators-larvae of dipteran flies in the genus Oedoparena-which prey on intertidal barnacles. We 1) quantified patterns of larval Oedoparena distribution and abundance in the Northwest Straits of Washington State, USA, 2) determined larval physiological tolerance limits in the laboratory, and 3) conducted a manipulative field experiment to assess the role of microhabitat temperature on predation rates in Oedoparena. Members of Oedoparena in Washington are univoltine, with peak larval abundance in late spring and early summer. Infestation frequencies in the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli were as high as 22% and 35%, respectively. In laboratory studies, larvae of O. glauca were able to tolerate temperatures up to 37degreesC; however, this temperature is often exceeded in high intertidal habitats. In a field manipulation using experimental shades, we demonstrate that the alleviation of physiological stress greatly increased the abundance of larvae of Oedoparena spp. As a result of increased larval densities under shades, adult B. glandula mortality increased from 5% to nearly 30%, and C. dalli mortality increased from less than 20% to over 60%. Because high intertidal barnacles serve as food and habitat for a diverse array of species, Oedoparena spp. have the potential to play a major role in structuring high intertidal communities, particularly in cooler microhabitats.","Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Harley, CDG (corresponding author), Hopkins Marine Stn, Oceanview Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",chris.harley@stanford.edu,"Harley, Christopher D.

Since such an effect could be prey density dependent, a constant density of prey must be maintained while assessing this effect, irrespective of the elimination of prey by predation. However, when studying a predator-harvester, such as a planktivorous fish, which collects zooplankton at a rate of up to 1 prey s(-1), instantaneous replacement of each consumed prey item is not feasible. This problem was solved in short-lasting mesocosm experiments by minute-by-minute supplementation to replace eliminated Daphnia and maintain a constant average prey density. Such experiments were performed with different numbers of foraging roach (Rutilus rutilus) at three prey densities and in two ranges of ambient temperature. The number of Daphnia required at the start of each experiment to establish the initial prey density and the number that it was necessary to add per minute were determined in experiments conducted without prey supplementation and in preliminary experiments with prey supplementation. The results of this study revealed that fish foraging in a group eat less, due to both exploitation and non-aggressive competition for space. Moreover, the effect of interference competition was stronger at higher temperatures, irrespective of the prey density, indicating that natural populations of roach foraging in shoals may suffer more from competitive interactions in warmer waters.","[Maszczyk, Piotr; Bartosiewicz, Maciej; Jurkowski, Jakub Eryk] Univ Warsaw, Dept Hydrobiol, Fac Biol, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland; [Wyszomirski, Tomasz] Univ Warsaw, Dept Plant Ecol & Environm Conservat, Fac Biol, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland","Maszczyk, P (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Dept Hydrobiol, Fac Biol, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, Zwirki & Wigury 101, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland.",p.maszczyk@uw.edu.pl,"Wyszomirski, Tomasz/V-8605-2018; Maszczyk, Piotr/AAN-4661-2020","Wyszomirski, Tomasz/0000-0001-8385-2919; Maszczyk, Piotr/0000-0002-1738-419X","State Committee for Scientific Research, PolandPolish State Committee for Scientific Research [NN304 067336]; Polish National Science Center [2011/03/B/NZ8/02093]; EU European Regional Development Fund under the Innovative Economy Operational Program","We thank Z.M.

Earwigs, Forficula auricularia L. (Dermaptera: Forficulidae), are important predators in fruit orchards. They are capable of suppressing outbreaks of pest species, such as pear psyllid and various apple aphid species. Earwigs therefore play an important role in integrated pest management in fruit orchards and are essential in organic top fruit cultures. However, earwig populations are very unstable, showing large between-year variation in densities, which limits their practical use. Extensive knowledge of regulating processes of populations is therefore crucial for efficient orchard management. A 2-year phenological study in several apple and pear orchards in Belgium showed a significant displacement of third instars during the second brood in relation to the presence of adults. We also observed a yearly population crash at the time of moulting into adults. This population decrease was correlated with earwig numbers at peak density. The crash occurred at lower earwig densities in apple orchards than in pear orchards.

The system permits a detailed study of localised competition with major implications for coral reefs with respect to human impacts including climate change. Using underwater video cameras, this study examined competition among 30 species of large reef fishes (from nine families) for access to shelter provided by 26 tabular structures, which may be the highest reported diversity of vertebrates competing for a single resource. Mean concentrations of fishes under tabular structures were also among the highest biomass recorded on reefs (4.71 kg m(-2)). A generated dominance hierarchy for the occupation of shelter appeared to be primarily driven by the size of fishes. In contrast to previous studies, fishes higher in the hierarchy tended to exhibit the lowest levels of aggression. However, size difference between fishes was found to be strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of aggressive interactions (R (2) = 0.971, P < 0.0001). The strong competition for the shade provided by these corals highlights concerns about future shifts in the structure of large reef fish communities as corals are lost. This is particularly concerning given the critical functional roles played by certain species of large reef fishes that utilise tabular structure for shelter and which occupy the lower ranks of the dominance hierarchy.","[Kerry, J.

Both species are known to compete directly through egg cannibalism and indirectly through the density-dependent release of allelopathic chemicals. To better characterize these indirect interactions, recent work has focused on quantifying the per-capita effects of intraspecific chemical competition. However, the effects of interspecific chemical competition in this system have not previously been estimated. We used experimental microcosms to examine how interspecific chemical secretions affected the reproductive activity and development time of laboratory populations of T. castaneum and T. confusum. We created replicated habitats containing flour medium that had been occupied and chemically 'conditioned' by one of the two beetle species across a range of densities, then examined how beetles of the other species responded in terms of the number of eggs laid by females and, separately, the development time of offspring. We found that T. castaneum fecundity was reduced when beetles experienced flour conditioned by T. confusum. In contrast, fecundity of T. confusum was largely unaffected by flour conditioned by T. castaneum. Additionally, we found that interspecific conditioning decreased development times for beetles of both species, particularly the development of larvae to pupae. Our results indicate that interspecific chemical competition impacts the life history of Tribolium species and suggests that models incorporating chemical competition may more accurately describe the biology of flour beetle communities.","[Bullock, Marissa; Legault, Geoffrey; Melbourne, Brett A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Legault, Geoffrey] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Coker Hall,120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Legault, G (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.; Legault, G (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Coker Hall,120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",legault@unc.edu,,"Legault, Geoffrey/0000-0003-2136-587X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1457660],"M.B. and G.L. conceived of the project.

Our focus is not on the lethal effects of predator, but on the simple idea that (i) birds will not settle where they perceive a high risk of predation, and (ii) species differ in their perception of the safety of woody vegetative cover due to differences in antipredator escape behavior. Consistent with this idea is the fact that the composition of this grassland community responds markedly to minor manipulations in the distribution of woody cover. In particular, with the addition of cover to open grasslands, species with cover-dependent escape tactics increase in abundance, while the abundance of cover-independent species decreases greatly; this decrease may reflect aggression from cover-dependent species, but evidence suggests that some cover-independent species may actively avoid cover-rich areas per se. Non-predatory effects of cover, most notably those concerning food resources and microclimate, appear unable to explain these results. Predators may influence many communities of terrestrial vertebrates via species-specific responses to cover.","UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA","LIMA, SL (corresponding author), INDIANA STATE UNIV, DEPT LIFE SCI, TERRE HAUTE, IN 47809 USA.",,,"Valone, Thomas/0000-0002-7657-3126",,,,74,66,66,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,86,1,,,,,105,112,,10.1007/BF00317396,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FD564,WOS:A1991FD56400016,28313165,,,,2021-09-27,

India, with a 125 million English speakers boasts the second largest number of English speakers in the world, after the United States. The 1961-2001 Indian censuses report a sharp increase in Hindi/English Bilinguals, suggesting that English is on the rise in India. To the contrary, we claim supported by field evidence, that these statistics are inaccurate, ignoring an emerging class who do not have full bilingual competence and switch between Hindi and English, communicating via a code popularly known as Hinglish. Since current language competition models occlude hybrid practices and detailed local ecological factors, they are inappropriate to capture the current language dynamics in India. Expanding predator prey and sociolinguistic theories, we draw on local Indian ecological factors to develop a novel three-species model of interaction between Monolingual Hindi speakers, Hindi/English Bilinguals and Hinglish speakers, and explore the long time dynamics it predicts. The model also exhibits Turing instability, which is the first pattern formation result in language dynamics. These results challenge traditional assumptions of English encroachment in India. More broadly, the three-species model introduced here is a first step towards modeling the dynamics of hybrid language scenarios in other settings across the world. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We examined how top-down and bottom-up interactions may mediate knock-on effects of a coastal deposit-feeding clam, Macomona liliana (hereafter Macomona), on sandflat meiobenthos densities. Therefore we manipulated densities of Macomona in combination with predator exclusion and experimental shading that was expected to alter microphytobenthos biomass. We show that Macomona regulated densities of meiobenthic (38-500 mu m) nematodes, copepods, polychaetes, turbellarians, and ostracodes during the three months of incubation via indirect mechanisms. Predator pressure on Macomona by eagle rays (Myliobatis tenuicaudatus) was found to have a negative effect on densities of some meiobenthic taxa. Furthermore, experimental shading resulted in the loss of a positive relation between Macomona and microphytobenthos biomass, while concurrently increasing the density of some meiobenthic taxa. We suggest that this observation can be explained by the release from bioturbation interference effects of the cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi that was found to thrive in the presence of Macomona under non-shaded conditions. Our results highlight the importance of interactions between macrofaunal bioturbation, microphyte biomass, sediment stability, and predation pressure for the structuring of benthic communities. This experiment illustrates that manipulative field experiments may be particularly suitable to study such multiple indirect mechanisms that regulate ecosystem diversity and related functioning because such approaches may best capture the complex feedbacks and processes that determine ecosystem dynamics.

The alteration of stream habitats by urbanisation reduces the availability of shelter. Reduced shelter availability may increase both predation risks and metabolic costs, negatively affecting the growth performance of stream fish. Although urbanised streams often allow the establishment of invasive species, the additive or interactive effects of shelter availability and invasive species are rarely explored. The invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is a strong shelter competitor and predator in streams. 2. We conducted a stream-channel experiment to investigate how shelter availability and this invasive crayfish species affect the growth performance (measured as the loss in body mass under starved conditions) of two native benthic species, Japanese crucian carp (Carassius auratus complex) and an endangered cobitid fish (Lefua echigonia). 3. We found that both the absence of shelter and the presence of crayfish increased body mass loss in the crucian carp. However, the growth performance of the crucian carp was improved by the presence of shelter except in the presence of crayfish, in which case the shelter available did not ameliorate the negative effect of the crayfish on growth performance (i.e. an interactive effect). This result suggests that crayfish may affect the growth performance of the crucian carp through chemical cues as well as through shelter occupancy. 4. In contrast, shelter availability is the primary factor affecting the body mass loss of the cobitid fish. However, the growth performance of these fish was unaffected by the presence of crayfish. The change in the growth performance of the cobitid fish in response to the absence of shelter was greater than that of the crucian carp. This finding suggests that the cobitid fish may be more vulnerable than the crucian carp to a reduction in shelter availability. 5. Our study demonstrates that reduced shelter availability and/or crayfish invasion can have significant, indirect negative effects on the growth performance of native fish, but whether those effects are interactive might vary depending on the species. Our findings have clear implications for stream restoration and habitat assessment.","[Matsuzaki, Shin-ichiro S.; Takamura, Noriko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Sakamoto, Masaki] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Imizu, Toyama, Japan; [Kawabe, Kiyoshi] Hodogaya Contract Lab Co Ltd, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","Matsuzaki, SS (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",matsuzakiss@nies.go.jp,"Matsuzaki, Shinichiro/C-6543-2012",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [1811493, 23710288]; Ministry of the Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan [S9]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23710288, 23510031] Funding Source: KAKEN","We are most grateful to the staff at the NIES Ecosystem Field Station, including Yoshio Suzuki and Chizuko Yoshida, Yutaka Ogamino, Takamaru Nagata and Takahiro Morosawa, for their valuable assistance during the experiments.

Additional treatments included altering food concentration and reversing an initial size advantage of one of the species. There was no evidence of intraspecific interference competition in either species. There were strong asymmetric interspecific effects; the leopard frog depressed growth of the wood frog in mixed-species treatments whereas the wood frog had no negative effects on the leopard frog. These interspecific effects appear to be largely due to exploitative competition. Reversing initial size advantages of the species did not affect the qualitative outcome of competition, though the effect of the leopard frog on the wood frog was diminished when wood frogs were initially 30% larger. The leopard frog was consistently more active than the wood frog; I argue that this difference in activity contributes to the competitive superiority of the leopard frog in these experiments.

The environments in which these models are parameterized may be spatially heterogeneous. We demonstrate that, even in the absence of interaction between individuals, nonzero estimates of competitive or facilitative coefficients can result from environmental heterogeneity when densities are not experimentally imposed. We show this using a model of individual position and size in a simple environment composed of two patch types. Suppose two noninteracting species are intermixed in the study area and species 1 becomes established more readily in the patch type in which species 2 grows larger and has higher fecundity. Analyses that ignore environmental heterogeneity may indicate that species 1 facilitates species 2 because larger individuals of species 2 will tend to be associated with greater numbers of species 1. Similarly, environmental pseudocompetition can result if species 2 is more frequent among small individuals of species 1. The strength of the environmental pseudointeraction depends on (a) the magnitude of the size and fecundity differences between patch types, (b) the magnitude of the establishment differences between patch types, and (c) the size, relative to the environmental grain, of the neighborhood or quadrat used for sampling the number of competitor individuals.

In many systems this separation is experimentally impossible without interfering with the natural behavior of the animals. Consequently, these studies can only demonstrate the combined effect of interference and exploitation on the forager's feeding rate, namely, it usually decreases in a decelerating rate as a function of density. We suggest here a simple experimental and statistical procedure that facilitates the separation of the effects of interference from those of exploitation. This procedure includes manipulation of both predator density and the foraging experiment duration. The statistical analysis is based on multiple linear regression. The working assumption is that exploitation can be neglected at the beginning of the foraging experiment because, initially, predators do not experience diminishing returns in prey capture rates. Using both the results of an individual-based simulation and a field experiment dataset of gerbils foraging for seeds in an artificial food patch located in the field, we demonstrate that our procedure can successfully detect and separate the effect of interference from the combined overall effect of competition (i.e., interference plus exploitation).","[Scharf, Inon; Filin, Ido; Ovadia, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Scharf, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",schari@bgu.ac.il; filin@bgu.ac.il; oferovad@bgu.ac.il,"Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012; Scharf, Inon/AAF-2343-2020","Scharf, Inon/0000-0002-8506-7161; Filin, Ido/0000-0001-6231-0029; Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,27,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",1438-3896,,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

In the study area, Microtus densities fluctuated from ten to 100-fold and predator densities fluctuated more than ten-fold. M. epiroticus suffered more from predation than M. agrestis, probably because densities in M. epiroticus patches were higher than densities in M. agrestis patches making M. epiroticus more profitable prey for patch-searching predators. The proportion of M. epiroticus among all voles declined during the crash phase of the vole cycle, at least partly as a result of predation. Breeding female voles showed little spatial overlap and presumably competed for space at high densities. At low densities, interference competition through predators may have been more important than space competition. The proportion of the smaller species M. epiroticus in the total number of all voles increased rapidly with increasing vole densities. This could be due to more aggregated way of life which gives an advantage in competition for space. Predation reduced the time for space competition to short periods, and decreased periodically the proportion of the more successful competitor. Thus, the coexistence of the two vole species seemed to be predator-induced. In this sense predation was a more important factor.than interspecific competition.","UNIV TURKU,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,SF-20500 TURKU 50,FINLAND","NORRDAHL, K (corresponding author), UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,P RAUTATIEKATU 13,SF-00100 HELSINKI 10,FINLAND.",,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,33,71,72,0,5,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1993,67,1,,,,,149,158,,10.2307/3545105,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KZ779,WOS:A1993KZ77900017,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, considerably more effort has been devoted into understanding the consequences of temporal rather than spatial variations in fruit crop for plant fitness. In order to simultaneously evaluate both components, we quantify fruit production and pre-dispersal damage by three arthropod species (mites, chalcid wasps and moths) in the Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) during 3 years in a spatially explicit context. Our aims were to assess (1) the interaction between fruit production and pre-dispersal fruit damage by arthropods, (2) the potential interference or competition between arthropods, and (3) the form of the phenotypic selection exerted by arthropods on fruit traits considering the spatial context. Arthropods damaged a substantial fraction of fruits produced by Spanish juniper with levels of damage showing sharp inter-annual variations. Fruit damage by mites was negatively related to yearly fruit crop and positively correlated at individual trees fruiting in consecutive years. Increased interspecific interference was an additional consequence of reduced fruit availability during small crop years. During a masting year, fruit damage by less mobile species such as mites was negatively affected by tree crop size, and no spatial structure was observed for mite damage. The incidence of chalcid wasps was low, so the spatial pattern of seed predation was unclear, and no preferences for fruit or seed traits were detected. Conversely, moths selected larger fruits and their incidence on trees was spatially aggregated up to 20 m, with predation levels being negatively affected by fruit abundance at the patch level, suggesting a positive density-dependent effect of neighbors on fruit output. These results highlight the importance of including the spatial component to understand complex species interactions at local scales.","[Mezquida, Eduardo T.] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Miguel Olano, Jose] Univ Valladolid, EU Ingn Agr, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Soria 42004, Spain","Mezquida, ET (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Darwin 2, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",eduardo.mezquida@uam.es,"Olano, Jose Miguel/K-7273-2014; Mendoza, Jose Miguel Olano/A-9250-2012","Olano, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-4526-5462; Mendoza, Jose Miguel Olano/0000-0002-4526-5462","Junta de Castilla y LeonJunta de Castilla y Leon [VA069A07, VA006A10-2]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of SpainSpanish Government [CGL2009-13190-C03-03]",We thank Cabrejas del Pinar Council for permission to work in its land and E.

One fundamental pattern in macroecology is the interspecific relationship between local abundance and regional range size, which is generally considered to be positively linear. Here, we examine structural details of the relationship between abundance and range size in cyclic populations of small mammals and its long-term temporal variation. Location Finland. Methods We analysed 39years of trapping data of Rodentia and Soricomorpha collected in field and forest habitats across Finland. Abundance was measured as the mean population density of individuals, and range size as the number of grid cells occupied and sample occupancy. Data were analysed using linear mixed models. Results The relationship between mean local density and sample occupancy was generally linear, whereas the relationship between density and the number of grid cells occupied was generally curvilinear (U-shaped) for both habitats, being negative for species with small range sizes and positive for species with larger ranges. The curvilinearity was temporally consistent in both habitats. Main conclusions The interspecific relationship between abundance and range size varies depending on how range size is measured. Interestingly, the curvilinear relationship between density and range size was found in an assemblage in which many of the species have fluctuating (cyclic) populations. Future research on abundancerange size relationships should focus on long-term temporal variation to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop macroecological theory.","[Komonen, Atte] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Henttonen, Heikki] Finnish Forest Res Inst, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland; [Huitu, Otso] Finnish Forest Res Inst, FI-77600 Suonenjoki, Finland; [Nissinen, Kari] Univ Jyvaskyla, Finnish Inst Educ Res, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Komonen, A (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",atte.komonen@jyu.fi,,,,,,39,4,4,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

We investigated the population dynamics and competitive interactions of two Daphnia species in Gull Lake, Michigan. In each of 3 yr D. pulicaria was always common, while D. galeata mendotae became abundant only in late summer. The summer invasion of D. galeata mendotae was associated with a decline in abundance of D. pulicaria in some, but not all years. Decline of D. pulicaria was strongly predicted by the loss of oxygen from deep water during summer, which resulted in greater spatial overlap between the species, and by changes in the quality of the phytoplankton resources. We employed in situ enclosures to manipulate the density of each species and quantify the intensity of intra- and interspecific competition. Repeated competition experiments demonstrated that the relative exploitative ability of the species reversed from early to late summer. Strong interspecific competition was often observed, but its strength varied with juvenile or adult stage, and with season. Daphnia pulicaria juveniles were always affected strongly by interspecific effects: while D. galeata mendotae juveniles were impacted largely by intraspecific effects. The relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition on adults reversed from early to late summer for each species. The magnitude of intra- and interspecific effects on D. pulicaria adults was similar during early summer, but by late summer interspecific effects were much stronger than intraspecific effects. The reverse was true for D. galeata mendotae adults; interspecific effects greatly decreased in late summer. This seasonal shift in the nature of competitive interactions provides an explanation for seasonal succession in this Daphnia assemblage.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,WK KELLOGG BIOL STN,E LANSING,MI 48824","HU, SXS (corresponding author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,E LANSING,MI, USA.",,,,,,,94,88,91,0,47,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1995,76,7,,,,,2278,2294,,10.2307/1941702,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RX362,WOS:A1995RX36200028,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, recent models have emphasized the relative carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of algae as a potential determinant of these patterns. In this research, I utilized five fishless ponds that varied in Daphnia pulex relative abundance and patterns of seasonal succession to explore the factors influencing Daphnia population performance in these systems. D. pulex population growth rates were measured in three treatments: (1) predators/competitors excluded, (2) competitors present and predators excluded, and (3) competitors and the predator Chaoborus present. The experiment was conducted twice in the growing season. In contrast to the top-down view, effects of competition outweighed effects of predation but were variable among ponds (being strongest in those ponds/times in which Daphnia relative abundance was low, and weakest when Daphnia were dominant). Competitor interaction strength was also temporally variable, increasing later in the season. Several potential determinants (biotic and abiotic) of variable competition intensity were explored using regressions. Only the C:P ratio of edible algae showed a significant relationship; negative effects of competition increased as algae became more phosphorus limited, in keeping with recent stoichiometric models. However, significant collinearities in several biotic/abiotic variables among ponds suggest, that this interpretation may not be the only explanation for variable competition intensity.","Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Steiner, CF (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",,,,,,,30,19,19,0,12,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2003,84,4,,,,,982,990,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0982:VDIPCA]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,677NC,WOS:000182813600018,,,,,2021-09-27,

In the field, however, contaminant effects are ubiquitously co-occurring with ecological interactions such as species competition and predation, which might influence the sensitivity of the individuals exposed to toxicants. The present experimental study investigated how intra- and interspecific competition influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms to a pesticide. For this, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the mortality and growth of the snail Bithynia tentaculata and the crustacean Gammarus pulex under different levels of intraspecific and interspecific competition for a food resource. Interspecific competition was created by adding individuals of Radix peregra and Asellus aquaticus, respectively. The interaction of competition and carbendazim exposure significantly influenced B. tentaculata growth, however, combined effects on survival and immobility were considered transient and were less easily demonstrated. Positive influence of competition on G. pulex survival was observed under low-medium carbendazim concentrations and under medium-high density pressures, being partly related to cannibalistic and predation compensatory mechanisms, enhanced under food limiting conditions. This study shows that intra- and interspecific competition pressure may influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms in a more complex way (positive, non-significant and negative effects were observed) than just increasing the sensitivity of the studied species, as has generally been hypothesized.

A direct, competitive effect of R. padi on D. noxia was observed only at extraordinarily high aphid densities (>2,000 individuals per greenhouse seedling). Lacewing predators significantly reduced the rate of increase of D. noxia in each experiment, but they were sometimes less effective on plants that received a mixture of both aphid species than they were on plants that received an equivalent number of D. noxia alone. The presence of R. padi may have reduced predation on D. noxia because the former species is more accessible to lacewing predators or because its faster growth rate caused it to outnumber D. noxia on plants that initially received an equal ratio of both species.

Fanning of oysters Saccostrea commercialis (Iredale & Roughley) and Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) in New South Wales, Australia, depends on their natural recruitment and growth on intertidal structures in estuaries. We investigated the effects of predation by fish on numbers of oysters recruiting to experimental panels of 3 different sizes. We tested effects of excluding fish of different sizes using different sizes of mesh (12.5 and 50 mm). Numbers of oysters were significantly reduced on panels open to predatory fish. Numbers of oysters per unit area and subsequent predation on them did not vary, however, across 3 different sizes of panels, indicating that predation was not dependent on patch size. Mortality on panels open to predation averaged 40.0 % (+/-4.3 % SE). Fish also significantly altered the distribution of sizes of oysters. The effect of predation was almost entirely attributable to toadfish Tetractenos spp. Previous knowledge of the life history of oysters and succession in these intertidal assemblages suggests that effects of predation may not, however, have important long-term consequences on natural populations.","Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Ecol Labs, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Anderson, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Ecol Labs, A11, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",mjanders@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Connell, Sean D/A-8874-2008; Anderson, Marti J./AAQ-9038-2021","Connell, Sean D/0000-0002-5350-6852; Anderson, Marti J./0000-0002-4018-4049",,,,53,34,35,0,11,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

As part of an extensive adaptive management strategy built around a network of protected areas, an emphasis was placed on understanding this important species' life history. Multiple capture-mark-recapture techniques and a model selection approach to data analysis in Program MARK were used to estimate the effects of individual age and conspecific density on natural per-capita daily survival probabilities of yellow tang recruits (recently settled individuals, 30-50 mm total length) and the effects of body size and site on natural per-capita monthly survival probabilities for juveniles (58-127 mm total length). The models of recruit survival that included additive effects of density and age were best supported by the data and indicated an increase of survival with age and decrease of survival with increased conspecific density. At 1 day post-settlement, the model averaged daily per-capita survival probability ranged from 0.963 (95% CI: 0.932-0.981) at a low density of 0.1 recruits m(-2) to 0.848 (95% CI: 0.752-0.911) at a high density of 1.3 recruits m(-2). The best supported model of juvenile survival had no effect of fish length or site, with a constant monthly per-capita survival of 0.939 (95% CI: 0.925-0.950). Only about 1% of recruits may survive to adulthood when protected from fishing. These results can be used to better analyze and interpret data from protected area monitoring surveys and refine management practices. Continued long-term monitoring, combined with targeted life history studies and demographic modeling, is needed to further investigate the population level effects of fishing yellow tang juveniles.","[Claisse, J.

The former species is normally allotopic with the latter two but has recently suffered competition from them following successional changes on sand-dune habitats that have rendered all three species syntopic. In a replicated cage experiment using natural densities of larvae, survivorship of B. calamita was reduced more strongly by interspecific than by intraspecific competitors. Predation did not relieve interspecific competition and in some treatments further increased the mortality of B. calamita. Survival was highly correlated with growth rate, and the negative effects of interspecific competition on growth were much stronger than those of intraspecific competition. Feeding-niche overlaps among all three species were high, and growth rates of B. calamita were related to total algal cell numbers available in the treatment cages. However, larvae in treatments exhibiting interspecific competition also generated large numbers of Anurofeca (= Prototheca) richardsi. This unicellular organism is implicated in interference competition between anurans. B. calamita growth also correlated inversely with A. richardsi numbers. Taken together the data demonstrate strong adverse effects of interspecific competition on the endangered B. calamita and indicate that both resource and interference mechanisms were probably operative, though the former was more important than the latter. Methods for alleviating the destructive impact of competition on the endangered species are discussed.","Univ Sussex, Sch Biol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Beebee, TJC (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Biol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",,,,,,,55,16,19,0,23,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

A 15-mo, whole-lake experiment revealed direct and indirect mechanisms by which a fish predator structured its prey population, primarily by affecting recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish. Piscivorous Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) were added to two of four sections of a divided lake in eastern Finland previously stocked with crucian carp (Carassius carassius). Although the stocked crucians quickly grew beyond vulnerable sizes, recruitment of their offspring through their 1st yr of life was reduced by 90% in sections with perch. Surviving YOY in predator sections were completely confined to vegetated inshore areas. This restriction to refuges lowered their growth rates in comparison with YOY in predator-free sections, which can further reduce recruitment by prolonging susceptibility to size-limited predation and decreasing energy reserves needed for anaerobic overwintering. In the presence of piscivores, surviving prey subsequently benefit from reduced intraspecific competition, increasing growth rates to achieve large, invulnerable body sizes rapidly. Resulting populations of crucian carp, consisting of relatively few but relatively large individuals, contrast with populations living in the absence of piscivores, which are characterized by high densities of small, stunted individuals. Such divergent population patterns are displayed by a number of prey species in Scandinavia and North America, suggesting that a combination of direct and indirect effects of predation on younger age classes, such as documented for crucian carp, may be common in fish populations of small northern lakes. Detecting these patterns and identifying their underlying mechanisms may often require a combination of extensive and intensive studies.","UNIV JOENSUU, DEPT BIOL, SF-80101 JOENSUU 10, FINLAND","TONN, WM (corresponding author), UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT ZOOL, EDMONTON T6G 2E9, ALBERTA, CANADA.",,"Tonn, William M/A-3765-2014","Tonn, William M/0000-0002-0509-3184",,,,53,127,134,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1992,73,3,,,,,951,958,,10.2307/1940171,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU767,WOS:A1992HU76700021,,,,,2021-09-27,

A quantitative parasitoid web was constructed describing the trophic relationships between the community of aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic links were expressed in the same units (m(-2)). Over a 2-year period, separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids were active in the field. 2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked by 15 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification (mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of ants. 3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September 1994 and May to October 1995, Aphids and primary parasitoids were most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one month later. 4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were relatively constant across webs, as was tilt ratio of the number of links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio of the total number of links to the total number of species increased with web size. 5. The relative abundance of the species in the different webs was well described by 3 Dirichlet distribution with a common parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances in the field with few common and many rare species. 6. Predator (i.e. parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential for indirect interactions between aphids, Mummy parasitoids were the most important group linking different aphids, A quantitative overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly linked by mummy parasitoids, Symmetrical links were uncommon. and rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids. 7. Ant-attended aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants. Species of mummy parasitoids attack, on average, approximately twice the number of host species than species of either primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Godfray, HCJ (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",c.godfray@ic.ac.uk,,,,,,103,274,286,2,126,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The objective of the surveys was to identify natural enemies that potentially regulate the temporal abundance of naturally occurring EPNs by using molecular tools. Nematodes were extracted from two soil depths at monthly intervals, DNA extracted, and target organisms were measured using qPCR. Potentially causal relationships between the temporal patterns of EPNs and their natural enemies were assessed primarily with stepwise regression of variables at various time lags. Drechslerella dactyloides was the only nematophagous fungus species exhibiting evidence of top-down regulation, being inversely related to population change of Heterorhabditis indica at two of three sites. Acrobeloides spp. (EPN competitors) were associated with reduced population growth of Steinernema diaprepesi at two sites and H. indica was associated with reduced abundance of H. zealandica and S. diaprepesi at one site each. A Paenibacillus sp. exhibited significant phase-space, predator-prey dynamics at two of three sites with abundant S. diaprepesi, a species-specific host of the bacterium. The initial abundance of both S. diaprepesi and Paenibacillus sp. explained significant variability in population changes of S. diaprepesi in a multiple regression model at a lag of three months. Controlled experiments showed that pH is directly related to adherence of the bacterial endospores to the S. diaprepesi cuticle. Soil pH in these surveys was directly related to the infestation rate (encumbrance) by Paenibacillus and inversely related to the abundance of S. diaprepesi. Vertical distribution patterns reflected potential routes for avoiding competition and predation between species. Nematode-trapping fungi tended to inhabit shallower soil horizons than did several other nematophagous fungal species and S. diaprepesi and H. indica. The nematophagous fungus Purpureocillium lilacinum was especially abundant in deeper soil horizons and in the flatwoods sites. Depth distribution among EPNs also differed significantly with H. indica > S. diaprepesi > than H. zealandica. These results support soil pH management to conserve the demonstrated services of S. diaprepesi. They also suggest a need to better understand potential non-target effects of practices favorable to nematophagous fungi and bactivorous nematode competitors of EPNs.","[Campos-Herrera, Raquel; Pathak, Ekta; El-Borai, Fahiem E.; Duncan, Larry W.] UF, CREC, 700 Expt Stn Rd, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA; [Campos-Herrera, Raquel] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Agr, Serrano 115 Dpdo, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Stuart, Robin J.] Florida Dept Agr & Consumer Serv, DPI, Dundee, FL 33838 USA; [Pathak, Ekta] Sam Higginbottom Inst Agr Technol & Sci, Allahabad, UP, India; [El-Borai, Fahiem E.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Agr, Plant Protect Dept, Zagazig, Egypt; [Campos-Herrera, Raquel] Univ La Rioja, CSIC, Inst Ciencias Vid & Vino, Gobiemo La Rioja, Carretera Burgos Km 6, Logrofio 26007, Spain","Duncan, LW (corresponding author), UF, CREC, 700 Expt Stn Rd, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",lwduncan@ufl.edu,"Stuart, Robin/AAE-7619-2020; Campos-Herrera, Raquel/Z-2427-2019","Campos-Herrera, Raquel/0000-0003-0852-5269; Stuart, Robin/0000-0002-5845-9653",USDA-CSREES Special Grant (TSTAR); U.S-Egypt Science and Technology Joint FundUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID)Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)US-Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund [206]; Ramon Areces Spanish Foundation; Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union (Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship for Career Development) [FP7-PEOPLE-2009-IOF-252980]; Government of Spain [RYC-2016-19939],"This study is supported by a USDA-CSREES Special Grant (TSTAR), and U.S-Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund (206).

In the Campigna Biogenetic Nature Reserve, central Italy, hundreds of mounds of the dominant Formica paralugubris were repeatedly introduced, creating several populations that still survive today. In this study, we analyzed the temporal dynamics and the ecological impact of five of these populations. Their present state was assessed by censusing the total number of nest mounds and their volumes, while past changes were reconstructed from literature records. We also evaluated the impact of this species on autochthonous arthropod communities by comparing impacted and non-impacted areas and performing predation experiments. The density of nests and their volume remained stable or declined for a few years after transplant, and then they began to grow steadily. Local arthropods were severely affected, since almost all collected groups were significantly less represented in impacted than in non-impacted sites. Additionally, experiments with live bait demonstrated that potential prey have a significantly greater probability of being consumed in the areas occupied by F. paralugubris. These results prompt a thorough assessment of the fate of the introduced red wood ant populations, since their role as biological control agents has to be traded against the ecological impact on native arthropod communities. This is particularly relevant for highly biodiverse areas, such as the Campigna forest, that are home of several invertebrate species with conservation interest.","[Frizzi, Filippo; Masoni, Alberto; Santini, Giacomo] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Via Madonna del Piano 6, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Quilghini, Giovanni] Reparto Carabinieri Biodiversita Follonica, Via Bicocchi 2, I-58022 Follonica, Grosseto, Italy; [Ciampelli, Paola] Reparto Carabinieri Biodiversita Pratovecchio, Via Dante Alighieri 41, I-52015 Pratovecchio Stia, Arezzo, Italy","Frizzi, F (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Via Madonna del Piano 6, I-50019 Florence, Italy.",filippo.frizzi@unifi.it,"Medina, Alberto Martin Gago/J-9320-2017; Santini, Giacomo/H-7366-2013","Medina, Alberto Martin Gago/0000-0002-0019-9692; Frizzi, Filippo/0000-0002-1419-0445; Masoni, Alberto/0000-0001-5473-4649",Reparto Carabinieri Biodiversita di Pratovecchio,"This study was partly funded by the Reparto Carabinieri Biodiversita di Pratovecchio.

We conducted an experiment to evaluate how pond hydroperiod affected the ability of two larval anuran species (Hyla squirella and Bufo terrestris) to interact with intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Pond hydroperiod altered how an increase in the abundance of intraspecific competitors affected fitness components of B. terrestris but not for H. squirella. Specifically, an increase in intraspecific abundance caused a reduction in B. terrestris survivorship in short hydroperiod ponds but had no effect on fitness components of B. terrestris in long hydroperiod ponds. Interspecific competition did not occur between these species in either short or long hydroperiod ponds. Our study highlights the point that the strength of density-dependent processes operating in the aquatic environment can depend on pond hydroperiod. Consequently, the extent to which processes operating in the aquatic environment contribute to the regulation of population and metapopulation size for amphibians will also likely depend on pond hydroperiod.","[Rogers, Tracy Noel; Chalcraft, David R.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Chalcraft, DR (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",chalcraftd@ecu.edu,,"Chalcraft, David/0000-0002-2165-0948",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716558],"This work was completed in partial fulfillment of the degree requirements for a Master of Science degree at East Carolina University.

Theory posits that this mix of stage-specific competition and predation, termed life-history intraguild predation (LHIGP), can lead to alternative stable states. In one state, prey exclude predators through competition (i.e. juvenile competitive bottleneck), while in the alternative, adult predators control prey density to limit competition and foster coexistence. Nevertheless, the interactions leading to these states have not been demonstrated in an empirical LHIGP system. To address this gap, we manipulated densities of cannibalistic adult cyclopoid copepods (Mesocyclops edax) and their cladoceran prey (Daphnia pulex) in a response-surface design and measured the maturation and survival of juvenile copepods (nauplii). We found that Daphnia reduced and even precluded both nauplii maturation and survival through depletion of a shared food resource. As predicted, adult copepods enhanced nauplii maturation and survival through Daphnia consumption, yet this positive effect was dependent on the relative abundance of Daphnia as well as the absolute density of adult copepods. Adult copepods reduced nauplii survival through cannibalism at low Daphnia densities and at the highest copepod density. This work demonstrates that predation can relax a strong juvenile competitive bottleneck in freshwater zooplankton, though cannibalism can reduce predator recruitment. Thus, our results highlight a key role for cannibalism in LHIGP dynamics and provide evidence for the interactions that drive alternative stable states in such systems.","[Toscano, Benjamin J.; Rombado, Bianca R.; Rudolf, Volker H.

The consequences of intraguild interactions on the foraging efficiency of the two coccinellid species were investigated by evaluating the functional responses of single beetles and intra- and interspecific combinations to densities of the spirea aphid, Aphis citricola van der Goot (Hemiptera: Aphididae), on apple seedlings, during 2 and 12 h under laboratory conditions. A type II functional response was observed in all the bioassays. Solitary H. axyridis consumed significantly more aphids than single P. japonica in both exposure periods. However, at intermediate prey densities the prey consumption of P. japonica was slightly greater than that of H. axyridis. The 95% confidence intervals of the functional response curves of conspecific and heterospecific pairs overlapped at 2 h. In contrast, conspecific pairs of H. axyridis showed a higher functional response curve at 12 h compared to a combination of H. axyridis and P. japonica. Prey's predation risk reduction was only detected for paired H. axyridis and mixed predators compared to their estimated functional responses at the 2-h foraging period. By comparing functional responses between intraguild predatory lady beetle combinations, we could further predict the potential ecosystem service provided by these natural enemies.","[Feng, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Xu; An, Meng-Ru; Li, Yu-Dan; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Wang, Lin-Lin; Ren, Jin-Ze; Liu, Tong-Xian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Xu; An, Meng-Ru; Li, Yu-Dan; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Wang, Lin-Lin; Ren, Jin-Ze; Liu, Tong-Xian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Minist Agr, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops Northwes, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhao-Xu] Gansu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Liu, TX (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Liu, TX (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Minist Agr, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops Northwes, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",txliu@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Liu, Tong-Xian/0000-0002-7686-0686",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31272089]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Z109021611]; national college students' science and technology innovation project [201610712004],"We thank Xing-Lin Yu for assistance in field collection of insects.

The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway. 2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species' selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area. 3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1.5% could hold all four large carnivores together. 4. Synthesis and applications. A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.","[May, Roel; van Dijk, Jiska; Swenson, Jon E.; Linnell, John D.

In the UK, the non-native Grey Squirrel Sciurus carolinensis is common in rural and urban habitats. It exploits supplementary feeders and may induce interference competition by excluding birds, but empirical evidence of this is unavailable. Using controlled model presentation experiments, we demonstrate that Grey Squirrels could reduce bird use of supplementary feeders and induce interference competition. Total bird resource use was reduced by 98% and most species exhibited similar sensitivities. The likelihood and magnitude of interference competition will depend on how rapidly displaced birds find alternative food sources; it will be greatest where there are high Grey Squirrel densities and few supplementary feeders. Other studies suggest that supplementary feeding increases Grey Squirrel numbers, and the species is also predicted to expand its non-native range across most of Europe. Our data indicate that Grey Squirrels may eventually alter the net effect of supplementary feeding on bird populations across the European continent; increased use of squirrel-proof feeders may help to minimize such effects.","[Bonnington, Colin; Evans, Karl L.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Gaston, Kevin J.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England","Bonnington, C (corresponding author), URS, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",colin.bonnington@urs.com,,"Gaston, Kevin J./0000-0002-7235-7928",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),This research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.

Most research in this area has focused on the role of specialized enemies and the extent to which herbivory on individual plant species is density-dependent. Relatively few insect herbivores specialize on a single host plant species. Insect herbivores that feed on more than one plant species may link the regeneration dynamics of their host species through apparent competition or apparent mutualism. We investigated herbivory and survival of seedlings of two tropical tree species (Cordia alliodora and Cordia bicolor) in the forests of Barro Colorado Island (Panama). We used experiments and observations to assess seedling fate in relation to the presence of conspecifics and heterospecifics across a range of spatial scales. Herbivory significantly increased seedling mortality and was highest at high local densities of C. alliodora seedlings. There was also evidence that high local densities of C. alliodora increased herbivory on co-occurring C. bicolor seedlings. Synthesis. The elevated rates of seedling herbivory at high densities of conspecifics documented in our study are consistent with the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, which explains how so many plant species can coexist in tropical forests. Our data also highlight the possibility that herbivore-mediated density-dependence, facilitated by herbivores that feed on multiple plant species, can also occur across plant species. Enemy-mediated indirect effects of this sort have the potential to structure plant communities.","[Downey, Harriet; Lewis, Owen T.; Bonsall, Michael B.; Gripenberg, Sofia] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Fernandez, D.

The spatial genetic structure (SGS) of a plant population is mainly determined by gene flow via seed and pollen, various natural selection pressures and spatial patterns of existing plants. However, the role of those factors in shaping SGS requires further investigation. 2. We studied the relative importance of those factors in shaping the SGS of an understorey dioecious fig species (Ficus cyrtophylla). Spatial patterns of existing individuals and microhabitat were surveyed, patterns of seed rain were investigated, seed dispersers were observed in the field, and the gene flow and SGS of a focal population were determined. 3. Three mid-sized bulbul (Pycnonotus spp.) species were the primary dispersers of Ficus cyrtophylla fruits. All the age cohorts exhibited clumped patterns with a decreasing trend from seeds to seedlings, saplings and adults. Seed rain occurred in a non-random pattern with high clumping in moderately lit microhabitats. The observed pattern suggests disperser preferences for those microhabitats resulting in higher seed deposition. 4. Seeds and pollen of F. cyrtophylla were widely dispersed (ranging from 9 m to 2.75 km and 10 m to 3 km, respectively). About two-thirds of seeds and half of the pollen grains were locally dispersed (< 250 m) within the focal population. 5. Significant positive autocorrelations occurred at a local scale (< 10 m) in seeds and seedlings but not in saplings and adults. The SGS pattern disappeared when we reduced the sample size of seedlings to that for the saplings, which suggests that demographic thinning effects (e.g. density-dependent predation and competition) on spatial distribution may lead to the loss of SGS through transitions from seedlings to saplings and adults. 6. Synthesis. Although F. cyrtophylla seeds and pollen were widely dispersed, the significant SGS present in seedlings probably resulted from clumped seed dispersal due to dispersers' behaviour and high seedfall beneath parent trees. The loss of SGS in sapling and adult life stages is probably caused by demographic selection effects during recruitment. Our study emphasizes the different roles of dispersal and local selection in shaping SGS of plant populations.","[Zhou, Hui-Ping; Chen, Jin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Hui-Ping] Yunnan Inst Trop Crops, Jinghong 666100, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China","Chen, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China.",cj@xtbg.org.cn,"Zhou, Huiping/J-3639-2015; Zhou, Huiping/H-6875-2019","Zhou, Huiping/0000-0002-0050-372X",National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30570316],"The authors would like to thank Qingjun Li, Panyu Ren, and Ling Zhang for the support and help in laboratory work, Meng Li for the field work and Sawat Sanitjan for the assistances in bird investigation.

Yet facilitative behaviour is poorly studied, especially in marine ecosystems. We investigated the diet and foraging behaviour of 5 Afro-Palaearctic migratory seabirds during their non-breeding period in West Africa, focussing on their facilitative associations with predatory fishes. We used next-generation sequencing to describe the diet of 5 tern species, employing DNA metabarcoding for the identification of prey from droppings. This is the first time this method has been used for studying the diet of non-breeding migratory seabirds. Our results showed a high diet overlap among all seabirds, mostly due to the dominance of a single prey species, Sardinella maderensis (with a mean frequency of occurrence of 90% in tern diets). The subsurface marine predators identified in association with terns were crevalle jack Caranx hippos and West African Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus tritor, 2 predatory fishes which also rely on Sardinella maderensis as their most frequent prey in the study area, the Bijagos Archipelago. There were marked inter-specific differences in the reliance of terns on subsurface marine predators as facilitators, ranging from completely independent (little tern Sternula albifrons) to near-obligatory (black tern Chlidonias niger). The varied feeding strategies and small-scale spatial segregation may explain the co-existence of the 5 tern species during the non-breeding period, preying mostly on the same clupeids. Declines both in predatory fishes and in Sardinella maderensis and other clupeids are likely to impact the long-distance migrant seabirds studied here, calling for integrated management of fisheries in these coastal ecosystems.","[Correia, Edna; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Mata, Vanessa A.] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Regalla, Aissa] IBAP Inst Biodiversidade & Areas Protegidas Guine, Bissau, Guinea Bissau; [Catry, Paulo] ISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal","Correia, E (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",ednaritacorreia@gmail.com,"Correia, Edna/D-8766-2019; Mata, Vanessa Alves/L-7375-2013; Catry, Paulo/I-5408-2013; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/E-8060-2011","Correia, Edna/0000-0003-3893-1700; Mata, Vanessa Alves/0000-0003-3005-9030; Catry, Paulo/0000-0003-3000-0522; Regalla de Barros, Aissa/0000-0003-1522-8211; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/0000-0002-7207-3474","MAVA Foundation; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT Portugal)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [MARE-UID/MAR/04292/2019, IF/00502/2013/CP1186/CT0003]; FCT/MEC; FEDER within the PT2020 Partnership agreement [UID/AMB/50017]; FEDER within the Compete 2020 [UID/AMB/50017]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PD/BD/52594/2014]","This work was supported by the MAVA Foundation through a project granted to IBAP (Guinea-Bissau) - 'La recherche participative au service de la conservation de la biodiversite du Parc National Marin de Joao Vieira-Poilao (Archipel des Bijagos)'.

The field experiments required to test this hypothesis are complex to implement, but the recent revival of regression methods offers a viable alternative. Here we use the dynamic and static regression methods to determine the importance of D. aurita as a competitor and intraguild predator. Capture-recapture data from two localities in the Rio de Janeiro State were used, Garrafao (municipality of Guapimirim), a coastal forest of the Serra do Mar, and Barra de Marica, a costal sand dune vegetation. Population and microhabitat variables were monitored from April 1997 to April 2003 in Garrafao, and from January 1986 to July 1990 in Barra de Marica. Microhabitat variables were related to Canopy, Plant, Litter and Rock covers, Obstruction from 0 to 1.5 m, and Number of logs. Exploitation competition was tested by the dynamic method, which models the effects of D. aurita on the per capita growth rate of a species. Interference by predation or competition was tested by the static method, where the abundance of D. aurita at trap stations was regressed against the abundance of other small mammals, after removal of any variation associated with microhabitat factors. Exploitation competition was not detected, but the interference of D. aurita was pervasive, affecting all small mammals studied in the two localities. The clear avoidance of D. aurita by all small mammals tested in two localities of different physiognomies indicates that it functions as an intraguild predator, even if actual predation by D. aurita is an occasional event.","[Vieira, Marcus V.; Cerqueira, Rui] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Vertebrados, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Vieira, MV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Vertebrados, CP 68020, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mvvieira@biologia.ufrj.br,"Vieira, Marcus/U-5314-2019; Vieira, Marcus/D-2540-2011; Cerqueira, Rui/E-5321-2011","Vieira, Marcus/0000-0002-4472-5447; ",IBAMA/MMA; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPERJFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ); FUJB; PIBIC/CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"Many colleagues and partners assisted in the fieldwork, particularly Joana Macedo, Diogo Loretto, Rosana Gentile and Simone Freitas.

To this effect, six field campaigns were carried out in four sampling sites during winter season targeting the collection of fish species. A total of 48 samples were collected. Individuals from seven different taxa (marine and estuarine) were collected, although the assemblage was dominated by two estuarine species-the native Pomatoschistus sp. (goby) and the NIS Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichog). Goby was the most abundant taxa in the majority of salt marsh habitats, except for one specific, marsh pool, where extreme environmental conditions were registered, namely high temperature and salinity. Such conditions may have boosted the intrusion of mummichog in this area. This species is well adapted to a wide range of abiotic factors enabling them to colonize habitats where no predators inhabit. Impacts of mummichog introduction in the Guadiana salt marsh area are still unpredictable since this is the first time they have been recorded in such high density. Nevertheless, in scenarios of increased anthropogenic pressure and, consequently, habitat degradation, there is a potential risk of mummichog spreading to other habitats and therefore competing for space and food resources with native species.","[Goncalves, Renata; Teodosio, Maria Alexandra; Cruz, Joana] Ctr Ciencias Mar, CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Ben-Hamadou, Radhouan] Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Doha, Qatar; [Correia, Ana Dulce] Battelle UK Ltd, 29 Springfield Lyons Approach, Chelmsford CM2 5LB, Essex, England; [Chicharo, Luis] Ctr Invest Marinha & Ambiental, CIMA, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal","Goncalves, R (corresponding author), Ctr Ciencias Mar, CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",rgoncalves@ualg.pt; machichar@ualg.pt; jcruz@ualg.pt; benhamadou@qu.edu.qa; correia.ana10@gmail.com; lchichar@ualg.pt,"Cruz, Joana/I-9043-2017; Ben-Hamadou, Radhouan/F-8192-2011","Cruz, Joana/0000-0002-7191-9204; Ben-Hamadou, Radhouan/0000-0003-2686-5822",FCT (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/47985/2008]; European Regional Development Fund (COMPETE program-Operational Competitiveness Program); FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [UID/Multi/04326/2013],"The authors are indebted to Marilia Claro, Katarzyna Sroczynska, and Simao Santos, who helped with the field work.

She will be sadly missed. Plant habitat complexity can buffer against predator-prey interactions by offering physical refuges, and also novel microhabitats for alternative prey. In shallow lakes, submerged and free-floating plants affect predator-prey interactions with expected differences related to climate-driven differences in fish community structure. We tested the overall hypothesis that fish predation shapes the structure of plant-associated macroinvertebrate communities. By introducing artificial free-floating and submerged plants in a total of 14 shallow lakes under contrasting climate regimes (temperate and subtropical), we predicted that higher densities of macroinvertebrates would occur in the temperate zone where littoral fish predation is comparatively weaker than in the subtropics. We also tested the hypothesis that different structural complexities and % PVI would lead to different association patterns. Taxonomic richness, diversity, and densities of plant-attached macroinvertebrates were several fold higher in the temperate lakes. Macroinvertebrate densities per unit of plant weight were generally higher on the more complex free-floating than on the more abundant (as % PVI) submerged plants. The structure of littoral macroinvertebrates showed no clear relationship with the trophic state gradient. Fish communities, whose structure (biomass, density and habitat use) differed consistently between the temperate and subtropical locations, seemingly shaped the macroinvertebrate communities, most likely via predation and in the subtropics potentially also by competition. Free-floating plants appeared as a better anti-predation refuge or a preferred habitat for macroinvertebrates, particularly in the subtropics, but with increasing water turbidity this pattern became less distinct. In contrast, in the temperate lakes, the use of artificial plants by macroinvertebrates was rather related to the biomass of periphyton than to their refuge capacity, thus suggesting stronger bottom-up effects. A stronger fish predation pressure, which is to be expected with climate warming and eutrophication, may reduce the richness and abundance of plant-associated macroinvertebrates, with potentially strong impacts on shallow lake functioning. A warming-driven expansion of free-floating plants could, if moderate, weaken such effects, but a more diverse macrophyte community would facilitate co-existence of macroinvertebrate and fish.","[Clemente, Juan M.; Teixeira-de Mello, Franco; Iglesias, Carlos; Meerhoff, Mariana] Univ Republica, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Dept Ecol & Gest Ambiental, Maldonado, Uruguay; [Boll, Thomas; Jeppesen, Erik; Meerhoff, Mariana] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Pedersen, Asger Roer] Aarhus Univ, Hammel Neurorehabil Ctr, Hammel, Denmark; [Pedersen, Asger Roer] Aarhus Univ, Univ Res Clin, Hammel, Denmark; [Jeppesen, Erik] Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Clemente, JM; Meerhoff, M (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Dept Ecol & Gest Ambiental, Maldonado, Uruguay.; Meerhoff, M (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark.",checho@fcien.edu.uy; merluz@fcien.edu.uy,"Mello, Franco Teixeira-de/AAA-4869-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019","Mello, Franco Teixeira-de/0000-0003-4904-6985; Iglesias, Carlos/0000-0002-4125-3704","Danish Research Agency; AU Centre of Water Technology; PEDECIBA; SNI from ANII (National Agency for Research and Innovation), Uruguay","We thank R.

Several studies have shown that C fluminea can cause large-scale changes in macrozoobenthic assemblages; however, very few attempted to investigate the effects of this IAS on mobile epibenthic species, such as fishes and crustaceans. In this context, the influence of C fluminea on epibenthic species was investigated during one year by comparing the associated epibenthic fauna in three nearby sites of the Minho estuary (NW of the Iberian Peninsula), wherein the abiotic conditions are similar but the density of the Asian clam is highly different. From a total of 13 species, six were significantly influenced by C. fluminea; five responded positively, namely the brown shrimp Crangon crangon, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, the common goby Pomatoschistus microps, the brown trout Salmo trutta fario and the great pipefish Syngnathus acus, whereas the shore crab Carcinus maenas was negatively influenced. However, stomach contents analysis revealed that fish and crustacean species do not feed on C fluminea, suggesting that this IAS is still not a large component of the diet of higher trophic levels in this estuarine ecosystem. Our results suggest that the structure provided by C fluminea shells is likely to be one of the main factors responsible for the differences observed. C fluminea physical structure seems to influence the epibenthic associated fauna, when found in densities higher than 1000 ind./m(2), with sedentary small-bodied crustaceans and fishes being mainly attracted by the increasing in habitat complexity and consequent enhancement of heterogeneity and shelter availability.

For this reason, they have been often used to examine the consequences of competitive interactions. Hosts represent limited resources for larval parasitoid development and thus one competitor usually excludes all others. Although parasitoid competition has been debated and studied over the past several decades, understanding the factors that allow for coexistence among species sharing the same host in the field remains elusive. Parasitoids may be able to coexist on the same host species if they partition host resources according to size, age, or stage, or if their dynamics vary at spatial and temporal scales. One area that has thus far received little experimental attention is if competition can alter host usage strategies in parasitoids that in the absence of competitors attack hosts of the same size in the field. Here, we test this hypothesis with two parasitoid species in the genus Aphytis, both of which are specialized on the citrus pest California red scale Aonidiella aurantii. These parasitoids prefer large scales as hosts and yet coexist in sympatry in eastern parts of Spain. Parasitoids and hosts were sampled in 12 replicated orange groves. When host exploitation by the stronger competitor, A. melinus, was high the poorer competitor, A. chrysomphali, changed its foraging strategy to prefer alternative plant substrates where it parasitized hosts of smaller size. Consequently, the inferior parasitoid species shifted both its habitat and host size as a result of competition. Our results suggest that density-dependent size-mediated asymmetric competition is the likely mechanism allowing for the coexistence of these two species, and that the use of suboptimal (small) hosts can be advantageous under conditions imposed by competition where survival in higher quality larger hosts may be greatly reduced.","[Pekas, Apostolos; Garcia-Mari, Ferran] Univ Politecn Valencia, IAM, Cami de Vera 14, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Tena, Alejandro] UJI, IVIA, Unidad Asociada Entomol, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Harvey, Jeffrey A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Frago, Enric] Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, Droevendaalsesteeg 1,Bldg 107,POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Frago, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, Droevendaalsesteeg 1,Bldg 107,POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",enric.frago@gmail.com,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Harvey, Jeffrey A/B-7439-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Harvey, Jeffrey A/0000-0002-4227-7935; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of SpainSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [AGL2005-07155-C03-03]; European CommunityEuropean Commission [329648],"We would like to thank Amparo Aguilar for her valuable help in the field and in the laboratory, and Camille Ponzio for her comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

According to the apparent competition hypothesis (ACH), less-abundant prey species (e.g. ptarmigan, waders and small passerines) will experience higher predation rates when breeding in association with the more common prey (geese), due to spill-over predation by the shared predator. As many of these less-abundant species are endemic and/or red-listed, increased predation can have negative repercussions on their populations. We used a one-year baited artificial nest study to assess relative nest predation risk on Svalbard Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus muta hyperborea, small waders (Purple Sandpiper Calidris maritima, Dunlin Calidris alpina, plovers Charadrius spp., and phalaropes Phalaropus spp.) and Snow bunting Plectrophenax nivalis in two study locations contrasted by nesting density of Arctic breeding geese (Pink-footed Goose Anser brachyrhynchus and Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis). We predicted higher predation risk for the less-abundant species in the study location with higher goose abundance. However, we found that relative nest predation risk was lower in the study location with higher goose abundance, thus being compatible with apparent mutualism and/or prey swamping mechanisms. Our results contrast with those from more structurally complex Arctic ecosystems and suggest that allochtonous subsidies from temperate ecosystems structure the predation pattern in this high-Arctic tundra ecosystem.","[Pedersen, Ashild O.; Fuglei, Eva] NPI, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Eidesen, Pernille B.] Univ Ctr Svalbard UNIS, Postbox 156, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Norway; [Ims, Rolf A.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Postbox 6050, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Stien, Jennifer; Jepsen, Jane U.; Stien, Audun; Tombre, Ingunn] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Arctic Ecol Dept, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway","Pedersen, AO (corresponding author), NPI, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.",aashild.pedersen@npolar.no,,"Jepsen, Jane Uhd/0000-0003-1517-1569; Stien, Audun/0000-0001-8046-7337",Fram Centre; Norwegian Polar Institute; Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk; University Centre in Svalbard,"Funding for this study was provided by the Fram Centre, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research and the University Centre in Svalbard.

In this research, under laboratory conditions, the suitability of the two most abundant aphid species in citrus agroecosystems of the Western Mediterranean basin, Aphis gossypii and A. spiraecola were evaluated for two of their principle natural enemies, the coccinellid predators Scymnus subvillosus and S. interruptus.

Some biological parameters of S. interruptus were lower when they were exclusively fed A. spiraecola; as opposed to when only fed A. gossypii. These differences were not found with S. subvillosus. When a mixed diet of both aphids was offered, the fitness of both predators was higher than when they were each fed only a single aphid species. These laboratory observations were further confirmed under field conditions, wherein S. subvillosus abundance was greater in those colonies where A. spiraecola was predominant. On the other hand both, S. subvillosus and S. interruptus were found equally in A. gossypii colonies. Implications of these results for the biological control of aphids in this crop are discussed.","[Bouvet, J. P. R.] INTA, EEA, Concordia, Entre Rios, Argentina; [Bouvet, J. P.

We investigate potential benefits and costs of a common and varied morphological trait, cuticular spines, for foraging behavior, interspecific competition, and predator-prey interactions in naturally co-occurring spiny ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Polyrhachis) in an experimental setting. We expect that a defensive trait like spines might be associated with more conspicuous foraging, a greater number of workers sent out to forage, and potentially increased competitive ability. Alternatively, consistent with the ecological trade-off hypothesis, we expect that investment in spines for antipredator defense might be negatively correlated with these other ecological traits. We find little evidence for any costs to ecological traits, instead finding that species with longer spines either outperform or do not differ from species with shorter spines for all tested metrics, including resource discovery rate and foraging effort as well as competitive ability and antipredator defense. Spines appear to confer broad antipredator benefits and serve as a form of defense with undetectable costs to key ecological abilities like resource foraging and competitive ability, providing an explanation for both the ecological success of the study genus and the large number of evolutionary origins of this trait across all ants. This study also provides a rare quantitative empirical test of ecological effects related to a morphological trait in ants.","[Blanchard, Benjamin D.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Blanchard, Benjamin D.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Dept Sci & Educ, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Nakamura, Akihiro; Cao, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun, Peoples R China; [Chen, Stephanie T.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC USA; [Moreau, Corrie S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol & Ecol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Moreau, Corrie S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Blanchard, BD (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bblanchard@fieldmuseum.org,"Nakamura, Akihiro/O-8384-2018","Nakamura, Akihiro/0000-0001-7349-5102; Moreau, Corrie/0000-0003-1139-5792; Blanchard, Benjamin/0000-0002-7747-6934","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1614105, DEB-1701352, IOS-1916995]","We express our gratitude to XTBG for extensive logistical support, especially Hui Xian, Yi Wan, Hui Wang, and Xiao Yang.

While the use of free water is influenced by physiological factors (e.g., species-specific water requirements, moisture in forage, temperature), nonphysiological factors, such as habitat characteristics and interspecific interactions, are also important. In fact, for species of concern, interspecific interactions and habitat can be important factors influencing their spatial and temporal use of the landscape and its resources. The kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) is a small carnivore considered to be a species of concern over much of its range, and two of the most important conservation challenges it faces are related to (1) habitat and (2) predation/competition by intraguild species. Our objective was to determine the influence of habitat characteristics, predators (bobcats [Lynx rufus], coyotes [Canis latrans]), and potential competitors (badgers [Taxidea taxus], gray foxes [Urocyon cinereoargenteus]) on the use of water by kit foxes. From June to September 2010-2012, we used remote cameras to monitor carnivores at 63 water sources in the Mojave Desert. We used zero-inflated mixed-effects models and a two-stage model selection analysis to evaluate the influence of habitat, predators, and competitors on spatial visits to water by kit foxes. We also assessed temporal avoidance of intraguild predators and competitors by kit foxes at water sources using a coefficient of overlap. We found that visual obscurity, overhead canopy cover, badgers, and coyotes influenced spatial visits of kit foxes. In addition, kit foxes exhibited strong temporal overlap with badgers and bobcats, moderate temporal overlap with gray foxes, and weak temporal overlap with coyotes. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the spatial and temporal use of water sources by kit foxes is dynamic, depending on habitat characteristics and the activity of intraguild predators and competitors.","[Hall, Lucas K.] Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA; [Larsen, Randy T.; McMillan, Brock R.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Knight, Robert N.] US Army Dugway Proving Ground, Environm Programs, Dugway, UT 84022 USA","Hall, LK (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",lhall12@csub.edu,,,Utah Division of Wildlife Resources [106298]; Utah Chapter of The Wildlife Society,"We would like to thank R.

The aim of this laboratory study was to compare two predators of the rosy apple aphid (RAA) Dysaphis plantaginea: the generalist Forficula auricularia and the specialist Episyrphus balteatus. Predation by 2nd and 3rd instar larvae of E. balteatus and 3rd and 4th instar nymphs of F. auricularia was evaluated individually and in combination for 24 h in Petri dishes. Five different densities (25, 50, 75, 100 and 200) of 1st or 3rd instar nymphs of RAA were incubated at three different temperatures (15, 20 and 25 degrees C). Overall, the older life-stages of both predator species were more voracious than younger individuals. The two predator species did not negatively interact. Instead, when the RAA density was not limiting they had an additive effect. Although the predators consumed significantly higher numbers of RAA when the younger life-stages were offered, they fed more efficiently on the older life-stages of RAA with consumption of 1.8- to 2.7-fold higher biomass. In general, the most RAA were consumed at 20 degrees C. Syrphids consumed more RAA at 15 degrees C than at 25 degrees C whereas earwigs consumed slightly more aphids at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Overall, the two predators consumed a constant proportion of RAA at the first four RAA densities until reaching satiation. This finding suggests that in theory they would be effective in regulating RAA numbers in early spring when field RAA populations are beginning to build up. The potency of both predators, alone or in combination, should now be tested for augmentative approaches in semi-field and field studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Conservation of native fishes requires understanding of food web changes resulting from the introduction of non-native species, flow alteration and other human impacts. Using delta(13)C and delta(15)N analysis of fishes and invertebrates we investigated the effects of non-native species, and reservoirs on food webs of the Laja river ecosystem (Guanajuato, central Mexico). We estimated trophic position (TP), relative trophic niche and food web dispersion at 11 reservoir, river and tailwater sites. Reservoirs and non-native fishes modified food webs in the Laja. Food web dispersion was greater in reservoir than in tailwater and river sites. Reservoir food webs had the greatest range of delta(13)C values, indicating a more diverse resource base compared to rivers. delta(13)C values increased with distance downstream from reservoirs, suggesting declining subsidies of river food webs by reservoir productivity. Stable isotopes revealed potential effects of non-native fishes on native fishes via predation or competition. Non-native Micropterus salmoides were top predators in the system. Non-natives Cyprinus carpio, Oreochromis mossambicus and Carassius auratus exhibited lowest TP in the Laja but overlapped significantly with most native species, indicating potential for resource competition. Native Chirostoma jordani was the only species with a significantly different trophic niche from all other fish. Many rivers in central Mexico share similar anthropogenic impacts and similar biotas, such that food web patterns described here are likely indicative of other river systems in central Mexico.

The species is sometimes seen in primary rainforest, although at a curiously low density compared with that of other monkey species. We conducted a 24-month field study in the tropical rainforest of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast, and found that putty-nosed monkeys require an ecological niche almost identical to that of the Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana. Moreover, the niche breadth of putty-nosed monkeys was significantly decreased in the presence of Diana monkeys, suggesting that feeding competition with Diana monkeys kept putty-nosed monkeys from successfully colonizing a rainforest habitat. However, contrary to the interspecies competition hypothesis, groups of both species almost completely overlapped in home ranges and formed near-permanent mixed-species associations, rather than avoiding each other. We hypothesized that Diana monkeys tolerated immigrating putty-nosed monkeys and formed mixed-species groups with them, despite high levels of competition, because of their merit in predation defense. Direct observations and a series of field experiments confirmed that male putty-nosed monkeys play a vital role in defense against crowned eagles, suggesting that putty-nosed monkeys obtain access to feeding trees by offering antipredation benefits to Diana monkeys. We discuss these findings in light of biological market theory.","Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire; Univ Leipzig, Fak Biowissensch Pharm & Psychol, Abt Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews KY16 9JP, Fife, Scotland","Zuberbuhler, K (corresponding author), Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, BP 1303, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire.",kz3@st-and.ac.uk,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X",,,,44,72,78,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Some species, however, do show an opposite tendency. We argue that release of competition between a strong competitor and a weak one is a plausible explanation for these different sensitivities to area reduction. We provide a quantitative model for competitive release caused by habitat limitation, solely based on the balance of diffusion and growth of the species. We show that in small habitat patches the stronger competitor has its density diminished, as opposite to the weaker competitor who, in a certain area range, has its density increased. We examine field data from an ecological experiment in Amazonia (BDFFP) which measured densities of two Amazonian rodents who showed opposite sensitivity to area reduction and we argue that our model explains the observations accurately. This implies that (i) area reduction is a strong factor determining densities of species in patches of habitat, regardless of considerations on degradation or edge effects and (ii) that species interactions have to be taken into account to explain sensitivity to size of the patches in ecological communities. We also discuss alternative explanations, such as predator release and effects due to imperfect isolation. Moreover, we stress the conceptual and mathematical simplicity of our model, which, nevertheless explains a phenomenon not yet well understood. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Theoretical studies indicate that indirect interactions between two prey types that share common predators can be positive, neutral or negative. We document a positive indirect interaction between different types of prey fish on coral reefs in Australia. A high abundance of one type of prey fish (cardinalfishes: Apogonidae) resulted in higher recruitment, abundance and species richness of other prey fish. Our evidence indicates that these effects were not due to differential settlement but were instead due to differential post-settlement predation. We hypothesize that resident piscivores altered their foraging behaviour by concentrating on highly abundant cardinal-fish when they were present, leaving recruits of other species relatively unmolested. Indirect effects were evident within 48 h of settlement and persisted throughout the 42-day experiment, highlighting the importance of early post-settlement processes in these communities.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Webster, MS (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,34,41,41,0,28,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Each of these myrmecophiles has adapted in a highly specific way to the lifestyle of its host. We studied this diverse myrmecophile fauna of L. distinguenda as a new model for multispecies parasitism to gain a better understanding of fundamental coevolutionary processes. Our study focused on behavioural and on chemical integration and exploitation strategies of the different symbiont species. In addition, we examined potential counterstrategies of the host ant. Myrmecophiles were studied both in large free-living L. distinguenda colonies and in more detail in parts of colonies separated for observation. We found that at least five myrmecophile species imposed cost on their host by exploiting its resources. Their impact varied considerably depending on both the type of resources exploited and their abundance. Myrmecophile species were well integrated into host societies either by chemical mimicry of host cuticular hydrocarbons or by remaining chemically insignificant, lacking most characteristic recognition cues. Despite these chemical integration strategies, host ants were able to recognize and kill the alien intruders to various degrees. This important finding demonstrates that symbiont populations are actively counter-regulated by the host. By constructing a host-parasite interaction network, we finally suggest that host defences can maintain myrmecophile diversity by keeping parasite populations small. This reduces interguild competition, comparable to top-down effects of predators on lower trophic levels in ecological food webs. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Research in this area is needed due to the often contradictory predictions provided by the many theoretical models, the increasing dependence on biological control, and the concern that biological control agents may adversely affect some nontarget organisms. We describe a study whereby the occurrence and dynamics of interspecific interactions among three natural enemies (two parasitoids: Encarsia formosa and Encarsia pergandiella; and one predator Delphastus pusillus) of the whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii (previously referred to as Bemisia tabaci strain ''B''), were evaluated in greenhouse cage experiments. Eight populations consisting of all possible combinations of the three natural enemies and one population of whitefly alone were established to test the following hypotheses: (1) Natural enemy introductions are capable of suppressing B. argentifolii populations; (2) all interspecific interactions are detrimental to achieving biological control; (3) the likelihood of achieving biological control decreases as the potential number of interspecific interactions increases; and (4) the species composition of biological control agents is of greater consequence than the number of natural enemy species released. In addition, we tested the hypothesis (5) that the frequency of interspecific interactions increases with a decrease in host or prey availability. Our results demonstrate that all combinations of natural enemies provided significant levels of whitefly suppression. While the intensities of interspecific interactions among natural enemy species were frequently positively and significantly correlated with the densities of parasitized whitefly, interspecific interactions among natural enemies were not detrimental to achieving higher levels of biological control. The composition of species released, rather than the number of species released, was of greater importance to accomplishing biological control. Releases of D. pusillus in combination with one or both of the parasitoids provided the greatest levels of whitefly suppression. These results suggest that the types of interspecific interactions rather than the numbers of interspecific interactions among natural enemies may be important to the outcome of inundative biological control programs.

The framework established by earlier population-specific studies, however, cannot be overlooked. Examination of the feeding habits of fish ranging from planktivores to piscivores gave the first indication that trophic processes were influenced by the spatial complexity and annual hydrological patterns of river-floodplain ecosystems. Experimental studies, which have often been considered impossible or impractical in large rivers, demonstrated the potential for biotic controls of system dynamics through predator-prey and competitive interactions. Such studies have been particularly helpful in understanding the potential impact of non-native species, including zebra mussels and Asian carp, to biodiversity and secondary production. Our understanding of riverine ecosystem function expanded greatly as food web studies began the application of a new tool-natural stable isotopes. Studies employing stable isotopes illustrated how food webs in a number of large rivers throughout the world are supported by the autochthonous production of microalgae. This study, coupled with other studies testing the prevailing models of riverine ecosystem function, has brought us to a point of better understanding the nature of river ecosystem functions. It is through looking back at the earlier studies of fish diet that we should realize that the temporal and spatial complexities of river ecosystem function must still be addressed more fully. This and a better grasp of the significance of the arrangement of patches within the riverine landscape will prove beneficial, as we assess the appropriate scale of river rehabilitation with an eye on how rehabilitation promotes productivity within complex ecosystems, including the Upper Mississippi River.","Winona State Univ, Large River Studies Ctr, Dept Biol, Winona, MN 55987 USA","Delong, MD (corresponding author), Winona State Univ, Large River Studies Ctr, Dept Biol, Winona, MN 55987 USA.",mdelong@winona.edu,,,,,,54,18,20,1,76,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,FEB,2010,640,1,,,,,89,101,,10.1007/s10750-009-0065-6,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,546KR,WOS:000273810200006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Fueling in migrants is controlled by intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors. From captive studies we have started understanding the internal mechanisms controlling bird migration. Field studies have demonstrated the effects of external factors, such as food availability, weather, competitors, parasites or diseases, on the stopover behavior of migrants. However, an integrated approach is still missing to study coherently how the innate migration program interacts with the varying environmental cues and to estimate the contribution of the innate migration program and the environment to realized migration. The northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe offers a unique opportunity for integrated studies. It breeds across almost the whole Holarctic with just a gap between eastern Canada and Alaska. All breeding populations over-winter in sub-Saharan Africa which makes the northern wheatear one of the most long-distant migratory songbirds with extraordinary long non-stop flights across oceans. It is a nocturnal migrant which travels without parental or social aid/guidance. Thus, young birds rely entirely on endogenous mechanisms of timing, route selection and fueling on their first outbound migration. By establishing indoor housing under controlled conditions the endogenous control mechanisms of northern wheatear migration could be revealed. At the same time, environmental factors controlling fueling could be investigated in the field. On migration wheatears occur in a variety of habitats with sparse vegetation where their stopover behavior could be quantitatively studied in the light of optimal migration theory by the use of remote balances, radio-tagging and even experimentally manipulated food availability. The present paper summarizes our approach to understand the control of migration in northern wheatears by combining field and laboratory studies at various spatial and temporal scales, and linking various sub-disciplines.","[Bairlein, Franz; Delingat, Julia; Eikenaar, Cas; Bulte, Marc; Schmaljohann, Heiko] Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Dierschke, Volker] Gavia EcoRes, D-21423 Winsen, Luhe, Germany; [Maggini, Ivan] Univ Western Ontario, Adv Facil Avian Res, London, ON N6G 1G9, Canada","Bairlein, F (corresponding author), Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",franz.bairlein@ifv-vogelwarte.de,"Maggini, Ivan/I-1744-2014; Schmaljohann, Heiko/A-2284-2011","Schmaljohann, Heiko/0000-0002-0886-4319; Maggini, Ivan/0000-0002-1528-2288",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [BA 816/15-4],This work was supported financially by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (BA 816/15-4).

One example is the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus which has established large populations in European rivers and is widely considered as the main cause for the decline of native benthic invertebrates. This effect has been mainly associated with direct predation, whereas the indirect effects via competition for primary resources are poorly understood and possibly underestimated. To assess the probability of these indirect effects, we performed five outdoor flow-through mesocosm experiments in three European rivers, manipulating the density of D. villosus. We quantified its in-situ food consumption during three 24-h gut content surveys in the mesocosms. Gut evacuation rates for correction were measured in the laboratory for different food sources and under continuous feeding. We analysed the invader's effects on primary resources by quantifying periphyton biomass and community leaf litter decomposition in the mesocosms at different D. villosus densities. The remarkably high food consumption rates (0.38-1.27 mg mg(-1) d(-1), in dry mass/dry body mass) of D. villosus can be attributed to its high gut evacuation rates. The leaf litter decomposition rates indicate that D. villosus is an efficient shredder; however, there was no effect on periphyton biomass. Our results indicate that D. villosus may be a strong competitor with primary consumers in benthic food webs of invaded rivers, with both direct and indirect negative effects on benthic communities. High consumption rates together with opportunistic feeding behaviour probably promote the invasion success of this amphipod.","[Worischka, Susanne; Richter, Luise; Haenig, Anne] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrobiol, Zellescher Weg 40, D-01217 Dresden, Germany; [Worischka, Susanne; Hellmann, Claudia; Becker, Jochen; Winkelmann, Carola] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Integrated Nat Sci, Univ Str 1, D-56070 Koblenz, Germany; [Hellmann, Claudia] Biota Inst Okol Forsch & Planung GmbH, Nebelring 15, D-18246 Butzow, Germany; [Kratina, Pavel] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England","Worischka, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrobiol, Zellescher Weg 40, D-01217 Dresden, Germany.; Worischka, S (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Integrated Nat Sci, Univ Str 1, D-56070 Koblenz, Germany.",susanne.worischka@tu-dresden.de; luise.richter2@tu-dresden.de; haenig@googlemail.com; hellmann@institut-biota.de; jochenbecker@uni-koblenz.de; p.kratina@qmul.ac.uk; cawinkelmann@uni-koblenz.de,"Kratina, Pavel/O-5192-2019; Worischka, Susanne/AAV-2204-2021","Kratina, Pavel/0000-0002-9144-7937; ","German Research Foundation (DFG, Emmy Noether program)German Research Foundation (DFG) [WI 3591/1]","This study was part of a project supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Emmy Noether program, WI 3591/1).

Field experiments demonstrated that large numbers of individuals of this species, comprising similar to 90% of a suite of gastropod scavengers, were attracted to baited traps in the subtidal sands of Lobster Bay, Cape d'Aguilar Marine Reserve, Hong Kong. Laboratory experiments identified the effective chemo-detection distances of E. contractus as 60 em in still and > 80 cm in flowing water, respectively. The average times to arrival at bait in still and flowing water were 92.3 and 69.0 min, respectively, but were significantly less for individuals experiencing a longer period of starvation. The mean dine taken for E contractus to consume a meal was 70.6 min. Comparisons were made between Ergalatax contractus and Nassarius nodifer, representative of a suite of sympatric scavenging nassariids in Lobster Bay The nassariid arrived significantly faster at bait in both still (30.2 min) and flowing water (20.8 min) than E. contractus and fed faster (25.7 min), as is typical of representatives of the Nassariidae. Although the two species partition carrion resources temporally, manipulation experiments provided evidence for inter-specific competition between them. That is, although E. contractus possesses the morphological and behavioural characteristics of a predator, its opportunistic scavenging abilities have led to its success and numerical superiority on the shallow subtidal sands of Lobster Bay. The dominance of E. contractus in Lobster Bay, and elsewhere in Hong Kong, is unusual. Here, the normally predatory E. contractus, far outnumbers all other scavengers, possibly because of an enhanced, largely allochthonous, supply of food which it is able to exploit by virtue of its previously identified opportunistic habit of scavenging the leftovers of other predators. The presence of inter-specific competition between E. contractus and a sympatric suite of nassariids enhances, not impedes; carrion exploitation.","Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Shek O, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Morton, B (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",prof_bsmorton@hotmail.com,,,,,,68,10,10,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Using sediment from Bjornhordenbukta, a small, sheltered bay in Oslofjord, areas were subjected to 20 weeks of continuous disturbance from urchins at densities equivalent to 28 and 71 individuals m(-2), whilst other areas remained undisturbed. Low density treatments, reflecting the natural field densities observed during collection of the sediment, produced higher infaunal beta diversity than the heavily disturbed or control treatments and this could be attributed to a decrease in competitive exclusion. This is consistent with the predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell, 1978). Bioturbation also caused a significant change in the chemistry of the surface sediment increasing oxygenation, decreasing the rates of denitrification and increasing the precipitation of phosphate. It is concluded that the disturbance activity of Brissopsis lyuifera may play a vital role in the maintenance of regional diversity and in the mediation of geochemical processes.

Adult female predators were given prey as mixed populations of phytoseiid larvae and larvae of a more preferred species, the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, at different densities and ratios. Typhlodromus pyri, more of a generalist predator, showed higher rates of predation and cannibalism on phytoseiid immatures at most prey densities and ratios. Manly preference indices indicated that T. pyri switched to feed on phytoseiid larvae at higher prey levels and ratios of T. urticae than M. occidentalis. This greater ability to use phytoseiid larvae as prey may help stabilize T. pyri populations when more preferred prey is unavailable.

Mid-tide levels of these shores are commonly dominated by a lush canopy of perennial fucoid rockweeds, with an understory of mussels, barnacles and crustose algae. Patches of cleared space in these canopies are often occupied by ephemeral algae. After the scour, emergent rock in mid-shore areas was occupied by a succession of diatoms, green and blue-green ephemeral algae, and then Fucus canopy. Mussels reappeared in the understory, but rarely displaced the rockweed canopy. These events provided an exceptional opportunity to study recovery dynamics in a perennial intertidal community, at a scale (> 40 km) much larger than any in previous studies. This paper describes large-scale patterns of natural succession at a variety of locations and disturbance intensities, and then reviews the community structure in the light of several experimental tests of processes and species interactions during the succession. Formation of a Fucus canopy was ubiquitous, and variations in the recruitment and regeneration of Fucus were major influences on the rate of succession and the abundance of other species. A survey of Fucus and mussel dominance over about 15 km of coastline supports this view. Most areas in this survey were not dominated by mussels, but by the small-scale patch dynamics of ephemeral algae and Fucus, in succession. Previous work suggested that emergent rock on these shores is normally dominated by fucoid rockweeds because predatory whelks control competition with the mussels, and because herbivorous littorinid snails control competition with ephemeral algae. However, our observational and experimental results show that these interactions were not generally important during this succession, and that the importance of different species and interactions varies. Our results emphasize the importance of several properties of the rockweeds, as the most abundant and structurally important species. These conclusions suggest caution in the extrapolation of specific, small-scale experiments to general hypotheses about community structure and recovery from disturbance.

During a study on the great tit at Wytham Wood, Oxfordshire, nest predation by weasels was as high as 50% in some years prior to 1976. In 1976, nest-boxes were made virtually predator proof. 2. The change in nest-box type increased local recruitment rate and total population size of great and blue tits. We examined here the consequences of reduced nest predation on the survival rate of the great tit late in life. 3. Prior to 1976 (during the nest predation period), survival rate after the age of 5 years showed no decline and no relationship to the number of successful breeding attempts in either sex. 4. After 1976 (predator-proof period), both sexes showed increased mortality rates after the age of 5. However, only female survival was related to the number of successful breeding attempts, with a negative correlation. 5. This enhanced mortality late in life is likely to result from an increased cost of reproduction due to the combined effects of increased competition (higher adult density) and increased investment in reproduction (more young to raise because of reduced nest predation). These results fit predictions from life history theory, where increased effort early in life is predicted to trade with survival late in life.","EDWARD GREY INST FIELD ORNITHOL, DEPT ZOOL, OXFORD, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,59,56,58,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

On intertidal mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, mechanisms underlying the negative correlation between the densities of two dominant macro-invertebrates, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsolete and the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator, are unclear. We investigated the effect of mud snail density on survival, growth and fecundity of C volutator in 2-wk experiments in the laboratory and field, and observed behavioral interactions between the two species. Snails negatively affected juvenile and adult survival of amphipods, juvenile growth, and proportion of females. that were ovigerous. Behavioral observations revealed that snails are active predators of C. volutator, both juveniles and adults. We documented several attack methods by snails. As well, we observed that C volutator could become entangled in laid mucus trails of snails, leaving them vulnerable to attack from snail trail-followers or other predators. Snail predation, in combination with increased C. volutator migration in the presence of snails, appears to be a primary short-term mechanism for the observed negative correlation between these invertebrate species. Competition (likely through interference), resulting in lowered growth and fecundity, may be a longer-term mechanism for this negative correlation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The species were raised alone and together at two densities in replicated artificial ponds.

Competition was detected as a decrease in grown rate with increasing, density, but competition was riot so strong as to influence the survival of either species. Ambystoma macrodactylum grew slowly relative to heterospecifics, and growth declined more with increasing conspecific density than with heterospecific density. In contrast, growth of A. gracile leas depressed more by increasing density. of the slower growing heterospecifics: These differences in effects of competition likely arise from differing breeding phenology-A. macrodactylum breeds earlier than A. gracile, and A. macrodae- was larger than A. gracile when the latter were added to the experimental ponds. The results provide no evidence for competitive differences or interaction at tire loo density used here. Assuming a coexistence mechanism exists to offset the competitive asymmetry at high density, I present a testable hypothesis on the mechanism of differential susceptibility of the species to predation.","Evergreen State Coll, Olympia, WA 98505 USA","Pearman, PB (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Abt Okol, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Pearman, Peter B/C-6298-2011","Pearman, Peter B/0000-0002-0794-101X",,,,40,2,3,0,11,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,EMPORIA,"EMPORIA STATE UNIV, DIVISION BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 1200 COMMERCIAL ST, EMPORIA, KS 66801-5087 USA",0018-0831,,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,JUN,2002,58,2,,,,,156,165,,10.1655/0018-0831(2002)058[0156:IBASLE]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Zoology,Zoology,557GM,WOS:000175900800002,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we examine interactions among two pairs of invasive crayfish species because of their close proximity and thus chance of sympatric populations in the near future within the Thames catchment, U.K. (signal, Pacifastacus leniusculus and virile crayfish, Orconectes virilis within a river system; red swamp, Procambarus clarkii and Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus found within a suite of ponds). We address two questions: do sympatric invasive crayfish occupy a smaller niche than their allopatric counterparts due to potential resource competition? and do interactions among invasive species amplify or mitigate one another's impacts on the ecosystem? Two fully factorial mesocosm experiments (one for each crayfish pair) were used to investigate crayfish diet and their impact on benthic invertebrate community structure, benthic algal standing stock and leaf litter decomposition rates in allopatric and sympatric populations, compared with a crayfish-free control. We used stable isotope analysis to examine crayfish diet in the mesocosms and in allopatric populations of each species in the Thames catchment. Isotopic niche width did not vary significantly between allopatric and sympatric populations of crayfish in the mesocosm experiments, and isotopic niche partitioning in all the wild populations suggests the invaders can coexist. All four species altered benthic invertebrate community structure but with differing functional effects, often mediated via trophic cascades. Red swamp crayfish predation upon snails evidently promoted benthic algal standing stock via reduction in grazing pressure. However, a trophic cascade whereby the crayfish consumed native invertebrate shredders, causing a reduction in net leaf litter decomposition, was decoupled by red swamp and signal crayfish since they consumed leaf litter directly and thus moderated the cascade to a trickle when in sympatry with Turkish or virile crayfish, respectively. Benthic invertebrate predator abundance was significantly reduced by sympatric red swamp and Turkish crayfish but not independently when in allopatry, indicating an amplified effect overall when in sympatry. Our results suggest that the combined effect of multiple invasions on the ecosystem can reflect either an additive effect of their independent impacts or an amplified effect, which is greater than the sum of their independent impacts. A lack of general pattern in their effects makes any potential management strategy more complex.","[Jackson, Michelle C.; Jones, Tabitha; Milligan, Maaike; Sheath, Danny; Taylor, Jeff; Grey, Jonathan] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Jackson, Michelle C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Sheath, Danny] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Ellis, Adam; England, Judy] Environm Agcy, Hatfield, Herts, England","Jackson, MC (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.",mjackson@zoology.up.ac.za; j.grey@qmul.ac.uk,,"Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271",Environment Agency,"We are grateful to the Environment Agency for funding and to numerous colleagues for assistance, particularly Paul Fletcher.

(Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), in its new range to explore reasons for the invader's relatively slow spread. Tetropium fuscum is a European spruce borer established in Nova Scotia since at least 1990, but it has spread only about 125 km from its site of introduction. We compared the densities of Tetropium spp., their known parasitoids, and the community of wood-boring insects at sites located within the invasion zone in Nova Scotia versus well outside this zone, in New Brunswick, Canada. Using red spruce trees stressed by girdling or felling, we tested whether: 1) T. fuscum had altered the native wood-boring community; 2) T. fuscum displaced a native congener, Tetropium cinnamopterum (Kirby); and 3) parasitism rates of Tetropium spp. differed between the invaded and noninvaded zones. Both Tetropium spp. and their parasitoid wasps emerged exclusively from felled trees as opposed to girdled trees. We found no difference in community diversity inside versus outside the invasion zone. The combined densities of both Tetropium spp. and their overall parasitism rates also did not differ between zones, but T. cinnamopterum density was significantly greater outside the invasion zone, suggesting T. fuscum may displace the native congener where they are sympatric. Our results suggest that the native and invasive Tetropium spp. act as a single functional species in the invasion zone. We speculate that natural control agents (predators, parasitoids, and competitors) might be limiting the rate of spread of T. fuscum.","[Dearborn, Kenneth W.; Heard, Stephen B.] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; [Sweeney, Jon] Nat Resources Canada, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, POB 4000, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada; [Pureswaran, Deepa S.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, 1055 Rue PEPS, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Pureswaran, DS (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, 1055 Rue PEPS, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",kenneth.dearborn@bell.net; sheard@unb.ca; jswee-ney@nrcan.gc.ca; deepa.pureswaran@canada.ca,"Pureswaran, Deepa/G-8074-2019; Sweeney, Jonathan/Q-5281-2019",,"Canadian Forest Service of Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; SERG-International Members; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN 2011-386164, RGPIN 2015-04418]","We thank Kate van Rooyen, Andrew Morrison, Cory Hughes, Chantelle Alderson, Vincent Webster, Bethany Nordstrom, Lisa Leachman, Wayne MacKay, and Wayne MacKinnon for assistance in the lab and field.

I sampled vegetation and counted birds in 90 hayfields of various ages (i.e. number of years since planting) and sizes that were originally planted to a legume-dominated seed mixture. I also resampled a subset of these fields two years later. Over time, these hayfields changed from tall, dense, homogeneous stands of legume-dominated vegetation to short, sparse, patchy stands of grass-dominated vegetation. Fields of all ages were dominated by introduced plant species. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), the most common bird species breeding in these fields, were most common in fields of intermediate ages, whereas numbers of Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), the second most abundant species, increased logarithmically with field age. Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrows (A. henslowii) were most abundant in the oldest hayfields, whereas abundances of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis, the third most common species) did not differ in fields of different ages. Bird-species richness and diversity increased linearly with hayfield age. Three species (Red-winged Blackbird, Bobolink, Savannah Sparrow) accounted for more than 90% of the breeding individuals. Vegetation structure, composition, and patch size were the most important proximate correlates of habitat selection for these species. Hayfield size was positively correlated with abundance for five of the seven most common species. Furthermore, those species that nested late in the season (Bobolinks, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Henslow's Sparrows) had low breeding densities in fields with early mowing dates the previous year.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA",,,,,,,,53,72,73,1,20,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,JUL,1995,112,3,,,,,720,730,,,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,TZ356,WOS:A1995TZ35600015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Annual grasses were grown either alone or in mixtures, at different distances from rows of Dactylis glomerata (cocksfoot) and Phalaris aquatica (phalaris). Dactylis had a greater suppressive effect than Phalaris on Vulpia and Hordeum. Biomass, tiller production, and panicle production of annual grasses increased linearly with increasing distance from the perennial row. Tiller and panicle production were greater for Vulpia than Hordeum. The estimated rate of population growth (l) for annual grasses was greater in Phalaris than in Dactylis and in Vulpia than in Hordeum, and increased with sowing distance from perennial grass rows. It was estimated that l, when seeds were sown directly adjacent to a row of perennial grasses, was 1 and 0.4 for Vulpia and Hordeum, respectively, within Dactylis stands, and 7 and 3, respectively, within Phalaris stands. However, 15 cm from the row, l reached 50 and 39 for Vulpia and Hordeum, respectively, within Phalaris stands, and 39 and 16, respectively, within Dactylis stands. In grazed, dryland pastures, perennial competition alone is therefore unlikely to prevent population growth of annual grasses, especially in systems heavily disturbed by grazing or drought. However, Dactylis showed more promise than Phalaris in limiting the abundance of these weeds.","[Cousens, R.

However, considerable debate exists over whether multiple natural enemies often interact to produce additive or non-additive effects on their prey or host populations. Based on the large data set stored in the Sao Joao and Barra sugarcane mills (state of Sao Paulo, Brazil) regarding the programme of biological control of Diatraea saccharalis using the parasitoids Cotesia flavipes and tachinid flies, in the present study the author investigated whether the parasitoids released into sugarcane fields interfered significantly with the rate of parasitized D. saccharalis hosts. The author also observed whether there was an additive effect of releasing C. flavipes and tachinids on the rate of parasitized hosts, and looked for evidence of possible negative effects of the use of multiple parasitoid species in this biological control programme. Results showed that C. flavipes and the tachinids were concomitantly released in the Barra Mill, but not in the Sao Jao Mill. Furthermore, in the Barra Mill there was evidence that the parasitoids interacted because the percentage of parasitism did not increase after the release of either C. flavipes or tachinids. In the Sao Joao Mill, when both parasitoid species were released out of synchrony, both the percentage of parasitism by C. flavipes as well as that of the tachinids increased. When large numbers of tachinids were released in the Barra Mill, they caused a significant lower percentage of parasitism imposed by C. flavipes. The implications of the results as evidence of non-additive effects of C. flavipes plus tachinids on D. saccharalis populations are discussed.","Univ Estadual Paulista, IB, Dept Parasitol, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil","Rossi, MN (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, IB, Dept Parasitol, Rubiao Jr, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",rossilife@fca.unesp.br,"Rossi, Marcelo N/D-8876-2013",,,,,32,2,2,1,6,BLACKWELL VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",1439-0418,,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

The BBM was applied in the northwest Mediterranean to field data, on 2 small pelagic fish species whose larvae coexist in summer: Engraulis encrasicolus, a dominant species, and Sardinella aurita, which is expanding northwards in relation to sea warming. The BBM allows one to quantify the contribution of circulation, with significant mesoscale activity, to the survival of fish larvae, clearly separating the effect of transport from biological factors. It is based on comparing the larval abundances at age found in local target areas, associated with the mesoscale structures (boxes), to those predicted by the overall mortality rate of the population in the region. The application of the BBM reveals that dispersion/retention by hydrodynamic structures favours the survival of E. encrasicolus larvae. In addition, since larval growth and mortality rates of the species are required parameters for application of the BBM, we present their estimates for S. aurita in the region for the first time. Although growth and mortality rates found for S. aurita are both higher than for E. encrasicolus, their combined effect confers a lower survival to S. aurita larvae. Thus, although the warming trend in the region would contribute to the expansion of the fast-growing species S. aurita, we can confirm that E. encrasicolus is well established, with a better adapted survival strategy.","[Raya, Vanesa; Salat, Jordi; Sabates, Jordi] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Raya, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",vraya@icm.csic.es,,,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CTM2015-68543-R],"This research was supported by the project CTM2015-68543-R (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness).

We examined prey choice based on past diet history and compared growth and reproductive output among laboratory-reared O. muricata on exclusive bryozoan diets of M. membranacea and the native, historically preferred prey, Electra pilosa. Adult nudibranchs were collected from Cape Neddick, York, Maine for the prey choice experiment and post-metamorphic juveniles were collected from Jaffery Point, Newcastle, New Hampshire for the growth and reproduction experiments. Nudibranchs were laboratory reared under controlled conditions for up to 10 months until completion of spawning. Growth was monitored biweekly, and reproductive performance was assessed with a weight-adjusted dimensionless reproductive index (Sigma RI) of each individual's spawn summed over the reproductive period. Prey choice experiments showed nudibranchs tended to select prey based on prior feeding history. Diet influenced reproductive output: nudibranchs fed E. pilosa had larger first spawn, more total spawn, and larger average spawn, as well as higher reproductive effort. Diet did not influence weight-specific growth rate, maximum body size, or pre-spawn body size. Since the temporal abundances of these bryozoan prey differ, the predator benefits by consuming the novel prey when the native prey is rare. With the increased awareness of invasive species in communities, we suggest studies need to consider predator-prey paradigms that include the seasonality of non-native prey to gain an understanding of the influence these organisms have on native predator population dynamics.","[Lambert, Walter J.] Framingham State Univ, Dept Biol, Framingham, MA 01701 USA; [Bell, George R.

The experiment was conducted in an array of wading pools and utilized a replicated block design for variance analysis. Pools were open to natural colonization by male and female treefrogs. The treatments consisted of controls containing no predators or competitors, four treatments containing one species of predator (either Ambystoma maculatum larvae, Enneacanthus chaetodon adults, Notophthalmus viridescens adults, or Tramea carolina larvae), and two treatments containing one species of competitor (either Rana catesbeiana or Hyla chrysoscelis). Male and female treefrogs avoided pools containing conspecific tadpoles and pools containing adult black-banded sunfish, Enneacanthus chaetodon. Females also avoided pools containing larval spotted salamanders, Ambystoma maculatum. Correspondence between calling sites and oviposition sites was examined in response to treatment, block (consisting of a location and a time), and location. Correspondence between male choices and female choices was weak. Number and location of calling males showed no significant correlation with the number and location of eggs along any of the axes of choice. Both males and females chose sites based on the species present, and both showed preferences in regard to location and time. The differences between male and female choices indicate that the potential choices have different values of each sex, or that different criteria are used to rank potential choices. Anuran reproductive behavior is not a simple consequence of the direct interactions between males and females, but is a result of complex interactions between the behavior of the two sexes and the environment in which their behavior is embedded.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,,,,,,48,72,74,0,38,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1991,72,3,,,,,778,786,,10.2307/1940580,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FM084,WOS:A1991FM08400002,,,,,2021-09-27,

These ontogenetic shifts can alter the trophic position of individuals, the type and strength of ecological interactions across species, and allow for cannibalism within species. In this study we ask if and how the interaction of a size refuge and cannibalism in the prey alters the dynamics of intraguild predation (IGP) systems. By manipulating the composition of large cannibalistic (Aeshna umbrosa) and predatory (Anax junius) dragonfly larvae in mesocosms we show that the interaction of cannibals and predators was non-linear and increased the survival of prey. The structure of the final resource community shared by prey and predator differed between small and large dragonfly treatments but not within size classes across species. In general, the small prey stage showed similar shifts in microhabitat use and refuge use when exposed to either conspecific cannibals or predators, while large cannibals showed no clear anti-predator response. However, further behavioral experiments revealed that specific behavioral components, such as distances between individuals or number of movements, differed when individuals were exposed to either cannibals or predators. This indicates that individuals discriminated between conspecific or heterospecific predators. Furthermore, in similar experiments large cannibals and predators showed different behaviors when exposed to conspecifics rather than to each other. These changes in behavior are consistent with the observed increase in prey survival. In general, the results indicate that cannibalism and ontogenetic niche shifts can result in behavior-mediated indirect interactions that reduce the impact of the predator on the mortality of its prey and alter the interactions of IGP systems. However, they also indicate that size is not the sole determinant and that we also need to account for the species identity when predicting the dynamics of communities.","[Rudolf, Volker H.

However, in many cases, food-web and habitat complexity also change with abiotic stress or disturbance, potentially altering patterns of species interactions across environmental gradients. We used a combination of field assays and mesocosm experiments to investigate how disturbance from desiccation moderates top-down control of prey by predators across a gradient of pond duration in New Zealand. Field manipulations of predator abundance in ponds led to an unexpected decrease in the top-down control of prey biomass by predatory invertebrates as pond duration increased (decreasing abiotic stress). Predatory fish, which are restricted to permanent ponds, had negligible effects on prey biomass. Mesocosm experiments further indicated the consumptive effects of fish are weak; a result that cannot be explained by an increase in physical habitat refugia in relatively more permanent ponds. Manipulations of invertebrate predator diversity in mesocosms (both substitutive and additive treatments), and the addition of olfactory fish cues, revealed that strong non-consumptive effects of fish reduced predation by predatory invertebrates, and these effects overwhelmed the positive influence of invertebrate predator diversity on prey consumption. These results suggest that decreases in top-down control with increasing pond permanence are likely a result of non-consumptive effects of fish weakening predation by invertebrate predators in the more complex food webs of permanent ponds. Therefore, considering non-consumptive effects of predators in complex food webs will likely improve the understanding of biotic interactions across environmental gradients.","[Greig, Hamish S.; Wissinger, Scott A.; McIntosh, Angus R.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Wissinger, Scott A.] Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA","Greig, HS (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.",hamish.greig@canterbury.ac.nz,"McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011","McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813","Miss E.L.

Mechanisms such as competition, resource partitioning(5), dispersal ability(10) and predation tolerance(6-9) do not adequately explain relative abundance under field conditions(11,12). Recent work suggests that interactions between plants and soil microbes is important(13-21). Here I show that such interaction explains a significant proportion of the variance in the relative abundance of species in plant communities. Rare plants exhibited a relative decrease in growth on 'home' soil in which pathogens had had a chance to accumulate, whereas invasive plants benefited from interactions with mycorrhizal fungi. Some plant species accumulate pathogens quickly and maintain low densities as a result of the accumulation of species-specific pathogens, whereas others accumulate species-specific pathogens more slowly and do not experience negative feedback until plant densities reach high levels(13,15,21). These results indicate that plants have different abilities to influence their abundance by changing the structure of their soil communities, and that this is an important regulator of plant community structure.","Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Klironomos, JN (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,27,1167,1245,32,789,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,MAY 2,2002,417,6884,,,,,67,70,,10.1038/417067a,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,546ZM,WOS:000175307200038,11986666,,,,2021-09-27,

However, there is growing evidence that negative interactions among distantly related taxa also occur and may be far more important than previously thought. In this study, we took advantage of an 11-year-old replicated vertebrate-exclosure experiment in a coastal dune community in northern California, USA, to examine the effects of the two most common vertebrate herbivores (jackrabbits and black-tailed deer) on the abundance of the three most visible invertebrate herbivores (two snail, a moth, and a grasshopper species). Our results indicate that four of the six possible pairwise interactions were significantly negative for the invertebrates. Jackrabbits reduced the abundances of snails by 44-75%, tiger moth caterpillars by 36%, and grasshoppers by 62%. Deer reduced the abundances of snails by 32%, increased the abundances of caterpillars by 31%, and had no measurable effect on grasshopper abundance. Our data also revealed that jackrabbits significantly decreased the volume of forbs and common shrubs and the flowering by grasses in our study plots. We were unable to detect an effect of deer on these measures of vegetation. These results suggest that by changing vegetation, jackrabbits may reduce invertebrate populations that are limited by food, protective structures, or microclimate provided by plants. Of these three mechanisms, only shade was strongly supported as limiting snail numbers in smaller-scale manipulations. In most systems, as in this one, the number of pairs of distantly related herbivores far exceeds the number of pairs of congeners. Since interactions among distantly related herbivores may be common in many cases, these interactions are likely to be important and should receive far more attention from ecologists.","[Huntzinger, Mikaela] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Cushman, Hall] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA","Huntzinger, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,40,35,37,0,51,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2008,89,7,,,,,1972,1980,,10.1890/07-0834.1,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,331JC,WOS:000258007500019,18705383,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"Research was funded through the Australian Research Council.

Prior modeling and field studies have shown that coexistence can be promoted by reducing the competitive ability between species through spatial or temporal niche differentiation. Colonization, disturbance, aggregations in patchy habitats, resource transport and supply rates, predation, sex ratio mediation have been suggested to promote species coexistence. The role of mutualism in promoting species coexistence has never been quantitatively studied. In this study, by starting from the traditional Lotka-Volterra competition model, a new general model with introduction of mutualism between two competitive species is proposed. We hypothesized that the interaction of one species to the other is flexible instead of always negative; the zero growth isoclines of the competing species are parabolic. Three conclusions are drawn from this modeling study. First, mutualism is a new way of promoting coexistences of two species. Second, mutualism often increases the carrying capacities of both species, and then promotes their competitive abilities. Third, the mutualism-competition model is also appropriate to describe the dynamics of cooperation and competition between individuals or groups within species, and mutualism between plants and animals. The behind mechanism lies in mutualism or cooperation reduced the severity of competition at low density. Inferior competitor, if cooperative to superior competitor, is also possible to survive. Since mutualism or cooperation is commonly seen among competitors or between prey and predators, its role in shaping social or community structure is worth to explore. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the convenience of using mesopredator controls is technically questionable and scientifically-sound research is therefore required to evaluate the impact of predation on prey case by case. In this study we evaluated the effect of the alteration of terrestrial mesopredator dynamics on the demographic parameters of a relict capercaillie Tetrao urogallus aquitanicus population currently in decline for which the impact of predation has not previously been assessed. We used a six-year mesocarnivore removal experiment (2008-2013) together with seven-years of previous demographic information on capercaillies (1999-2007) within a before-after control-impact (BACI) design to evaluate the effect of mesocarnivore removal on capercaillie demographic parameters and on spatial behaviour of the most frequent predatory mesocarnivores of the capercaillie (Martes spp. and red fox Vulpes vulpes). Using a dynamic site-occupancy approach, the reduction of mesocarnivore population levels as a result of removal was clear for marten species, mainly during key months for capercaillie reproduction, but not for the red fox. Our results show that the breeding success of capercaillies was enhanced in areas where carnivores were removed and was inversely related to the occupation level of the studied mesocarnivores, although being only significant for Martes spp. Moreover, capercaillie predation rates were lower and adult survival seemingly higher in treatment during the removal phase. Cost-effective, long-term management interventions to ensure the recovery of this threatened capercaillie population are discussed in the light of the results. At our study area, the decision for implementing predation management should be included within a broader long-term conservation perspective. In this regard, a more feasible and sustainable management intervention in ecological and economic terms may be to balance the impact of mesocarnivores on capercaillies through the recovery of apex predators.","[Moreno-Opo, Ruben; Garcia, Francisco; Munoz-Igualada, Jaime; Mariano Gonzalez, Luis] Minist Agr Food & Environm, Madrid, Spain; [Moreno-Opo, Ruben; Pique, Josep; Munoz-Igualada, Jaime] TRAGSATEC, Madrid, Spain; [Afonso, Ivan] MUSIA, La Plana, Lleida, Spain; [Afonso, Ivan; Canut, Jordi; Roig, Job] Assoc Conservat Capercaillie ACU, Buseu, Baix Pallars, Spain; [Jimenez, Jose] Inst Res Game Resources CSIC, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Fernandez-Olalla, Mariana] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Montes, Madrid, Spain; [Canut, Jordi] Alt Pirineu Nat Pk, Llavorsi, Spain; [Garcia-Ferre, Diego] Generalitat Catalunya, Dept Agr Ramaderia Pesca Alimentacio & Medi Ambie, Barcelona, Spain; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Univ Oviedo, Res Unit Biodivers, Mieres, Spain; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Riddarhyttan, Sweden","Moreno-Opo, R (corresponding author), Minist Agr Food & Environm, Madrid, Spain.",at_sgb4@magrama.es,"Jimenez, Jose/I-9840-2019","Jimenez, Jose/0000-0003-0607-6973; Lopez-Bao, Jose Vicente/0000-0001-9213-998X",Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya; European UnionEuropean Commission; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"The present work was commissioned by the Spanish Ministry of Environment, and the GALLIPYR-POCTEFA 2007 cofunded by the Generalitat de Catalunya and the European Union, who provided support in the form of salaries for authors [RM-O, IA, JP, JM-I], but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Little is known of their ecological adaptations or fitness but they are clearly successful animals. Diversity within communities can be considerable, possibly relating to the small size of individuals and temporal and spatial resource gradients. Little is known about genetic diversity, environmental tolerances and demography. Local distribution patterns are better known but rarely proven with appropriate statistics. New data from work in Northern Ireland on behaviour and habitat choice of Procerodes littoralis and on species richness, population aggregation and microdistribution of meiofaunal turbellarians is presented. Nothing appears known about intra-specific competition but more about inter-specific relationships including responses to biogenic structures. Dietary information is sparse and mostly observational with little known about feeding efficiency. Studies at Sylt have revealed mainly univoltine or polyvoltine annual life cycles partly related to habitat preference and possibly giving some evidence of r and K selection. Factors controlling local abundance are largely uninvestigated and the reasons for the apparent rarity of many species not understood. Lists and counts of turbellarians within particular habitats provide some knowledge of community structure but very few numerical analyses, e.g. of diversity and similarity, exist. Contribution to energy flux and to structuring communities has not been determined in spite of the turbellarians' assumed major role as meiofaunal predators. Nevertheless marine turbellarians appear particularly fitted to studies such as habitat heterogeneity, community stability and biogeography and are surely suitable subjects for field and laboratory experiments.

Focal individuals were observed alone and in pairs with conspecifics and allospecifics at four prey (Baetis bicaudatus, Baetidae, Ephemeroptera) densities to determine whether competitors and prey resource levels affected prey capture rates. Presence of conspecific or allospecific competitors reduced stonefly prey capture rates, especially for Kogotus, the smaller of the two species, due to a significant decline in predator-prey encounter rates with competitors present. This competitive effect was not observed at the lowest and highest prey densities due to very low or very high predator-prey encounter rates, respectively. Thus, interference affected feeding rates only at intermediate prey densities. Competitors had no effect on the probability of attacks per prey encounter or capture success per attack. Within each stonefly species the effects of intra- and interspecific interference on feeding rates were similar, even though behavioral responses by both stoneflies to interspecific encounters were more frequent than to encounters with conspecifics. Kogotus showed the highest levels of response to encounters with other stone-flies, maintaining those high levels of response to Megarcys over all prey densities.

Intraguild predation webs contain competition, predation, and omnivory in a system of three species where theory and empirical results can be compared. We studied a planktonic microcosm community in which an alga is consumed by a flagellate and by a rotifer that also consumes the flagellate. Previously published theory predicts that phase lags between the species are the outcome of a tug of war'' among the intraguild-predation links: rotifers <-> algae, flagellates <-> algae, and rotifers <-> flagellates. We observed sustained oscilltions with abundance peaks that corresponded exactly to theoretical predictions in all replicates: peaks of the rotifers and flagellates fell on either side of a quarter-period lag behind the prey (algae) peaks, with the peak of the intermediate predator (flagellates) preceding that of the top predator (rotifers). The phase lags in these experiments suggest that temporal variation in flagellate growth rate is primarily driven by variation in the intensity of its consumption by rotifers, rather than by variation in the density of its algal prey. This system illustrates how interaction strength affects the pattern of intraguild predation cycles and provides an opportunity to explore how evolution of interaction strength may affect those dynamics.","[Hiltunen, T.; Jones, L.

Most seeds are dispersed in proximity to the parent tree, where mortality is also expected to be the highest, because of competition with siblings or the attraction of natural enemies. Whereas distance-dependent mortality in the seed-to-seedling transition was often observed in tropical forests, few studies have attempted to estimate the shape of the survival-distance curves, which determines whether the peak of seedling establishment occurs away from the parent tree (Janzen-Connell pattern) or if the peak attenuates but remains at the parent location (Hubbell pattern). In this study, we inferred the probability density of seed dispersal and two stages of seedling establishment (new recruits, and seedlings 20 cm or taller) with distance for 24 tree species present in the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Using data from seed traps, seedling survey quadrats, and tree-census records spanning the 1988-2014 period, we fit hierarchical Bayesian models including parameters for tree fecundity, the shape of the dispersal kernel, and overdispersion of seed or seedling counts. We combined predictions from multiple dispersal kernels to obtain more robust inferences. We find that Hubbell patterns are the most common and Janzen-Connell patterns are very rare among those species; that distance-dependent mortality may be stronger in the seed stage, in the early recruit stage, or comparable in both; and that species with larger seeds experience less overall mortality and less distance-dependent mortality. Finally, we describe how this modeling approach could be extended at a community scale to include less abundant species.","[Marchand, Philippe] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Rech Sur Forets, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada; [Comita, Liza S.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Wright, S.

Post colonisation and community level processes are proving to be less reliable predictors of initial population size and propagule pressure is now posited as a key predictor of species establishment. Yet, empirical studies manipulating the intrinsic parameters of propagule pressure, such as arrival frequency (number), and intensity (size) are lacking. Understanding colonisation and incipient population survival is particularly important in the field of bio-invasions. Propagule pressure is now often cited as a key determinant of invasion success, yet we have few empirical tests manipulating the intrinsic parameters of propagule pressure. We conducted a series of factorial field experiments utilizing larvae of the cosmopolitan invasive oyster Crassostrea gigas. A newly developed technique was used to quantitatively alter the size of propagules and the frequency at which they arrive. When total propagule pressure was held constant, and the size and arrival frequency was altered, frequent small inoculations dramatically increased incipient population size >65% relative to infrequent large introductions. We also found that smaller, less dense inoculations resulted in >85% greater proportional settlement and colonisation of this cosmopolitan species. Predation altered the overall survival of incipient oyster populations, but did not alter this pattern. Our findings may help explain patterns of ballast water and hull-fouling introductions, as ports and harbours that receive frequent exposure to invasive propagules from the same source location will be at greater risk of invasion.","[Hedge, Luke H.; Johnston, Emma L.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [O'Connor, Wayne A.] Ind & Investment NSW, Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Taylors Beach, NSW 2316, Australia","Hedge, LH (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",l.hedge@unsw.edu.au,"O'Connor, Wayne/AAL-8097-2020; Johnston, Emma L/B-7210-2009","Johnston, Emma L/0000-0002-2117-366X; O'Connor, Wayne/0000-0002-0972-4668; Hedge, Luke/0000-0002-6805-3462",Australian government Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; Australian Research Council Discovery grantAustralian Research Council,"We would like to thank S.

Yet, the consequences of warming-led modifications in biotic interactions at higher trophic levels on lower trophic groups are lesser known. Here, we test the effects of multiple predator species on prey population size and traits and subsequent effects on basal resources along an experimental temperature gradient (12-15 degrees C, 17-20 degrees C, and 22-25 degrees C). We experimentally assembled food web modules with two congeneric predatory mites (Hypoaspis miles and Hypoaspis aculeifer) and two Collembola prey species (Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta) on a litter and yeast mixture as the basal resources. We hypothesized that warming would modify interactions within and between predator species, and that these alterations would cascade to basal resources via changes in the density and traits (body size and lipid: protein ratio) of the prey species. The presence of congeners constrained the growth of the predatory species independent of warming despite warming increased predator density in their respective monocultures. We found that warming effects on both prey and basal resources were greater than the effects of predator communities. Our results further showed opposite effects of warming on predator (increase) and prey densities (decrease), indicating a warming-induced trophic mismatch, which are likely to alter food web structures. We highlight that warmer environments can restructure food webs by its direct effects on lower trophic groups even without modifying top-down effects.","[Thakur, Madhav P.; Kuenne, Tom; Dunker, Susanne; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Thakur, Madhav P.; Kuenne, Tom; Fanesi, Andrea; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Thakur, Madhav P.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Griffin, John N.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Dunker, Susanne] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany","Thakur, MP (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands.",madhav.prakash.thakur@gmail.com,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Fanesi, Andrea/0000-0003-1410-3169; Thakur, Madhav/0000-0001-9426-1313; Griffin, John/0000-0003-3295-6480; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [TH 2307/1-1]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118]; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Leipzig University,"We thank Alfred Lochner, Christian Ristok, Julia Siebert, and Katja Steinauer for their help in the experiment.

Preference for native congeneric fishes, the fairy basslet Gramma loreto and blackcap basslet G. melacara, were tested. We observed behavior of predators in response to 2 individual prey consisting of cross-factored combinations of species (fairy and blackcap basslets) and size (small and large). Upon initial exposure to prey, lionfish first hunted fairy basslet and graysby first hunted blackcap basslet, with both predators initially preferring large over small fish. Overall behavior (quantified from the entire duration of observation) indicated both predators lacked a preference between basslet species based on total number of strikes and hunting time. Despite essentially identical size ranges of predators studied, graysby overall preferred large basslet across all graysby sizes, whereas the overall preference of lionfish between prey size varied with lionfish size. Importantly, the initial preferences of predators were likely least affected by the unnatural setting in aquaria. By preferentially consuming the less-preferred prey species of native graysby or by increasing predation on larger basslets, invasive lion fish may enhance coexistence between basslet species or among basslet sizes within local populations structured according to a size hierarchy. Alternatively, increased consumption of basslets may deplete local basslet populations, especially if lionfish exhibit prey switching behavior.","[Kindinger, Tye L.; Anderson, Emily R.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Kindinger, TL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",kindingt@science.oregonstate.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-12-33027]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1233027] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank M.

Foxes were removed from two areas around the perimeter of Lake Burrendong, and data were collected from these areas and a nearby untreated area before, during, and after the period of fox control. The arrival of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1996 provided an opportunity to examine the interactive effects of controlling foxes and rabbits. In this landscape, typical of central NSW, (a) the fox population was not affected by a large reduction in the abundance of rabbits, or vice versa; (b) the cat population declined in areas where foxes were removed after the large RHD-induced reduction in rabbit numbers, but there was no consistent response to the removal of foxes; (c) the abundance of some macropod species increased in response only to the combined removal of rabbits and foxes; (d) there were no consistent changes in the abundances of bird species in response to the removal of either foxes or rabbits, but there were clear habitat differences in bird species richness; and (e) there was likely to be an increase in woody plant species after the large reduction in rabbit populations by RHD.

Eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) is a remarkably successful invader of freshwater systems worldwide, with the capacity to detrimentally impact native fishes both directly (e.g. competition, predation, agonistic interactions) and indirectly (e.g. triggering trophic cascades). Here, we modelled the influence of eastern gambusia and several environmental covariates on fish species diversity, abundance and condition based on quantitative survey data collected from 93 wetlands in south-eastern Australia. We predicted that small-bodied, wetland specialist species sharing dietary-and habitat-niches with eastern gambusia would be most severely impacted, and that environmental stressors associated with wetland drying during late summer would magnify these impacts. Eastern gambusia influenced the occurrence, abundance and/or body condition of most common wetland species; however, the direction and level of impact appeared dependent on both biotic and environmental forces. From these results, we postulate that generalist life-history strategies that permit niche-segregation may release some native species from competitive/predatory pressures, allowing coexistence with eastern gambusia in resource-limited, environmentally harsh habitats, whilst specialist species that occupy narrower ecological niches may be less resistant.","[Macdonald, Jed I.; Tonkin, Zeb D.; Ramsey, David S.

In the present study, we examine the small-scale spatial pattern of a mixed beech and oak seedling-sapling bank in two areas of an unmanaged temperate deciduous forest with different environmental conditions. We used environmental, biotic and spatial variables to establish the main factors that explain the spatial pattern of these seedling-sapling banks at different scales. The stand structure in both areas was similar, but while in plot A beech dominated the canopy, plot B was dominated by oaks. In both areas, established beech individuals showed a clear reverse J-shaped distribution, whereas established oaks showed a unimodal distribution with only a few young individuals. Seedlings of beech and oak were distributed in aggregates, whereas beech saplings had a random distribution. At broader scales, the abundance of seedlings and saplings is affected by the environment as well as by inter-species competition, while at finer scales the spatial pattern is mainly influenced by stochastic processes, probably related to seed predation and establishment. The structure of the seedling-sapling bank indicates an advantage of beech over oak as far as regeneration is concerned. Beech seedlings and saplings tolerate the stress induced by the canopy and the understorey and persist for many years, while oak seedlings decline in a few years. Therefore, if current conditions persist, after canopy opening beech seedlings and saplings can grow rapidly into the canopy and the stands will move towards beech dominance.","[Gazol, Antonio; Ibanez, Ricardo] Univ Navarra, Dept Plant Biol, Pamplona 31008, Spain","Gazol, A (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Dept Plant Biol, Irunlarrea S-N, Pamplona 31008, Spain.",agazolbu@alumni.unav.es,"Ibanez, Ricardo/C-4567-2017; Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015","Ibanez, Ricardo/0000-0002-1772-4473; Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543",Fundacion Caja Navarra; Fundacion Universitaria de Navarra; Asociacion de Amigos de la Universidad de Navarra,"The authors thank Etienne Laliberte and Daniel Borcard for technical advice in the variation partitioning analysis performed.

However, most species also display seasonal reproductive peaks, but little is known about underlying causes of temporal density changes. We investigated population dynamics of the pest predator Rhynchium haemorrhoidale (F.) (Hymenoptera: Eumenidae) and its natural enemies in relation to season, climate and varying shade tree composition in cacao agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia). Nesting of R. haemorrhoidale showed clear seasonality with highest densities in the wet season and lowest in the dry season, which was not related to changes in temperature. Wasp densities increased with land-use intensity, presumably because less-shaded areas offer more favourable climatic conditions and higher densities of the major prey, the cacao pest Agathodes caliginosalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Pupal body size was higher in June than in November indicating increasing intraspecific competition due to high wasp densities and food shortage at the beginning of the wet season. Body size between habitat types was similar, thus season appeared to be more important than habitat in terms of food supply. High wasp densities in the wet season were associated with high diversity of the altogether seven parasitoid species. In conclusion, we found a pronounced seasonality of the wasp R. haemorrhoidale and a preference for little shaded agroforestry, which may be due to enhanced temperature and density of its prey. Our data indicate a high potential for biological control of a major cacao pest by management of nesting sites of R. haemorrhoidale.","[Hoehn, Patrick; Tscharntke, Teja] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agroecol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Buchori, Damayanti] Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Pest & Plant Dis, Fac Agr IPB, Bogor 16680, Indonesia","Hoehn, P (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Agroecol, Waldweg 26, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",pathoehn@web.de,"Buchori, Damayanti/L-5878-2017; Tscharntke, Teja/N-5123-2014","Buchori, Damayanti/0000-0002-2843-0737; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf/0000-0003-1359-3944",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 552],"We thank Sarina Pearce, Riccardo Bommarco and Orjan Ostman for valuable suggestions and ideas on the manuscript and the following experts for the identification of species: Gian Luca Agnoli, Bologna (Chrysididae), J.

Similarly, invasive species can impact natives when they reduce shared resources. Alternatively, some invaders may benefit natives if they either directly or indirectly increase resource acquisition by natives. I predicted that the native California killifish, Fundulus parvipinnis would reduce the fitness of the morphologically similar introduced sailfin molly, Poecilia latipinna in a California estuary. A field experiment found no effect of competition; increasing the density of the native killifish did not affect sailfin molly growth. However, there was an unanticipated positive association of female sailfin molly density on growth of native killifish. Unlike any other native fish in the estuary, the introduced molly is a live bearer and I hypothesize that the presence of female mollies may have generated a novel food source (newborn fish) for the native competitor. This potential food source could have overcompensated for any potential competition for other resources. The positive effect was not mutual, i.e., the presence of killifish did not increase the growth of adult mollies (killifish are oviparous and lay eggs on the substrate). While killifish may not limit mollies through competitive effects, they could provide partial resistance to invasion by preying on juvenile mollies. Additional experiments designed specifically to test whether juvenile mollies increase killifish growth would confirm the mechanism and potentially reveal the importance of this in nature. Considering the role of all life stages of an invader is a key step when evaluating interactions with natives and determining the success and impacts of introduced species.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama","Torchin, ME (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama.",torchinm@si.edu,,,UC-Mexus; STRISmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"I thank K.

Species that live in groups, such as shoaling fish, can experience both direct density-dependent mortality through resource limitation and inverse number-dependent mortality via increased feeding rates and predator evasion in larger groups. To investigate the role of these processes in a temperate reef fish population, we manipulated the density and group size of the shoaling species Trachinops caudimaculatus on artificial patch reefs at two locations with different predator fields in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. We compared mortality over four weeks to estimates of predator abundance and per capita availability of refuge and food to identify mechanisms for density or number dependence. Mortality was strongly directly density dependent throughout the experiment, regardless of the dominant predator group; however, the limiting resource driving this effect changed over time. In the first two weeks when densities were highest, density-dependent mortality was best explained by refuge competition and the abundance of benthic predators. During the second two weeks, food competition best explained the pattern of mortality. We detected no effect of group size at either location, even where pelagic-predator abundance was high. Overall, direct density effects were much stronger than those of group size, suggesting little survival advantage to shoaling on isolated patch reefs where resource competition is high. This study is the first to observe a temporal shift in density-dependent mechanisms in reef fish, and the first to observe food limitation on short temporal scales. Food competition may therefore be an important regulator of postsettlement reef fish cohorts after the initial intense effects of refuge limitation and predation.","[Ford, John R.; Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Ford, JR (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",jford@unimelb.edu.au,"SWEARER, STEPHEN/AAC-1527-2020; Swearer, Stephen/X-4882-2018","SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943; Swearer, Stephen/0000-0001-6381-9943",Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Australia and Pacific Science Foundation,"The authors thank invaluable field hands: Christian Jung, Dean Chamberlain, Evan Hallein, Matt Le Feuvre, John Ahern and Seann Chia.

Despite major declines, no present-day species of marine apex predator has yet become extinct. Because of their vulnerability, understanding the mechanisms leading to their extinction in the past could provide insight into the natural factors that interact with human threats to drive their loss. We studied the geographical distribution patterns of the extinct macro-predatory shark Carcharocles megalodon in order to elucidate its pathway to extinction. LocationWorld-wide from the Miocene to the Pliocene (c.23-2.6Ma). MethodsA meta-analysis of C.megalodon occurrence records was performed using the Paleobiology Database as a platform. The data were binned into geological time slices, and the circular home range around each data point was mapped in reconstructions made in GPlates. We then quantitatively assessed the species' geographical range and global abundance over time, and the relationship between distribution and climate. ResultsThe pathway to extinction of C.megalodon probably started in the late Miocene with a decrease in its global abundance. This decrease was then followed by a decline in its geographical range during the Pliocene. Although the extinction of C.megalodon has been attributed to climate change, we found no evidence of direct effects of global temperature. Instead, we found that the collapse in geographical distribution coincided mainly with a drop in the diversity of filter-feeding whales and the appearance of new competitors (large predatory whales and the great white shark). Main conclusionsThis research represents the first study of the distributional trends of an extinct, cosmopolitan apex predator in deep-time. Our results suggest that biotic factors, and not direct temperature limitations, were probably the primary drivers of the extinction of the largest marine apex predators that ever lived.","[Pimiento, Catalina] Univ Zurich, Paleontol Inst & Museum, Karl Schmid Str 4, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pimiento, Catalina; MacFadden, Bruce J.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pimiento, Catalina; Jaramillo, Carlos] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Clements, Christopher F.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Varela, Sara] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Edificio Ciencias,Campus Externo, Alcala De Henares Madrid 28805, Spain; [Varela, Sara] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Velez-Juarbe, Jorge] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dept Mammal, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Silliman, Brian R.] Duke Univ, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA","Pimiento, C (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Paleontol Inst & Museum, Karl Schmid Str 4, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",catalina.pimientohernandez@pim.uzh.ch,"Pimiento, Catalina/ABF-1204-2020; Varela, Sara/J-7725-2016","Pimiento, Catalina/0000-0002-5320-7246; Varela, Sara/0000-0002-5756-5737; Clements, Christopher/0000-0001-5677-5401; Silliman, Brian/0000-0001-6360-650X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR 0418042, PIRE 0966884]; Office Of The DirectorNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [0966884] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This project was funded by the NSF EAR 0418042, PIRE 0966884 (OISE, DRL, EAR).

Genetically based stable colour polymorphisms provide a unique opportunity to study the evolutionary processes that preserve genetic variability in the wild. Different mechanisms are proposed to promote the stability of polymorphisms, but only few empirical examples have been documented, resulting in an incomplete understanding of these mechanisms. 2. A remarkable genetically determined stable colour polymorphism is found in the Nicaraguan Midas cichlid species complex (Amphilophus cf. citrinellus). All Midas cichlids start their life with a dark-grey coloration (dark morph), but individuals carrying the dominant gold allele (c. 10%) lose their melanophores later in life, revealing the underlying orange coloration (gold morph). How this polymorphism is maintained remains unclear. Two main hypotheses have been proposed, both suggesting differential predation upon colour morphs as the proximate mechanism. One predicts that the conspicuous gold morph is more likely to be preyed upon, but this disadvantage is balanced by their competitive dominance over the dark morph. The second hypothesis suggests a rare morph advantage where the rarer gold morph experiences less predation. Empirical evidence for either of these mechanisms is still circumstantial and inconclusive. 3. We conducted two field experiments in a Nicaraguan crater lake using wax models simulating both morphs to determine predation pressure upon Midas cichlid colour morphs. First, we tested the interaction of coloration and depth on attack rate. Second, we tested the interaction of fish size and coloration. We contrasted the pattern of attacks from these experiments to the predicted predation patterns from the hypotheses proposed to explain the colour polymorphism's stability. 4. Large models imitating colour morphs were attacked at similar rates irrespectively of their position in the water column. Yet, attacks upon small models resembling juveniles were directed mainly towards dark models. This resulted in a significant size-by-colour interaction. 5. We suggest that gold Midas cichlids experience a rare morph advantage as juveniles when individuals of this morph are extremely uncommon. But this effect is reduced or disappears among adults, where gold individuals are relatively more common. Thus, the interaction of rare morph advantage and conspicuousness, rather than either of those factors alone, is a likely mechanism resulting in the stability of the colour polymorphism in Midas cichlids.","[Torres-Dowdall, Julian; Golcher-Benavides, Jimena; Machado-Schiaffino, Gonzalo; Meyer, Axel] Univ Konstanz, Lehrstuhl Zool & Evolut Biol, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [Torres-Dowdall, Julian] Univ Konstanz, Zukunftskolleg, Constance, Germany; [Golcher-Benavides, Jimena] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Meyer, A (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Lehrstuhl Zool & Evolut Biol, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany.",axel.meyer@uni-konstanz.de,"Machado-Schiaffino, Gonzalo/Q-9480-2018; Machado-Schiaffino, Gonzalo/AAE-3114-2020; Meyer, Axel/C-9826-2009","Machado-Schiaffino, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4049-3247; Machado-Schiaffino, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4049-3247; Meyer, Axel/0000-0002-0888-8193; Torres-Dowdall, Julian/0000-0003-2729-6246","Costa Rica CONICIT Science Incentive; Marie Curie-Zukunftskolleg, Seventh Framework Programme; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG TO914/2-1, DFG ME1725/18-1, DFG MA6144/1-1]; Alexander von Humboldt fellowship FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; European Research Council ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [293700]","Costa Rica CONICIT Science Incentive; Marie Curie-Zukunftskolleg, Seventh Framework Programme; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: DFG TO914/2-1, DFG ME1725/18-1 and DFG MA6144/1-1; Alexander von Humboldt fellowship Foundation; European Research Council ERC, Grant/Award Number: 293700",,67,4,4,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

These two species co-occur over much of northern North America and exhibit changing patterns of between-habitat distribution and abundance in western Canada. In our experiments, adult survival of P. adstrictus was ca. 35% lower in the presence of the larger-bodied P. melanarius. Because starvation of individually isolated beetles did not elevate mortality for either species, we conclude that predation, and not interspecific competition for food, was responsible for reduced survival of P. adstrictus in the mixed-species trials. Although beetle survival was not affected by reduced food, gravid P. melanarius lost mass when food was limited and showed potential increased egg production with increased food. Larvae of both species had high survivorship when held alone, but predation by both conspecific and heterospecific adults significantly reduced larval survival. All of these effects occurred in the presence of suitable alternative food but many were exacerbated when food levels were lowered experimentally. We conclude that intraguild predation and interspecific competition for food could reduce survival and reproductive potential, thus affecting the population dynamics of these two species in nature.","UNIV ALBERTA, DEPT BIOL SCI, EDMONTON, AB T6G 2E9, CANADA",,,,,,,,47,43,47,0,23,COLEOPTERISTS SOC,ATHENS,"UNIV GEORGIA, 413 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES BUILDING, ATHENS, GA 30602-2603 USA",0010-065X,1938-4394,,COLEOPTS BULL,Coleopt.

The model tracks the daily feeding, growth, movement, reproduction, and mortality of individuals of up to six species for multiple generations in up to three spatial boxes. The version presented in this paper has been configured and calibrated for Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. Six species are followed: yellow perch, bluegill, white bass, cisco, walleye, and northern pike. The environment consists of daily temperature, dissolved oxygen, and prey densities in each of the epilimnion, hypolimnion, and littoral zone spatial boxes. Feeding parameters and larval mortality rates were calibrated until all species persisted at reasonable biomasses, with realistic mean lengths at age and diets by life stage. Two alternate baseline calibrations are presented which differ in their degree of interannual variability. Correlation analysis of survival and growth rates showed that larvae were influenced by competition, yearlings by predation, and young of the year (YOY) juveniles by both. Adult growth was density-dependent for planktivores and positively related to forage biomass for piscivores. Cisco dynamics were effectively independent of the other species. The calibrated model was used to compare the effects of a biomanipulation experiment (piscivore enhancement) versus a coincident fish die-off event, and to evaluate alternative stocking regimes for their ability to sustain improved water duality. Predicted total zooplankton consumption was used to indicate effects on algae and water quality. Cisco die-off produced similar short-term but much larger long-term reductions in zooplankton consumption than piscivore enhancement. Delayed changes in YOY juvenile and larval survival illustrated complex indirect food web responses to piscivore enhancement.

The communities consisted mainly of aquatic dipteran larvae. Community M was dominated by a filter feeder, Tripteroides tenax, which reached a high density despite a strongly aggregated distribution. Community K had five trophic groups: carrion feeders, filter feeders, detritus feeders, nipping predators and hooking predators, each including multiple species. The summed density of filter feeders in Community K remained much below the level attained by filter feeders in Community M. Niche differentiation within each trophic group with regard to pitcher age and feeding behaviour was not sufficient to allow species coexistence through niche separation alone. Aggregated distributions directly reduced interspecific encounters. Nevertheless, species belonging to the same trophic group commonly shared the same pitcher, because of high occurrence probabilities of dominant species and positive associations between some taxa (due mainly to similar occupancies by pitcher age). Predator coexistence in Community K may have been facilitated by self-limitation of the large predators through intraspecific cannibalism strengthened by aggregation. Prey coexistence, on the other hand, may have relied more on population suppression by predation, especially the selective removal of old instar Tripteroides.","UNIV MALAYA,DEPT ZOOL,KUALA LUMPUR 59100,MALAYSIA","MOGI, M (corresponding author), SAGA MED SCH,DEPT MICROBIOL,DIV PARASITOL,NABESHIMA,SAGA 849,JAPAN.",,"Yong, Hoi Sen/C-1548-2010","Yong, Hoi Sen/0000-0002-9832-8826",,,,64,40,41,1,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1992,90,2,,,,,172,184,,10.1007/BF00317174,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU052,WOS:A1992HU05200004,28313712,,,,2021-09-27,

Both juveniles and adults of these two species are closely associated in low elevation headwater streams in western Virginia. I explored the effects of competition between juveniles of the two species, and the effects of heterospecific adults on juvenile performance, in a controlled, replicated experiment in artificial streams. Effects of competition were determined for three measures of juvenile performance that can be potentially related to reproductive output, and hence, to population dynamics: survival, growth and relative condition. Juveniles of C. bairdi and E. flabellare competed at densities well within the range observed in their natal streams. Adult E. flabellare had a positive effect on the survival of juvenile C. bairdi, the origin of which is unknown. Adult C. bairdi had no effect on juvenile E. flabellare. The most interesting result was that competition between juveniles of the two species was characterized by a qualitative asymmetry; C. bairdi responded with a reduction in growth, both in total length and mass, while E. flabellare responded with a decrease in relative condition, but no decrease in growth. These differences in response were clearly reflected in mass/length regressions. Unless responding variables can be precisely translated into quantitative effects on population dynamics, such qualitative asymmetries in competitive interactions greatly complicate the determination of competitive symmetry and the possible prediction of competitive outcomes, especially in species where r is difficult to determine directly.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27708",,,,,,,,72,18,19,0,14,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,1997,78,3,,,,,429,439,,10.2307/3545605,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WU941,WOS:A1997WU94100003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Ingesting nutritionally complementary foods may be the most effective means by which wild birds match nutrient ingestion and nutrient needs. Dietary complementation may occur fortuitously when foods chosen in response to non-nutritive factors (e.g. competition, predation risk, food colour), or on the basis of energy density, also fulfill specific nutrient needs (passive dietary complementation). In some environments, especially during productive phases (e.g. reproduction), free-living birds may rely on nutrient appetites to ensure their choice of foods satisfies their nutrient needs (active dietary complementation). Meeting nutrient needs through dietary complementation can be facilitated, complicated, or impeded by any of several environmental or organismal determinants of food choice.

Other such types include habitat modification, predator interference and facilitation. However, ecological network research has been typically limited to either pure food webs or to networks of only a few (<3) interaction types. The great diversity of non-trophic interactions observed in nature has been poorly addressed by ecologists and largely excluded from network theory. Herein, we propose a conceptual framework that organises this diversity into three main functional classes defined by how they modify specific parameters in a dynamic food web model. This approach provides a path forward for incorporating non-trophic interactions in traditional food web models and offers a new perspective on tackling ecological complexity that should stimulate both theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the patterns and dynamics of diverse species interactions in nature.","[Kefi, Sonia; Brose, Ulrich] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Kefi, Sonia] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Berlow, Eric L.] Univ Calif, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, Merced, CA 95389 USA; [Berlow, Eric L.; Martinez, Neo D.] Pacific Ecoinformat & Computat Ecol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94703 USA; [Berlow, Eric L.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Yosemite Field Stn, Oakhurst, CA 93644 USA; [Wieters, Evie A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Depto Ecol, Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile; [Wieters, Evie A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Depto Ecol, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile; [Wieters, Evie A.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Petchey, Owen L.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Petchey, Owen L.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wood, Spencer A.] Stanford Univ, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Boit, Alice] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Joppa, Lucas N.; Williams, Richard J.] Microsoft Res, Computat Ecol & Environm Sci, Cambridge CB3 0FB, England; [Lafferty, Kevin D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Menge, Bruce A.; Iles, Alison C.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Blanchette, Carol A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93105 USA","Kefi, S (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Berliner Str 28, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",sonia.kefi@univ-montp2.fr,"Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013; Brose, Ulrich/I-3488-2014; Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; Lafferty, Kevin D./B-3888-2009; Brose, Ulrich/AAT-7547-2020; Williams, Richard J/B-8344-2011; Wood, Spencer A/A-3603-2009; Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012; Martinez, Neo/A-5312-2008","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; Brose, Ulrich/0000-0001-9156-583X; Williams, Richard J/0000-0001-8847-3213; Kefi, Sonia/0000-0002-9678-7770; Martinez, Neo/0000-0002-1130-5550","Alexander von Humboldt foundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Fondap FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYTCONICYT FONDAP [15001-001]; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [107335, 1100920, 7100021]; Rhodes University; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission; German Research Foundation (BR)German Research Foundation (DFG) [2315/13-1]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); AW Mellon Foundation; D & L Packard Foundation; G & B Moore Foundation; W & G Valley Foundation; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","Part of SK and ELB's research was funded by a Humboldt fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt foundation.

Relative density of foxes was assessed with a scent station line and by fecal counts during small mammal trapping bouts. The bulk of foxes' annual diet consisted of two congeneric rodents: Akodon olivaceus and A. longipilis. Consumption rates of the first species remained unchanged between and within years, somewhat following its autumnal population peak and subsequent spring decline. By both methods foxes' relative density was higher in spring, suggesting a higher predation pressure during that season on A. olivaceus and perhaps further pushing its seasonal population decline. Foxes consumed twice the proportion of A. olivaceus in comparison to its subordinate competitor A. longipilis, which could lead to a predator-mediated coexistence. Although Oryzomys logicaudatus' body size and field abundance were similar to those of A. olivaceus, the former species was virtually not preyed by foxes, probably because this rodent is associated with vegetational variables that offer protection from a horizontal viewing, thus facilitating its avoidance of terrestrial predators.",,"MARTINEZ, DR (corresponding author), INST PROFES OSOMO,ECOL LAB,CASILLA 933,OSOMO,CHILE.",,"Martinez, David R./AAN-6521-2021; Rau, Jaime R/A-4922-2012","Rau, Jaime R/0000-0003-0444-578X",,,,0,13,16,0,10,SOC BIOL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 14164 CORREO, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

Abiotic conditions may also influence plant populations and can interact with consumers to determine plant distributions, but how these factors jointly influence invasions is poorly understood. In central Argentina's Caldenal savannas, we experimentally examined how seed predation and water availability influenced recruitment/establishment of nine exotic plant invaders over 2 years. We then explored how seed predation patterns related to invasion patterns. Excluding rodent seed predators dramatically increased seedling recruitment for eight of nine exotic species (by 100-300 % in most cases) and increased young/adult plant abundance for four species in one or both years. Adding water to ameliorate drought tended to increase seedling numbers for most species, but these trends were not significant. Vegetation surveys revealed that exotic plant richness was 50 % lower in matrix habitat compared with disturbed roadsides and that cover of the two most aggressive invaders, which were both strongly suppressed by seed predation, was 75-80 % lower in matrix than roadside habitats. Seed offerings indicated seed removal by rodents was 11 times greater in intact matrix habitat compared with roadsides. Rodent seed predation represents a significant source of biotic resistance to plant invasions. Ubiquitous disturbances such as road construction can disrupt this filter. The widely recognized role that disturbance plays in facilitating invasions, which is largely attributed solely to reduced plant competition, may also arise from disruption of top-down controls.","[Pearson, D.

Interactions with predators and competitors affect their abundance but also their foraging behaviour, potentially leading to non-consumptive cascading effects on the whole trophic web. We experimentally tested for plastic changes in larval trophic ecology of two anuran species in response to competitors and the non-lethal presence of native and non-native predators, using stable isotope analysis. We hypothesized that tadpoles would alter their diet in the presence of competitors and native predators, and to a lesser extent or not at all in the presence of non-native predators. First, we conducted a controlled diet experiment to estimate tadpole turnover rates and discrimination factors using Pelobates cultripes and Bufo calamita. Turnover rates yielded a half-life of 15-20 days (attaining a quasi-isotopic equilibrium after 2 months), whereas discrimination factors for natural controlled diets resulted in different isotopic values essential for calibration. Second, we did an experiment with P. cultripes and Rana perezi (=Pelophylax perezi) where we manipulated the presence/absence of predators and heterospecific tadpoles using microcosms in the laboratory. We detected a significant shift in trophic status of both amphibian species in the presence of non-native crayfish: the delta N-15 values and macrophyte consumption of tadpoles increased, whereas their detritus consumption decreased. This suggests that tadpoles could have perceived crayfish as a predatory risk or that crayfish acted as competitors for algae and zooplankton. No dietary changes were observed in the presence of native dragonflies or when both tadpole species co-occurred. Stable isotopic analysis is an efficient way to assess variation in tadpoles' tropic status and hence understand their role in freshwater ecosystems. Here we provide baseline isotopic information for future trophic studies and show evidence for plastic changes in tadpoles' use of food resources under different ecological scenarios.","[Caut, Stephane; Angulo, Elena; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] PA, Res Grp Biodivers, UO, CSIC, Oviedo 33071, Spain","Caut, S (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Avda Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",stephanecaut@gmail.com,"Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/F-8226-2014; Angulo, Elena/A-8107-2013; Angulo, Elena/AAF-8524-2020; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014","Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/0000-0003-0094-8195; Angulo, Elena/0000-0001-5545-4032; Angulo, Elena/0000-0001-5545-4032; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173",Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL-1123]; Junta Andalucia PAI group [RNM 128]; FEDEREuropean Commission [CGL2009-11123]; MICINNSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission; CSIC,"P.

Here, we examined the trends and reproduction of the red kite Milvus milvus, a highly endangered raptor near-endemic to Europe, to illustrate the dual benefits and challenges faced by a national park to protect this iconic species. Over the past 4 decades, the kite population of southern Spain has declined steeply and has become progressively confined to Donana National Park and its buffering Natural Park areas. Population deterioration was also evident within the protected area through (1) spikes of rapid eradication of whole sub-populations from buffer areas, likely propelled by illegal poisoning, and (2) more gradual but steady deterioration of numbers and reproduction, especially in peripheral buffer areas, probably caused by the interplay of several shocks related to food availability, habitat degradation, competition, predation, and chemical contamination. The result was a 46-55% decline with progressive confinement to the core National Park and an alarming effective population size of <10 pairs. Demographic modelling suggested low adult survival and predicted further declines, with possible extinction over the next 2 decades. We outline tentative goals for management, but these will need urgent information on ranging and mortality to provide more efficient targets. These results illustrate how establishment of a large park can prevent regional extinction, but not necessarily guarantee species-safety, leading to protracted forms of extinction debt. We suspect that similar dynamics will become more widespread as anthropogenic pressures increase around protected areas and their performance monitoring becomes more prevalent.","[Sergio, Fabrizio; Tanferna, Alessandro; Chicano, Javier; Blas, Julio; Hiraldo, Fernando] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, C Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Tavecchia, Giacomo] UIB, CSIC, Inst Mediterranean Studies IMEDEA, Anim Demog & Ecol Unit, Esporles 07190, Spain","Sergio, F (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, C Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",fsergio@ebd.csic.es,"Tanferna, Alessandro/L-6648-2015","Tanferna, Alessandro/0000-0003-0799-301X","Foundation Jaime Gonzalez-Gordon; Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and the Environment (National Parks Autonomous Agency) [1602/2015]","We thank all the (too many to mention) researchers, field workers, visitors, volunteers, gamekeepers, park managers and wardens that have provided data since the 1960s.

Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either (1) niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or (2) impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host-parasitoid or plant-animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as 'specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that 'dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species 'depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised. Distinguishing niche-based and impact-based interpretations may help to bridge terminological and conceptual gaps between network pattern analyses and traditional community ecology.

The design of enclosures, manipulation of species densities, and method of replication may influence experimental results. We designed an experiment with enclosure cages (1 m(2), 6-mm mesh) to examine the relative influence of fish size, density, and prey availability on growth of brown trout (Salmo trutta), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) within enclosures in Valley Creek, Minnesota. In addition, we examined water flow and invertebrate drift entering enclosures and in open riffles to investigate whether enclosures reduced the supply of invertebrate prey. Growth of small (age-0) brook and brown trout was not influenced by fish density, but growth of larger (age-1) trout generally decreased as density increased. Sculpin growth was not related to fish size or density, but increased with mean size of invertebrates in the drift. Enclosures reduced water flow and tended to reduce invertebrate drift rate, although total drift rate (ind./min), total drift density (ind./m(3)), and mean size of invertebrates were not significantly different inside enclosures compared to adjacent stream riffles. Enclosures had no effect on drift rate or size of Gammarus pseudolimnaeus, the main prey item for trout and sculpin in Valley Creek. Overall, our analyses indicated that reductions of prey availability by enclosures did not influence fish growth. Trout growth may have been limited at larger sizes and densities because of increased activity costs of establishing and defending territories, whereas sculpin growth was related to availability of large prey, a factor not influenced by enclosures.","Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Zimmerman, JKH (corresponding author), SO Conte Anadromous Fish Res Ctr, POB 796,1 Migratory Way, Turners Falls, MA 01376 USA.",jzimmerman@tnc.org; bvondrac@umn.edu,,,,,,46,20,21,0,14,NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0887-3593,,,J N AM BENTHOL SOC,J.

The study was conducted in Kachemak Bay, Alaska (USA) from 1991 to 1993 to determine the extent to which recruitment influences population dynamics of species near their geographic limit. Year-to-year variation in recruitment was highly significant, with average maximum recruitment between 1991 and 1993 ranging from 0.85 to 8.71 cm(-2). Recruitment densities on individual test surfaces ranged from 0-71 cm(-2). Inter-site variation in recruitment was significant and the ranking of sites by recruitment density was consistent between years. Recruitment of Semibalanus cariosus (Pallas) in the low intertidal was 7-162 times greater than of S. balanoides (L.) and Balanus glandula Darwin in the upper intertidal. Predation significantly affected the survival of recruits during 1991, a year of comparatively low overall recruitment. Also, 1991 was a year during which there was a linear relationship between initial recruitment and subsequent adult density for all species. In 1992 and 1993, years when initial larval settlement of S. cariosus was much greater, recruits commonly exceeded adult saturation density in the lower intertidal, resulting in intense intra-specific competition for space and leading to decoupling of recruit and adult density. Despite high recruitment in 1992 and 1993, recruit survival to adulthood of all species was actually greatest in the low recruitment year (1991), suggesting that even comparatively low recruitment provides enough new individuals to maintain populations. Consequently, at sites near their geographic limit, recruitment is not the primary process limiting S. cariosus populations in the low intertidal, although its influence was evident for high intertidal S. balanoides and B. glandula populations.","UNIV ALASKA FAIRBANKS, INST MARINE SCI, FAIRBANKS, AK 99775 USA",,,,,,,,74,42,42,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,1879-1697,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Predation by the spider on the three ladybird species differed. All the larvae of C. septempunctata, none of H. axyridis, and an intermediate number of P. japonica were attacked and eaten by the spider. All the larvae of H. axyridis suffered mortality due to cannibalism or starvation in the treatments with and without a spider. In case of C. septempunctata, however, mortality in the early instars was significantly greater in the treatment with a spider than without a spider and no larvae developed into pupae due to predation. In the treatment without a spider, the majority of the larvae in the former treatment suffered mortality due to cannibalism or starvation, and only 13.3% of larvae developed into the adult stage. In the case of P. japonica, mortality was mainly attributed to predation in the treatment with a spider and only 26.7% became adult. In comparison, 86.7% of larvae survived to the adult stage in the treatment without a spider. In addition, in both H. axyridis and C. septempunctata, the development of young larvae was significantly slower in the presence of a spider, but this was not the case with the older larvae of H. axyridis, which indicates that the effect of the spider on larval development changed with the developmental stage of the larvae in this species. However, the spider had no significant effect on the developmental time of P. japonica larvae. Although both the spider and the ladybirds significantly affected the number of aphids. they did not have an additive effect on aphid abundance. The interactions between the spider and the ladybirds, such as intraguild predation or competition, caused them to reduce aphid population density less than the ladybirds did on their own. The effect of the spider on the larval performance of three predatory ladybirds was found to be unequal in terms of their vulnerability to predation and rats of larval development and it depended on the species and developmental stage of the ladybird.","Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan","Yasuda, H (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.",,,,,,,38,23,28,0,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

We used temporal manipulations of density to explore potentially stabilizing density dependence in early survivorship among six local populations of a tropical damselfish (Dascyllus fiavicaudus). Specifically, we tested the premise that spatial heterogeneity in the strength of temporal density dependence would reflect variation in density of predators, the agent of mortality. Our field manipulations revealed that mortality among successive cohorts of young fishes was density dependent at each reef, but that its strength varied by similar to 1.5 orders of magnitude. This spatial heterogeneity was well predicted by variation among the six reefs in the density of predatory fishes that consume juvenile damselfishes. Because density dependence arose from competition for enemy-free space within a shelter coral, the mortality consequence of the competition depended on the neighborhood density of predators. Thus, the scale of heterogeneity in the density dependence largely reflected attributes of the environment that shaped the local abundance of predators. These results have important implications for how ecologists explore regulatory processes in nature. Failure to account for spatial variation could frequently yield misleading conclusions regarding density dependence as a stabilizing process, obscure underlying mechanisms influencing its strength, and provide no insight into the spatial scale of the heterogeneity. Further, models of population dynamics will be improved when experimental approaches better estimate the magnitude and causes of variation in strength of stabilizing density dependence.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Schmitt, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",schmitt@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,,,,,56,40,42,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2007,88,5,,,,,1241,1249,,10.1890/06-0970,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,166HN,WOS:000246369900019,17536410,,,,2021-09-27,

In contrast, there are far fewer examples of mutualisms from freshwater habitats and there is no evidence that any mutualism has community-wide or ecosystem-level consequences. Northern hemisphere crayfish are host to a variety of ectosymbiotic worms called branchiobdellidans. The association between some of these crayfish worms and their hosts is a mutualism. The outcome of the association is context dependent and can be influenced by host size, symbiont number, and the environment. Here we document in two experiments that the mutualism between crayfish and these worms alters the effect of crayfish on stream community structure and sediment deposition, an important ecosystem variable. We enclosed crayfish stocked with 0 worms and intermediate (3-6) and high worm densities (12) in cages in streams in Boone, North Carolina and Clemson, South Carolina, United States. At both locations, there was a negative relationship between initial worm density and final macroinvertebrate abundance. There was a significant effect of worm treatment on macroinvertebrate community structure in both the Boone and Clemson experiments. In Boone, there were effects on both overall macroinvertebrate abundance and community composition, whereas in Clemson, changes to community structure were primarily driven by changes in total abundance. There was a negative relationship between benthic sediment volume and initial worm density in both experiments, primarily later in the experiments, though these effects were influenced by sediment deposition rates. Our results are the first to demonstrate strong effects of a mutualism on freshwater communities. Both members of this mutualism are found throughout the northern hemisphere, so similar impacts may occur in many other waterways. Given that various species in addition to crayfish function as keystone species and ecosystem engineers in freshwater systems throughout the world, mutualisms involving these strongly interacting species may be as important to the structure and functioning of freshwater systems as comparable mutualisms in marine and terrestrial systems.","[Creed, Robert P.; Farrell, Kaitlin J.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Skelton, James; Brown, Bryan L.] Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Skelton, James] Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Farrell, Kaitlin J.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 East Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Creed, RP (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",creedrp@appstate.edu,,"Brown, Bryan/0000-0003-4837-7117; Farrell, Kaitlin/0000-0002-4709-7749","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0949823, DEB-0949780]; Biology Department at Appalachian State University, Clemson University; Virginia Tech","Thanks to Mark Rollins, Brett Tornwall, John Brunt, Adam Speake, Travis Knott, Ryan Hassler, Chelsea Weithman, and others for help setting up and maintaining experiments.

Invasive species in aquatic systems are major drivers of changes in biodiversity. Amphipods are key species in freshwaters, with invasive amphipods either replacing or coexisting with native species and often damaging local biodiversity. However, the consequences of interactions among native and invasive amphipods for their habitat use and feeding ecology and ecosystem function are not yet well understood. 2. We examined a number of streams in Brittany and Northern Ireland, with native and invasive amphipods, to evaluate the consequences of species interactions for both habitat use and diet. Our field studies centred on testing two proposed models: a cohabitation model without competition between two native species (Gammarus pulex vs Echinogammarus berilloni), and a competition model between an invasive and a native species (Gammarus pulex vs Gammarus duebeni celticus). For these three species, alone and in combination, we assessed their habitat use and feeding patterns, the latter through gut contents and stable C and N isotope analyses of their tissues. 3. When existing as single-species populations, all three species used stream habitats broadly similarly, although G. pulex was more strongly associated with leaf litter and vegetation compared to pebble substrata than the other species. When G. pulex coexisted with either E. berilloni or G. d. celticus, the latter two changed to using all habitats equally, whereas the former retained its habitat preferences. 4. Similarly, all three species when alone had similar gut contents, with inorganic material predominating, followed by leaf and woody material and more rarely algae and invertebrates. When G. pulex coexisted with E. berilloni, the diet of the latter did not change; however, the frequency of inorganic matter, leaves and wood declined in the gut contents of G. pulex. When G. pulex coexisted with G. d. celticus, the pattern of gut contents did not change in either species. 5. When existing as single-species populations, G. pulex had a broader range of isotopic signatures, both for delta 13C and for delta 15N, than the two other species, indicating a more variable diet among individuals. When G. pulex coexisted with either E. berilloni or G. d. celticus, the latter two had similar ranges of delta 13C and delta 15N, whereas for G. pulex the range was much less for delta 13C and delta 15N, suggesting a less diverse diet. 6. Our results infer two different modes of coexistence between native and non-native amphipods. We have shown that the native species, which coexist stably, appear to show interference competition, leading to spatial habitat segregation, whereas competition for food and possible intraguild predation by G. pulex on G. d. celticus would explain why the distribution and density of the latter is affected by G. pulex. However, since all the species have a similar diet and feeding habit, we expect no great overall effect on ecosystem processes as a consequence of species interactions and displacements.","[Piscart, Christophe; Dick, Jaimie T.

However, the dominant species as a recruit ( Clinocottus globiceps) was always replaced numerically as an adult by another species ( Oligocottus maculosus). When mechanisms of coexistence were evaluated, little support was found for either a lottery model, because competitive interactions are hierarchical, or a storage-effect model of coexistence, because the relative ranking of recruitment varied little among years and did not covary among species with environmental variables such as ocean temperature, upwelling indices, or an estimator of ocean productivity ( oyster condition index). There was also little evidence of niche partitioning based on habitat affinities. Additionally, predation-mediated coexistence had little support, given that the competitive dominant did not have the greatest rates of mortality. Instead, a competition-colonization trade-off may contribute to the coexistence of these species, where C. globiceps always recruits in the greatest numbers, while O. maculosus dominates the adult assemblage via competitive processes. The importance of post-recruitment processes in this assemblage is further suggested by some negative associations among species, the presence of density dependence, some habitat affinities, and previously published experimental work that demonstrated the competitive dominance of O. maculosus over C. globiceps.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Pfister, CA (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cpfister@uchicago.edu,,,,,,51,15,16,1,23,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2006,87,11,,,,,2905,2914,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2905:CBSEAL]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,108BK,WOS:000242214800022,17168034,,,,2021-09-27,

Animals may anticipate and try to avoid, at some costs, physical encounters with other competitors. This may ultimately impact their foraging distribution and intake rates. Such cryptic interference competition is difficult to measure in the field, and extremely little is known at the interspecific level. 2. We tested the hypothesis that smaller species avoid larger ones because of potential costs of interference competition and hence expected them to segregate from larger competitors at the scale of a resource patch. We assessed fine-scale spatial segregation patterns between three African herbivore species (zebra Equus quagga, kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis) and a megaherbivore, the African elephant Loxodonta africana, at the scale of water resource patches in the semi-arid ecosystem of Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. 3. Nine waterholes were monitored every two weeks during the dry season of a drought year, and observational scans of the spatial distribution of all herbivores were performed every 15 min. We developed a methodological approach to analyse such fine-scale spatial data. 4. Elephants increasingly used waterholes as the dry season progressed, as did the probability of co-occurrence and agonistic interaction with elephants for the three study species. All three species segregated from elephants at the beginning of the dry season, suggesting a spatial avoidance of elephants and the existence of costs of being close to them. However, contrarily to our expectations, herbivores did not segregate from elephants the rest of the dry season but tended to increasingly aggregate with elephants as the dry season progressed. 5. We discuss these surprising results and the existence of a trade-off between avoidance of interspecific interference competition and other potential factors such as access to quality water, which may have relative associated costs that change with the time of the year.","[Ferry, Nicolas; Dray, Stephane; Fritz, Herve; Valeix, Marion] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon, CNRS UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, Bat Gregor Mendel,43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Ferry, N (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon, CNRS UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, Bat Gregor Mendel,43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",ferrynicolas@me.com,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014; Dray, Stephane/B-4107-2010; Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661; Dray, Stephane/0000-0003-0153-1105; Ferry, Nicolas/0000-0001-5191-9648",CNRS Zone Atelier Hwange (CNRS-Hwange LTER); French 'Ministere de la Recherche' through the 'Ecole Doctorale Diversite du Vivant' of 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie',"This research was conducted under the Hwange Environmental Research Development (HERD) programme from the French 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique' (CNRS) and 'Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement' (CIRAD), within the study area of, and with funding support from, the CNRS Zone Atelier Hwange (CNRS-Hwange LTER).

Crayfish also provide an important food resource for many fish. Because of their abundance and relatively large body size, the interactions between fish and crayfish can have profound effects on the rest of the benthic community. In this paper we will 1) review the well-studied trophic and ecological relationships between fish and crayfish and 2) posit other potentially important but less-studied interactions. Fish and crayfish have generally been viewed as predator-prey. Crayfish are not easy prey for many fish because of their large size and defensive armor, and a number of studies have shown that the relative size of fish and crayfish is a major factor affecting the predator-prey interaction between these species. Crayfish may also compete with small benthic fish for food and shelter. Further, crayfish have been implicated in the declines of fish populations due to direct predation on fish eggs, and crayfish may indirectly affect fish populations through their destruction of macrophyte beds, which are important juvenile fish habitats. Many of these more subtle interactions between fish and crayfish were first observed when exotic species of crayfish were introduced to a new system (either intentionally or accidentally). More experimental work and long-term data sets are necessary to discover the importance of these less-studied interactions between crayfish and fish. Careful consideration should be given to the multiple pathways of fish-crayfish interactions when managing, farming, introducing, or studying these aquatic macroconsumers.","Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Dorn, NJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",,"Weljie, Aalim/V-6952-2019; Turner, Raymond J.

However, the relative roles of predation and intraspecific competition are rarely investigated simultaneously over different spatial scales, making generalities about these mechanisms difficult. Using juveniles of the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria (initial mean shell length [SL] +/- 95% CI = 12.4 +/- 0.13 mm), I tested the interactive effects of predator deterrence and intraspecific density (660 vs. 1320 individuals m(-2)) on growth and survival responses over a 185-day period from May to November 2003 at spatial scales that spanned four orders of magnitude: embayments, sites within embayments, tidal gradients, and blocks that were 10,000's, 1000's, 100's, and 5 m apart, respectively. Replicate field experiments were conducted from May to November 2003 at the upper and lower tidal heights at each of two intertidal mud flats (sites) within each of two embayments (Passamaquoddy Bay [PB] and Cobscook Bay [CB]) in eastern Maine. Mean survival, relative growth, and the abundance of wild recruits each varied significantly over all spatial scales. Predation was the most important factor affecting clam survival, explaining 45% of the total variability, whereas embayment, sites within embayments, tidal gradient, and intraspecific density collectively accounted for less than 10% of the variation. At all four intertidal sites, clam survival in experimental units designed to deter predators averaged 72%, but the degree of enhancement varied between embayments (PB = 6 1 %; CB = 267%). Average survival rate was higher (by 12-16%), but growth was slower (by ca. 50%) in upper vs. lower intertidal blocks; however, the patterns differed for both variables between sites within each embayment. The effect of increasing intraspecific clam density was to lower survival by ca. 17% (56% [660 m(-2)] vs. 48% [1320 m(-2)]) in both embayments, but growth was unaffected. Overall, clams doubled in SL, although mean relative growth was 15% greater in CB than PB. Tidal gradient, sites within embayments, and blocks were the three most important factors explaining 35%, 19%, and 22% of total variation in relative clam growth, respectively. In Maine and the northeast US, juveniles of Mya reach their highest abundance above mean low tide levels. Experimental evidence presented here suggests that differential predation along the tidal gradient is the dominant factor controlling clam abundance and distribution patterns in the intertidal zone.

To determine whether additional species were present in the Northeast Pacific and if so, how they coexist, lengths of wood were experimentally deployed on heavily sedimented sites on the Cascadia Basin and Escanaba Trough, non-hydrothermally active basalt on Gorda Ridge and Axial Volcano, and an isolated sediment pond within the axis of Juan de Fuca Ridge, at depths of between 1,530 and 3,232 m. All locations were between 41 degrees and 48 degrees N, at least 240 km off the North American coast. Six previously unknown species, Xylophaga corona n. sp., X. zierenbergi n. sp., X. heterosiphon n. sp., X. oregona n. sp., X. microchira n. sp. and Xylopholas crooki n. sp., were collected and are described here. Dominant species differed in recoveries made after 10 and 24 months at Juan de Fuca Ridge and Cascadia Basin localities. Xylophaga microchira n. sp. dominated four of five deployments recovered within 12 months, but its abundance declined by 24 months, being largely replaced on Juan de Fuca Ridge by X. oregona n. sp., a species known only from this Ridge and from an incidental collection on the Nootka Fracture Zone. At Cascadia Basin sites, the abundances of X. heterosiphon n. sp. and of what are likely to be predatory polyclad flatworms increased as that of X. microchira n. sp. declined. Xylophaga microchira n. sp. is hypothesized to be specialized for early colonization, but to be competitively inferior to X. oregona n. sp., and more vulnerable to predators than X. heterosiphon n. sp. The dominance of competitively superior and more predator-resistant species in older deployments argues that biotic interactions contribute to coexistence of multiple species of wood-borers despite direct competition among them.","Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Zool, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Voight, JR (corresponding author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Zool, S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",jvoight@fmnh.org,,,,,,38,57,62,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0260-1230,1464-3766,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

Mortality of N. viridula eggs was higher in simultaneous and sequential releases compared to single species releases. In simultaneous host exploitations, T. basalis females displayed an aggressive behavior against O. telenomicida females. The outcome of multiparasitism showed that interspecific larval competition was dominated by O. telenomicida regardless of the sequence in which oviposition occurred and which parasitoid was or was not simultaneously released in the patch. Finally, O. telenomicida can successfully develop in hosts already parasitized by T. basalis up to seven days earlier, acting as a facultative hyperparasitoid, so that intraguild predation (IGP) also occurred.

Studies on captive or supplemented birds suggest that they flexibly adjust their scatter-hoarding behaviour to the context of social dynamics and relative seed availability. Because many corvid-dispersed trees show high annual variation in seed production, context-dependent foraging can have strong effects on natural corvid scatter-hoarding behaviour. We investigated how seed availability and social dynamics affected scatter-hoarding in the island scrub jays (Aphelocoma insularis). We quantified rates of scatter-hoarding behaviour and territorial defence of 26 colour-marked birds over a three-year period with variable acorn crops. We tested whether caching parameters were correlated with variation in annual seed production of oaks as predicted by the predator dispersal hypothesis, which states that caching rates and distances should vary with seed abundance in ways that benefit tree fitness. We also tested whether antagonistic interactions with conspecifics would affect scatter-hoarding adversely, as found in experimental studies. Caching behaviour varied with acorn availability. Caching distances correlated positively with annual acorn crop size, increasing by as much as 40% between years. Caching rates declined over time in years with small acorn crops, but increased when crops were large. Acorn foraging and caching rates were also negatively correlated with rates of territorial aggression. Overall foraging rates, however, were not associated with aggression, suggesting that reduced dispersal rates were not simply due to time constraints. Our field results support laboratory findings that caching rates and distances by scatter-hoarding corvids are context-dependent. Furthermore, our results are consistent with predictions of the predator dispersal hypothesis and suggest that large seed crops and social interactions among scatter-hoarders affect dispersal benefits for oaks and other masting tree species.","[Pesendorfer, Mario B.; Kamil, Alan C.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, 348 Manter Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Pesendorfer, Mario B.; Sillett, T.

Intra-specific competition is an especially important ecological process because it generates negative density dependence in demographic rates. Although ecological factors are most often investigated to determine the strength of density dependence, evolutionary processes such as local adaptation could also feed back to shape variation in the strength of density dependence among populations. Using an experimental approach with damselflies, a predaceous aquatic insect, we find evidence that both density-dependent intraspecific competition and local adaptation can reduce per capita growth rates. In some cases, the effects of local adaptation on reducing per capita growth rates exceeded the ecological competitive effects of a doubling of density. However, we also found that these ecological and evolutionary properties of populations are coupled, and we offer two interpretations of the causes underlying this pattern: (1) the strength of density-dependent competition depends on the extent of local adaptation, or (2) the extent of local adaptation is shaped by the strength of density-dependent competition. Regardless of the underlying causal pathway, these results show how eco-evolutionary dynamics can affect a key demographic process regulating populations.","[Siepielski, Adam M.; Nemirov, Alex; Cattivera, Matthew; Nickerson, Avery] Univ San Diego, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Siepielski, Adam M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Siepielski, AM (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",amsiepie@uark.edu,"Siepielski, Adam/AAE-4806-2021",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1255318],"P.

Apart from competitive relationships between M. leidyi and fish larvae, direct predation by the ctenophore on both eggs and larvae is considered an important factor linking ctenophore and fish populations. We therefore estimated abundances of both the ctenophore and its potential prey in the spring of 2008. No significant correlations were detected between ctenophore numbers and the abundance of fish eggs. We further carried out stable isotope analyses to investigate the trophic position of M. leidyi. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of three potential prey groups (fish eggs, small plankton and larger plankton) showed that M. leidyi primarily feeds on plankton, while fish eggs are of minor importance. Mnemiopsis leidyi was located roughly one trophic level above the indigenous ctenophore Bolinopsis infundibulum, whereas its trophic position was more similar to another native ctenophore, Pleurobrachia pileus. A feeding selection experiment, with fish eggs and copepods offered in the same proportion, corroborated these findings. Mnemiopsis leidyi ingested significantly more copepods; feeding on fish eggs was not significantly different from zero. Based on these experiments, we conclude that in the North Sea, M. leidyi has no serious potential as a direct predator of fish eggs, but individuals of this species might compete for food with larval fish as well as with the native ctenophore P. pileus.","[Hamer, Henrike H.; Malzahn, Arne M.; Boersma, Maarten] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Stn Helgoland, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany; [Malzahn, Arne M.] GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany","Boersma, M (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Stn Helgoland, Ostkaje 1118, D-27483 Helgoland, Germany.",maarten.boersma@awi.de,"Malzahn, Arne/C-5851-2013; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013","Malzahn, Arne/0000-0002-2027-0804; Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG AB 289/2-1],This study was partly financed by German Science Foundation (DFG AB 289/2-1).

Habitat restoration, however, may be hindered by all inadequate understanding of species' habitat requirements. Habitat structure may play a major role in influencing the biotic interactions among species. Pond-breeding amphibians are one group that has experienced loss and alteration of critical habitats. Vegetation structure in wetland environments may be important to amphibian larvae if its presence mediates biotic interactions, such as competition, which Call affect growth and survival to metamorphosis. Despite the potential importance of habitat structure and competition, few stitches have examined these factors simultaneously. In a full-factorial pond mesocosm experiment, we tested for the effects of variation in habitat structure and density of it larger tadpole competitor (Rana pipiens, northern leopard frog) oil development and survival of three species of larval amphibians: Bufo americanus (American toad), Hyla versicolor (gray treefrog), and Ambystoma maculation (spotted salamander). Survival of Bufo was greater in mesocosins with live or artificial cattails than in those lacking vegetation. Although responses varied among species, our data suggest that time to metamorphosis, survival, and species evenness can be influenced by, both aquatic habitat structure and competition, whereas size at metamorphosis is affected primarily by, competition.

Indirect effects may be mediated by creation of dissimilar or inimical habitats, changes in predator and/or prey assemblages, alterations in associated biota, and perturbations of water movement and thermal regimes. Previous studies have shown that invasive algae can modify native habitat architecture, disrupt intricately linked food webs and alter epibiotic assemblages. In the UK, the seagrass Zostera marina supports a diverse epibiotic assemblage, influencing key factors such as sediment dynamics, depositional regime and trophic linkages. Increasing encroachment of the invasive alga Sargassum muticum into seagrass meadows changes the physical and chemical characteristics of the local environment and creates the potential for changes in the epibionts associated with the seagrass blades, threatening the integrity of the seagrass ecosystem. We investigated the effects of S. muticum invasion upon the epibiota of Z. marina in a drowned river valley in SW England seasonally from spring to autumn over four years in an in-situ manipulative experiment, comparing permanent quadrats with and without artificially introduced S. muticum. Epibiota were weighed, identified to the most detailed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) possible, and unitary organisms were enumerated. Multivariate PERMANOVA+ analysis revealed significant differences in epibiont assemblages between Sargassum treatments. Linear mixed effects models indicated that differences in epibiota assemblage composition were not reflected as significant differences in mean biomass per sample, or number of epibiont OTUs per sample. We conclude that S. muticum invasion into Z. marina meadows may significantly alter the species composition and abundance distribution of epibiotic assemblages found on the blades of the seagrass. Thus S. muticum invasion could have more wide-reaching effects on processes within coastal ecosystems than predicted purely by direct effects.","[DeAmicis, Stacey; Foggo, Andrew] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England","DeAmicis, S (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, 620 Davy Bldg, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",stacey.deamicis@plymouth.ac.uk,"DeAmicis, Stacey/F-3553-2015","DeAmicis, Stacey/0000-0002-3447-5085",Jack Kent Cooke Graduate Scholarship; Jack Kent Cooke Foundation,"This study was funded by (SD) Jack Kent Cooke Graduate Scholarship, Jack Kent Cooke Foundation: http://www.jkcf.org/.

An ecological model for the community was developed by means of interspecific relationship including competition and predation to calculate the APDP. As a case study, we reported here the ecotoxicological effects of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) collected from Bohai oil field on densities of two algae, Platymonas subcordiformis and Isochrysis galbana, a rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, and of a cladocera, Penilia avirostris, in single species and a microcosm experiment Time scales expressing toxic effect increased with increasing levels of toxic effect from molecule to community. Remarkable periodic changes in densities were found during the tests in microcosm experiment, revealing a strong species reaction. The minimum time scale characterizing toxic effect at a community level should be the common cycle of population densities of the microcosm. In addition, the cycles of plankton densities shortened in general with increasing PHC, showing an evident toxic effect on the microcosm. Using APDP as the endpoint, a threshold concentration for the modeled microcosm was calculated to be 0.404 mg-PHC-1. The APDP was found to be more sensitive and reliable than the standing crops of populations as the endpoint This indicated that the APDP, an endpoint at the community level, could be quantitatively related to the endpoints at the population level, and led to the quantitative concentration-toxic effect relationship at the community level.","[Wang, Changyou; Wang, Siwen; Luo, Zhuhua; Mao, Longjiang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Xinming] Jiangsu Environm Monitoring Ctr, Nanjing 210036, Peoples R China; [Yang, Bin] Beibu Gulf Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Marine Disaster Beibu Gulf, Qinzhou 535011, Peoples R China; [Liang, Shengkang] Ocean Univ China, Minist Educ, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China","Wang, CY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",chy.w@hotmail.com,,,Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2020r028]; National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC1402101]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This study was supported by the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST (Project No. 2020r028), the National Key Research and Development Program (Project No. 2016YFC1402101), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,83,0,0,5,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-6513,1090-2414,,ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE,Ecotox.

As ecosystem engineers, earthworms greatly affect plant communities. They create persistent soil structures enriched by nutrients that improve the conditions for plant growth and modify competition between plant species. We therefore hypothesized that earthworm activity would be more important in early stages of the primary succession, when the soil is not modified by earthworms, than in the late stages of the succession, when the soil is already improved by earthworms. On the other hand, earthworms also affect plants via many other effects such as seed predation or excreting hormone-like compounds, which could make earthworm presence important in late successional soil. 2. To explore earthworm effects on plant community succession, we performed a laboratory microcosm experiment without and with earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus and Aporrectodea caliginosa), with early successional plants (Poa compressa, Medicago lupulina and Daucus carota) and late successional plants (Arrhenatherum elatius, Lotus corniculatus and Plantago lanceolata) and with soil previously unaffected by earthworms (young soil) and soil substantially affected by earthworms (developed soil). These soils were taken from the early and late successional post-mining sites of the Sokolov coal mining district (northwest Czech Republic). 3. When both early and late successional plants were grown separately, earthworms increased plant biomass proportionally more in the young soil than in the developed soil, indicating that earthworm activity is more important in undeveloped than in developed soil. 4. When early and late successional plants were competing each other, the biomass of the early successional plants was reduced. In the young soil, the reduction was independent of earthworm presence. In the developed soil, the reduction was promoted by the earthworms. Late successional plants profited from the reduction of early successional plants and increased their biomass. This increase was promoted by the earthworm presence. 5. Our results indicate that the direct effects of earthworm presence on plants decrease during succession because of the cumulative effects of earthworm activity on soil conditions. Such ecosystem engineering effects favour late successional competitors and therefore promote the replacement of species during succession.","[Mudrak, Ondrej] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Dept Funct Ecol, Inst Bot, Trebon, Czech Republic; [Frouz, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Environm Studies, Prague, Czech Republic","Mudrak, O (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Dept Funct Ecol, Inst Bot, Trebon, Czech Republic.",ondrej.mudrak@ibot.cas.cz,"Mudrak, Ondrej/H-1614-2014","Mudrak, Ondrej/0000-0001-7775-0414","Grantova Agentura Ceske RepublikyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-09979S, 17-14409S, 1719376S, GA13-10377S, GA15-11635S, P504/12/1288]; Sokolovska uhelna","Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky, Grant/Award Number: 17-09979S, 17-14409S, 1719376S, GA13-10377S, GA15-11635S and P504/12/1288; Sokolovska uhelna a.s. coal mining company",,43,7,7,3,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

External selective pressures vary in the degree to which they regulate survival by sex and age class. Understanding the important factors and risks for different demographic classes helps managers design strategies that enhance the recovery of endangered species, including Sierra bighorn. Our goal was to determine what population-level factors (e.g., climate, habitat, population size, predation) affect survival and whether there are interactions between these factors by age and sex, and then apply our findings to recovery strategies. To this end, we conducted a known-fate survival analysis for female and male Sierra bighorn with data collected over 12 years, and used model selection to evaluate models with spatial, environmental, and other population-level factors hypothesized to be related to survival. Survival of adult Sierra bighorn declined continuously with age for both sexes; survival was generally higher for females than males, and there were no interactions between age and any environmental or population-level factors. The top model for both sexes included the date of peak value of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the previous summer; NDVI had a similar positive relationship with survival for both sexes, which indicates that the later the growing season persists into the summer, the better survival the subsequent year. For females, survival also was negatively related to an index of abundance for mountain lions (Puma concolor), whereas the relationship was less apparent for males. Instead, top models for males indicated elevated survival during warm wet years, but years with late peaks in NDVI the previous year ameliorated the effect of a cold, dry winter. Finally, competitive models for males and females included a variable representing avalanche risk, indicating reduced survival in areas with increased avalanche risk. From a recovery management perspective, the lack of any interaction between age and other covariates suggests that although we may still select younger female Sierra bighorn for translocations (an essential recovery action) because they have higher reproductive value than old females, there were no additional negative synergies between age and other factors to consider. All variables are of value in guiding expectations for newly established populations and established source populations and some may help fine tune the selection of translocation areas. In addition, including predation, weather covariates, and catastrophic effects, such as avalanche risk, in projection models is important for realistic estimation of the time required to meet recovery goals and predicting population trajectories under likely climate change scenarios. Our approach is generalizable to other systems; we demonstrated how survival analyses can inform endangered species recovery management by indicating ideal areas for translocations and provided realistic estimates of time-to-recovery or other recovery metrics.

We demonstrate how survival analyses can inform endangered species recovery management by indicating ideal areas for translocations and improving population projection model estimates of recovery metrics. Although our recommendations are specific to Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, our approach is generalizable to other systems.","[Conner, Mary M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5320 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Stephenson, Thomas R.; German, David W.; Few, Alexandra P.] Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep Recovery Program, 787 North Main St,Suite 220, Bishop, CA 93515 USA; [Monteith, Kevin L.] Univ Wyoming, Haub Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Zool & Physiol, 804 East Fremont, Laramie, WY 82072 USA; [Bair, Edward H.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, 6832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Few, Alexandra P.] USDA APHIS Wildlife Serv, POB 1938, Billings, MT 59103 USA","Conner, MM (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5320 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",mary.conner@usu.edu,,,California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Federal Assistance in Wildlife Grants; California Wild Sheep Foundation; Yosemite Conservancy; Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep Foundation; Wild Sheep Foundation; USFWSUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Bureau of Land Management; Inyo National Forest; Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest; Yosemite National Park; Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks,"We thank J.

Hemimysis is predicted to impact nearshore fish communities in the Northeastern USA where its range is expanding, either negatively through predation of shared zooplankton prey or positively as high-calorie prey. In this experimental study, we examined the factors influencing Hemimysis' benthic habitat selection, vertical distribution, and susceptibility to fish predation. In the presence of fish cues, Hemimysis preferred cobble over other benthic substrates (Dreissena mussels, pebble, or sand) regardless of light conditions; in dark conditions without a fish present, Hemimysis preferred open waters with sand habitat. Light and fish cues also interacted to influence the vertical distribution of Hemimysis, with the majority of mysids selecting depths that minimized perceived cumulative risk. The mean feeding rates of young-of-year (YOY) alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), adult round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), YOY yellow perch (Percaflavescens), adult pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), and YOY lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) varied among species, prey densities, and substrate (range = 0.77-57 mysids/fish/h). In general, feeding rates were highest for alewife, a nonnative species in the Great Lakes basin, and in refuge-free conditions for all species, except for non-native round goby, which fed at similar rates regardless of prey refuge availability. Collectively, our results suggest that fish feeding success is contingent upon the interaction of light and Hemimysis refuge availability due to behavioral modifications of Hemimysis in the presence of fish and adverse light conditions.

Here, we tested relative effects of plant species, herbivore intraspecific competition type, and spatial distribution of the herbivore among plant units on herbivore survival and whether parasitoids modified these effects. We used an endophagous bruchine seed predator Callosobruchus maculatus for the herbivore, and a braconid wasp Heterospilus prosopidis for the parasitoid. The survival rate of C. maculatus was measured for each of 16 combinations of two plants (bean species, Vigna unguiculata and V. radiata), two competition types of C. maculatus larvae (contest and scramble), two spatial distributions of hosts [sparse (1 C. maculatus larva per seed over 20 seeds) and dense (2 C. maculatus larvae per seed over ten seeds)], and with/without a parasitoid pair. In the absence of the parasitoid, C. maculatus survival rate was lower with V. radiata and in the contest type. With the parasitoid, the proportion parasitized hosts was independent of total host density. Neither the proportion of parasitized hosts nor host survival rate was affected by plant species or host strain, but they were affected by host spatial distribution. When host distribution was dense, a higher proportion of hosts were parasitized, and C. maculatus survival rate was lower. Here we discuss parasitoid potential as a selective agent for the sparse within-pod distribution of its hosts in the field.","[Tuda, Midori] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Inst Biol Control, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [den Hollander, Michelle D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Vamosi, Steven M.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Tuda, M (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Inst Biol Control, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",tuda@grt.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Vamosi, Steven/C-8126-2009","Vamosi, Steven/0000-0003-3903-5000","NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15770011, 19510237]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23405008, 22570215] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank P.

The in situ enclosures consisted of replicated ''low'', ''intermediate'' and ''high'' Chaoborus treatment densities, compared to natural lake densities. Due to large changes in Chaoborus densities during all three experiments, treatment effects were assessed by correlation analysis, using the calculated mean Chaoborus density for each enclosure. In the lake, Chaoborus preyed primarily on rotifers and the naupliar stages of cyclopoids and calanoids throughout the study. Only one statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationship between Chaoborus and zooplankton densities was found to exist, between Chaoborus and total zooplankton densities, during the first enclosure experiment. The lack of statistically significant relationships between Chaoborus and individual prey group densities occurred despite the fact that Chaoborus densities were enhanced up to 20 times the lake density during one of the enclosure experiments. These results contradict the strong impacts of large Chaoborus species documented in previous studies.

A general outcome of asymmetrical competition between co-existing predator species is that larger predators tend to suppress the abundances of smaller predators. Here, we investigate interference effects that an apex predator, the dingo (Canis dingo), has on the acquisition of food and water by the smaller red fox (Vulpes vulpes), by exposing free-ranging foxes to the odour of dingoes and conspecifics in an arid environment. Using giving-up densities we show that foxes foraged more apprehensively at predator-odour treatments than unscented controls, but their food intake did not differ between dingo- and fox-odour treatments. Using video analysis of fox behaviour at experimental water stations we show that foxes spent more time engaged in exploration behaviour at stations scented with fox odour and spent more time drinking at water stations scented with dingo odour. Our results provide support for the idea that dingo odour exerts a stronger interference effect on foxes than conspecific odour, but suggest that the odours of both larger dingoes and unfamiliar conspecifics curtailed foxes' acquisition of food resources.","[Leo, Viyanna; Letnic, Mike] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Reading, Richard P.] Denver Zool Fdn, Dept Conservat Biol, Denver, CO 80205 USA","Leo, V (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",viyanna.leo@unsw.edu.au; rreading@denverzoo.org; m.letnic@unsw.edu.au,,"Letnic, Michael/0000-0003-4191-8427",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"This research was funded by funding from the Australian Research Council.

While the relevance of competition and feeding traits have been widely studied for different consumer species, studies on intraspecific differences are more scarce, partly owing to difficulties in distinguishing different clones of the same species. Here, we investigate how intraspecific trait variation affects the competition between the freshwater ciliates Euplotes octocarinatus and Coleps hirtus in a nitrogen-limited chemostat system. The ciliates competed for the microalgae Cryptomonas sp. (Cry) and Navicula pelliculosa (Nav), and the bacteria present in the cultures over a period of 33 days. We used monoclonal Euplotes and three different Coleps clones (Col 1, Col 2, and Col 3) in the experiment that could be distinguished by a newly developed rDNA-based molecular assay based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. While Euplotes feeds on Cry and on bacteria, the Coleps clones cannot survive on bacteria alone but feed on both Cry and Nav with clone-specific rates. Experimental treatments comprised two-species mixtures of Euplotes and one or all of the three different Coleps clones, respectively. We found intraspecific variation in the traits selectivity and maximum ingestion rate for the different algae to significantly affect the competitive outcome between the two ciliate species. As Nav quickly escaped top-down control and likely reached a state of low food quality, ciliate competition was strongly determined by the preference of different Coleps clones for Cry as opposed to feeding on Nav. In addition, the ability of Euplotes to use bacteria as an alternative food source strengthened its persistence once Cry was depleted. Hence, trait variation at both trophic levels codetermined the population dynamics and the outcome of species competition.","[Floeder, Sabine; Yong, Joanne; Poprick, Tobias; Brinkhoff, Thorsten; Moorthi, Stefanie] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm ICBM, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Klauschies, Toni; Gaedke, Ursula] Univ Potsdam, Ecol & Ecosyst Modelling, Potsdam, Germany","Floder, S (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm ICBM, Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",sabine.floeder@uni-oldenburg.de,,,Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [394736697],We would like to thank Heike Rickels for preforming the nutrient analyses and Rebecca Schroter for helping out during sampling campaigns.

However, lack of knowledge of the indirect consequences of invasions, combined with poor understanding of how their ecological effects depend upon competitive attributes of the receiving community, hinders our ability to manage and predict the effects of invasive species on ecosystems. We established an experiment using a combination of both additive and substitutive experimental designs to explore the effects of the globally spreading mysid shrimp Hemimysis anomala on the biological structure of outdoor pond mesocosms in the absence and presence of a functionally similar native competitor, Mysis salemaai. The naturally smaller H.anomala had considerably stronger effects on primary producers, multiple aspects of consumer assemblages and overall biological structure of the ponds in comparison with the functionally similar native. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects was generally independent of the presence of M.salemaai and even total mysid density. Hemimysis anomala reduced both the abundance and diversity of zooplankton assemblages significantly, triggering a strong trophic cascade on phytoplankton and a simultaneous increase of benthic invertebrate biomass. These findings indicate that invasion by H.anomala may exacerbate the effects of nutrient enrichment on lakes. Our results demonstrate that introduced species can, irrespective of the presence of functionally similar natives, induce complex changes to ecosystems that reach beyond direct consumptive effects. Moreover, the cascading indirect effects of invasion can exacerbate the impacts of other stressors. Disregarding the complexity of indirect effects therefore risks underestimating significantly the global ecological footprint of biological invasions.","[Penk, Marcin; Irvine, Kenneth; Donohue, Ian] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Irvine, Kenneth] UNESCO IHE Inst Water & Educ, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Donohue, Ian] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Trinity Ctr Biodivers Res, Dublin 2, Ireland","Penk, M (corresponding author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",penkm@tcd.ie,"Donohue, Ian/A-7270-2010; Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013","Donohue, Ian/0000-0002-4698-6448; Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991; Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064","Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology [ECS/2009/01, GOIPD/2014/129]; Ecological Consultancy Services Limited","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments, which helped to improve the quality of the manuscript.

We used hair dye to dull epaulets of free-living territorial males prior to pair formation to determine if manipulated males experienced disadvantages in comparison with control males. We found no differences between control males and males with dulled epaulets in territorial behavior (territory size, song rate, trespass rate, and loss of territory), paternal care (time spent on territory and in antipredator sentinel behavior, and response to a model crow to simulate the threat of predation), pairing success (number of social mates), apparent reproductive success (numbers of nesting attempts, eggs/nest, nestlings/egg, and fledglings/nestling), or realized reproductive success (numbers of within-pair, extra-pair, and total fledglings as determined by DNA fingerprinting). We then used a meta-analysis of 11 published studies of Red-winged Blackbirds to determine if there is an overall effect of epaulet color or size on male-male competition, female choice, or reproductive success. Our results show that epaulet size has a small positive effect on male reproductive success, but epaulet color has no effect on male-male competition, female choice, and male reproductive success. One explanation for the seeming contradiction between studies that show that epaulets are necessary for territory defense and those that conclude that epaulets are not currently under selection is that epaulets serve as one of several cues of species recognition, especially among males at close range. An alternative explanation proposes counter-balancing intersexual advantages and intrasexual disadvantages of epaulet expression. Additional studies are needed to test these alternatives.","[Yasukawa, Ken] Beloit Coll, Dept Biol, Beloit, WI 53511 USA; [Enstrom, David A.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Parker, Patricia G.; Jones, Thomas C.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Zool, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Yasukawa, K (corresponding author), Beloit Coll, Dept Biol, Beloit, WI 53511 USA.",yasukawa@beloit.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN9306620],"We thank R.

However, the magnitude of these impacts is likely to vary depending on the availability of alternative prey species and the nature of ecological mechanisms driving the prey cycles. These multispecies effects can be modeled explicitly if parameterized functions relating prey consumption to prey abundance, and realistic population dynamical models for the prey, are available. These requirements are met by the interaction between the Hen Harrier ( Circus cyaneus) and three of its prey species in the United Kingdom, the Meadow Pipit ( Anthus pratensis), the field vole ( Microtus agrestis), and the Red Grouse ( Lagopus lagopus scoticus). We used this system to investigate how the availability of alternative prey and the way in which prey dynamics are modeled might affect the behavior of simple trophic networks. We generated cycles in one of the prey species ( Red Grouse) in three different ways: through ( 1) the interaction between grouse density and macroparasites, ( 2) the interaction between grouse density and male grouse aggressiveness, and ( 3) a generic, delayed density-dependent mechanism. Our results confirm that generalist predation can damp or suppress grouse cycles, but only when the densities of alternative prey are low. They also demonstrate that diametrically opposite indirect effects between pairs of prey species can occur together in simple systems. In this case, pipits and grouse are apparent competitors, whereas voles and grouse are apparent facilitators. Finally, we found that the quantitative impacts of the predator on prey density differed among the three models of prey dynamics, and these differences were robust to uncertainty in parameter estimation and environmental stochasticity.","Univ St Andrews, Gatty Marine Lab, NERC, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; Univ St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews KY16 9LZ, Fife, Scotland; Univ Stirling, Ctr Conservat Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland; Macaulay Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; Penn State Univ, Mueller Lab 208, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Harwood, J (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Gatty Marine Lab, NERC, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",jh17@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Matthiopoulos, Jason/N-9808-2013; Hudson, Peter/AAB-8080-2020; Asseburg, Christian/AAK-2903-2020; Redpath, Stephen/B-4640-2012","Matthiopoulos, Jason/0000-0003-3639-8172; Hudson, Peter/0000-0003-0468-3403; Asseburg, Christian/0000-0001-7196-3363; Redpath, Stephen/0000-0001-5399-9477",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [CEH010021] Funding Source: researchfish,,,66,11,11,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2007,88,10,,,,,2576,2586,,10.1890/06-0483.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,228FY,WOS:000250714200018,18027760,,,,2021-09-27,

The experiment involved factorial manipulation of soil fertility, invertebrate herbivores (slugs, grass aphids) and their predators (ground beetles, ladybirds). In the absence of herbivores the vegetation on soils of high, moderate and low fertility was dominated by plant species which under natural field conditions are restricted to fertile soils. At high fertility, the rate of competitive exclusion was rapid compared with communities persisting at lower fertility which remained species-rich with high densities of individuals. The effects of herbivory were profound and attributable mainly to the slug Deroceras reticulatum. At moderate and low soil fertility the main effect of herbivores was to change the ranking of plant species; palatable grasses (e.g. Poa annua, Poa trivialis and Lolium perenne) were suppressed and plant species of slower growth rate (e.g. Festuca rubra, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca ovina) were promoted. More subtle impacts of herbivory altered the size structure of plant populations suggesting the preference, by slugs, for seedlings and small (suppressed) plants. Although ladybirds and their larvae persisted in low numbers in some microcosms, carnivory was more strongly in evidence (lower densities of D. reticulatum and reduced consumption of lettuce discs) in relation to the activities of the ground beetle Pterostichus melanarius. Only in the low fertility treatment, however, was this potential translated into effects on vegetation; for several plant species the frequency of large individuals increased in the presence of P. melanarius. We conclude that outdoor microcosms provide a valuable ecological tool and, in particular, allow investigation of (a) the role of herbivores in promoting slow-growing plant species in the vegetation of infertile habitats and (b) the protection of palatable plants against herbivores by carnivores.","Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Kelso TD5 8PZ, Roxburg, Scotland; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Unit Comparat Plant Ecol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Buckland, SM (corresponding author), Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Kelso TD5 8PZ, Roxburg, Scotland.",s.buckland@mluri.sari.ac.uk,,,,,,61,55,58,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2000,91,2,,,,,336,352,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910214.x,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,385RQ,WOS:000166017800014,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, there is a general lack of knowledge on what factors control the growth rates of different prokaryotic groups and how these vary between sites and along seasons at a given site. We carried out several manipulation experiments during the four astronomical seasons in the coastal NW Mediterranean in order to evaluate the impact of grazing, viral mortality, resource competition and light on the growth and loss rates of prokaryotes. Gross and net growth rates of different bacterioplankton groups targeted by group-specific CARD-FISH probes and infrared microscopy (for aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, AAP), were calculated from changes in cell abundances. Maximal group-specific growth rates were achieved when both predation pressure and nutrient limitation were experimentally minimized, while only a minimal effect of viral pressure on growth rates was observed; nevertheless, the response to predation removal was more remarkable in winter, when the bacterial community was not subjected to nutrient limitation. Although all groups showed increases in their growth rates when resource competition as well as grazers and viral pressure were reduced, Alteromonadaceae consistently presented the highest rates in all seasons. The response to light availability was generally weaker than that to the other factors, but it was variable between seasons. In summer and spring, the growth rates of AAP were stimulated by light whereas the growth of the SAR11 clade (likely containing proteorhodopsin) was enhanced by light in all seasons. Overall, our results set thresholds on bacterioplankton group-specific growth and mortality rates and contribute to estimate the seasonally changing contribution of various bacterioplankton groups to the function of microbial communities. Our results also indicate that the least abundant groups display the highest growth rates, contributing to the recycling of organic matter to a much greater extent than what their abundances alone would predict.","[Sanchez, Olga; Mabrito, Isabel; Gazulla, Carlota R.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Bellaterra 08193, Catalunya, Spain; [Ferrera, Isabel] Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Malaga 29640, Spain; [Ferrera, Isabel; Gazulla, Carlota R.; Sebastian, Marta; Auladell, Adria; Marin-Vindas, Carolina; Cardelus, Clara; Sanz-Saez, Isabel; Pernice, Massimo C.; Marrase, Celia; Sala, M.

In order to understand this pattern I performed experiments at two levels. First, at the community level, I evaluated the importance of competition, predation, and pond permanence for patterns of larval performance. Second, at the behavioral level, I asked whether a hypothesized trade-off between gain and risk underlies ecological interactions, and ultimately, patterns of performance and distribution of these species. I employed a field manipulation to assess the contributions of competition and predation within different ponds that varied in permanence. In order to examine the effect of interspecific competition, enclosures contained each tadpole species either alone or in the presence of an equal density of the other species; these enclosures were placed in two temporary ponds, two intermediate ponds, and two permanent ponds. Tadpole stocking densities reflected local natural densities. This competition treatment was crossed with a predator treatment manipulating the absence or presence of predators (with ''presence'' representing the naturally occurring density within each pond). Patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across the pond permanence gradient: chorus frogs performed best relative to spring peepers in temporary ponds while spring peepers performed best relative to chorus frogs in permanent ponds (performance was measured as survivorship and growth). The dominant sources of mortality were pond drying in temporary ponds and predation in more permanent ponds. In contrast to most previous experimental studies of larval anurans, competition had small effects on tadpole performance. Results from the held experiment suggest that pond drying and predation may be important determinants of performance, and that the two species are differentially susceptible to these mortality agents. In a set of laboratory experiments I evaluated the hypothesis that a trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk mediated through activity (proportion of time spent moving) might explain patterns of Pseudacris distribution. In both species, individuals facultatively reduced activity in the presence of a caged predator with a corresponding drop in growth rate. In general, larval chorus frogs also tend to be more active and faster growing and developing than spring peepers. These results provide support for the existence of the trade-off and suggest that interspecific differences in activity may contribute to patterns of larval performance and distribution among ponds. The general nature of this trade-off suggests that it may also be important in other systems.","UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",,,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,,,,57,142,144,0,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1995,76,1,,,,,150,164,,10.2307/1940638,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QC872,WOS:A1995QC87200013,,,,,2021-09-27,

We performed an outdoor cattle tank experiment (n = 60) making an orthogonal combination of a primary productivity gradient (four nutrient addition levels: 0, 10, 100, and 1000 mu g P/L; N/P ratio: 16) with a vegetation gradient (no macrophytes, artificial macrophytes, and real Elodea nuttallii). We used artificial plants to evaluate the mere effects of plant physical structure independently from other plant effects, such as competition for nutrients or allelopathy. The tanks were inoculated with species-rich mixtures of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Both productivity and macrophytes affected community structure and diversity of the three functional groups. Taxon richness declined with increasing plankton productivity in each functional group according to a nested subset pattern. We found no evidence for unimodal diversity-productivity relationships. The proportional abundance of Daphnia and of colonial Scenedesmus increased strongly with productivity. GLM analyses suggest that the decline in richness of seston feeders was due to competitive exclusion by Daphnia at high productivity. The decline in richness of phytoplankton was probably caused by high Daphnia grazing. However, partial analyses indicate that these explanations do not entirely explain the patterns. Possibly, environmental deterioration associated with high productivity (e.g., high pH) was also responsible for the observed richness decline. Macrophytes had positive effects on the taxon richness of all three functional plankton groups and interacted with the initial productivity gradient in determining their communities. Macrophytes affected the composition and diversity of the three functional groups both by their physical structure and through other mechanisms. Part of the macrophyte effect may be indirect via a reduction of phytoplankton production. Our results also indirectly suggest that the often reported unimodal relationship between primary productivity and diversity in nature may be partially mediated by the tendency of submerged macrophytes to be most abundant at intermediate productivity levels.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Aquat Ecol Lab, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Plant Ecol, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium","Declerck, S (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Aquat Ecol Lab, Ch Beriotstr 32, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",steven.declerck@bio.kuleuven.be,"De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015; Declerck, Steven/E-4338-2010","De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Declerck, Steven/0000-0001-6179-667X; Muylaert, Koenraad/0000-0001-9645-4063",,,,34,95,99,3,116,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2007,88,9,,,,,2199,2210,,10.1890/07-0048.1,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,211CC,WOS:000249500900006,17918398,,,,2021-09-27,

During the growing season of 1990, plots with average densities of 10-11 grasshoppers per m(2) were treated with carbaryl bran bait (carbaryl plots) or bran bait without carbaryl (control plots). The grasshoppers fed particularly heavily on alfalfa, driving the percent cover of this species to essentially zero by mid-August. Application of carbaryl significantly reduced the densities of three of the four major grasshopper species present (Oedaleonotus enigma, Melanoplus sanguinipes, and M. packardii),and slowed the rate with which these insects consumed the standing crop of alfalfa. In contrast, densities of the fourth major grasshopper species present, M. bivittatus, were not reduced by application of carbaryl but instead were greatly elevated. This population response may have arisen in large part as adults of M. bivittatus aggregated in carbaryl plots in response to the reduced rate of defoliation of alfalfa by other species. Greater numbers of M. bivittatus nymphs also occurred in 1991 in plots treated with versus without carbaryl in 1990 (no carbaryl was applied in 1991), as did greater numbers of O. enigma nymphs (despite there having been fewer adult females present in these plots the previous year). But the densities of grasshoppers of all species were low in all plots in 1991 (approximately 1 per m(2) by mid-summer), and no differences in percent cover of alfalfa or other Vegetation were detected in plots treated the previous year with versus without carbaryl. The striking positive response of M. bivittatus to application of carbaryl bran (and associated reductions in population sizes of competing grasshopper species) strongly suggests that intense interspecific interactions occurred at the study site in 1990.",,"EVANS, EW (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,33,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1995,73,1,,,,,73,78,,10.2307/3545727,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH161,WOS:A1995RH16100010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Bi-directional consumer-resource (C-R) interactions have been the object of recent theory. In these interactions, each species acts, in some respects, as both a consumer and a resource of the other, which is the basis of many mutualisms. In uni-directional C-R interactions between two species, one acts as a consumer and the other as a material and/or energy resource, while neither acts as both. The relationship between insect pollinator/seed parasites and the host plant is an example of the latter interaction type of C-R, as the insect provides no material resource to the plant (though it provides a pollination service). In this paper we consider a different variation of the uni-directional C-R interaction, in which the resource species has both positive and negative effects on the consumer species, while the consumer has only a negative effect on the resource. A predator-prey system in which the prey is able to kill or consume predator eggs or larvae is an example. Our aim is to demonstrate mechanisms by which interaction outcomes of this system vary with different conditions, and thus to extend the uni-directional C-R theory established by Holland and DeAngelis (2009). By the analysis of a specific two-species system, it is shown that there is no periodic solution of the system, and the parameter (factor) space can be divided into six regions, which correspond to predation/parasitism, amensalism, and competition. The interaction outcomes of the system transition smoothly when the parameters are changed continuously in the six regions and/or initial densities of the species vary in a smooth fashion. Varying a pair of parameters can also result in the transitions. The analysis leads to both conditions under which the species approach their maximal densities, and explanations for phenomena in experiments by Urabe and Sterner (1996).

The lakes are characterized by a dominance of large zooplankton species. Small zooplankton species are scarce, whereas in nearby lakes with fish they are common. The importance of biotic and abiotic factors in preventing the successful invasion of small zooplankton species into these fishless lakes was determined using a series of field manipulations. The relative importance of competition with large herbivores (the cladoceran Daphnia pulex), predation by large invertebrates (the dipteran Chaoborus americanus and the copepod Diaptomus leptopus), and abiotic conditions including pH were examined experimentally. Abiotic and/or resource conditions suppressed the population growth rate of 70% of the small zooplankton species introduced into enclosures in the fishless lakes relative to those introduced into enclosures in their resident lake (a lake with fish). Fewer small zooplankton species were suppressed in a similar experiment when pH was experimentally raised to 7, suggesting that pH is one factor that inhibits the successful invasion of small zooplankton into these lakes. Manipulations of large herbivores and invertebrate predators showed that predation was more important than competition in restricting the distribution of small species. Predation by Chaoborus primarily reduced the densities of crustaceans while predation by Diaptomus reduced the densities of rotifers. Competitive suppression of small zooplankton by Daphnia was not detected. The results suggest that both predation by Chaoborus and Diaptomus and abiotic conditions, including pH, are important factors determining zooplankton community structure in these fishless bog lakes.","MIAMI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,OXFORD,OH 45054",,,,"Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",,,,86,101,109,0,42,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1993,74,8,,,,,2361,2380,,10.2307/1939588,,,20,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MJ575,WOS:A1993MJ57500017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) are secretive, sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) obligates of conservation concern that occupy the Intermountain West, USA. These unique leporids are difficult to monitor; however using remote cameras in conjunction with ranking of burrow activity may help refine sampling techniques for these mammals. We classified and deployed remote cameras at 405 burrows of pygmy rabbits between 2006 and 2010 in six study areas across Utah, USA. We ranked burrows based on the appearance of fecal pellets, as well as the condition of burrow entrances. We also documented the presence of pygmy rabbits and potential competitors and predators of pygmy rabbits at burrows using remote cameras. We used mixed-effects, zero-inflated negative binomial models and AIC model selection to evaluate the relative influences of burrow activity ranking, season, and rate of photographs for potential competitors and predators of pygmy rabbits on photo rates of pygmy rabbits. The top 2 models supported a simplified (active or inactive) burrow classification system and accounted for 45% of AIC weight. Rates of pygmy rabbit photographs were further influenced by meters from habitat edge ((beta=0.0008 +/- 0.0004, 95% CI=7.07E-05-0.002), photo rate of cottontail rabbits (beta=0.31 +/- 0.11, 95% Cl = 0.08-0.53), and were higher during summer than other times of the year (beta=0.38 +/- 0.19, 95% CI=0.01-0.74). Mean number of days to detection of pygmy rabbits at burrow complexes classified as active was four (SE=0.61), and a two-week sampling period was needed to capture 81% of first detections. Our results refine commonly used ranking criteria of burrow complexes to a 2-level scale (active and inactive), and also emphasize the use of remote cameras as an effective technique for quantifying activity of pygmy rabbits at burrow complexes. Such information can help researchers and land managers more effectively survey this species for conservation and management efforts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relatively little is known about the effects of Fire Ants on oviparous reptiles. Therefore, we quantified nestling and hatchling survival and examined indirect effects of Fire Ants on growth rate and movement patterns of hatchling Gopher Tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) using four 0.2-ha enclosures where we reduced Fire Ant abundance and four enclosures with ambient Fire Ant abundance. Both nestling and hatchling survival were greater in enclosures with reduced Fire Ants. Additionally, hatchlings exposed to ambient Fire Ant levels moved farther, used more locations, and had larger 6-mo home ranges than hatchlings exposed to reduced Fire Ant levels.

Cannibalistic intensity, offspring size, harvesting and refuge availability are important factors affecting the interplay between cannibalism and competition. We studied two populations of the common guppy (Poecilia reticulata) that differed in their cannibalistic voracity as well as offspring size. We manipulated the availability of refuges for juveniles and harvesting intensity of large adults to investigate how these factors influenced the dynamics of the two populations. Overall population dynamics was mainly affected by the origin of the founder populations and the presence of refuges. The population with a higher cannibalistic propensity and smaller offspring exhibited higher population variability, and the presence of refuges reduced cannibalism and stabilised the dynamics in both populations. Harvest of large cannibalistic females destabilised the dynamics and caused extinctions of several populations without refuges. Both populations displayed cannibal-driven cycles with repression of recruitment when no refuges were present. Cycle periods were shorter with refuges present and the dynamics were more cohort like with synchronised peaks in density of vulnerable juveniles and cannibals. We suggest that increased number of refuging juveniles led to intensified resource competition in the population. The harvest yield was low in the refuge treatments as few females grew large due to resource competition, leading to a small impact of harvesting in these treatments.","[Nilsson, Karin A.; Persson, Lennart] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Nilsson, KA (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",karin.nilsson@emg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation,"We thank anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

The toad's invasion and impact have attracted detailed study. In this paper, I review information on ecological interactions between cane toads and Australian anurans. The phylogenetic relatedness and ecological similarity between frogs and toads creates opportunities for diverse interactions, ranging from predation to competition to parasite transfer, plus a host of indirect effects mediated via impacts of toads on other species, and by people's attempts to control toads. The most clear-cut effect of toads on frogs is a positive one: reducing predator pressure by fatally poisoning anuran-eating varanid lizards. However, toads also have a wide range of other effects on frogs, some positive (e.g. taking up parasites that would otherwise infect native frogs) and others negative (e.g. eating frogs, poisoning frogs, competing with tadpoles). Although information on such mechanisms predicts intense interactions between toads and frogs, field surveys show that cane toad invasion has negligible overall impacts on frog abundance. That counter-intuitive result is because of a broad balancing of negative and positive impacts, coupled with stochastic (weather-induced) fluctuations in anuran abundance that overwhelm any impacts of toads. Also, the impacts of toads on frogs differ among frog species and life-history stages, and depend upon local environmental conditions. The impacts of native frogs on cane toads have attracted much less study, but may well be important: frogs may impose biotic resistance to cane toad colonization, especially via competition in the larval phase. Overall, the interactions between native frogs and invasive toads illustrate the diverse ways in which an invader's arrival can perturb the native fauna by both direct and indirect mechanisms, and by which the native species can curtail an invader's success. These studies also offer a cautionary tale about the difficulty of predicting the impact of an invasive species, even with a clear understanding of mechanisms of direct interaction.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Shine, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rick.shine@sydney.edu.au,,,Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"I thank my students and colleagues in Team Bufo for their efforts - both in revealing the intricate details of anuran interactions, and in generously sharing their knowledge with me.

The two most common species inhabiting meadows and river valleys, root vole Microtus oeconomus and common shrew Sorex araneus, exhibited synchronous periodic changes, characterised by a 3-year time lag as indicated by an autocorrelation function. Moreover, the cycles of these two species were synchronous within both habitats. Population dynamics of the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius was not cyclic. However, this species regularly reached maximum density 1 year before the synchronized peak of root voles and common shrews, which may suggest the existence of interspecific competition. Dynamics of all three species was dominated by direct density-dependent process, whereas delayed density dependent feedback was significant only in the root vole and common shrew. Climatic factors acting in winter and spring (affecting mainly survival and initial reproduction rates) were more important than those acting in summer and autumn and affected significantly only the common shrew. High temperatures in winter and spring had positive effects on autumn-to-autumn changes in abundance of this species, whereas deep snow in combination with high rainfall in spring negatively affected population increase rates in common shrew.","[Zub, K.; Jedrzejewska, B.; Jedrzejewski, W.; Barton, K.

In nature, the caudal fin is frequently observed to sustain damage as a result of social rank, predation or disease. To test whether the metabolic mode changed differently for fish with different metabolic mode after caudal fin amputation as a consequence of intensified energy competition, we investigated the swimming performance of fasting and fed fish with and without the caudal fin in juveniles of three cyprinid fish species: qingbo (Spinibarbus sinensis, locomotion-priority mode), common carp (Cyprinus carpio, additive mode) and goldfish (Carassius auratus, digestion-priority mode). The critical swimming speed (U-crit) of fasting qingbo, common carp and goldfish decreased significantly by 49%, 32% and 35% after caudal fin amputation. The maximum tail beat amplitude (TBA(max)) (all three fishes), maximum tail beat frequency (TBFmax) (only common carp and goldfish) and (or) active metabolic rate (MO2active) (only common carp) increased significantly after caudal fin amputation. In the control fish, digestion let to a significantly lower U-crit in goldfish but not in qingbo and common carp, and the MO2active of digesting common carp was higher than that of fasting fish, suggesting locomotion-priority, additive and digestion-priority metabolic modes in qingbo, common carp and goldfish, respectively. However, after fin amputation, digestion showed no effect on U-crit in any of the three fishes, and only the digesting common carp showed a higher MO2active than their fasting counterparts. This result suggested that the metabolic mode of the goldfish changed from the digestion- to the locomotion-priority mode, whereas the metabolic mode of the other two fishes remained the same after fin amputation. The metabolic mode of the common carp showed no change after fin amputation likely due to the high flexibility of the cardio-respiratory capacity of this fish, as indicated by the increased MO2active. Although the metabolic mode remained the same, the feeding metabolism in the fin-amputated qingbo was down-regulated at a lower swimming speed than that of the control group due to the intensified competition between digestion and locomotion. The underlying mechanism for the metabolic mode change in the goldfish is not clear and needs further investigation. However, we speculated that in caudal-fin-intact goldfish, the decreased swimming efficiency, rather than irreducible digestive loading, caused a decreased U-crit in digesting fish (i.e. false digestion-priority mode), and the metabolic mode should not be judged simply by the relative magnitude of the metabolic rates of fasting and digesting fish.

Some of their phytoseiid predators, however, show the reverse pattern. We test the hypothesis that this different seasonal phenology can be attributed to distinct saturation deficit tolerance spectra. Eggs of various species c.q. strains of phytoseiids, originating from different climate zones, were screened for their tolerance to a range of saturation deficits and compared with the tolerance spectrum of tetranychid species collected from cassava. In total 19 species/strains of predatory mites were compared with six tetranychid species. The response curves for all predators were sigmoidal with a narrow and specific region of saturation deficits where egg hatch success fell from 100% to 0%. Using probit analysis this region was characterized by the SD50, the saturation deficit at which only 50% of the eggs hatch. The response curves for the herbivores were trapezoid. In contrast to the phytoseiids the latter do not differ in the range of saturation deficits tolerated, but in the magnitude of the response. It appeared that inter-strain differences in the Phytoseiidae are sometimes larger than interspecific differences. We demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between population-specific SD50-values and long term average relative humidity in the collection site. The implications of this finding are discussed in terms of condition specific competition.","CTR INT AGR TROP,CALI,COLOMBIA","BAKKER, FM (corresponding author), UNIV AMSTERDAM,DEPT PURE & APPL ECOL,POPULAT BIOL SECT,KRUISLAAN 302,1098 SM AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.",,"Bakker, F.M./AAF-5380-2019","Bakker, F.M./0000-0002-1447-3285",,,,0,50,52,0,8,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Therefore, the effects of predation can be both consumptive and nonconsumptive and prey need to assess and respond appropriately to predation risk which in turn varies with environmental and social contexts. We tested the effects of predator density and diel cycle on the consumption, interspecific interactions and behavioural responses of a prey species, the native Australian glass shrimp, Paratya australiensis, exposed to a predator, the invasive eastern mosquito fish, Gambusia holbrooki. In the laboratory, P. australiensis were exposed to low or high densities of conspecifics or predators and observed during the day and at night. While P. australiensis experienced more interspecific approaches and nips when exposed to a high density of G. holbrooki and during the day, neither predator density nor diel cycle influenced the actual number of P. australiensis consumed. Similarly, while P. australiensis engaged in significantly more shelter use and swam less, there was no difference in these behaviours in relation to predator density and diel cycle. Foraging by P. australiensis was not related to species composition, but instead depended on the overall number of animals present with more P. australiensis foraging when exposed to a high density of conspecifics and G. holbrooki. These results indicate that the mechanisms by which G. holbrooki exerts negative effects on P. australiensis can be multiple and wide ranging, from direct predation to a reduction in activity and competition for resources. However, as neither predator density nor diurnal variation altered predation rate, P. australiensis did behave in an adaptive manner, by only adjusting its behavioural responses in proportion to the direct risk of predation.

Initially, we presented M. basalis with mixed age classes of each mite species separately at a density of approximately 30 mites per seedling. After 3 days, predator:prey ratios of 1:30, 1:15, and 1:10 resulted in reductions of T. kanzawai of 66.8%, 82.6%, and 83.3%, respectively, and reductions of P. cirri of 41.8%, 75.5%, and 77.2%, respectively. Predation on individual age classes was approximately equal in both species, reinforcing previous findings that this predator does not show a preference among age classes. We next presented M. basalis with mixed populations of the two mite species in which there were equal numbers of each species and the density was as in the single species tests. Total mite reduction with both mite species present was 48.5%, 71.9%, and 74.5% at ratios of 1:30, 1:15, and 1:10, respectively; T. kanzawai was reduced by 50.5%, 77.4%, and 79.5%, respectively, and P. cirri was reduced by 44.1%, 60.3%, and 63.2%, respectively. This study suggests that M. basalis has the potential for substantially suppressing populations of both T. kanzawai and P. cirri on papaya at a predator:prey ratio of 1:15 or greater. However, evaluation under realistic agricultural settings is needed before specific recommendations about predator release rates can be made.

While long periodic cycles in population dynamics can make the experimental observation of the indirect effects difficult, modelling the possible effects on an evolutionary tithe scale may provide the much needed information on the potential threats of the invasive species on the ecosystem. Using empirical data from a recent invasion in northernmost Fennoscandia, we applied adaptive dynamics theory and modelled the long term consequences of the invasion by the winter moth into the resident community. Specifically, we investigated the outcome of the observed short-term asymmetric preferences of generalist predators and specialist parasitoids on the long term population dynamics of the invasive winter moth and resident autumnal moth sharing these natural enemies. Our results indicate that coexistence after the invasion is possible. However, the outcome of the indirect interaction on the population dynamics of the moth species was variable and the dynamics might not be persistent on an evolutionary time scale. In addition, the indirect interactions between the two moth species via shared natural enemies were able to cause asynchrony in the population cycles corresponding to field observations from previous sympatric outbreak areas. Therefore, the invasion may cause drastic changes in the resident community, for example by prolonging outbreak periods of birch-feeding moths, increasing the average population densities of the moths or, alternatively, leading to extinction of the resident moth species or to equilibrium densities of the two, formerly cyclic, herbivores.

Studies in systems with multiple predator species have shown that the strength of these interactions may not be predictable and is largely dependent on individual behavioural traits, species density and habitat complexity. Although the association of prey consumption and satiation of a foraging predator has long been recognized, there has been relatively little research on how prey availability affects multiple predators' effects. In this work, we present a framework to investigate the variation in two coexisting/competing predators' effects on prey risk as affected by the prey availability rate. Functional responses by each predator species were first studied in single-predator treatments. Then, the intra- and inter-specific competition was investigated by employing additive and substitutative experimental designs to highlight the nature of multiple effects. Intra- and interspecific interactions were found to be similar and there was risk reduction, and risk enhancement for the prey at intermediate and high levels, respectively, according to the multiplicative risk model (MRM). The results indicated that when similar predators are concerned, the outcomes of MRM may vary according to the functional response curve of these predators. Thus, studies involving a wide range of prey densities are required to explore the nature of interactions. Moreover, this kind of experimental data can contribute to unravelling complexities in theoretical approaches by earlier studies and ultimately promote understanding the effect of multiple predators on prey population regulation.","[Lampropoulos, Panagiotis D.; Fantinou, Argyro A.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Perdikis, Dionyssios Ch.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Agr Zool & Entomol, GR-11855 Athens, Greece","Fantinou, AA (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Lab Ecol & Environm Sci, Iera Odos 75, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.",perdikis@aua.gr; argyr@aua.gr,,,,,,51,17,18,0,74,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1439-1791,1618-0089,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

The mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, commonly stocked into amphibian breeding sites for mosquito control worldwide, has recently been found in some breeding sites of the endangered fire salamander Salamandra infraimmaculata in northern Israel. A comparison of Salamandra larvae in natural pools varying in Gambusia densities suggested that Gambusia negatively affects Salamandra by causing damage to its appendages, in particular, its tailfin (as manifested in a smaller tail:body ratio). Comparison of the same pool before and after mosquitofish introduction suggested strong negative effects on larval performance and number of emerging metamorphs. To explicitly test the hypothesis that Gambusia negatively affects Salamandra larval development, growth and survival, we conducted a replicated outdoor mesocosm experiment. In this experiment, we also tested how habitat structural complexity, in the form of radiating cords simulating artificial vegetation, might mediate damage caused by Gambusia. We used a two-by-two factorial design: the presence or absence of increased structural complexity crossed with the presence or absence of mosquitofish. After a short period, mosquitofish strongly reduced larval wet weight and survival, and increased body damage in the form of a reduced larval tail:body ratio and partially missing gills and limbs. No Salamandra larvae exposed to mosquitofish survived to metamorphosis in either habitat type. We conclude that Gambusia strongly and negatively affects Salamandra larvae and that the introduction of Gambusia into sites containing Salamandra is inconsistent with the goal of preserving this endangered urodele.","[Segev, O.; Blaustein, L.] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Mangel, M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Mangel, M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Stock Assessment, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Segev, O.; Blaustein, L.] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel","Segev, O (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",segevo@research.haifa.ac.il,,,US-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2002-365],"We thank Naomi Hill and Moshe Shalit for help in the field, Tali Yehuda for logistics, Alon Silberbush, Asaf Sadeh, Nir Peleg, Oren Pearlson, Shirli Bar-David, Shai Markman, Burt Kotler, Matt Spencer and Alan Templeton for fruitful discussions, two anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments and Reuven Ortal and others from the Israel Parks and Nature Reserves Authority for permission to conduct this study.

Models aim to predict phytoplankton dynamics based on observed initial conditions and a set of equations and parameters. However, our knowledge about initial conditions in nature is never perfect. Thus, if phytoplankton dynamics are sensitive to small variations in initial conditions, they are difficult to predict. 2. We used time-series data from indoor mesocosm experiments with natural phyto- and zooplankton communities to quantify the extent to which small initial differences in the species, functional group and community biomass in parallel treatments were amplified or buffered over time. We compared the differences in dynamics between replicates and among all mesocosms of 1year. 3. Temperature-sensitive grazing during the exponential growth phase of phytoplankton caused divergence. In contrast, negative density dependence caused convergence. 4. Mean differences in biomass between replicates were similar for all hierarchical levels. This indicates that differences in their initial conditions were amplified to the same extent. Even though large differences in biomass occasionally occurred between replicates for a short time, dynamics returned to the same path at all hierarchical levels. This suggests that internal feedback mechanisms make the spring development of phytoplankton highly predictable.","[Bauer, Barbara; Gaedke, Ursula] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Potsdam, Germany; [Bauer, Barbara; Sommer, Ulrich] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel GEOMAR, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Bauer, B (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel GEOMAR, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",bauerb@uni-potsdam.de,"Bauer, Barbara/AAH-2454-2019","Bauer, Barbara/0000-0003-2688-2788",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinsschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [1162],"The authors thank Stefanie Branscheid for help in organising the data and doing some calculations, Matthijs Vos, Lisette N. de Semerpont Domis and two anonymous referees for stimulating comments on a previous version of the MS, Caolan Kovach-Orr for the improvement of the writing style, and all the people participating in the mesocosm experiments.

The risk of predation may be modified by the scaling between prey and shelter size, which enhances the protective capacity of a reef. We experimentally tested these predictions by manipulating densities of predatory Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus on 8 artificial patch reefs of 2 sizes (small, large) in a large seagrass bed near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. We initially censused patch reefs for 7 mo, after which we randomly selected equivalent numbers of small and large reefs to serve as permanent grouper removal versus control (non-removal) reefs. We continued to census patch reefs for 12 mo after predators were removed from certain reefs. The abundance of predatory Nassau grouper and the size of shelters from predation jointly explained the observed distribution and abundance patterns of spiny lobster and reef fish prey inhabiting artificial patch reef habitats. For example, the abundance of small lobsters was highest in small reefs where Nassau grouper were experimentally removed. When we assessed the effects of predator abundance on all reef fish prey (1 to 10 cm TL), we were unable to detect any significant effects on prey abundance or species diversity due to low statistical power. However, the total abundance and species richness of medium size reef fish (4 to 10 cm TL) was significantly higher in small shelters from which grouper were removed. In comparing species' relative abundances on reefs with low versus high numbers and Nassau grouper, the results indicated that grouper reduce prey abundances in a generalized, non-selective pattern, with no difference in the number of rare versus common prey species that were extirpated. Thus, juvenile Nassau grouper inhabiting certain patch reefs produce a general predatory impact, whereby predation reduces prey abundance and diversity in proportion to the initial relative abundance of prey. Our results support the prediction that at certain scales of space and time, post-settlement predation is a critical determinant of population abundance and species diversity of reef-fish and spiny lobster prey, and that the effect of predation is mediated by the protective capacity of a reef.","VIRGINIA INST MARINE SCI, COLL WILLIAM & MARY, SCH MARINE SCI, GLOUCESTER POINT, VA 23062 USA; OREGON STATE UNIV, HATFIELD MARINE SCI CTR, COLL OCEAN & ATMOSPHER SCI, NEWPORT, OR 97365 USA; CARIBBEAN MARINE RES CTR, EXUMA CAYS, BAHAMAS","Eggleston, DB (corresponding author), N CAROLINA STATE UNIV, DEPT MARINE EARTH & ATMOSPHER SCI, BOX 8208, RALEIGH, NC 27695 USA.",,,"Eggleston, David/0000-0001-7840-2665",,,,80,64,66,1,13,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We used a multidisciplinary approach to explore the mechanisms through which a typical central-place forager, the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) from the Chubut province of Argentina, responds to variations in oceanic conditions and prey resources. We combined habitat and species distribution modeling with isotopic dietary reconstructions based on blood delta 13C and delta 15N values to quantify the role of bathymetry, sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration, abundance of conspecifics, and extent of fisheries activities in explaining the foraging and feeding ecology of individuals breeding at different colonies. The at-sea distribution of penguins was tightly coupled with the spatial distribution of their staple prey species, anchovies (Engraulis anchoita), especially in areas over the continental shelf (>200 m depth), with relatively warm water (from 16 degrees to 21 degrees C), and moderate abundances of conspecifics (from 50 to 250 individuals). Competition with conspecifics and human fisheries were also identified as important factors explaining penguin diet with decreasing relative contributions of anchovies with increasing abundance of conspecifics and fishing activity. Our multifactorial approach allowed us to simultaneously explore different physical, biological and anthropogenic features likely affecting marine resource availability, and, consequently, driving the feeding and foraging ecology of this central-place forager. Our approach can be extended to a large suite of central-place foragers, thus providing important advances in the way we investigate how to effectively conserve and manage these species.","[Ramirez, Francisco; Forero, Manuela G.] CSIC, EBD, Dept Biol Conservac, Seville 41092, Spain; [Afan, Isabel] CSIC, EBD, Lab SIG & Teledetecc, Seville 41092, Spain; [Hobson, Keith A.] Environm Canada, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Bertellotti, Marcelo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Nacl Patagon, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Blanco, Guillermo] CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Ramirez, F (corresponding author), CSIC, EBD, Dept Biol Conservac, Avda Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",ramirez@ebd.csic.es,"Ramirez, Francisco/I-3553-2014; Afan, Isabel/F-4783-2015; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Blanco, Guillermo/L-3170-2014; Bertellotti, Marcelo/I-6200-2019","Ramirez, Francisco/0000-0001-9670-486X; Afan, Isabel/0000-0003-3874-0461; Blanco, Guillermo/0000-0001-5742-4929; Bertellotti, Marcelo/0000-0002-1834-7788",EcoGenes project [264125],"We thank Fundacion Patagonia Natural and staff of Natural Reserves of Chubut Province by the logistic support during fieldworks.

Part of this complexity occurs because many species change their behavior and morphology with different predators and competitors and, thus, change their per-capita interaction rates (i.e. trait-mediated interactions). Our objective was to use a simple experimental community of two predators (larval dragonflies, Anax longipes, and larval salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum), two prey (larval green frogs, Rana clamitans, and larval bullfrogs, R. catesbeiana), and a shared prey resource to determine whether we can predict interactions in a reassembled community by combining our knowledge of density- and trait-mediated interactions,. We combined pairwise laboratory experiments on predation rates and predator-induced behaviors with a mesocosm experiment to examine density- and trait-mediated effects. We used a factorial combination of no predators, caged Anax (to induce anti-predator traits without changing prey density), and lethal Anax crossed with no predators, caged Ambystoma, and lethal Amkystoina. The species interactions in the reassembled community were qualitatively predictable based on the pairwise experiments. Lethal Anax preyed upon Ambystoma and green frogs while lethal Ambystoma only preyed upon green frogs. Anax also reduced the activity of the green frogs; this caused a decrease in salamander predation on green frogs, a decrease in green frog acquisition of resources, and an increase in bullfrog acquisition of resources. Ambystoma had no effect on green frog activity, no effect on resource acquisition by green frogs, and no effect on resource acquisition by bullfrogs. These results suggest that we can better understand how species interact in natural communities if we have a more detailed understanding of trait-mediated mechanisms. However, if predicting the structure of large communities requires identifying how each species alters its traits in the presence of all other species along with altering density, improving our predictive ability may be a prohibitively large undertaking.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,70,45,47,0,29,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2002,131,4,,,,,569,579,,10.1007/s00442-002-0910-z,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,562UU,WOS:000176218000012,28547552,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

The successful regeneration often hinges on bamboo dieback after mass flowering or small-scale disturbances that remove the understory cover and create open sites suitable for seed germination and growth. We conducted a field experiment with repeated observations of emergence and survival of tree seedlings in undisturbed Sasa senanensis understory and experimental gaps simulating different disturbance events to determine mechanisms of bamboo interference with tree seedling regeneration. The experiments were repeated in four sites to test if seedling emergence was related to differences in site overstory composition and thus to differential seed input. Very few seedlings germinated under the Sasa layer and also few seedlings emerged in microsites where the Sasa above-ground biomass was removed but litter left intact. Only severe disturbance that exposed soil led to a significant increase in the number of seedlings. Smaller-seeded species with longer-distance seed dispersal such as Betula spp. and Abies sachalinensis were generally more abundant than larger-seeded species such as Quercus mongolica and Acer mono. The mechanism by which Sasa cover reduced seedling emergence was not uniform among tree species: emergence of smaller-seeded species - Betula spp, Abies sachalinensis and Picea glehnii - is reduced primarily by low levels of soil exposure, Acer mono emergence appears to be related to the reduced light level under Sasa cover, emergence of Kalopanax pictus and Phellodendron amurense is reduced by high litter production of Sasa, and Quercus mongolica suffered a high level of seed predation. The fact that seedlings of different species responded in different ways to particular treatments shows the importance of the regeneration niche for the maintenance of species diversity. The importance of bamboo understory as an ecological filter that shapes the future canopy composition and structure through differentially influencing tree species establishment is discussed.","[Dolezal, J.] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Dept Funct Ecol, Inst Bot, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Dolezal, J.] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Matsuki, S.] Iwate Univ, Fac Agr, Morioka, Iwate 020, Japan; [Hara, T.] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan","Dolezal, J (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republic, Dept Funct Ecol, Inst Bot, Dukelska 135, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic.",dolezal@butbn.cas.cz,"Hara, Toshihiko/D-8016-2012; Dolezal, Jiri/H-1583-2014","Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051","MONBUSHO; GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [206/05/0119, IAA600050802]","We thank L.

We report results of a direct experimental test of the dependence of animal diversity on plant diversity. We sampled arthropods in a well-replicated grassland experiment in which plant species richness and plant functional richness were directly manipulated. In simple regressions, both the number of species planted (log(2) transformed) and the number of functional groups planted significantly increased arthropod species richness but not arthropod abundance. However, the number of species planted was the only significant predictor of arthropod species richness when both predictor variables were included in ANOVAs or a MANOVA. Although highly significant, arthropod species richness regressions had low R-2 values, high intercepts (24 arthropod species in monocultures), and shallow slopes. Analyses of relations among plants and arthropod trophic groups indicated that herbivore diversity was influenced by plant, parasite, and predator diversity. Furthermore, herbivore diversity was more strongly correlated with parasite and predator diversity than with plant diversity. Together with regression results, this suggests that, although increasing plant diversity significantly increased arthropod diversity, local herbivore diversity is also maintained by, and in turn maintains, a diversity of parasites and predators.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Utah State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Siemann, E (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",siemann@ruf.rice.edu,,,,,,96,415,455,12,340,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

These effects can be of conservation concern when an introduced predator constrains the foraging behaviour of a threatened species, and therefore its access to resources. We examined the spatial response of foraging in endangered brush-tailed rock-wallabies to predation risk and food while taking into account the potentially competitive role of sympatric herbivores. We compared the occurrence (presence/absence) of rock-wallaby faecal pellets to the availability of edible vegetation, presence of sympatric macropods and predation risk factors such as distance from refuge and presence of shelter points. Rock-wallabies managed predation risk by foraging closer to their refuge and more often at shelter points. They foraged more where edible vegetation was higher, but only in the absence of predators and sympatric macropods, indicating that rock-wallaby foraging is restricted by their interactions with other species. The constraints on foraging behaviour demonstrated in this study can be used to guide management strategies aimed at conserving rock-wallaby populations.","[Tuft, K. D.; Crowther, M.

Despite possible threats that include predation of and competition with indigenous species, habitat degradation, and the spread of diseases and parasites, there is a lack of knowledge regarding its ecology and population dynamics within invaded systems. This study presents a mark-recapture experiment to investigate its population structure, natural mortality rate, population size and density within a population inhabiting a small, 76 ha invaded water supply reservoir in the temperate Eastern Cape region, South Africa. The adult population was found to be old ((x) over bar = 12.0 +/- 2.9 years) and male-dominated (1.76 male:1 female for fish < 100 cm TL and 3.77 male: 1 female for fish > 100 cm TL) with its maximum age estimated at one year less than the age of the reservoir. Adult abundance and density (in terms of numbers and biomass) was relatively low at 1655 fish (CV = 18%), 94.32 kg/ha (CV = 18%) and 21.78 fish/ha (CV = 16%), respectively. The estimated mean natural mortality rate was high at 0.80/year (CV = 82%). The skewed length- and age-structure suggests that the adult population is dominated by the fish that were either the initial colonizers during the reservoir filling phase or were the first internally reproduced recruits. The predominance of old, large fish in the population is also probably suppressing recruitment of younger fish. Despite the population being small, the fish are mobile and feed aggressively. Manual removal using baited longlines could be a feasible removal method.","[Booth, Anthony J.; Traas, Graham R. L.; Weyl, Olaf L.

We showed that red wood ants essentially influence spatial distribution of ground beetles on their common territories. Transplantation experiments suggest that in newly established ants' settlements stronger forms of interrelations arise than in old stable colony. To examine the ability of beetles to avoid collisions with ants we used two experimental techniques. In laboratory, we tested carabids ability to avoid a clash in a Y-shaped labyrinth containing an active tethered ant in one section. In field experiments we compared quantitative characteristics of movements (such as crookedness of individual trajectories, speed of movement, the time spent on stops) for beetles placed close to ants foraging routes and on ant-free plots. All beetles studied displayed a clear tendency to learn, that is, to modity their behavior in order to avoid collisions with ants. Species that exhibited best parameters of teaming were closer to ants by their size and characteristic movement, namely, Pterostichus oblogopunctatus and P. magus. Beetles' stereotyped behavioral tactics can be considered universal for avoiding collisions with any subject (for instance, with an ant) of a certain size and speed of movements. A set of tactics in the labyrinth included: (1) attempts to round the ant; (2) turns away after touching the ant with antennae; (3) turns away without a contact; (4) avoidances of a dangerous section; (5) stops near the ant with the antennae hidden. Comparing pairwise difference between four species shows that beetles use species-specific preference for definite combinations of tactics. Effective teaming allows carabids to penetrate into ant foraging territory and partly avoide interference competition. It seems that red wood ants are not inclined to learn to avoid collisions with competing carabid species. Instead, they recognize an enemy's image and selectively attack relatively small predatory carabids rather than herbivorous species. Experiments with dummy beetles suggest that ants react for several hierarchically organized key characteristics of competitors such as speed of movement, dark color, bilateral symmetry, protuberances (legs, antennae), and smell. Among professional groups in ant family, guards and hunters react to beetles aggressively, whereas aphid tenders ignore them. Sophisticated combination of flexible and innate behavioral patterns enables insects to share territories and interact in the mode of relatively mild, spatial, competition instead of predation. Eliciting sets of hierarchically organized features of competitors that govern adjustment of spatial distribution in insects' community enable us to integrate ideas of classic and cognitive ethology.","Novosibirsk State Univ, Inst Anim Systemat & Ecol, Novosibirsk 63009, Russia","Dorosheva, EA (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Inst Anim Systemat & Ecol, Ul Frunze 11, Novosibirsk 63009, Russia.",zhanna@reznikova.net,,,,,,54,5,5,0,16,MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA,MOSCOW,"39 DIMITROVA UL., MOSCOW, 113095, RUSSIA",0044-4596,,,ZH OBSHCH BIOL,Zhurnal Obshchei Biol.,SEP-OCT,2006,67,5,,,,,344,360,,,,,17,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,096BG,WOS:000241351400003,17100097,,,,2021-09-27,

Tritrophic interactions among plants, herbivores and predators are expected to be influenced by the surrounding vegetation. Neighbouring plants can influence focal plant colonisation by herbivorous insects and the foraging behaviour of natural enemies, such as insectivorous birds. 2. The aim of the experiment was to disentangle the interactive effects of neighbouring plants and avian predation on arthropod abundance and insect leaf damage in oak tree seedlings, using exclusion cages and vegetation removal. 3. The presence or removal of surrounding herbaceous vegetation differentially mediated top-down effects of insectivorous birds on distinct arthropod guilds and herbivore damage in seedlings. Avian predation reduced sawfly larval abundance regardless of the presence of plant neighbours; lepidopteran larval abundance only when plant neighbours were removed; and spider abundance only when plant neighbours were left intact. The removal of plant neighbours increased prey accessibility for foraging insectivorous birds and decreased chewer damage on seedlings. The density of concealed-feeder insects (leaf miners) increased with plant neighbour removal and when seedlings were less damaged by chewer guild, suggesting intraguild competition. 4. These results highlight the strong indirect effects of neighbouring vegetation on tritrophic interactions involving a focal plant species, its associated herbivores and the upper trophic level of predators.","[Giffard, Brice; Corcket, Emmanuel] Univ Bordeaux, UMR 1202, BIOGECO, Talence, France; [Barbaro, Luc; Jactel, Herve] INRA, BIOGECO, UMR 1202, Cestas, France","Giffard, B (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux 1, UMR 1202, BIOGECO, Batiment B2,Ave Fac, F-33405 Talence, France.",brice.giffard@gmail.com,,"Giffard, Brice/0000-0003-4367-1245",European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [226299],"We thank A.

Mantid cohorts within the normal range of emergence from a single egg mass were established in a replicated, well-controlled open field experiment. On the scale of the progeny from a single female, density-dependent food limitation caused mortality and ontogenetic asynchrony to increase with increasing density. All cohorts converged to a common level of abundance and biomass because both development rate and population size declined with increasing initial density. Numbers and biomass of other arthropods generally declined with increasing initial density of mantids, although there were both positive and negative effects on different taxa. The abundance of hemipterans (almost exclusively herbivorous mirids) increased in the presence of mantids; this was an indirect effect as large in magnitude as any of the direct reductions in abundance of other taxa. Per capita interaction strengths of mantids on most taxa generally were weak except for the strong positive interaction with hemipterans. In spite of different mantid development rates among treatments, predator load (proportion of arthropod biomass present as predators) for all three treatments, attributable mainly to mantid biomass, converged to approximately five times control level by the end of the experiment. The differences in predator loads between control and treatment plots thus may represent different levels of predator saturation: one for control plots, where predator load was constant over time and in which generalists contributed relatively little to predator biomass, and a higher one for treatment plots, in which generalists comprised the bulk of predator biomass. Predator load may therefore be an indicator of the relative importance of generalist vs. specialist predators in terrestrial arthropod assemblages.","UNIV DELAWARE, SCH LIFE SCI, PROGRAM ECOL & EVOLUT, NEWARK, DE 19716 USA",,,,,,,,69,88,91,0,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1994,75,7,,,,,2022,2032,,10.2307/1941607,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PK129,WOS:A1994PK12900017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Because food is generally limited in natural environments, it is typically assumed that increasing animal density leads to reduced individual fitness through food depletion or monopolization. However, recent work demonstrates that density dependence can occur without apparent food depletion, or with virtually unlimited resources, suggesting that other mechanisms must also be important. Alternatively, density-dependent regulation could be achieved through increasing energy costs rather than decreasing food abundance. The relative importance of these two processes (food depletion and energy costs) and their underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we manipulated the density of juvenile stream-dwelling brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in three neighboring populations over two consecutive summers to relate food availability and consumption to density-dependent growth, survival, and their trade-off. Despite strong patterns of density dependence and evidence of food limitation, increasing fish density did not lead to detectable prey depletion in the environment. Instead, behavioral observations suggested that increasing densities resulted in higher energetic costs, primarily via increasing interference competition and the use of less suitable foraging microhabitats. These results highlight that animal populations may be regulated by density dependence without necessarily impacting prey communities.","[Matte, Jean-Michel O.; Fraser, Dylan J.; Grant, James W.

We predicted that food-patch utilization by House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), a widespread human commensal, would be less sensitive to variation in predation risk than that of Spanish Sparrows (P. hispaniolensis), its nonurban counterpart. We applied the giving-up density (GUD) method to quantify patch use behavior of the two species with respect to distance from shelter. Our results indicated that Spanish Sparrows perceived a steep gradient of increased predation cost with increasing distance from shelter, while House Sparrows seemed indifferent to distance from shelter. These results support the hypothesis that the cost of predation has less effect on the foraging behavior of urban than nonurban birds, although alternative explanations include differences between species in the degree of neophobia, or variations in their ability to assess predation risk.","[Tsurim, Ido; Abramsky, Zvika] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Tsurim, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",tsurim@bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,37,9,10,0,65,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,NOV,2008,110,4,,,,,772,776,,10.1525/cond.2008.8572,,,5,Ornithology,Zoology,393PQ,WOS:000262385600019,,,,,2021-09-27,

We conducted two manipulative field experiments in the soft-bottom intertidal zone during 19901991 in eastern Maine to assess effects of predation, intraspecific competition, and initial planting size on the survival and growth of cultured individuals of Mya. Experiment I (23 June 1990 to 13 June 1991) tested interactive effects of two planting sizes (small=8.5 mm shell length (SL); large=11.8 mm SL) and protective netting on fate and growth of clams. Animals of each size were added to separate experimental units within each of 60 1-m(2) areas delimited by a wooden box. To deter predators, 50 boxes were covered with a specific type of plastic netting that differed in aperture size (4.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mm) and degree of rigidity (flexible vs. extruded) while 10 boxes served as controls (without netting). Small clams grew at a faster rate than large clams, but both added approximately 18 mm of new shell by the end of the study. Growth was unaffected by netting size and rigidity, but 13% more clams were recovered alive after a year in protected vs. unprotected treatments (84% vs. 71%). Survival was independent of netting type. The presence of netting resulted in nearly a 3 x enhancement of wild spat (<15 mm SL) compared to unprotected controls (568.8+/-24.4 vs. 199.6+/-22.8 m(-2)). This result suggests that the decline of wild stocks in eastern Maine may not be related to recruitment failure, but to post-settlement events, such as predation, which remove clams from the intertidal. In Experiment II (15 April to 6 October 1991), clam (14.6+/-0.2 mm SL) density was manipulated across four levels from 333 to 2664 m(-2) in protected (extruded netting, 12.8 mm aperture) and unprotected 1-m(2) boxes. Survival within unprotected boxes was independent of stocking density (79%), but was inversely density-dependent in protected boxes (77% in the lowest density treatment increasing to a mean of 88% in the other three treatments). A negative cubic relationship explained the effect of density on growth. We present the first mariculture strategy for public stock enhancement or private entrepreneurs interested in rearing M. arenaria in Maine and the northeast US. Hatchery-reared juveniles 8-10 mm SL should be planted in the spring near or below mid tide levels at densities between 333 and 666 m(-2) and protected with flexible netting (6.4 mm aperture) raised several centimeters above the sediment surface. Netting should be removed from mud flats in the late fall before the threat of ice and severe winter storms. Animals should attain sizes between 25 and 30 mm SL during this time and reach a size refuge from burrowing and other predators. Growth to legal, commercial size (50.8 mm SL) should take another 2-4 years depending on geographic location and mean seawater temperature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The relative importance of these two types of processes can vary across ecological systems and across temporal and spatial scales. Numerous empirical studies have explored spatial patterns resulting from extrinsic and intrinsic processes, however the interaction of these two types of processes can result in complex patterns that are difficult to test. We used a unique model system consisting of periphytic algae grown on agar in an experimental stream to manipulate an extrinsic and an intrinsic process. We manipulated an extrinsic process by varying the spatial arrangement of nutrients creating both heterogeneous and homogeneous environments for the algae. We manipulated an intrinsic process by introducing a snail herbivore to the system. The resulting spatial algal patterns showed that both types of processes were important in producing spatial abundance patterns and that the patterns occurred at two distinct spatial scales in our system. At the scale of the imposed nutrient heterogeneity, algae tracked the differences in nutrient supply rates. The snail herbivores both reduced and promoted spatial patterns in algal abundance at different spatial scales reflecting their species-specific foraging behavior. An ability to detect differences in algal abundance allowed the snails to reduce the power of patterns at the scale of the imposed nutrient heterogeneity; however below a spatial scale of approximately 30 mm the snails could no longer detect differences in algal abundance and so foraged randomly. At this spatial scale the spatial heterogeneity in algal abundance increased and the resulting algal patterns were relatively spatially fixed through time. We suggest that this relative constancy may arise in part from a detected weak Allee effect in algal growth rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this non-native environment, the species has flourished and has become the dominant apex predator on many reefs. In the present study, a comparison of non-native populations of C. argus in the MHI with native populations in Moorea showed that mean total length (32.0 vs. 26.9 cm), mass (722 vs. 326 g), growth, and body condition were each significantly elevated in the MHI. In addition, while an ontogenetic shift towards larger prey occurred in both locations, it was faster and more consistent in Moorea than in the MHI. As a result, while small C. argus of comparable size in the 2 locations consumed similar-sized prey, large C. argus in Moorea consumed significantly longer and deeper-bodied prey than their counterparts in the MHI. This pattern was unrelated to the size distributions of available prey and may thus reflect stronger intra-and interspecific competition for small prey in Moorea. Although ecological release in a broader sense (i.e. a combination of predator release, parasite release, and competitive release) may play a role, the most direct explanation for the observed differences between C. argus in native habitats in Moorea (with many competing grouper species) and non-native habitats in the MHI (few competitors) would be competitive release (here used in the sense of benefits resulting from the reduction of interspecific competition).","[Meyer, Amanda L.; Dierking, Jan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Dierking, J (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Marine Sci IFM GEOMAR, Evolutionary Ecol Marine Fishes Grp, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",jdierking@ifm-geomar.de,"Dierking, Jan/C-5170-2014","Dierking, Jan/0000-0002-4660-6919",Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l'Environnement (CRIOBE); National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA05NOS4261157]; University of Hawaii Arts and Sciences Advisory Council; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Fulbright Program,"We are grateful to C.

Using a fully-factorial field experiment, we examined the relative importance of all three of these factors to the six most common insect herbivore species utilizing this host plant in a West Central Florida coastal habitat. The presence of ants affected more herbivore species than either early-season herbivory by larval T. bacharidis or nitrogen enrichment. Experimental reductions of L. humile resulted in reductions of an aphid, its coccinellid predators, and adult T. bacharidis, and increases of two species of leafminers and one species of stemborer. Due to the strong negative effects of stemborer herbivory on host plant survival, the increase in stemborer abundance led to increased host plant mortality. Early-season herbivory by larval T. bacharidis only affected the abundance of aphids and their predators, both of which were more abundant on trees with reduced early-season herbivory. Nitrogen fertilization had the most limited effects and only T. bacharidis larvae achieved higher densities on fertilized trees. Our results indicate that aphid tending by the exotic L. humile affects other insects on B. halimifolia more so than herbivory by the exploitative competitor T. bacharidis or nitrogen as a limiting nutrient.","[Altfeld, Laura] Eckerd Coll, Div Nat Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33711 USA; [Stiling, Peter] Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Altfeld, L (corresponding author), Eckerd Coll, Div Nat Sci, 4200 54th Ave S, St Petersburg, FL 33711 USA.",laura@altfeld.com; pstiling@cas.usf.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 03-15190],"We thank Sylvia Lukasiewicz for help with field work, Robert Browning and Jim Wilson at Fort De Soto Park for use of the field site.

We present the first effort, to our knowledge, describing a comprehensive ecological network that includes all known trophic and diverse non-trophic links among >100 coexisting species for the marine rocky intertidal community of the central Chilean coast. Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions exhibit highly nonrandom structures both alone and with respect to food web structure. The occurrence of different types of interactions, relative to all possible links, was well predicted by trophic structure and simple traits of the source and target species. In this community, competition for space and positive interactions related to habitat/refuge provisioning by sessile and/or basal species were by far the most abundant non-trophic interactions. If these patterns are corroborated in other ecosystems, they may suggest potentially important dynamic constraints on the combined architecture of trophic and non-trophic interactions. The nonrandom patterning of non-trophic interactions suggests a path forward for developing a more comprehensive ecological network theory to predict the functioning and resilience of ecological communities.","[Kefi, Sonia] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS, IRD, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Kefi, Sonia; Brose, Ulrich] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Berlow, Eric L.] Vibrant Data Inc, San Francisco, CA 94121 USA; [Wieters, Evie A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Wieters, Evie A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Marine Conservat, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Wieters, Evie A.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Biol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Joppa, Lucas N.] Microsoft Res, Computat Ecol & Environm Sci, Cambridge CB1 2FB, England; [Wood, Spencer A.] Univ Washington, Nat Capital Project, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Kefi, S (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS, IRD, CC 065,Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France.",Sonia.kefi@univ-montp2.fr,"Brose, Ulrich/AAT-7547-2020; Wood, Spencer A/A-3603-2009; Brose, Ulrich/I-3488-2014","Brose, Ulrich/0000-0001-9156-583X; Kefi, Sonia/0000-0002-9678-7770","Alexander von Humboldt foundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1120158, 1130167]; Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo [ICM-P10-033F]","A countless number of colleagues, students and postdocs have collaborated over the past decades in unveiling the myriad of fascinating species interactions that conforms the basis of this contribution.

Species richness of butterflies in general and the proportion of monophagous species in particular increase with fragment size. Habitat fragmentation disrupts plant-pollinator and predator-prey interactions in some cases. No evidence for changes in the outcome of competitive interactions exists for insects. Habitat connectivity increases inter-patch movement and population density and decreases extinction risk. Habitat quality changes with succession and management. Depending on life-history traits, insect species may profit from early, mid or late successional stages of calcareous grasslands. We conclude from the few well-designed and replicated studies that there is a bias towards modelling approaches and small-scale fragmentation experiments, so more large-scale studies on a community level are needed to quantify the functional roles of insects and their dependence on fragmented calcareous grasslands in the landscape mosaic.

A small proportion of these introduced species become invasive, causing a range of impacts in the receiving community. It is therefore important to evaluate the patterns of which species become invasive and which strategies are most successful in managing them. This review assesses the distribution, abundance, impact and management of the invasive Vespidae worldwide. We identified 34 vespid species known to be introduced around the world, but the seven most invasive species are all eusocial. Most introduced Vespidae only occur in one or two countries, but some areas have become geographic hotspots of invasion: Hawaii (15 species), North America (eight species), New Zealand (five species), Australia (four species) and South America (four species). Two invasive species, Vespula vulgaris and V. germanica have become particularly widespread and abundant with a range of impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function. Other successful invasive species include several Polistes spp., which affect local biodiversity through direct predation or competition for food or space. Toxic baiting has been the most successful control strategy against invasive vespids to date, although this has mostly been small scale experimental management as it has proved difficult to develop commercial control products. Development of shelf-stable lures or baits combined with suitable toxins or pathogens could overcome some of the commercial impediments. Several attempts at biological control using parasitoids have not successfully reduced invasive wasp populations, although the biocontrol agent has only established in one case. The social structure of colonies and their high reproductive efficiency have facilitated invasion by these species, but it also means management at the population level will be difficult. This emphasises the need to prevent such invasions from occurring in the first place.","[Beggs, Jacqueline R.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Beggs, Jacqueline R.] Univ Auckland, Joint Grad Sch Biodivers & Biosecur, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Brockerhoff, Eckehard G.] Scion New Zealand Forest Res Inst, Christchurch 8540, New Zealand; [Corley, Juan C.; Masciocchi, Maite] INTA EEA Bariloche, CONICET, Grp Ecol Insectos, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Kenis, Marc] CABI Europe Switzerland, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland; [Muller, Franck; Rome, Quentin; Villemant, Claire] Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR OSEB 7205, Dept Systemat & Evolut, F-75005 Paris, France","Beggs, JR (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",j.beggs@auckland.ac.nz,"Masciocchi, Maite/K-3378-2019; Beggs, Jacqueline R/I-3796-2014; Rome, Quentin/AAD-1870-2019; Brockerhoff, Eckehard Gustav/C-1528-2009","Beggs, Jacqueline R/0000-0002-2112-2803; Rome, Quentin/0000-0002-7055-8064; Brockerhoff, Eckehard Gustav/0000-0002-5962-3208; Corley, Juan/0000-0002-8032-2223; Masciocchi, Maite/0000-0002-0095-2170","University of Auckland; New Zealand's Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [C02X0501]; Better Border Biosecurity (B3) programme; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas), ArgentinaConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); France AgriMer; Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite; Ministere de l'Ecologie, du Developpement Durable, de l'Energie et du Logement (MEDDTL)","J.

Coexistence of predators that share the same prey is common. This is still the case in size-structured predator communities where predators consume prey species of different sizes (interspecific prey responses) or consume different size classes of the same species of prey (intraspecific prey responses). A mechanism has recently been proposed to explain coexistence between predators that differ in size but share the same prey species, emergent facilitation, which is dependent on strong intraspecific responses from one or more prey species. Under emergent facilitation, predators can depend on each other for invasion, persistence or success in a size-structured prey community. Experimental evidence for intraspecific size-structured responses in prey populations remains rare, and further questions remain about direct interactions between predators that could prevent or limit any positive effects between predators [e.g. intraguild predation (IGP)]. Here, we provide a community-wide experiment on emergent facilitation including natural predators. We investigate both the direct interactions between two predators that differ in body size (fish vs. invertebrate predator), and the indirect interaction between them via their shared prey community (zooplankton). Our evidence supports the most likely expectation of interactions between differently sized predators that IGP rates are high, and interspecific interactions in the shared prey community dominate the response to predation (i.e. predator-mediated competition). The question of whether emergent facilitation occurs frequently in nature requires more empirical and theoretical attention, specifically to address the likelihood that its pre-conditions may co-occur with high rates of IGP.","[ten Brink, Hanna; Mazumdar, Abul Kalam Azad; Huddart, Joseph; Persson, Lennart; Cameron, Tom C.] Umea Univ, S-90742 Umea, Sweden; [Cameron, Tom C.] Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England","Cameron, TC (corresponding author), Umea Univ, S-90742 Umea, Sweden.",tcameron@essex.ac.uk,"Brink, Hanna ten/R-3606-2019; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012; Cameron, Tom/H-9555-2012","Brink, Hanna ten/0000-0001-6772-7229; Cameron, Tom/0000-0002-5875-1494",Marie Curie Intra-European FellowshipEuropean Commission [275873]; Erasmus; Umea University,"This work was funded by a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship to TCC (FANTI-SIZE, 275873), Erasmus travel grants (HTB, JH) and by Umea University (LP, MAKA).

Management should be based on substantial scientific studies and the state's ability to implement these. In Brazil, the surface longline fishery has been in existence since the 1950s, and remains of great economic importance. This study analyzes 179 legal instruments (1934-2014), divided into restrictive, administrative and promotional, comparing with catches landed (1996-2011). The results show that there was a complete disrespect for the regulations, wherein fleets continued landing prohibited or size limited species, such as Kajikia albida, Makaira nigricans, Alopias superciliosus, A. vulpinus, Carcharhinus longimanus, Galeorhinus galeus and Xiphias gladius. Furthermore, divergent regulatory provisions have hindered understanding/implementation of regulations by all those involved. Being a country of continental proportions and with different longline fisheries along the coast, conducting scientific studies and the development of normative approaches becomes a huge challenge. In a dynamic activity such as fishing, the constant review of these regulations will allow fisheries management to become more accurate and in accordance with the aspirations of the different interests involved. Despite the surface longline fishery having operated for 60 years in Brazil, the existence of incongruous laws makes the management and control of this activity incompatible with the conservation of species. The lack of regulations governing this fishery creates a gap, increasing the risk of extinction of species (target and bycatch) and the future collapse of this activity.","[Fiedler, Fernando N.; Port, Dagoberto] Univ Vale Itajai UNIVALI, Programa Pos Grad Ciencia & Tecnol Ambiental PPCT, Rua Uruguai 458, BR-88302202 Itajai, SC, Brazil; [Giffoni, Bruno B.] Fundacao Pro TAMAR, Rua Antonio Athanazio da Silva 273, BR-11680000 Ubatuba, SP, Brazil; [Sales, Gilberto] Ctr TAMAR ICMBio, Av Ministro Victor Konder 374, BR-88301700 Itajai, SC, Brazil; [Fiedler, Fernando N.] Ctr Nacl Pesquisa & Conservacao Biodiversidade Ma, Av Ministro Victor Konder 374, BR-88301700 Itajai, SC, Brazil; [Fisch, Fabian] Ctr Univ FACVEST UNIFACVEST, Av Marechal Floriano 947, BR-88501103 Lages, SC, Brazil","Fiedler, FN (corresponding author), Ctr Nacl Pesquisa & Conservacao Biodiversidade Ma, Av Ministro Victor Konder 374, BR-88301700 Itajai, SC, Brazil.",fnfiedler@hotmail.com,"de Barros Giffoni, Bruno/AAT-7020-2020; Port, Dagoberto/C-3311-2011; Fisch, Fabiane/H-3405-2013; Fisch, Fabiane/E-9849-2018","Port, Dagoberto/0000-0003-3909-7957; Fisch, Fabiane/0000-0002-9011-7020; Fisch, Fabiane/0000-0002-9011-7020",Coordenagdo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior CAPES - Brasil,"The authors thank the owners, captains and fishermen of the pelagic longline vessels who provided valuable information to the field staff and all onboard observers of GEP-UNIVALI and Projeto TAMAR that made this study possible.

A total of 25,749 individuals were collected, comprising 46 species. Amphipods were best represented in the total number of species (32) and individuals (89% of numerical abundance) followed by isopods (12 species and 11% abundance) and tanaids (2 species and 1%). The highest number of species was registered in intermediate levels (1-1.5 m) dominated by Corallina elongata, although the highest abundances of peracarids were associated to seaweeds of lower levels (0-1 m) such as Gelidium corneum, Osmundea pinnatifida, Valonia utricularis and a turf of Caufacanthus ustulatus. The most abundant peracarids, Hyale stebbingi, H. schmidti, H. perieri, Stenothoe monoculoides. Caprella penantis, C. grandimana, Dynamene edwardsii and Ischyromene lacazei, were present throughout the whole year during 2006 and 2007. The highest peracarid densities were measured in April-August coinciding with the highest development of seaweeds, just before the maximum values of water temperature measured at the end of summer. Multivariate analyses confirmed a clear zonation of algae and associated peracarids in a vertical gradient, which was maintained stable during the two-year study. Several physical and biological factors may regulate such patterns of peracarid abundance and future experimental studies are necessary to explore the importance of factors such as competition, predation or weather conditions.

Here we provide quantitative data using a sensitive stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry procedure with microcosms on species interactions in the fungal pathway. We measured N-15 and C-13 enrichment in microarthropods through grazing rare isotope enriched fungal mycelia. Experimental treatments were various combinations of 1, 2, 3, 4 microarthropods species. We used three fungivores (the collembolan Lepidocyrtus curvicollis, the Astigmata Tyrophagus putrescentiae, the Oribatida Oribatula tibialis), and the Mesostigmata predator Hypoaspis acquilifer. We collected individuals of each species separately, as well as their feces, and molt where available. All three fungivorous microarthropods consumed significantly more than their own body weight per day. The three fungivores differed in their consumption of the mycelium as it was not equally palatable to each. The Mesostigmata predator Hypoaspis also differed in its microarthropod prey preference. In multiple species combinations microarthropod behavioral interactions modified consumption and predation rates. Our selection of mites of different sizes, with varied preference for the mycelium, combined with differing predation rates on each mite, demonstrate that even three trophic level interactions with only five interacting species are not predictably simple. The interpretation of the stable isotope results and consumed-excreted weights indicate that: (a) behavior and microscopic observations should not be ignored in competition-predation interactions, and (b) functional guilds can take advantage of more diverse food opportunities. The reality of mixed diets complicates functional guild assignments that are reflected in N-15 and C-13 isotope levels at natural abundances in the environment. Microcosm experiments with this sensitive technique can help decipher the interpretation of rare isotope natural abundance values, as well as providing measured consumption, growth, and excretion rate values for modeling soil food web interactions.","[Crotty, Felicity, V; Adl, Sina M.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Soil Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada","Adl, SM (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Soil Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",sina.adl@usask.ca,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [249889],This work was supported through NSERC grant 249889 to SA.,,63,6,6,0,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Dicyphus errans (Wolff) (Hemiptera: Miridae) is a generalist omnivorous predator that commonly occurs in tomato greenhouses and field crops in the Mediterranean basin. In this work cannibalism among same-aged neonate nymphs of D. errans was studied when 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 individuals were placed in a Petri dish along with or without heterospecific prey. Although nymphs were unable to complete their development in the absence of prey they survived longer when there were initially 2 individuals per dish than in any other treatment including a single individual. This may indicate that cannibalism in this predator has positive effect on nymphal survival, which however was not the case at higher densities. The presence of heterospecific prey increased nymphal survival and individuals were as equally successful in completing their development as when kept singly. Developmental time in all the treatments was very similar. Adult weight of both females and males was significantly greater when a nymph was reared alone and similar in all the other treatments. The results indicate that cannibalism occurs among neonates of D. errans if heterospecific prey is scarce and has a negative effect on adult weight when heterospecific prey is abundant.

These hormones also mediate physiological and behavioral responses to stressful events, allowing individuals to cope with stressors. Various environmental insults, such as a food shortages, predation attempts, and agonistic encounters often elevate plasma glucocorticoid levels in vertebrates. Because exposure to maternally-derived (via circulation or egg) glucocorticoids may be detrimental to the developing embryo, maternal stress can have negative carryover effects on offspring fitness. We examined corticosterone, the primary avian glucocorticoid, concentrations in egg yolk in a plural-breeding, joint-nesting species, the smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani), in which females compete among themselves to lay eggs in the final incubated clutch. We investigated whether yolk corticosterone levels varied with laying order and group size. Because egg-laying competition leads to physiological and social stress that is intensified with group size and laying order, we predicted that yolk corticosterone levels should increase from the early to the late egg-laying period and from single female to multi-female groups. In this two-year field study, we found that yolk corticosterone levels of late-laid eggs within the communal clutch were higher in multi-female groups than in single female groups. Results from this study suggest that laying females experience higher levels of stress in multi-female groups and that this maternal stress influences yolk corticosterone concentrations. This study identifies a novel cost of group-living in plural-breeding cooperatively breeding birds, namely an increase in yolk corticosterone levels with group size that may result in detrimental effects on offspring development.

A wild bruchid seed-predator, Kytorhinus sharpianus, has a complex life cycle consisting of bi- and trivoltinism on a wild leguminous plant, Sophola flavescens. Observations of adults showed significant female-biased sex ratios (from 1:2 to 1:6) for nine generations over 4 years. 2. To investigate the potential effects of larval competition on the sex ratio, we altered the number of hatched eggs per seed and counted emergent males and females under laboratory conditions. Although only one adult could emerge per seed, the ratio of the females that emerged increased with the number of hatched eggs per seed. However, the sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1 in the case of one hatched egg per seed. 3. We dissected seeds bearing two hatched eggs at regular intervals, and classified the surviving and the dead larvae according to their developmental stage. Over time, one larva within each seed always survived, while the other larva died from the second to fourth instar before the seed resource became exhausted. 4. In order to study the effects of the difference in the stages of two larvae in a seed on the emergence sex ratio, we manipulated intervals between the first and second ovipositions in the laboratory. As the difference in developmental stages of the two larvae increased, the closer to 1:1 the emergence sex ratio became. 5. Field observations, however, showed that about 60% of infested seeds were bored by only one K. sharpianus larva. This suggests that female dominance in larval competition within a seed may be relatively unimportant in causing the female-biased sex ratio in the field.",,"ISHIHARA, M (corresponding author), UNIV TOKYO,COLL ARTS & SCI,DEPT BIOL,MEGURO KU,TOKYO 153,JAPAN.",,,,,,,20,12,12,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The barrier includes several hundred kilometers without suitable habitat and is the convergence zone of major ocean currents. Within the barrier region, along-shore larval transport is expected to be erratic, with water moving offshore to form long-lived eddies. Through comparison of central and range edge populations, we test for evidence of recruitment limitation and interspecific competition with the whelk, Haustrum vinosum, which occurs sympatrically at the range edge. We found similar levels of recruitment and allozyme genetic variation within centre and edge populations where H. vinosum was absent, implying that populations are strongly interconnected. Nevertheless, recruitment and abundance of M. marginalba were lower at its extreme range limit, where it occurs with H. vinosum. Indeed, we detected significant inverse correlations between the abundance of these species, although their habitat use was similar and they consumed similar prey. These lines of evidence suggest a restricted recruitment across the barrier limits the range of M. marginalba but emphasize that multiple factors may act to set species range limits.

For example, altered predator-prey interactions may influence the dynamics of trophic cascades, affecting net primary production. In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated a plant-grasshopper-spider food chain in mesic tallgrass prairie to investigate the effects of temperature and food quality on grasshopper performance, and to understand the direct and indirect tritrophic interactions that contribute to trophic cascades. Because spiders are active at cooler temperatures than grasshoppers in our system, we hypothesized that predator effects would be strongest in cooled treatments, and weakest in warmed treatments. Grasshopper spider interactions were highly context-dependent and varied significantly with food quality, temperature treatment and year. Spiders most often reduced grasshopper survival in the cooled and ambient temperature treatments, but had little to no effect on grasshopper survival in the warmed treatments, as hypothesized. In some years, plants compensated for grasshopper herbivory and trophic cascades were not observed despite significant effects of predators on grasshopper survival. However, in the year they were observed, trophic cascades only occurred in cooled treatments where predator effects on grasshoppers were strongest. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change will require an understanding of how temperature influences species interactions. Our results demonstrate that changes in daily temperature regimes can alter predator-prey interactions among arthropods with consequences for ecosystem processes such as primary production and the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes.","[Laws, Angela Nardoni; Joern, Anthony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Laws, AN (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",alaws@ksu.edu,,,NSF Kansas EPSCoR Ecological Forecasting Consortium; Kansas State Univ.

However, the presence of alternative prey does not always result in an improved control of the target pest species, due to the complexity and specificity of biotic interactions. To increase the effectiveness of IPM programs, a fine understanding of the interactions among co-occurring pest species and their biocontrol agents is necessary. We tested the occurrence of apparent competition between the major tomato pests Tuta absoluta and Bemisia tabaci when preyed on by a generalist mirid bug Macrolophus pygmaeus, by monitoring pest and predator population dynamics in a greenhouse experiment. We also measured the cascading effect of the shared predator on plant and fruit damage due to pests. We observed higher predator population growth and reduced population densities of both prey in treatments with two prey, as compared to treatments with one prey, showing that apparent competition occurred. Plant and fruit damage caused by B. tabaci was reduced in the presence of T. absoluta, but damage due to T. absoluta, which accounted for the major part, was not reduced in the presence of B. tabaci, resulting in similar levels of total damage when pests co-occurred. This study demonstrates that, even if promoting apparent competition leads to actual reduction in pest densities, yield loss may not be reduced when this strategy is applied to major pests such as T. absoluta.","[Jaworski, Coline C.] Univ Toulouse UPS, ENFA, UMR5174, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol,CNRS, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Jaworski, Coline C.; Chailleux, Anais; Bearez, Philippe; Desneux, Nicolas] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, INRA French Natl Inst Agr Res, UMR 1355 7254,Inst Sophia Agrobiotech, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Chailleux, Anais] Cirad, UPR HortSys, F-34398 Montpellier, France","Jaworski, CC (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse UPS, ENFA, UMR5174, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol,CNRS, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France.",jaworskicoline@yahoo.fr; nicolas.desneux@sophia.inra.fr,"Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013; Jaworski, Coline/AAI-2614-2021","Jaworski, Coline/0000-0002-6136-8656",Plant Health and Environment Department of INRA; Environment and Agronomy Department of INRA; French ministry of agriculture (CASDAR Project) [10063],"We thank Emily Mohl and Anais Bompard for comments on the design of the study, Caroline Groiseau and Cecile Thomas for their assistance throughout the experiments, Jacques Frandon (Biotop) for providing part of the biological materials, and Ian Kaplan and Tim Oppenheim for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Along the east coast of Australia, the alga can also persist in mangroves as a free-living form trapped amongst pneumatophores. We investigated (1) whether the alga has an effect on molluscan species richness and abundance in mangroves similar to that on rocky shores, and (2) whether, in mangroves, the source (phenotypically distinct estuarine or rocky shore populations) of H. banksii influences the outcome of its interspecific interactions. Sampling of 3 rocky shore and 3 mangrove sites along the east coast of Australia revealed that patches of H. banksii consistently supported a greater species richness of molluscs than adjacent substratum. Whereas the alga increased the abundance of molluscs in the mangrove forest, it had no effect or decreased molluscan abundance on the rocky shore. Transplant of H. banksii from rocky shores and estuarine tidal flats into the mangrove indicated that the source of the algae influenced the magnitude of effects. Although all algae enhanced molluscan abundance and species richness, estuarine H. banksii, which had larger vesicles and a longer thallus, supported more molluscs of more species than rocky shore H. banksii. These results support the growing consensus that the influence of foundation species at the community level is dependent on environmental conditions. As human activities place increasing pressure on coastal ecosystems, it will be important to understand the mechanisms and conditions that determine community-level effects of foundation species so that biodiversity may be conserved.","[Bishop, Melanie J.; Morgan, Tara; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Hardstaff, Lyndle K.; Evenden, Robert W.] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Bishop, Melanie J.; Morgan, Tara; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Hardstaff, Lyndle K.; Evenden, Robert W.] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environm Resource Management, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Coleman, Melinda A.] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Bishop, MJ (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",mbishop@bio.mq.edu.au,"Coleman, Melinda A/R-5563-2016; Kelaher, Brendan/P-3647-2017","Coleman, Melinda A/0000-0003-2623-633X; Kelaher, Brendan/0000-0002-7505-4412; Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"We thank B.

The main paradigms have shifted among the importance of competition, predation and abiotic conditions as determinants of community structure. Differential habitat selection is considered to reduce competition and hence allow co-existence. Our goal was to test hypotheses regarding how breeding site use of a population that was patchily distributed on a dynamic floodplain may facilitate coexistence: 1) do species co-occur randomly or do they occur more or less often than expected by chance? 2) Do species use the same habitat types in equal proportions or do they use them differentially? 3) If they use habitat types differentially, is this differential use related to abiotic and biotic conditions? 4) Does interspecific competition predict breeding site use or do abiotic conditions and predation risk better predict habitat use? We collected presence/absence (i.e. detection/nondetection) data of egg clutches and larvae of four pond-breeding anuran species during a two year study at a total of 353 ponds. We used site occupancy models and model averaging techniques to predict breeding site selection in relation to habitat types, abiotic and biotic factors. These parameters were corrected for imperfect detection of species. The rates of co-occurrence were consistently higher than expected by chance. Species differed in the use of the main habitat types. Habitat types that were used by multiple species were used in a species-specific manner in relation to both abiotic conditions and predation risk. Species preferred ponds where other species and fish were present. Although niche differentiation in breeding site selection is evident, our results do not support the pervasive role of competition avoidance in governing current breeding site selection. We conclude that differential habitat use and differences in response to abiotic conditionsand predation risk can override competitive interactions, thereby facilitating local co-existence and high species diversity.","[Indermaur, Lukas; Jokela, Jukka] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Indermaur, Lukas; Jokela, Jukka] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, IGB, Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, DE-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, DE-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolut Biol & Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] KARCH, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland","Indermaur, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",lukas.indermaur@eawag.ch,"Tockner, Klement/G-9265-2011; Jokela, Jukka/F-8626-2010; Schmidt, Benedikt R./B-8491-2008","Schmidt, Benedikt R./0000-0002-4023-1001; Tockner, Klement/0000-0002-0038-8151; Jokela, Jukka/0000-0002-1731-727X",MAVA Fondation pour la nature'' (Switzerland),"We are grateful to Fabienne Sutter and Simone Blaser for field data collection, and to Marc Kery and Jeff Laake for help in modelling issues.

Diaptomus generally had a strongly negative effect on both cyclopoid species. The cyclopoids established populations more successfully when introduced to aquaria before calanoids than they did when calanoids were already present. On the other hand, whether introduced earlier or later than the cyclopoids, Diaptomus populations were unaffected by Acanthocyclops and were strongly depressed by Mesocyclops. Diaptomus effects on the phytoplankton were often strong but varied markedly among experiments. They included reduction of populations of edible algae, such as Chlamydomonas, which are essential for both calanoid and cyclopoid nauplii, and large increases in inedible algae, such as Kirchneriella. Feeding experiments revealed that under conditions of food scarcity Acanthocyclops nauplii survived less well than did Diaptomus nauplii. Competition for edible phytoplankton seemed to be a key factor in the calanoid-cyclopoid interactions, since the survival of herbivorous cyclopoid larvae determined the abundance of the predaceous adults. This indicates that the competitive effects of calanoids on cyclopoids often may exceed the predative effects of cyclopoids on calanoids.","SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,SAN DIEGO,CA 92182",,,,,,,,75,17,20,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JUN 14,1991,215,2,,,,,83,110,,10.1007/BF00014714,,,28,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,FY908,WOS:A1991FY90800001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Parasitoids and predators can provide sustainable long-term solutions to pest problems (biological control), reducing the need for expensive and sometimes polluting pesticide applications. When several species of beneficial insects are present, their pest control actions may be additive, synergistic, or disruptive. One form of disruptive interaction between parasitoids and predators is direct interspecific contest for access to individual pests (the resource to be exploited). This study evaluated behavioural interactions between brood-guarding wasps, Goniozus nephantidis (Muesebeck) (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), which are known to engage in intra-specific contests, and a predatory bug, Cardiastethus exiguus (Poppius) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), which attack the same pest species, Opisina arenosella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae), a major pest in coconut production systems. Dyadic parasitoid-predator and predator-predator contests were staged to determine the factors that influence the behaviours within, and outcomes of, such interactions. Parasitoids were aggressive towards predators, sometimes killing them, but predators were not aggressive towards parasitoids. Biting and stinging only occurred when there was a host larva present. In the absence of the parasitoid that had oviposited onto a host, predators often consumed the parasitoid's eggs. Egg consumption sometimes occurred when the parasitoid was present. Intra-specific competition between pairs of predators was also evaluated: adults were aggressive towards each other, but interactions were not fatal. Biting was more common when there was no prey larva present. When a larva was present, predators were observed feeding simultaneously. We conclude that direct parasitoid-predator interactions are likely to influence pest population dynamics, possibly reducing the overall suppression of O. arenosella by its natural enemies.","[Velasco-Hernandez, Maria C.; Hardy, Ian C.

These species coincide geographically, co-occur locally, and consume similar food resources. Despite their idiosyncratic responses to landscape and patch variables, patch occupancy models suggest that competition may influence their respective distributions and abundances, and accordingly their influence on the rest of the forest community. Experimental studies, however, are wanting. We present the result of a large-scale experiment in which we removed white-footed mice or gray squirrels from small, isolated forest fragments in Dutchess County, New York, and added these mammals to other fragments in order to alter the abundance of these two species. We then used mark-recapture analyses to quantify the population-level and individual-level effects on resident mice, squirrels, and chipmunks. Overall, we found little evidence of competition. There were essentially no within-season numerical responses to changes in the abundance of putative competitors. Moreover, while individual-level responses (apparent survival and capture probability) did vary with competitor densities in some models, these effects were often better explained by site-specific parameters and were restricted to few of the 19 sites we studied. With only weak or nonexistent competition among these three common rodent species, we expect their patterns of habitat occupancy and population dynamics to be largely independent of one another.","[Brunner, Jesse L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Brunner, Jesse L.; Duerr, Shannon; Vuong, Holly; Ostfeld, Richard S.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY USA; [Keesing, Felicia] Bard Coll, Dept Biol, Annandale On Hudson, NY USA; [Killilea, Mary] NYU, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Vuong, Holly] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA","Brunner, JL (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",jesse.brunner@wsu.edu,"Brunner, Jesse L./B-1692-2013","Brunner, Jesse L./0000-0003-4894-8274; Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301",Environmental Protection Agency (STAR)United States Environmental Protection Agency [83377601]; National Science Foundation-National Institutes of Health joint program in the Ecology of Infectious Diseases [EF0813035]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0949702] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by grants from the Environmental Protection Agency (STAR Grant 83377601) and the National Science Foundation-National Institutes of Health joint program in the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (EF0813035).

Many simple theories predict that complex speciose communities should be less stable than simple ones. In contrast, stability of collective community attributes, such as functional groups, may be greater in more complex communities. We used aquatic microcosms containing microbial food webs to generate an experimental gradient of species richness. Biweekly counts of population samples permitted estimation and comparison of density, persistence time, and temporal variation in density for populations and trophic functional groups embedded in communities of varying richness. Densities of nearly half of the species declined as species richness increased, demonstrating broad community-wide density compensation that resulted from more abundant competitors and predators in species-rich communities. Persistence time, a measure of population stability, also declined with increasing species richness. Another measure of population stability, temporal variation in density, indicated that abundances of most species embedded in diverse communities varied no more than in less diverse communities. In contrast to results for individual species, temporal variation of entire functional groups composed of multiple species decreased as species richness increased. The stability of individual populations was not predicted by that of functional groups. Interspecific interactions and statistical averaging may both contribute to the reduced temporal variability of functional groups created by aggregating multiple species.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","McGrady-Steed, J (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",pjmorin@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,67,108,123,1,54,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2000,81,2,,,,,361,373,,,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,279ZM,WOS:000085077200007,,,,,2021-09-27,

The field experiment followed a two-factorial design, with Glossosoma densities (natural vs reduced) and sculpin presence (present vs absent) as treatments. Diet analysis revealed that all four prey species were eaten under the natural condition and the sculpin preferred mayfly grazers to Glossosoma. Our experiment showed that although mayfly densities in the presence of either sculpin or Glossosoma were lower than in the no-sculpin plus reduced-Glossosoma treatment, no difference in mayfly densities was found between the following three treatments: sculpin plus natural-Glossosoma, no-sculpin plus natural-Glossosoma, and sculpin plus reduced-Glossosoma. These results indicated that fish predator produced no effects additive to the competitive operation on the mayfly density, and also that competitive operation of Glossosoma on the mayfly densities produced no additional effects to fish predators. In addition, although the competitive effect of the mayflies on Glossosoma could not be manipulated in isolation, the density of Glossosoma in the presence of sculpin was greater than that in the absence of sculpin in the natural-Glossosoma treatment. Thus, the densities of these competing grazers either stayed the same or increased in the presence of the fish predator relative to predator-free treatments. A theoretical model, developed to explain the experimental results here, predicted that the densities of the two competing prey under predation pressure could be simultaneously greater than those under predator absent conditions when the behaviorally-mediated effects of the predator were strongly operative. Although we were unable to distinguish experimentally the two different effects of predator on the prey competition, the behaviorally- and density-mediated effects, the reality of the behaviorally-mediated effects in the experiment was discussed.","Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600019, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; Chitose Board Educ, Chitose, Hokkaido 0660077, Japan","Miyasaka, H (corresponding author), Res Inst Human & Nat, Kamigyo Ku, 335 Takashima Cho, Kyoto 6020878, Japan.",,,,,,,44,15,15,0,23,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2003,101,3,,,,,511,520,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12001.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,680PH,WOS:000182986200008,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, a cowbird chick also benefits from the presence of some host nest mates as the parasite is provisioned disproportionately more with increasing brood size. Since asynchronous hatching affects both cowbird and host nestlings' growth and survival, mechanisms that optimize the timing of egg-laying by female parasites should be prevalent. Several habitat features might facilitate optimal timing of parasitic egg-laying and we examined whether aspects of host nesting habitat predicted cowbird hatching synchrony. We tested whether synchronous nests were less concealed, closer to perches, and located in areas of higher host density than asynchronous nests using a broad-scale information theoretic approach. There was no support for these predictions regarding song sparrow (Melospiza melodia; n=55) or yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia; n=67) nests parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds at Mono Lake, USA. For example, the best statistical models for predicting hatching synchrony in yellow warbler nests included nesting-patch width and nest-substrate shrub species. However, these relationships were relatively weak: both synchronous and asynchronous nests were in patches with statistically indistinguishable widths and the two dominant shrub species at our site contained similar proportions of synchronous and asynchronous nests. We conclude that the variability of host nesting habitats does not contribute to a biologically consistent effect on hatching synchrony by this generalist brood parasite.","[Tonra, Christopher M.; Johnson, Matthew D.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Heath, Sacha K.] PRBO Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA; [Hauber, Mark E.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Hauber, Mark E.] CUNY, Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Tonra, CM (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, 5751 Murray Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",christopher.tonra@umit.maine.edu,"Heath, Sacha/I-3323-2019","Heath, Sacha/0000-0002-9822-8091","Bureau of Land Management; Humboldt State Univ; Foundation, Inyo National Forest; Marin Rod and Gun Club; Miller Inst. for Basic Research in Science; Mono Basin Bird Chautauqua; Mono Lake Committee; Mono Market, the New Zealand Marsden; PRBO [1644]","We thank the many fine PRBO biologists, too numerous to name here, who assisted in collecting field data.

In St. Joseph Bay, FL, USA, pen shells [Atrina rigida (Sol.)] are preyed on by horse conchs [Pleuroploca gigantea (Kiener)]. The shells of dead Atrina are subsequently used as shelters and/or nest sites by a suite of benthic species, including crabs, octopi, and fish. By influencing the rate of new shelter availability, horse conchs may indirectly affect the distribution or reproduction of shell-occupant species. Feeding observations and an exclosure experiment indicate that Atrina are the primary prey of large horse conchs. The abundance of occupant species is strongly correlated to Atrina shell abundance, suggesting that shelter availability may influence population distributions. Experimental additions of new shelters mimicking freshly-killed pen shells caused an increase in the abundance of occupant species. Among these species, the blennies Hypsoblennius hentzi (Leseuer) and Chasmodes saburrae J. & G. and the clingfish Gobiesox strumosus Cope showed an increase in both abundance and frequency of egg-guarding, suggesting an important indirect effect of horse conchs on the distribution and reproductive output of these fish. Because the addition of new shells affected blennies and clingfish more strongly than other occupant species, community composition is influenced by shelter availability. In habitats where biogenic structures are prominent, such as mollusc shells in soft-sediment marine communities, this type of nontrophic indirect effect may be an important component of population and community regulation.",,"KUHLMANN, ML (corresponding author), FLORIDA STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI B142,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32306, USA.",,,,,,,47,13,13,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

In protected areas, uncontrolled (non-intervention) management allows natural beetle-induced tree mortality, while in commercial forests infested trees are salvage-logged in order to lower I. typographus numbers and stabilize wood production. However, the effects of active pest controls on I. typographus population are often ambiguous, and little is known about how antagonists, beetle density, or intraspecific competition help terminate I. typographus outbreaks. To answer this question, we studied I. typographus population development, breeding performance, and natural antagonists under intervention and non-intervention management in the High Tatra Mts. from 2014 to 2017. We used sentinel logs and windthrown trees, following the current legislation in Tatransky narodny park (TANAP, Slovakia) and Tatrzanski Park Narodowy (TPN, Poland). Both parks are mountainous, are covered by Norway spruce forests that have been extensively affected by windthrows and extensive I. typographus outbreaks over the last 20 years, and are zoned under intervention and non-intervention types of management. We found that I. typographus was a dominant species and that its numbers gradually increased during the study, but that the numbers of maternal galleries in sentinel logs (from 50 to 300 per m(2)) and sex ratio (1 male:2.5 females) remained the same among years. The length of maternal galleries and egg production (per m(2) of bark), however, gradually declined, and breeding performance decreased from 10 daughter beetles per female in 2014 to almost zero in 2017. These parameters did not significantly differ between intervention and non-intervention sites. Antagonists were not abundant and had limited effects on I. typographus numbers. Active intervention did not affect I. typographus population dynamics or rates of parasitism but increased numbers of Thanasimus beetles, which are predators of bark beetles. In other words, intervention increased the numbers of some natural enemies of I. typographus but did not affect I. typographus population dynamics. Because control measures did not reduce I. typographus numbers in the intervention zone, the natural ecological processes crucial for maintaining ecosystem functioning and biodiversity were evidently preserved.","[Vanicka, Hana; Holusa, Jaroslav; Resnerova, Karolina; Vele, Adam] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Protect & Entomol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic; [Ferencik, Jan] State Forests Tatra Natl Pk, Tatranska Lomnica 05960, Slovakia; [Potterf, Maria] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Potterf, Maria] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Resource Wisdom, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Potterf, Maria] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Sturova 2, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; [Grodzki, Wojciech] Forest Res Inst, Dept Mt Forests, Ul Fredry 39, PL-30605 Krakow, Poland","Holusa, J (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Protect & Entomol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic.",holusaj@seznam.cz,"Holusa, Jaroslav/AAD-8192-2021; Grodzki, Wojciech/R-8170-2018; Resnerova (Lukasova), Karolina/AAC-1652-2021","Holusa, Jaroslav/0000-0003-1459-0331; Grodzki, Wojciech/0000-0003-0623-752X; Potterf, Maria/0000-0001-6763-1948; Resnerova (Lukasova), Karolina/0000-0002-9347-5149; Vanicka, Hana/0000-0002-3300-5065",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [IGA B_02_18]; Ministry of AgricultureGida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi [QK1920433],"The authors thank Roman Bercak, Sona Zimova, Pavlina Danhelkova, and Jiri Trombik for help with the field work.

Both Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stepehensi are container breeding mosquitoes and co-exist which may result in larval competition. In this study, interspecific competition between the above two species has been monitored under the laboratory conditions. Methods: Three sets of experiments were conducted with different stages of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi larvae. First two experiments were set up with I/II instar and III/IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi respectively in the ratios of 20:20, 20:40 and 40:20 in plastic bowls. For third set of experiment 20 IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti were put with equal number of I instar larvae of An. stephensi. Results: In the presence of food, 12.5-15 % mortality was recorded in I/II stage larvae of Ae. aegypti while in An. stephensi mortality ranged from 21-55%. Pupation commenced from Day 6 onwards in Ae. aegypti while in An. stephensi it commenced from Day 11 onwards. In the absence of food, there was no pupation in both the species but Ae. aegypti survived up to longer duration (7.5-18.5 days with 50% mortality) in comparison to An. stephensi (2-7 days with 50% mortality). When younger stages of An. stephensi (I/II) were put together with older stages of Ae. aegypti (III/IV) in the presence of food, pupation was completed in 85% Ae. aegypti population while there was 100% mortality in An. stephensi population. Interpretation & conclusion: The better survival and development of Ae. aegypti than An. stephensi under the same conditions exhibits interspecies competition showing competitive advantage of Ae. aegypti over An. stephensi. Further research is required to have a thorough understanding of the interaction between these two container inhabiting mosquito species in the nature.","[Haq, S.; Kumar, Gaurav; Dhiman, Ramesh C.] ICMR Natl Inst Malaria Res, Sect 8, New Delhi 110077, India","Dhiman, RC (corresponding author), ICMR Natl Inst Malaria Res, Sect 8, New Delhi 110077, India.",r.c.dhiman@gmail.com,"Dhiman, Ramesh/P-3836-2016","Dhiman, Ramesh/0000-0001-9844-9970",,,,25,0,0,0,0,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0972-9062,,,J VECTOR DIS,J.

I examined the competitive ability of larval common frogs (Rana temporaria) and common toads (Bufo bufo) in a laboratory experiment by manipulating the number and size of Rana and the number of Bufo. 2. Bufo was the most active tadpole type, whereas small Rana was more active than large Rana. 3. Especially at high food availability, the growth rate of large Rana at metamorphosis was reduced in the presence of small Rana, whereas that of small Rana was not affected by larger conspecifics. 4. Both size classes of Rana were negatively affected by the presence of Bufo. Size at metamorphosis of Bufo was greater when large Rana was present. These results suggest that activity level is important in determining competitive ability. 5. To study competition in the field, tadpoles of Bufo were introduced to small rock-pools that did not support Bufo naturally, but were with or without Rana. 6. In the experimental pools, there were no interspecific effects on the growth rate of either species. However, the growth rate of Bufo was lower in the experimental pools than in pools inhabited naturally. Futher, survival of Bufo was low in small pools. Lower food availability or physical factors associated with small pools, rather than interspecific competition, may be the reason why Bufo avoids breeding in small rock-pools.","Univ Helsinki, Div Populat Biol, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Integrat Ecol Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Laurila, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Populat Biol, Norbyvagen 18 D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,60,31,35,0,21,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Pairs of European Triturus newt species of similar size tend not to co-occur syntopically, suggesting that similarity in body size is associated with competitive interactions that prevent coexistence. I tested this hypothesis with an experiment involving larvae of four species in 675-L artificial ponds. 2. There were strong interactions between most species pairs. Even the small T. helveticus had a clear impact on the larger T. alpestris. Pairs of species with different body sizes did not interact less strongly. 3. A standard increase in competitor biomass (c. 2 g mass at metamorphosis) caused 42% lower expected survival from hatching to 1 year of age, regardless of whether the species were of similar or different size. In most cases this resulted from delayed metamorphosis, reduced size at emergence, and slightly lower larval survival. 4. A standard increase in competitor density (0.74 individuals m(-2)) caused a greater reduction in expected 1-year survival when the competitor was larger (18% decline) than when both species were of similar size (6% decline), primarily because the very large T. cristatus consumed the smallest species. 5. These findings suggest that species interactions during the larval stage cannot explain distribution patterns of same- and different-sized Triturus.","Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Van Buskirk, J (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",jvb@zool.unizh.ch,,"Van Buskirk, Josh/0000-0002-0486-3626",,,,62,20,20,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We studied population growth and persistence of the specialist P. persimilis and the generalist N. californicus reared singly versus reared in combination after simultaneous and successive predator introductions on detached bean leaf arenas with abundant prey, Tetranychus urticae, and with diminishing prey. When reared singly with abundant prey, either predator population persisted at high densities to the end of the experiment. In every predator combination system with abundant prey and various initial predator:predator ratios N. californicus displaced P. persimilis. When held singly with diminishing prey, the population of P. persimilis grew initially faster than the population of N. californicus but both species reached similar population peaks. Irrespective whether reared singly or in combination, N. californicus persisted three to five times longer after prey depletion than did P. persimilis. Regarding the crucial interactions in the predator combination systems, we conclude that intraguild predation was a stronger force than food competition and finally resulted in the displacement of P. persimilis. Previous studies showed that intraguild predation between the specialist P. persimilis and the generalist N. californicus is strongly asymmetric favoring the generalist. We discuss the implications of potential interactions between P. persimilis and N. californicus to biological control of spider mites.","Univ Agr Sci, Inst Hort & Fruit Growing, Dept Hort, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; Inst Phytomed, Fed Off, A-1226 Vienna, Austria; Inst Phytomed, Agr Res Ctr, A-1226 Vienna, Austria; Univ Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Walzer, A (corresponding author), Univ Agr Sci, Inst Hort & Fruit Growing, Dept Hort, Peter Jordanstr 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",,,,42,36,40,0,17,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

With these clones, two competition experiments were conducted in two large-scale indoor mesocosms, the Plankton Towers in Plon, Germany. We varied the presence of fish and kairomones. Using allozyme electrophoresis we observed Diel Vertical Migration (DVM) of individual clones. Without fish, two clones belonging to the largest taxa (D. galeata and D. galeata X hyalina) became numerically dominant after three weeks. The mere presence of fish kairomones led to a significant decrease in the niche overlap between the five taxa. With fish present in the towers relative densities of smaller D. cucullata X galeata clones were highest. We observed that under different predation intensities different taxa showed the highest instantaneous rate of increase. Without fish and fish kairomones this rate was the highest for D. galeata, when fish kairomones were present D. galeata X hyalina had the highest relative r.

Biomass of cattail litter (Typha sp.), numbers of small insectivorous fish (primarily juvenile carp, Cyprinus carpio, and to a lesser extent juvenile brown bullhead, Ictalurus nebulosus), or numbers of large fish (primarily adult brown bullhead, which will consume both midges and small fish) were manipulated in mesh-walled mesocosms (1.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 m). Using core sampling, midge population responses to manipulations were monitored from early May through late August. Trophic responses of marsh midges to resources and predation changed temporally over the summer. In June, neither resource limitation nor predation by fish significantly influenced midge numbers. In July, after juvenile carp and brown bullhead first became abundant from the spawn, these small insectivorous fish significantly reduced midge larval densities. At that time, midge densities still did not respond to variable detritus supplies. By August, both predation by small fish and available supplies of cattail litter significantly affected midge numbers. Because midges did not respond to a nonnutritive mimic of cattail litter, it suggests that resource limitation of midge abundance was nutritionally based. Feeding by large adult bullhead had no apparent direct or indirect influence on midge densities in any month. Small fish largely disappeared from the study habitats by August, but populations of midge larvae did not rebound because they had stopped breeding for that year. This study supports emerging concepts on the integrated influences of top-down and bottom-up trophic interaction on food web function. Predation and resource limitation were simultaneously influencing midge abundance. Results also emphasize how life history phenologies of predators and prey can contribute to temporal variation in food web structure and function.","Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Batzer, DP (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,59,55,56,0,39,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1998,79,5,,,,,1688,1698,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1688:TIADBM]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101CX,WOS:000074853000019,,,,,2021-09-27,

Differences in the strengths of these mechanisms will determine their roles in maintaining species coexistence. In the first assessment of these mechanisms in a Congo Basin forest, we quantified their relative strengths and tested the extent to which density-dependent mortality is driven by the distance-dependent behavior of seed and seedling predators predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We conducted a large-scale seed addition experiment for five randomly selected tropical tree species, caging a subset of seed addition quadrats against vertebrate predators. We then developed models to assess the mechanisms that determine seedling emergence (three months after seed addition) and survival (two years after seed addition). As predicted, both niche differentiation and density-dependent mortality limited seedling recruitment, but predation had the strongest effects on seedling emergence and survival. Seedling species responded differently to naturally occurring environmental variation among sites, including variation in light levels and soil characteristics, supporting predictions of niche-based theories of tropical tree species coexistence. The addition of higher densities of seeds into quadrats initially led to greater seedling emergence, but survival to two years decreased with seed density. Seed and seedling predation reduced recruitment below levels maintained by density-dependent mortality, an indication that predators largely determine the population size of tree seedlings. Seedling recruitment was unrelated to the distance to or density of conspecific adult trees, suggesting that recruitment patterns are generated by generalist vertebrate herbivores rather than the specialized predators predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. If the role of seed and seedling predation in limiting seedling recruitment is a general phenomenon, then the relative abundances of tree species might largely depend on species-specific adaptations to avoid, survive, and recover from damage induced by vertebrate herbivores. Likewise, population declines of herbivorous vertebrate species (many of which are large and hunted) may trigger shifts in species composition of tropical forests.","[Clark, C. J.; Poulsen, J.

These studies provide a new theoretical framework for explaining resource partitioning patterns among African ungulates that coexist in spatially heterogeneous savanna grasslands. According to these studies, different-sized ungulates can coexist because larger species forage at a coarser scale but can tolerate lower quality food, whereas smaller species need higher quality food but forage at a finer scale. To test this hypothesis in an African savanna, we created an experimental mosaic with variation in grain ( spatial detail) and quality of short-grass patches and directly observed the visitation of naturally occurring grazers to this mosaic over a two-year period ( total of 903 observation hours). Of the seven species that visited our experiment, warthog, impala, zebra, and white rhino visited long enough to allow data analysis. We showed that warthog and impala avoided plots with a finer grain of short grass and that warthog preferred fertilized plots to unfertilized plots. Zebra and white rhino did not avoid the finer grain plots. Our results suggest that differences in grain and quality of a resource might indeed contribute to partitioning of this resource by savanna ungulates. Although four focal species is unusually high for an experimental study on resource partitioning among naturally occurring savanna ungulates, this number is too low to evaluate the allometric basis of our hypothesis. Our results, however, encourage wider experimental testing of the role of spatial heterogeneity in facilitating the coexistence of potentially competing savanna herbivores.","Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Cromsigt, JPGM (corresponding author), Van Speykstr 40, NL-9726 BN Groningen, Netherlands.",jcromsigt@hotmail.com,"Olff, Han/A-8516-2008","Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576; Cromsigt, Joris/0000-0002-8632-9469",,,,38,78,80,0,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2006,87,6,,,,,1532,1541,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1532:RPASGM]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,058IJ,WOS:000238658400022,16869429,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Age-0 flatfish making summer use of shallow coastal embayments around Kodiak Alaska distribute themselves according to a variety of bottom features. Both field and laboratory studies indicate that the numerically dominant species, northern rock sole Lepidopsetta polyxystra and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis, demonstrate an affinity for seafloor with emergent structure: algae, shell, worm-tubes, etc. We conducted field manipulations, in which bivalve shell was scattered on the seafloor along 100 m transects, with the goal of examining movements of juvenile flatfish in response to these habitat alterations. In the first manipulation, contrary to expectations, Age-0 flatfish emigrated from the shell-enhanced seafloor, producing fish densities that were lower than on adjacent un-enhanced bottom. In comparison, larger flatfish, predominantly Age-1(+) rock sole Lepidopsetta spp., increased in abundance on shell-enhanced bottom. Small flatfish may have moved to avoid larger flatfish. The manipulation was repeated at another site with similar physical features, but where large flatfish abundances are generally lower. This time, Age-0 flatfish densities were greater on the shell-enhanced bottom than on adjacent un-enhanced bottom. Again, large flatfish were more abundant on the shell bottom, but they were nearly an order of magnitude less abundant than in the first manipulation. In a subsequent laboratory experiment, Age-1 northern rock sole demonstrated stronger affinity for shell bottom than did Age-0 northern rock sole. In another experiment, Age-0 northern rock sole moved to avoid aggregations of larger conspecifics as well as other species of large flatfish, We conclude that these Age-0 flatfish, predominantly northern rock sole, perceive larger fish as predators and/or competitors, with habitat quality degraded by their presence. These results demonstrate that habitat quality for juvenile fish is influenced by biotic factors as well as by physical characteristics of habitat.","Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, NOAA Fisheries, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Behav Ecol Program, Newport, OR 97365 USA; Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA Fisheries, Kodiak Lab, Kodiak, AK 99615 USA","Ryer, CH (corresponding author), Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, NOAA Fisheries, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Behav Ecol Program, Newport, OR 97365 USA.",cliff.ryer@noaa.gov,,,,,,54,13,13,1,4,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The ovipositional responses of a mosquito, Culiseta longiareolata, to a predator and to species sharing the same trophic level as this mosquito (controphic species) were assessed experimentally in outdoor artificial pools. 2. The predator, larval Anax imperator, which strongly reduced larval C. longiareolata survival, resulted in a 52% reduction of C, longiareolata egg rafts. The controphic species (primarily Daphnia magna), which had a small but statistically significant negative effect on the survival of C. longiareolata larvae, did not have a statistically significant influence on the number of egg rafts. 3. Laboratory trials indicated that only a small fraction of the reduced number of egg rafts seen in predator pools may be due to consumption of the egg rafts by A. imperator. 4. The experimental evidence indicates that the reduced number of C. longiareolata egg rafts found in the presence of A. imperator is due largely to oviposition habitat selection, i.e. C, longiareolata females choose pools with low risk of predation for their offspring.","Univ Haifa, Lab Community Ecol, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Biol Chem Lab, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Lab Community Ecol, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",,,,,,,61,79,81,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The spread of invasive species is also facilitated by human activity, further increasing the pressure on native species. In two experiments, we measured the foraging efficiency, risk perception and inter-individual consistency of risk-taking (personality variation in boldness) of an invasive species, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and a threatened tilapia, the Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas), in clear and turbid water. In experiment one, O. niloticus was faster to initiate feeding, encountered more food items and consumed more than O. amphimelas. The latency to start foraging by O. niloticus decreased in turbid water. Turbidity did not affect the latency to start foraging in O. amphimelas but the number of food items they encountered was highest at the intermediate turbidity. There was however no significant effect of turbidity in either species on the total food consumed. In contrast to this foraging context, in experiment two with a refuge and no food available, risk taking behaviour was similar in both species and they both responded with similarly reduced risk taking in turbid water. Evidence of personality variation was weak, being observed only in O. amphimelas when first leaving the shelter in turbid water. Overall, species differences were greater in the foraging context but turbidity was more important in the risk-taking context. O. amphimelas is more sensitive to turbidity during foraging, and O. niloticus is likely to have a competitive advantage in foraging situations, especially in degraded turbid habitats.Significance statementUnder human-induced environmental change, native species are often exposed to multiple stressors. Here, we tested the responses of two cichlid fish to increasing turbidity, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), which is invasive throughout the tropics, and the Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas), a threatened species, indigenous to Tanzania. We found that turbidity was beneficial to the foraging of O. niloticus, which in both clear and turbid water consumed and encountered more food than O. amphimelas. In contrast, without food present, both species displayed similar responses of increased risk perception in turbid water with little evidence of personality variation between individuals in either species. Our results suggest that invasive species tolerant of degraded habitats may outcompete less well-adapted native species for food.","[Wing, Jonathan D.

Studies of such mechanisms have up to now been almost exclusively limited to communities of primary producers or consumers, and very few are focused on coexistence of predatory communities. Top-down regulation by predators is on the other hand essential in structuring communities of primary consumers. We therefore present a study focusing on coexistence and assembly in a species rich community of dung-inhabiting predators, investigating the potential effect of their temporal trends (succession, seasonality) on lowering their negative interactions (competition and intra-guild predation). We used field derived predator-prey co-occurrence data in combination with previous observations of trophic interactions and morphological constraints to describe the potential food web of dung-inhabiting insects. We used that food web to establish all combinations of negative interactions among individual species. We then analyzed whether interaction between species successional and seasonal optima could lower or eliminate their negative interactions. The predator prey ratio increased throughout dung pat succession, remaining constant among seasons. We found that the predator size decreased along the successional gradient, while similarly sized predators were evenly distributed across seasons. The succession of dung-inhabiting predators therefore displayed potential for environmental filtering. In contrast, seasonality niche differentiation seems to promote coexistence of species co-occurring along succession. The interaction of both species temporal patterns should significantly reduce or even eliminate the potential negative interactions between dung-inhabiting predators and thus promote high species richness in communities of dung-inhabiting insects.","[Sladecek, Frantisek Xaver Jiri; Zitek, Tomas; Konvicka, Martin] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Ctr, Inst Entomol, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Sladecek, Frantisek Xaver Jiri; Zitek, Tomas; Konvicka, Martin] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Segar, Simon Tristram] Harper Adams Univ, Dept Crop & Environm Sci, Newport, Shrops, England","Sladecek, FXJ (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Biol Ctr, Inst Entomol, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",franzsladecek@gmail.com; ziki108@seznam.cz; konva333@gmail.com; simon.t.segar@gmail.com,,,"Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [MSM200961902]; Institute of Entomology, Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Science [RVO//:60077344]; Grant Agency of University of South Bohemia [152/2016/P]; Univ. of South Bohemia Postdoc project [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0006]; Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-24571S]; Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [SS01010526]","We are very grateful to the school farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, for allowing us to carry out this study on their pasture.

We investigated the foraging strategy of a widely spread community consisting of Desert hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii), Midday gerbils (Meriones meridianus), Northern three-toed jerboas (Dipus sagitta) and Long-eared hedgehogs (Hemiechinus auritus) in the Alashan Desert, China. The aim was to analyse foraging as a result of biotic and abiotic factors in undisturbed habitats, i.e. we did not manipulate any surrounding conditions and all animals were free ranging. Three habitats were investigated, named after the dominant species: Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, Corispermum sp. and Zygophyllum pterocarpum. The following results can be summarised: (1) we found no or only slight differences for the GUD within the habitats between open and sheltered places; (2) lunar illumination affected foraging during waxing and waning moon phases within the first part of the night; (3) ambient temperature and the presence of moonlight resulted in changes in the interspecific competition that impacted the GUD; and (4) we determined prominent differences amongst habitats within the four moon phases, especially between the more covered habitats Ammopiptanthus and Zygophyllum, in contrast to the Corispermum habitat with its sparse coverage ratio. In general, foraging effort was elevated in the more covered habitats. We found a preferred foraging activity in warm and dark parts of the night which may lead to elevated inter-individual competition resulting in higher GUDs. Warmer periods were preferred in nights with constant light conditions, although resource competition was again elevated. We concluded that the foraging strategy was mainly affected by habitat, whereas moonlight and temperature modulate the resulting GUD in undisturbed environments. The availability of vegetal shelters influences foraging only in detail.","[Roschlau, C.] Univ Stuttgart, Dept Anim Physiol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Scheibler, E.] Univ South Wales, Sch Appl Sci, Treforest, Wales","Scheibler, E (corresponding author), Univ South Wales, Sch Appl Sci, Fac Comp Engn & Sci, Alfred Russel Wallace Bldg, Glyntaff Treforest CF37 4AT, Wales.",elke.scheibler@southwales.ac.uk,,,"Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Margarete-von-Wrangell programme; Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany","This work was supported by the Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg and the European Social Fund, by the Margarete-von-Wrangell programme.

We conducted field experiments in the Florida Keys, USA, to examine the effects of grazing fishes on coral/seaweed competition. Initially, fragments of Porites divaracata from an inshore habitat were transplanted into full-cage, half-cage, and no-cage treatments on a fore-reef. Within 48 h, 56% of the unprotected corals in half-cage and no-cage treatments (62 of Ill)were completely consumed. Stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) were the major coral predators, with redband parrotfish (S. aurofrenatum) also commonly attacking this coral. Next, we transplanted fragments of P. porites collected from the fore-reef habitat where our caging experiments were being conducted into the three cage treatments, half in the presence of transplanted seaweeds, and half onto initially clean substrates. The corals were allowed to grow in these conditions, with concurrent development of competing seaweeds, for 14 weeks. Although seaweed cover and biomass were both significantly greater in the full-cage treatment, coral growth did not differ significantly between cage treatments even though corals placed with pre-planted seaweeds grew significantly less than corals placed on initially clean substrate. This surprising result occurred because parrotfishes not only grazed algae from accessible treatments, but also fed directly on our coral transplants. Parrotfish feeding scars were significantly more abundant on P. porites from the half and no-cage treatments than on corals in the full cages. On this Florida reef, direct fish predation on some coral species (P. divaracata) can exclude them from fore-reef areas, as has previously been shown for certain seaweeds and sponges. For other corals that live on the fore-reef (P. porites), the benefits of fishes removing seaweeds can be counterbalanced by the detrimental effects of fishes directly consuming corals.","SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Miller, MW (corresponding author), SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 75 Vivginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",margaret.w.miller@noaa.gov,"Hay, Mark E/D-9752-2011","Hay, Mark E/0000-0002-6130-9349; Miller, Margaret W./0000-0003-0883-5064",,,,52,103,109,1,38,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1998,113,2,,,,,231,238,,10.1007/s004420050373,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YT907,WOS:000071658500011,28308202,,,,2021-09-27,

We measured the densities of dispersed seeds, early emerged seedlings, established recruits and adults, at four sites over a period of 2 years. Seed predation among species was compared by seed removal experiments and analysis of rodent larder-hoards. The three species differed markedly in local regeneration patterns. The rank order in the seed rain following decreasing seed density was flex, Taxus and Crataegus. However, Crataegus established 3.3 times more seedlings than Taxus. For all species, there was a positive linear relationship between the density of emerged seedlings and seed density, suggesting that recruitment was seed-rather than microsite-limited. A consistent pattern of seed selection among species was exerted by rodents, which preferred Taxus and, secondarily, flex seeds to Crataegus seeds. Predation ranking was the inverse of that of seed protection against predators, measured as the mass of woody coat per mass unit of the edible fraction. Recruitment potential, evaluated as the ratio of seedlings to seeds, was negatively related to seed predation, with the rank order Crataegus>Ilex>Taxus. The selective early recruitment limitation exerted by predation may have a demographic effect in the long term, as judged by the positive relationship between early seedling emergence and the density of established recruits. By modulating the pre-emptive competition for seed safe sites, rodents may preclude the progressive exclusion of species that produce low numbers of seeds (i.e. Crataegus) by those dominant in seed number (i.e. flex, Taxus), or at least foster the evenness for site occupation among seedlings of different species.","Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organismos & Sistemas, Unidad Ecol, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain","Garcia, D (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organismos & Sistemas, Unidad Ecol, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain.",danielgarcia@uniovi.es,"Martinez, Isabel/B-3218-2009; Garcia, Daniel/A-1236-2011","Martinez, Isabel/0000-0003-4205-8596; Garcia, Daniel/0000-0002-7334-7836; Obeso-Suarez, Jose Ramon/0000-0001-7157-6478",,,,63,56,60,0,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2005,144,3,,,,,435,446,,10.1007/s00442-005-0103-7,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,955SL,WOS:000231247800011,15891859,,,,2021-09-27,

This work was initiated 6 years after introduction of several biological control agents. The soil seed bank of the site used in this study contained a mean density of 5,848 seeds/m(2) (ranging from 0 to 16,364 seeds/m(2)), and 92% of the seeds isolated from soils were shriveled, discolored, and/or partially decayed. Additionally, none of the intact seeds germinated, suggesting that the viable seed bank at our field study site has been exhausted. Centaurea stoebe seeds were planted into pots under a range of soil nitrogen (N) availability, with half of the pots containing a single density of previously established seedlings of a native cool-season grass, slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus). A watering regime mimicking local precipitation was applied. Spotted knapweed exhibited large biomass responses to N addition, but the presence of grasses suppressed the ability to exploit this N. Surprisingly, low soil N conditions improved knapweed survivorship in the presence of grasses. Nevertheless, recruitment and biomass were still far below the levels reached in the absence of competition. To evaluate the effect of density on successful recruitment, Centaurea stoebe seed was introduced into a meadow at three densities matching reduced levels of seed production under the constraints of seed predators. These densities were sown with or without a seed mixture of native species, into an existing plant community lacking C. stoebe, and seedling recruitment was recorded over 2.5 years. Across all plots and densities sown (568-2,272 seeds m(-2) year(-1)), seedling recruitment was less than 1%. The invasion potential of spotted knapweed was greatly diminished when realistic levels of plant competition and biological control limit seed production. We therefore conclude that a combination of seed limitation and shortage of 'safe sites' within undisturbed vegetation can limit densities of C. stoebe.","[Knochel, David G.; Flagg, Cody; Seastedt, T.

Here, we explored how ecosystem engineering effects can feed back to the engineer, not only modulating the engineer's population density (node modulation) but also affecting its interactions with other species (link modulation). Gall induction can be viewed as ecosystem engineering since galls serve as habitat for other species. In a community-level field experiment, we generated treatments with reduced or elevated ecosystem engineering by removing or adding post-emergence galls to different plots of their host plant in the Brazilian Cerrado. We tested the effect of post-emergence galls on the galler, as well as on the galler-parasitoid and galler-aphid interactions. The manipulation of post-emergence galls had little effect on the galler-abundance and survivorship were not affected, and gall volume changed only slightly-but modified interactions involving the galler, parasitoid wasps and inquiline aphids. Aphid inquilines negatively affected density-dependent parasitism rates (interaction modification) likely by killing parasitised galling larvae. Post-emergence galls interfered with aphid inquilinism-likely by the provision of alternative habitat for aphids-and thus interfered with the negative effect of aphids on parasitism (modification of an interaction modification). This work is one of the few studies to demonstrate experimentally the role played by environment-mediated interaction modification at a community level in the field. Moreover, by manipulating a species' ecosystem engineering effect (post-emergence galls) instead of the species itself, we demonstrate the novel result that populations can be regulated by non-trophic effects initiated by their own activities that alter their interaction with other species. This reveals that indirect interactions mediated via the environment offer new pathways of feedback loops for population regulation. Our results indicate that interaction modification has the potential to be a key regulatory mechanism underlying interaction variation in nature, and play a major role in community structure, dynamics and stability.","[Barbosa, Milton; Morris, Rebecca J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Barbosa, Milton; Fernandes, G.

This is typically interpreted as evidence for direct resource competition between the invader and native species. However, this may also reflect indirect impacts of the exotic shrubs through harboring high densities of seed predators--known as apparent competition. Here I present data from separate seed predation experiments conducted with two shrub species exotic to North America; Rosa multiflora, an invader of abandoned agricultural land, and Lonicera maackii, an invader of disturbed or secondary forest habitats. Both experiments showed significantly greater risks of seed predation for tree seeds located under shrub canopies when compared to open microhabitats within the same site.

Previous studies have predicted the exclusion of hedgehogs from rural habitats in areas where badgers are abundant. The two species coexist at the landscape scale, however, as hedgehogs use suburban habitats, which are thought to provide a refuge from the effects of badger predation. We carried out surveys of hedgehog abundance and studied the use of spatial refugia by hedgehogs in relation to badger density and distribution in 10 study sites in the Midlands and south-west regions of England. Surveys confirmed that hedgehogs were almost absent from pasture fields in rural habitats, with their distribution concentrated in amenity grassland fields in suburban areas. However, although suburban habitats are less frequently used by badgers than rural areas, and therefore represented spatial refugia for hedgehogs, the probability of occurrence and abundance of hedgehogs varied in relation to the density of badger setts in the surrounding area. As sett density increased, both the probability of occurrence of hedgehogs and their abundance decreased. A generalized linear model predicted that the probability of hedgehog occurrence in suburban habitats declined towards zero in areas of high badger density. The most probable explanation is the negative effect of high badger abundance on the ability of hedgehogs to move between patches of suburban habitat. The present study concords with results from previous surveys and experimental studies, which found a strong negative spatial relationship between hedgehogs and badgers. It also provides correlative evidence that intraguild predation can exclude intraguild prey from productive habitats.","Cent Sci Lab, Sand Hutton, Yorks, England; Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Biodivers & Ecol Div, Southampton, Hants, England","Young, RP (corresponding author), Durrell Wildlife Conservat Trust, Jersey JE3 5BP, England.",richard.young@durrell.org,"Delahay, Richard/J-2261-2014; Wilson, Gavin/J-5409-2014; Doncaster, C.

Using 32 consecutive months of point counts in a coastal landscape in Oaxaca, Mexico, we studied the annual cycle, non-breeding season (October to March) and breeding season (May to August) of terrestrial birds. For broad trophic guilds of plant-consumers and insectivores, we disclosed seasonal dynamics and assessed the spread of non-breeding season abundance across migratory habit categories and habitat types. to test for habitat-use patterns derived from hypotheses concerning specific trophic resources, we focused on subsets within trophic guilds: frugivores (plant-consumers that mainly eat fruit) and invertebrate gleaners (insectivores that mainly eat terrestrial leaf and stem invertebrates). Drawing on a resource-centred dietary requirement hypothesis, we predicted lower abundance of migrant frugivores in mangrove, where palatable fruit availability was expected to be low and resident frugivores probably exploited invertebrates to feed nestlings. Based on the competition-oriented nest predation hypothesis, we anticipated a higher proportion of migrant invertebrate gleaners in marsh. we recorded migrant birds in every month of the year. For 20 plant-consumer species, the non-breeding season density was highest among residents in mangrove (> 5 individuals per hectare). For 46 insectivore species, densities were > 5 and > 9 individuals per hectare for migrants and residents, respectively. Comparable average abundances in trophic guilds suggested both migrant and resident species were equally important. For 14 frugivore species, a higher proportion of migrants in marsh (0.90) than mangrove (0.03) resulted from reciprocal between-habitat changes in migrant and resident abundances, as predicted by the dietary requirement hypothesis. For 22 invertebrate gleaners, proportions of migrants in mangrove (0.45) and marsh (0.55) were comparable, as were abundances. Contrary to the nest predation hypothesis, any between-habitat variation in invertebrate gleaner nesting activity did not markedly influence non-breeding season abundance.","[Ruiz, Mateo D.

While direct toxic effects can be garnered from single-species laboratory studies, the full suite of possible effects can only be observed when organisms are embedded within a community. In this study, we manipulated the concentration of malathion (a broad-spectrum insecticide) to determine the impacts on aquatic communities containing phytoplankton, periphyton, and 27 species of animals (16 zooplankton, 5 snails, 3 tadpoles and 3 predatory insects). Using relatively low concentrations (0.13 to 0.46 mg l(-1)), we found important direct (and interactive) effects of predators and malathion on the food web as well as a number of apparent density- and trait-mediated indirect effects. Malathion initiated an indirect effect by decreasing zooplankton diversity and abundance, which propagated an increase in phytoplankton, a decrease in periphyton, and a subsequent decrease in the growth of leopard frog tadpoles. There also was an apparent trait-mediated indirect effect whereby increased amounts of the pesticide reduced predation rates on amphibians without affecting the survival of the primary amphibian predator (larval Anax dragonflies). In contrast, snail survival and growth was unaffected by the pesticide but there were strong, species-specific effects from their primary predator (adult Belostoma water bugs). This is one of few studies to examine the impacts of malathion on aquatic communities across a range of concentrations, despite the fact that it is currently the most commonly applied insecticide in the United States, it is applied around the world, and it can be legally directly sprayed over aquatic habitats to control the mosquitoes that carry malaria and West Nile virus. Our results suggest several mechanisms by which a wide variety of pesticides with similar modes of action might impact aquatic communities.","[Relyea, Rick A.; Hoverman, Jason T.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, 101 Clapp Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea@pitt.edu,"Hoverman, Jason T/D-1756-2013","Hoverman, Jason T/0000-0002-4002-2728",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We are indebted to Josh Auld, Nicole Diecks, Jon Lam, Dustin Lutomski, Dani Rosenberger and Nancy Schoeppner for their assistance in executing the experiments.

In half of the cages density of macrobenthos was increased artificially in 2.5-3 times. Through 2.5 months, both total biomass of macrofauna and most of the dominant species (Mya arenaria, Hydrobia ulvae, Arenicola marina, Littorina saxatilis) in cages exceeded the control values in some times. The similar result was received for macrophytes (mainly for Ruppia maritima). The total losses from vertebrate predators (birds and fishes) were estimated as about 80% of the seasonal production both for macrofauna and macrophytes. In cages with raised initial density the absolute gain of animals biomass was maximal, but the growth rates practically of all species, except H. ulvae, were significantly lower than at cages with natural density. The production of macrophytes was also lower at increased density of animals. The conclusion is made, that the press of vertebrate predators is the basic controlling factor for this community, keeping density of littoral macrofauna below a critical level, at which the competitive effects become significant. However there is a specifity in the individual reaction of some species complicating the general pattern.","Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Moscow, Russia","Azovsky, AI (corresponding author), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Moscow, Russia.",,"Dnestrovskaya, Nataliya Yu/H-7465-2016; Azovsky, Andrey/B-4773-2018","Azovsky, Andrey/0000-0001-6815-3968",,,,34,0,0,0,14,MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA,MOSCOW,"39 DIMITROVA UL., 113095 MOSCOW, RUSSIA",0030-1574,,,OKEANOLOGIYA+,Okeanologiya,NOV-DEC,1999,39,6,,,,,867,875,,,,,9,Oceanography,Oceanography,275NY,WOS:000084827300009,,,,,2021-09-27,

Tail autotomy is mainly considered an antipredator mechanism. Theory suggests that predation pressure relaxes on islands, subsequently reducing autotomy rates. 2. Intraspecific aggression, which may also cause tail loss, probably intensifies on islands due to the higher abundance. 3. We studied whether tail autotomy is mostly affected by predation pressure or by intraspecific competition. We further studied whether predator abundance or predator richness is more important in this context. 4. To test our predictions, we examined multiple populations of two gecko species: Kotschy's gecko (Mediodactylus kotschyi; mainland and 41 islands) and the Mediterranean house gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus; mainland and 17 islands), and estimated their abundance together with five indices of predation. 5. In both species, autotomy rates are higher on islands and decline with most predation indices, in contrast with common wisdom, and increase with gecko abundance. In M. kotschyi, tail-loss rates are higher on predator and viper-free islands, but increase with viper abundance. 6. We suggest that autotomy is not simply, or maybe even mainly, an antipredatory mechanism. Rather, such defence mechanisms are a response to complex direct and indirect biotic interactions and perhaps, in the case of tail autotomy in insular populations, chiefly to intraspecific aggression.","[Itescu, Yuval; Schwarz, Rachel; Meiri, Shai] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Pafilis, Panayiotis] Univ Athens, Dept Biol, Sect Zool & Marine Biol, Athens 15784, Greece","Itescu, Y (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",yuvitescu@gmail.com,"Schwarz, Rachel/AAB-6987-2020; Meiri, Shai/D-2403-2010","Pafilis, Panayiotis/0000-0002-1832-4906; Meiri, Shai/0000-0003-3839-6330",Israel Science Foundation (ISF)Israel Science Foundation [1005/12],"We thank Alex Slavenko, Aviv Bejerano, Stav Brown, Colin Donihue, Nir Einav, Tamar Freud, Alison Gainsbury, Efrat Golan, Eden Goshen, Anat Hartmann, Simon Jamison, Lama Khoury, Menachem Kurzits, Shani Levinkind, Amir Lewin, Michael Mosses, Gaya Savion, Eylon Sharoni, Achiad Sviri, Oliver Tallowin, Karin Tamar, Alexandros Vezyrakis and Keren-Or Werheimer for their valuable help with field work.

Consequently, a species geographical distribution is related to population dynamics through density-dependent processes. Small Arctic rodents are important prey species in many Arctic ecosystems. They commonly show large cyclic fluctuations in abundance offering a potential to investigate how landscape characteristics relates to density-dependent habitat selection. Based on long-term summer trapping data of the Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) in the Scandinavian Mountain tundra, we applied species distribution modeling to test if the effect of environmental variables on lemming distribution changed in relation to the lemming cycle. Lemmings were less habitat specific during the peak phase, as their distribution was only related to primary productivity. During the increase phase, however, lemming distribution was, in addition, associated with landscape characteristics such as hilly terrain and slopes that are less likely to get flooded. Lemming habitat use varied during the cycle, suggesting density-dependent changes in habitat selection that could be explained by intraspecific competition. We believe that the distribution patterns observed during the increase phase show a stronger ecological signal for habitat preference and that the less specific habitat use during the peak phase is a result of lemmings grazing themselves out of the best habitat as the population grows. Future research on lemming winter distribution would make it possible to investigate the year around strategies of habitat selection in lemmings and a better understanding of a fundamental actor in many Arctic ecosystems.","[Le Vaillant, Maryline; Erlandsson, Rasmus; Elmhagen, Bodil; Angerbjorn, Anders] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hornfeldt, Birger] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Eide, Nina E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, POB 5685, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway","Le Vaillant, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",levaillant.mary@gmail.com,"Angerbjorn, Anders/AAX-3670-2021; Angerbjorn, Anders/A-5982-2013; Elmhagen, Bodil/M-4444-2014","Erlandsson, Rasmus/0000-0002-9207-5709; Angerbjorn, Anders/0000-0001-5535-9086; Elmhagen, Bodil/0000-0001-5496-4727",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; county administration board in Jamtland; county administration board Vasterbotten; EU LIFE project SEFALO; EU LIFE project SEFALO+; Stockholm University; Fjallraven AB; Swedish Research Council FORMASSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; EU/Interreg Sweden-Norway [20200939]; Goran Gustafsson Foundation; World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF); Norwegian Environment Agency; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [208418/F40],"We thank our many volunteers that did a great job carrying out the field work.

Under predation pressure, potential prey may adopt evasive strategies. These responses can be costly and could impact population growth. As some prey species may be more affected than others, predation pressure could also alter the dynamics among species within communities. In field cages and small observation cages, we studied the interactions between a generalist predator, the African weaver ant, Oecophylla longinoda, two species of fruit flies that are primary pests of mango fruits, Ceratitis cosyra and Bactrocera dorsalis, and their two exotic parasitoids, Fopius arisanus and Diachasmimorpha longicaudata. In all experiments, either a single individual (observation cage experiments) or groups of individuals (field cage experiments) of a single species were exposed to foraging in the presence or absence of weaver ants. Weaver ant presence reduced the number of eggs laid by 75 and 50 percent in B. dorsalis and C. cosyra respectively. Similarly, parasitoid reproductive success was negatively affected by ant presence, with success of parasitism reduced by around 50 percent for both F. arisanus and D. longicaudata. The negative effect of weaver ants on both flies and parasitoids was mainly due to indirect predation effects. Encounters with weaver ant workers increased the leaving tendency in flies and parasitoids, thus reduced the time spent foraging on mango fruits. Parasitoids were impacted more strongly than fruit flies. We discuss how weaver ant predation pressure may affect the population dynamics of the fruit flies, and, in turn, how the alteration of host dynamics could impact parasitoid foraging behaviour and success.","[Migani, Valentina; Merkel, Katharina; Hoffmeister, Thomas] Univ Bremen, Inst Ecol, Fac Biol Chem, Bremen, Germany; [Ekesi, Sunday] ICIPE, Nairobi, Kenya; [Merkel, Katharina] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Migani, V (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Inst Ecol, Fac Biol Chem, Bremen, Germany.",migani@uni-bremen.de,"Hoffmeister, Thomas S/E-2804-2013; Hoffmeister, Thomas S./AAH-7796-2020; Ekesi, Sunday/P-8944-2019; Migani, Valentina/AAF-9746-2020","Hoffmeister, Thomas S/0000-0003-2840-7278; Hoffmeister, Thomas S./0000-0003-2840-7278; ",German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ project) [10.7860.9-001.00],This research was supported by funds from the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ project No: 10.7860.9-001.00).,,61,8,9,0,14,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,FEB 1,2017,12,2,,,,,,,e0170101,10.1371/journal.pone.0170101,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,EN6RS,WOS:000396131700012,28146561,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-27,

Antlion larvae usually occur in clusters with a high density of individuals; therefore, competition can be intense. We observed two abundant antlion species, E. nostras and M. formicarius, which co-occur in some habitats. In a simple habitat choice experiment where substrates differed according to sand particle size, we found that E. nostras exhibited dominance over M. formicarius. Most E. nostras larvae remained in the more suitable substrate and constructed pits, while all the M. formicarius larvae moved out of the suitable area, and did not build pits. In the second experiment, we observed the characteristics of the pit-fall traps and scored the occurrence of larval relocation in relation to interactions and in the control group, where larvae were kept in containers separately. In interactions, the larvae of E. nostras constructed smaller pits, but pit enlargement was greater in comparison to the control group. M. formicarius larvae constructed similar sized pits in both groups; however, enlargement was greater in the control group. Relocation of larvae occurred only during interactions. In direct interactions, we found 15 behavioural patterns, which are described in detail for the first time. In the presence of a competitor, larvae showed intense territorial behaviour. We recorded several behavioural patterns during larval confrontation, and interestingly, intraguild predation rarely occurred. In most cases, E. nostras larvae outcompete M. formicarius, which was evident from the larger pits and the rate of pit-construction.","[Klokocovnik, Vesna; Veler, Eva; Devetak, Dusan] Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Koroska Cesta 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia","Klokocovnik, V (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Koroska Cesta 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",vesna.klokocovnik@um.si,,,Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia; Research Programme Computationally Intensive Complex Systems [P1-0403],This research was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency and the Research Programme Computationally Intensive Complex Systems (Grant No. P1-0403).,,50,2,2,1,1,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

Because both species have a similar lifestyle and are food limited, the question arises as to how coexistence persists. Laboratory experiments investigated if either leech has a competitive advantage on three foods, viz. oligochaete worms (Tubifex sp.), snails (Lymnaea peregra), and a worm-plus-snail mixture. A variety of densities with a range of ratios of the two leeches, and monospecific controls were used. The level of feeding ensured increasing food shortage with rising leech density. Experiments, conducted at 14-degrees-C, lasted 3 months. Regression values for growth against density in the controls indicated the occurrence of intraspecific competition in both leech species. Light mortality occurred at the highest densities. G. complanata gained significantly less weight in mixed leech cultures than in monospecific cultures at some of the highest densities when fed worms, but more weight when fed on snails. The opposite was true for H. stagnalis. When both prey types were provided, no differences at any density were observed for either leech. Differences in body-size and feeding strategy between the leeches may be implicated in determining their feeding success on the prey types. Because the anti-predatory responses (e.g. shaking) exhibited by L. peregra are less when encountering an inactive than an active leech, the sit-and-wait strategy of G. complanata may aid snail capture. In contrast, the seek-out strategy of H. stagnalis, coupled with its relatively smaller size, may result in fewer successful captures. The active hunting strategy of H. stagnalis may be advantageous for the capture of oligochaetes which are relatively less mobile than snails. Offering both prey types simultaneously would have had an ameliorating influence on interactions between the two leeches. Findings provide support for the hypothesis that long-term co-existence between the two glossiphoniids in British lakes may depend, in part at least, on the occurrence of a snail food refuge for G. complanata.",,"YOUNG, JO (corresponding author), UNIV LIVERPOOL, DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, POB 147, LIVERPOOL L69 3BX, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,31,11,11,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,1993,93,2,,,,,156,161,,10.1007/BF00317664,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KR753,WOS:A1993KR75300002,28313600,,,,2021-09-27,

Adult Laccotrephes japonensis (Nepidae), first-instar nymph of Kirkaldyia (=Lethocerus) deyrolli (Belostomatidae), Hyla japonica tadpole, and fourth-instar nymph of Appasus japonicus (Belostomatidae) have been shown to be intraguild predator, intraguild prey, common prey, and prey of L. japonensis, respectively. To further understand the factors affecting prey preference by L. japonensis, we also examined the comparison of swimming speed in the three prey animals (K. deyrolli first-instar nymph, A. japonicus fourth-instar nymph, and H. japonica tadpole), and effects of prey animals on weight gain of L. japonensis adult. Despite there being no significant difference in weight gain or swimming speed of the three prey species, L. japonensis exhibited a strong preference for the 1st-instar nymph of K. deyrolli. We suggested that this may be evidence for one of elimination of a potential competitor, K. deyrolli, by L. japonensis through intraguild predation.","[Ohba, Shin-ya] Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Vector Ecol & Environm, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan; [Ohba, Shin-ya] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Lab Insect Ecol, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Swart, Charles C.] Trinity Coll, Dept Biol, Hartford, CT 06111 USA; [Swart, Charles C.] Trinity Coll, Neurosci Program, Hartford, CT 06111 USA","Ohba, S (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Dept Vector Ecol & Environm, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan.",oobug@hotmail.com,"Ohba, Shin-ya/M-5406-2019","Ohba, Shin-ya/0000-0003-3854-0902",,,,28,3,6,1,5,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

These are that alternative states (1) are in the same location, (2) experience the same environment, (3) persist for multiple generations, (4) resist repeated perturbations, and (5) result from a pulse manipulation. In 1974, we initiated an experiment testing the ability of Ascophyllum nodosum-dominated rocky intertidal communities to recover from complete canopy removal. Manipulations were monitored frequently for 5 yr after clearance and resurveyed again after a 35-yr hiatus. After clearance, Ascophyllum was replaced immediately by another fucoid alga, Fucus spp, which continued to dominate the space through 1979 despite regular annual recruitment by Ascophyllum. Observations in 2009 revealed that Fucus spp. still dominated the cleared plots. Surveys in 2011 and 2013 demonstrated that Fucus persisted in experimental plots and Ascophyllum persisted in adjacent, unmanipulated plots. All criteria for testing an alternative state were met. Fucus persisted through multiple generations of both fucoids, a steady annual rain of recruits of both species, a high frequency of storm-driven perturbations, and it resulted from a pulse manipulation. Likely mechanisms include poor Ascophyllum recruitment directly under the Fucus spp. canopy despite abundant recruitment in adjacent areas, self-maintenance by Fucus spp. through high recruitment and fast growth, and recruitment facilitation of Fucus by the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. Several lines of evidence indicate that other possible mechanisms including indirect facilitation of fucoids through predation on competitors (mussels), and positive or negative effects of littorine grazing, are unlikely. Although prior results in Maine suggested that the mussel Mytilus edulis was an alternative stable state, the new results suggest that Fucus spp. was the alternative state to Ascophyllum. During the nearly four decades of this experiment, a number of important species including fucoids, littorine grazers, and mussels all declined in abundance, most likely due to climate change. The presumed impact of climate change makes prediction of the long-term response of this system difficult, but it already differs dramatically from its structure in the 1970s.","[Menge, Bruce A.; Lubchenco, Jane] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Cordley Hall 3029, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Bracken, Matthew E.

The experiments were conducted using oyster shell habitats constructed in the intertidal zone. First we tested whether crab losses from intertidal shell habitat constructed in the intertidal zone. First we tested whether crab losses from intertidal shell habitat were due to density-dependent emigration, density-dependent predation, or both. Our results show that although both processes account for crab losses, predation is not density-dependent, and most crabs had emigrated rather than being eaten at high crab density. Field experiments were also conducted to test the effect of crab density, food availability and conspecific physical contact on crab emigration. Treatments were different densities of free crabs to allow physical contact between them or individually caged crabs to prevent physical contact, with or without enhanced food (small clams). Emigration of crabs from experimental shell habitat increased with density of free crabs, irrespective of whether food was enhanced or risk of predation increased. Our results suggest that physical interactions regulate density because: (1) the per capita consumption rate of clams in the artificial shell plots was significantly lower at high crab density; and (2) density of enclosed crabs did not affect the immigration rate of conspecifics. Although the ultimate cause may be competition for food or avoidance of cannibalism, we suggest that when crab recruitment to epibenthic shell substratum has been successful, crab density over the short term is regulated primarily by space competition mediated by physical interactions.",,"IRIBARNE, O (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH FISHERIES,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.",,,,,,,43,38,38,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Thus, from a slightly different perspective, aphids, other herbivorous insects, and plants often may interact indirectly by sharing natural enemies. Such interactions may be either negative or positive, as in the concepts of apparent competition and apparent mutualism, and may therefore have variable impact on the herbivores' host plants as well. I examine the different mechanisms for such indirect effects among herbivores as explored in the experimental literature. An impressive collective effort by numerous researchers recently has expanded considerably our empirical base of support for a variety of hypothesized mechanisms; aphids stand out as the most commonly Studied Subjects in research on these mechanisms. I therefore focus especially on the recent literature of cases involving aphids interacting indirectly with other prey for generalist predators. My remarks are organized by considering how the availability of alternate prey may alter functional and numerical (aggregative and reproductive) responses of predators to focal prey density. Although the distinctions among these different classes of predator responses and the associated indirect effects are often blurred and scale-dependent, this classification remains useful for organizing the diverse ways in which aphids have been found to participate in indirect interactions among prey as mediated by predators. Collectively, the results of the numerous studies reviewed here Suggest that many such indirect interactions likely occur frequently in natural settings, with consequences ultimately for host plant performance.","Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Evans, EW (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ewevans@biology.usu.edu,,,Utah Agricultural Experiment Station; Utah State University Ecology Center,"I thank the organizing committee of the Tenth International Symposium oil Ecology of Aphidophaga (Athens, Greece, September 2007) for the invitation to prepare and present this review.

Exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were stocked from 1994 in naturally fishless lakes, the primary reproductive habitat of this grebe. Trout and grebes are visual predators, whose diets overlap. Consequently, trout could reduce the abundance of prey of the hooded grebe. This study compared the size distribution and abundance of the pelagic zooplankton fraction preyed upon by trout in four fishless lakes and three lakes stocked with trout, including vegetated and unvegetated lakes. The mean size of Daphnia spp. was 45% and 35% larger in fishless lakes than in stocked lakes, for unvegetated and vegetated lakes, respectively. Boeckella spp. were larger in fishless than in stocked vegetated lakes. Fishless and stocked lakes had highly contrasting biomasses of large pelagic crustaceans. Amphipods were absent from the water column of all stocked lakes analysed, and were abundant in fishless lakes. Parabroteas sarsi was absent from the two large unvegetated lakes, stocked with trout. These shifts in the abundance and size spectrum of the zooplankton may reflect competition between trout and hooded grebe, affecting the survival of the latter species. The current conservation status of this rare aquatic bird demands the application of management tools to reduce the detrimental effects of aquaculture on their primary reproductive habitat.

While its occurrence is predicted to increase in the future, we have little understanding of mechanisms that underlie changes in the fish community associated with coral degradation. The present study uses a field-based experiment to examine how the intensity of interference competition between juveniles of two species of damselfish changes as healthy corals degrade through thermal bleaching. The mortality of a damselfish that is a live coral specialist (Pomacentrus moluccensis) increased on bleached and dead coral in the presence of the habitat generalist (Pomacentrus amboinensis). Increased mortality of the specialist was indirectly owing to enhanced aggression by the generalist forcing the specialist higher up and further away from shelter on bleached and dead coral.

Interactions between predators mediate their impact on mussel prey, and thus have indirect effects on the mussel bed community. We studied the effects of predator density and species composition on mussel predation by green crabs (Carcinus maenas) and dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus). We conducted an experiment in which predators at high and low natural intertidal densities were enclosed with mussels, in either single- or multiple-predator species treatments. Biomass consumed by each species in each treatment was determined and effects of multiple predators on consumption rates were estimated. Mean size of mussels eaten by each predator species was also measured and compared between treatments. Feeding by whelks and crabs was inhibited by conspecifics, and whelk foraging was also depressed in the presence of crabs. The presence of whelks had a positive effect on crab foraging, which may have moderated the negative effects of intraspecific competition between crabs. Sizes of mussels consumed did not differ statistically between treatments. In mixed-species treatments, crabs appear to have kleptoparasitized mussels being eaten by whelks, possibly facilitating consumption of larger mussels by crabs. Results indicate that interactions between invertebrate predators of blue mussels cause shifts in the feeding patterns of these predators, and are therefore an important part of mussel bed community dynamics.

The high densities of invasive coqui frogs (Eleutherodactylus coqui) in Hawaii have been hypothesized to increase non-native mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) and rat (Rattus spp.) abundances, and in turn increase bird nest depredation rates. We compared the relative abundances of rats and mongooses and artificial bird nest predation rates at 12 sites that had plots with similar habitat invaded and not invaded by coqui frogs across the island of Hawaii. We interpret our results considering mongoose and rat stomach analyses and camera trap data collected to monitor coqui scavengers. We found that coqui presence was associated with 30% greater mongoose abundance and 17% lower Pacific rat (R. exulans) abundance. Based on our diet analyses and scavenging data, both mongooses and rats consume coquis, but mongooses were the most important consumers of coquis, which may have contributed to their increase in coqui plots. We speculate that coquis are competing with rats for invertebrate prey due to reduced Pacific rat abundance and greater amounts of fruit in rat stomachs collected in coqui-invaded compared to uninvaded plots. We did not observe any difference in birdnest predation rates in coqui-invaded and uninvaded plots. Our results suggest that the coqui invasion may increase or decrease non-native mammal populations, and non-native amphibians may serve as both novel prey and competitors to non-native mammals.","[Hill, Shane A.; Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hill, Shane A.; Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Siers, Shane R.] USDA, APHIS, Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr,Hawaii Field Stn, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Shiels, Aaron B.] USDA, APHIS, Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA","Beard, KH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Beard, KH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",karen.beard@usu.edu,"Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011","Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495; Siers, Shane/0000-0001-7961-5072","USDA APHIS NWRC; USU Ecology Center; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University","We thank the USDA APHIS NWRC and the USU Ecology Center for funding; the NWRC Hilo field station and technicians, A.

Because intraspecific aggregation of competing insect larvae across, e.show $132#g. fruits, dung, mushrooms etc., is an important means by which many species can coexist (aggregation model of species coexistence), there is a strong need to explore the mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of this kind of spatial resource exploitation. In the present study, by using Drosophila-parasitoid interactions as a model system, we tested the hypothesis whether intraspecific aggregation reflects an adaptive response to natural enemies. Most of the studies that have hitherto been carried out on Drosophila-parasitoid interactions used an almost two-dimensional artificial host environment, where host larvae could not escape from parasitoid attacks, and have demonstrated positive density-dependent parasitism risk. To test whether these studies captured the essence of such interactions, we used natural breeding substrates (decaying fruits). In a first step, we analysed the parasitism risk of Drosophila larvae on a three-dimensional substrate in natural fly communities in the field, and found that the risk of parasitism decreased with increasing host larval density (inverse density dependence). In a second step, we analysed the parasitism risk of Drosophila subobscura larvae on three breeding substrate types exposed to the larval parasitoids Asobara tabida and Leptopilina heterotoma. We found direct density-dependent parasitism on decaying sloes, inverse density dependence on plums, and a hump-shaped relationship between fly larval density and parasitism risk on crab apples. On crab apples and plums, fly larvae benefited from a density-dependent refuge against the parasitoids. While the proportion of larvae feeding within the fruit tissues increased with larval density, larvae within the fruit tissues were increasingly less likely to become victims of parasitoids than those exposed at the fruit surface. This suggests a facilitating effect of group-feeding larvae on reaching the spatial refuge. We conclude that spatial aggregation in Drosophila communities can at least in part be explained as a predator avoidance strategy, whereby natural enemies act as selective agents maintaining spatial patterns of resource utilisation in their host communities.","Univ Kiel, Inst Zool, Dept Anim Ecol, D-24098 Kiel, Germany","Rohlfs, M (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Zool, Dept Anim Ecol, Bot Garten 1-9, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",rohlfs@zoologie.uni-kiel.de,"Hoffmeister, Thomas S/E-2804-2013; Rohlfs, Marko/A-8686-2011; Rohlfs, Marko/AAF-6749-2019; Hoffmeister, Thomas S./AAH-7796-2020","Hoffmeister, Thomas S/0000-0003-2840-7278; Hoffmeister, Thomas S./0000-0003-2840-7278; Rohlfs, Marko/0000-0002-8767-1629",,,,38,40,40,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2004,140,4,,,,,654,661,,10.1007/s00442-004-1629-9,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,845TF,WOS:000223266500015,15232730,,,,2021-09-27,

Furthermore, our view of phytophagous insect populations is probably biased by the more frequent attention given to economic pests whose dynamics might be expected to be somewhat exceptional. Herein, we report on the population dynamics and community-level features in a diverse, native fauna of phytophagous insects associated with goldenrod (Solidago altissima), a native perennial plant that forms a dominant, long-persisting element in old-field succession. The data consist of censuses taken in six consecutive years at 16 old fields in the Finger Lakes Region of New York; five additional stands were followed for four consecutive years. Our analyses address two questions: (a) to what extent is the functional structure of the community (as reflected in such attributes to the herbivore load, guild spectrum, and dominance hierarchy) maintained by compensatory changes in the densities of the member species and (b) are certain traits associated with a species' tendency to fluctuate in density or to dominate the community? In general, populations of goldenrod insects fluctuated less than those of insects reported in the literature. Few were abundant; only 7 of the 138 species in the goldenrod fauna ever reached densities at which their biomass exceeded 0. 1% of the leaf biomass. The functional structure of the community, as reflected in the total herbivore load and the proportions of that load contributed by various guilds, varied widely in space and time. A small subset of the fauna remained dominant throughout the study; these species, whose populations occasionally irrupted, retained their high rank in relative abundance even during those periods when their populations were waning. There was no evidence for compensatory changes in the densities of species within guilds, as would be expected if a relatively distinct set of limiting resources were available to insects with different feeding styles. Species were no more likely to exhibit negative correlations with their guild mates than they were with members of other guilds. There was also little evidence of sporadic or diffuse competition within the fauna as a whole; even during population outbreaks, the dominant species rarely engendered decreases in the biomass or diversity of the remaining species, and increases in the total herbivore load were seldom associated with losses of species from the community. Several species were positively associated with one another on the basis of similar habitat requirements or the use by one species of conditions created by the presence of another. The community was predictable only in the sense that dominant species remained dominant and rare species rare. The abundance and population variability of species were not correlated with such traits as body size, generation time, or host range. Taxon-related trends, on the other hand, stood out; coleopterans tended to be abundant whereas lepidopterans were rare, and hemipterans tended to fluctuate widely whereas dipterans remained relatively constant. Furthermore, species that were clumped in space (onto stems within fields) tended to be abundant and variable. The boom and bust dynamics of these aggregating species may be related to the ability of colonies to survive the inroads of generalist predators. The low degree of regional synchrony in the performance of populations at different sites suggests that large-scale, weather-driven fluctuations are uncommon. Our analysis of this well-developed, native insect fauna reveals a community that has a somewhat predictable structure that reflects the idiosyncracies of the component species. These species do not fluctuate in an integrated community-structuring manner, but as an outcome of each species performing at its individualistic' level, the community displays a characteristic dominance hierarchy. The members of this diverse fauna rarely achieve densities at which they compete with one another. Our results are consistent with Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin's hypothesis (1960) which predicts that terrestrial herbivores rarely deplete plant resources to levels at which there is widespread interspecific competition.",,"ROOT, RB (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV, CORSON LAB, ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,93,138,139,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD; also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease) has been introduced recently as a biocontrol agent for rabbits in Australia. The consequences for fox populations that use rabbits as primary prey, for populations of alternative native prey, and for pastures, were examined using a model for rabbit- and fox-prone areas of semi-arid southern Australia. 2. Existing data were used to quantify the interactions of foxes, rabbits and pasture. A generic model for predation on native herbivores was constructed by modifying the density-dependent (Type III) functional response of foxes to rabbits to a depensatory (Type II) response that is appropriate for alternative prey. Similar dependence on pasture biomass was assumed for the dynamics of both rabbits and alternative prey in order to identify clearly the consequences of differing predation. In the absence of quantitative data for Australian conditions, the epidemiology of RCD was simulated empirically to mimic a range of potential patterns of occurrence. 3. For semi-arid Australia the model predicts that as the frequency and intensity of RCD epizootics increases: (i) the mean abundance of rabbits will decline, as will the frequency of eruptions of rabbits; (ii) there may be little increase in mean pasture biomass and a small decrease in periods of very low pasture biomass when competition between herbivores is most intense; (iii) the mean abundance of foxes will decline; (iv) there will be a reduced frequency of occasions when rabbit density is low but fox density is high due to a lag in the response of predator populations; and (v) there is potential for an increase in the mean abundance of alternative prey and in the proportion of time their density exceeds a threshold comparable to that currently required for eruptions of rabbits.","CSIRO Wildlife & Ecol, Lyneham, ACT 2602, Australia","Pech, RP (corresponding author), CSIRO Wildlife & Ecol, POB 84, Lyneham, ACT 2602, Australia.",,,,,,,53,67,69,1,19,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The purpose of this paper is to report on field and laboratory experiments that link this pattern of abundance to biotic interactions among larvae. In the first field experiment, growth and survival were compared in single and mixed species treatments in littoral enclosures. Larvae, which eat mainly vascular plant detritus, grew at similar rates among treatments in both temporary and permanent habitats suggesting that exploitative competition is not important under natural food levels and caddisfly densities. However, the survival of Limnephilus larvae was reduced in the presence of Asynarchus larvae. Subsequent behavioral studies in laboratory arenas revealed that Asynarchus larvae are extremely aggressive predators on Limnephilus larvae. In a second field experiment we manipulated the relative sizes of larvae and found that Limnephilus larvae were preyed on only when Asynarchus larvae had the same size advantage observed in natural populations. Our data suggest that the dominance of Asynarchus larvae in temporary habitats is due to asymmetric intraguild predation (IGP) facilitated by a phenological head start in development. These data do not explain the dominance of Limnephilus larvae in permanent basins, which we show elsewhere to be an indirect effect of salamander predation. Behavioral observations also revealed that Asynarchus larvae are cannibalistic. In contrast to the IGP on Limnephilus larvae, Asynarchus cannibalism occurs among same-sized larvae and often involves the mobbing of one victim by several conspecifics. In a third field experiment, we found that Asynarchus cannibalism was not density-dependent and occurred even at low larval densities. We hypothesize that Asynarchus IGP and cannibalism provide a dietary supplement to detritus that may be necessary for the timely completion of development in these nutrient-poor, high-elevation wetlands.","ALLEGHENY COLL, DEPT ENVIRONM SCI, MEADVILLE, PA 16335 USA; ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA; UNIV COLORADO, DEPT EPO BIOL, BOULDER, CO 80301 USA","Wissinger, SA (corresponding author), ALLEGHENY COLL, DEPT BIOL, MEADVILLE, PA 16335 USA.",,,"Brown, Wendy/0000-0002-7237-1797",,,,70,78,81,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1996,77,8,,,,,2421,2430,,10.2307/2265743,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VY497,WOS:A1996VY49700014,,,,,2021-09-27,

In the face of human-induced declines in the abundance of common species, ecologists have become interested in quantifying how changes in density affect rates of biophysical processes, hence ecosystem function. We manipulated the density of a dominant detritivore (the cased caddisfly, Limnephilus externus) in subalpine ponds to measure effects on the release of detritus-bound nutrients and energy. 2. Detritus decay rates (k, mass loss) increased threefold, and the loss of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from detrital substrates doubled across a range of historically observed caddisfly densities. Ammonium and total soluble phosphorus concentrations in the water column also increased with caddisfly density on some dates. Decay rates, nutrient release and the change in total detritivore biomass all exhibited threshold or declining responses at the highest densities. 3. We attributed these threshold responses in biophysical processes to intraspecific competition for limiting resources manifested at the population level, as density-dependent per-capita consumption, growth, development and case : body size in caddisflies was observed. Moreover, caddisflies increasingly grazed on algae at high densities, presumably in response to limiting detrital resources. 4. These results provide evidence that changes in population size of a common species will have nonlinear, threshold effects on the rates of biophysical processes at the ecosystem level. Given the ubiquity of negative density dependence in nature, nonlinear consumer densityecosystem function relationships should be common across species and ecosystems.","[Klemmer, Amanda J.; Wissinger, Scott A.; Ostrofsky, Milton L.] Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16225 USA; [Klemmer, Amanda J.; Wissinger, Scott A.; Greig, Hamish S.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Klemmer, Amanda J.; Wissinger, Scott A.; Greig, Hamish S.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 1, New Zealand","Klemmer, AJ (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16225 USA.",amanda.klemmer@pg.canterbury.ac.nz,,,New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarship; Harold State Scholarship from Allegheny College,"We thank J.

Laboratory experiments showed that copepodids and adults, but not nauplii, markedly suppressed the population growth of this rotifer. The suppression could be attributed entirely to predation, rather than to exploitative competition for shared food resources or to interference. Mortality rates predicted from a separate feeding-rate experiment were sufficient to account for the decline in population size observed in the Tropocyclops treatment of culture experiments. Also, monitoring the availability of cryptomonad food in treatments with and without Tropocyclops throughout these experiments showed that cryptomonad densities always remained high and were just as high or significantly higher in the copepod treatments. Furthermore, direct videographic observations of P. remata from cultures with and without Tropocyclops demonstrated no significant differences in swimming velocity, tendency to deviate from a straight-line path, or frequency and length of spontaneous escape responses. Per capita ingestion rates of T. extensus on P. remata variedfrom 2 to 8 day(-1), were significantly higher for adult females than adult males or copepodids V, and increased significantly with rotifer density. A tendency of copepods to hat,e higher ingestion rates on young than adult rotifers was not significant. Copepods cultured since birth with cryptomonads and P. remata ate significantly fewer rotifers than those cultured only with cryptomonads; this may be explained by a more sated condition of the former and provided no evidence for the idea that previous experience with this rotifer might increase predation efficiency. The results show that T. extensus in natural communities has the potential to deplete natural populations of susceptible rotifer prey. Accordingly, shift the species structure of rotifer assemblages in favour of resistant species, and provide selection pressure for avoidance responses.","Univ Nacl Comahue Crub, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Dieguez, MC (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue Crub, Unidad Postal Univ, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",,,"Dieguez, Maria/0000-0002-8241-3719",,,,56,26,28,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

In the dry season, P. longipes occurred significantly less frequently on a palm, Prestoea acuminata var. montana (Arecaceae), than the other tree species. Carapace length and the diameter of the tree on which an individual was found were positively correlated, suggesting competition for substrates. Microhabitat selection shifted in the wet season. Individuals occurred as frequently on P. acuminata as on any other species. The seasonal shift in substrate use could result from altered distribution or abundance of prey, an ontogenetic shift in substrate preference or greater competition arising from an increased abundance of P. longipes.","[Curtis, Caroline A.] Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Bloch, Christopher P.] Bridgewater State Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Bridgewater, MA 02325 USA","Curtis, CA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",cacurtis@cns.umass.edu,,,"National Science Foundation to the Institute of Tropical Ecosystem Studies, University of Puerto Rico [DEB-0620910]; International Institute of Tropical Forestry, Long-Term Ecological Research Program in the Luquillo Experimental Forest","This research was supported in part by grant number DEB-0620910 from the National Science Foundation to the Institute of Tropical Ecosystem Studies, University of Puerto Rico, and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry as part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Program in the Luquillo Experimental Forest.

A field experiment was used to test (1) whether predation intensity on the infaunal clam Mercenaria mercenaria (L.) differed between shallow-subtidal and intertidal sand flats, (2) whether predation on clams differed between intertidal sand flats and vegetated habitats [the edge of Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) salt marshes] of similar elevation, and (3) whether the outcome of these comparisons was influenced by the experimental method used. For mobile prey, some restraint on prey movement is typically required to compare predation intensity among different habitats. This is most often achieved by tethering prey. Tethering and other experimental interventions may induce different experimental artifacts in estimates of predation intensity in different habitats, which would invalidate between-habitat comparisons (Peterson & Black 1994: Mar Ecol Frog Ser 111:289-297). I used combinations of 2 types of prey restraint, tethers and buried fences, to test for possible interactive effects of habitat and prey restraint on prey mortality. Tethered or untethered clams were deployed within fenced or unfenced field plots within each habitat type, in a factorial design, and were exposed to the natural assemblage of predators for 1 wk. Within each habitat type, both tethering and fencing increased the proportion of clams recovered Live after 1 wk compared to the treatment in which no prey restraints were used. Significantly more Live clams were recovered in the intertidal sand flats than in the subtidal sand bottoms within field plots enclosed with buried fences, suggesting lower predation intensity in the intertidal than in subtidal sand fiats. In contrast, there was no significant difference in proportions of live clams between subtidal sand bottoms and intertidal sand flats within unfenced plots. These results were obtained with both tethered and untethered clams. Significantly more clams were recovered live in intertidal sand flats than in intertidal salt marshes of similar elevation in all treatment combinations, suggesting lower predation intensity in unvegetated than in vegetated habitats. This result was unexpected because habitat structural complexity is known to decrease predation rates in other shallow marine habitats, such as rocky intertidal habitats and seagrass beds. Results of this field experiment indicate that prey restraints can bias not only estimates of predation intensity within a single habitat type but can also bias between-habitat comparisons of predation intensity, probably by causing experimental artifacts of different magnitudes in each habitat. The actual magnitude of experimental artifacts in each habitat type can only be estimated with direct observations of predator-prey interactions in the field.",,"Micheli, F (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",,,,,,,46,24,24,0,12,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

However, apex predators are often subject to lethal control aimed at minimizing attacks on livestock. Lethal control can affect both the abundance and behaviour of apex predators. These changes could in turn influence the abundance and behaviour of mesopredators. We used remote camera surveys at nine pairs of large Australian rangeland properties, comparing properties that controlled dingoes Canis lupus dingo with properties that did not, to test the effects of predator control on dingo activity and to evaluate the responses of a mesopredator, the feral cat Felis catus. Indices of dingo abundance were generally reduced on properties that practiced dingo control, in comparison with paired properties that did not, although the effect size of control was variable. Dingoes in uncontrolled populations were crepuscular, similar to major prey. In populations subject to control, dingoes became less active around dusk, and activity was concentrated in the period shortly before dawn. Shifts in feral cat abundance indices between properties with and without dingo control were inversely related to corresponding shifts in indices of dingo abundance. There was also a negative relationship between predator visitation rates at individual camera stations, suggesting cats avoided areas where dingoes were locally common. Reduced activity by dingoes at dusk was associated with higher activity of cats at dusk. Our results suggest that effective dingo control not only leads to higher abundance of feral cats, but allows them to optimize hunting behaviour when dingoes are less active. This double effect could amplify the impacts of dingo control on prey species selected by cats. In areas managed for conservation, stable dingo populations may thus contribute to management objectives by restricting feral cat access to prey populations. aSynthesis and applications. Predator control not only reduces indices of apex predator abundance but can also modify their behaviour. Hence, indicators other than abundance, such as behavioural patterns, should be considered when estimating a predator's capacity to effectively interact with lower trophic guilds. Changes to apex predator behaviour may relax limitations on the behaviour of mesopredators, providing enhanced access to resources and prey.","[Brook, Leila A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Johnson, Christopher N.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Ritchie, Euan G.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia","Brook, LA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",leila.brook@my.jcu.edu.au,"Johnson, Chris N/A-7275-2008; Ritchie, Euan/N-1088-2014; Johnson, Christopher N/J-7894-2014","Ritchie, Euan/0000-0003-4410-8868; Johnson, Christopher N/0000-0002-9719-3771",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0877398],"We thank owners and managers for allowing us to survey their properties.

The vulnerability of native biotas to ecological disruption may be especially great on oceanic islands invaded by continental species with unique ecological traits. In part because Hawaii lacks native eusocial insects, social invaders may threaten endemic taxa that are ecologically similar but solitary. Using a combination of field manipulations, molecular analyses, physiological data, and behavioral assays, we identify the mechanisms underlying the displacement of two genera of native solitary Hymenoptera in Hawaii by a social continental invader, the western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica). Experimental removal of V. pensylvanica colonies resulted in increased densities of native Hymenoptera. Endemic Hylaeus bees directly suffer through predation by yellowjackets, and perhaps as a consequence, avoid floral resources occupied by V. pensylvanica. Native Nesodynerus wasps also avoid V. pensylvanica but are negatively affected by yellowjackets not through predation, but through exploitative competition for caterpillar prey. Displacement of native solitary Hymenoptera may be heightened by the ability of V. pensylvanica to prey upon and scavenge honey bees and to rob their honey stores, resources unavailable to endemic bees and wasps because of their specialized niches. Our study provides a unique example of an ecologically generalized social invader that restructures native assemblages of solitary Hymenoptera by interacting with endemic taxa on multiple trophic levels.","[Wilson, E.

Like other Conoidea, Terebridae are typified by the presence of a venom gland and a highly specialized radula, which they use for hunting. Remarkably, some lineages of the family exhibit a tendency to reduction and complete loss of the radula, venom gland and proboscis. Recent studies on the mollusc community of Murray Beach (Nha Trang Bay, southern Vietnam) revealed an unusually rich and diverse fauna of Terebridae in a limited area of monotonous sandy sediments at depths of 6 to 18 m. In the present paper, mechanisms of resource partitioning between 16 syntopic Terebridae species from Murray Beach are studied using stable isotope analysis (SIA). The terebrid species studied exhibit considerable variation in isotopic signatures: mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of different species ranged between -16.9 and -9.3%, and between 5.8 and 9.5%, respectively. Although the isotopic niches of the species overlap considerably, the 5 most abundant species, contributing similar to 80% to the total abundance of the terebrid community, show little or no overlap. The studied Terebridae belong to 5 major phylogenetic lineages. By integrating phylogenetic data with the SIA results, we infer possible mechanisms of adaptive radiation in the family. Closely-related species within most phylogenetic clades, especially Clades E1 and E5, are well separated in isotopic niche space. In contrast, members of different clades overlap considerably in isotopic niche space, suggesting that trophic specialization has occurred independently in the evolution of different Terebridae lineages.","[Fedosov, A.

Native species are often not the primary prey of these predators, which depend on introduced mice and rabbits as their primary food source. Theoretical models predict that predation risk for a subsidiary, or secondary prey species is inversely proportional to its population size. This prediction was tested by a quasi-natural experiment in which four different sized prey colonies were constructed at four existing sooty shearwater breeding sites. Domestic hens' eggs were placed in shearwater burrows immediately following the shearwater breeding season and egg predation rates monitored at five, ten and fifteen days. Treatments were switched between sites and the experiment run for a second time after a two-week stand-down period. The net effect of increasing colony size was to lower individual risk of predation. The larger number of individuals present served to effectively buffer, or dilute, per-capita predation risk from predators whose numbers are fixed by extraneous factors: chiefly the abundance of their primary prey. Although eggs were removed more slowly from smaller colonies than from larger ones, each loss had a greater per-capita effect on individual mortality risk. The inverse density dependent relationship found between colony size and predation risk implies that predator population dynamics are largely independent of secondary prey numbers. Abundant introduced predators can therefore easily drive a small secondary prey population to extinction. Control of primary prey populations may be an important management tool in these circumstances.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Jones, C (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Alexandra, New Zealand.",,,,,,,60,17,17,0,22,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2003,102,1,,,,,57,66,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12451.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,693BD,WOS:000183694000006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Coexistence of invasive species of no common evolutionary history in their new ranges enables the study of ecological rules shaping novel communities at their initial stages. In oligohaline parts of the Baltic Sea, the most dominant and widespread epifaunal suspension feeders are invasive mussels Dreissena polymorpha and cirripeds Amphibalanus improvisus. This study experimentally evaluated recruitment and microhabitat use in response to environmental forcing in these two species in a eutrophic bay. Recruitment was structured by different microhabitat exploitation patterns coupled with both individual and interactive effects of several environmental gradients. Despite functional similarity, the importance of environmental gradients differed between these species: mussel recruitment was best explained by temperature while barnacle recruitment was best explained by wave exposure. Zebra mussels were more fastidious about surface orientation than barnacles. The preferred orientations also differed between species, as mussels strongly preferred horizontal surfaces, while barnacles were more abundant on vertical surfaces. Increase in one species also predicted well the abundance of the other, especially for barnacles, as mussel abundance was the best predictor of barnacle abundance over all the other factors. The extent of microhabitat segregation correlated weakly over the studied range of the most important environmental gradients. The study shows that coexistence of functionally similar non-native D. polymorpha and A. improvisus in their sympatric range is likely determined by complex interactions between these species, their different microhabitat exploitation patterns, environmental limitations and optima.

A number of field experiments have shown that top-down control by avian predators can limit grasshopper populations, but the effects of avian predators on grasshopper populations can differ between years and between sites in the same habitat. I conducted experiments examining grasshopper populations in avian exclosures and control plots for 3 yr at two locations in eastern Montana. Avian predation had variable direct and indirect effects on grasshopper communities at the two locations. Grasshopper population densities, species richness, and diversity at the two sites were not consistently significantly affected by avian predation, indicative of weaker top-down effects. The effects of predation varied among years and between the two sites. Avian predators modified body size composition of grasshopper populations through size-selective predation on medium-bodied grasshoppers. Even in years when avian predators did not limit grasshopper populations, selective predation seemed to indirectly mediate competitive interactions among grasshoppers. Birds reduced the proportion of presumably competitively superior medium-bodied grasshoppers, and small-bodied grasshoppers increased in abundance.","USDA, ARS, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Branson, DH (corresponding author), USDA, ARS, No Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",dbranson@sidney.ars.usda.gov,,,,,,25,14,22,0,23,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Yet the influence of resource availability-critical for survival and reproduction-on small carnivore habitat use within these modified environments is poorly understood. We conducted camera-trap surveys within a seasonally dry tropical forest fragment (148 km(2)) in northeastern Thailand to better understand the influence resource availability has on small carnivore habitat use within fragmented areas. Species occupancy models including both habitat and resource variables were assessed across periods of high and low resource availability (fruit abundance and rodent biomass). Species with similar resource or habitat preferences may also compete when resources are low. Therefore, we tested species with shared preferences for patterns of spatial co-occurrence and temporal overlap. Fruit availability influenced the distribution of common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), while rodent biomass influenced Asiatic jackal (Canis aureus), leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), and small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), but only during annual periods of scarcity. In contrast, small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was highly selective for a specific habitat (dry dipterocarp forest) regardless of seasonal fluctuations in food availability. Occupancy increased for all species during periods of resource scarcity, with leopard cat and Asiatic jackal experiencing the greatest increases (139% and 58%, respectively). Species with shared resource and habitat preferences appeared to avoid each other, either spatially or temporally. For example, leopard cat and Asiatic jackal co-occurred spatially less than would be expected, though only when rodents were scarce. Similarly, small Indian civet and small Asian mongoose, which used the same habitat and co-occurred spatially at a rate greater than expected, were active at different times. Our results indicate that seasonal resource fluctuations and interspecific interactions strongly influence the distribution of sympatric small carnivores in a fragmented forest.

Several studies have typified species of echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks as the most important herbivores and carnivores of intertidal assemblages. Unfortunately, little is known about the diet and behavior of many consumers, making difficult addressing key issues related to the importance of omni vory, intra-and inter-specific competition, or individual specialization. The goal of this paper is to fill some gaps in the available information and provide researchers with an exhaustive dietary analysis and relevant ecological descriptors for a suite of 30 consumer species distributed along the southeastern Pacific coast. Our data integrate information collected through seasonal samplings conducted between 2004 and 2007 at 4 localities distributed over 1,000 km of coast in northern Chile. Based on laboratory and field work analysis, we present: (a) a consumer-resource matrix obtained from high-resolution analyses of gut contents of 6,377 individuals, including 222 prey items (80% identified at species or genus level); (b) estimates of the density, body size (length and weight), diet width (at individual and species levels), and within-individual diversity of consumer species; (c) an nMDS ordination of the compositional similarity of consumers' diets, and information on the relative importance and occurrence frequency of the most common preys of each consumer. Based on the high frequency of omnivory and the high diet overlap among consumers, we discuss their potential for competition and the role of individual specialization in shaping their generalist character, highlighting the need to reappraise their behavior and ecological effects in the intertidal community.","[Camus, Patricio A.; Arancibia, Paulina A.; Isidora Avila-Thieme, M.] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Concepcion, Chile; [Arancibia, Paulina A.; Isidora Avila-Thieme, M.] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Programa Magister Ecol Marina, Concepcion, Chile","Camus, PA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Casilla 297, Concepcion, Chile.",pcamus@ucsc.cl,"Avila-Thieme, M.

To test this model, we employed the comparative-experimental method to investigate these processes at 16-44 wave-exposed rocky intertidal sites in Oregon, California, and New Zealand, varying in average upwelling and/or downwelling during spring-summer. As predicted by the IUH, ecological subsidies (phytoplankton abundance, prey recruitment rates), prey responses (barnacle colonization, mussel growth), and species interactions (competition rate, predation rate and effects) were unimodally related to upwelling. On average, unimodal relationships with upwelling magnitude explained approximate to 50% of the variance in the various processes, and unimodal and monotonic positive relationships against an index of intermittency explained approximate to 37% of the variance. Regressions among the ecological subsidies and species interactions were used to infer potential ecological linkages that underpinned these patterns. Abundance of phytoplankton was associated with increases in rates of barnacle colonization, intensity of competition and predation, and predation effects, and rates of barnacle recruitment were associated with increases in mussel growth, barnacle colonization, and species interactions. Positive effects on interactions were also seen for rates of colonization, competition, predation, and predation effects. Several responses were saturating or exponential, suggestive of threshold effects. These results suggest that the IUH has geographic generality and are also consistent with earlier arguments that bottom-up effects and propagule subsidies are strongly linked to the dynamics of higher trophic levels, or top-down effects, as well as to nontrophic interactions. The approximate to 50% of the variance not explained by upwelling is likely due to more regional-to-local influences on the processes examined, and future efforts should focus on incorporating such effects into the IUH.","[Menge, Bruce A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Menge, Duncan N.

A behavioral experiment demonstrated that an individual of either species was less likely to feed on a recently grazed patch when the prior forager was T. aureotincta. Both snails responded only to the amount of food available on a patch, and, except at very low food levels, the likelihood that a snail would remain to feed was identical for the two species across microalgal densities. Where food was scarce, T. eiseni was more likely than T. aureotincta to feed in that patch. Density-dependent effects on microalgal standing stock differed between the snails; at low grazer densities, T. aureotincta depressed food levels to a comparatively greater degree, whereas at high grazer densities, T. eiseni had a relatively greater effect. The relative growth performance of the snails differed as a function of available food: T. aureotincta had superior body growth at high resource densities, while T. eiseni grew comparatively better at low microalgal densities. Differences in effects on and growth responses to microalgae arose from dissimilar foraging characteristics of the snails. Compared with T. eiseni, T. aureotincta moved more rapidly while feeding, harvested twice as great an area per unit time, but was unable to crop microalgae as close to rock surfaces. While T. eiseni grazed a smaller area per unit time, it removed relatively more microalgae per area grazed. These differing suites of foraging attributes may represent a trade-off to harvest food at different densities: cropping closer to the substratum (area intensive grazing) yields more food when microalgae are scarce, but precludes grazing a larger area per unit time (area extensive grazing) through fast movement, which provides a greater food intake when microalgae are abundant. If an area extensive (moves faster)-intensive (digs deeper) trade-off is a common feature of benthic grazer systems, knowledge of this aspect could provide great predictive insight into the patterns and causes of density dependence arising from exploitation.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, INST MARINE SCI,COASTAL RES CTR, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA","Schmitt, RJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,104,49,50,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1996,77,2,,,,,408,425,,10.2307/2265618,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TY198,WOS:A1996TY19800006,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, how interspecific differences in defence ability affect habitat partitioning amongst competing prey species remains unresolved. We examined how prey defences affect species distribution in a natural ecosystem: the aquatic food web within Neotropical bromeliads. We first related differences in prey (mosquito) density to the presence and absence of predatory damselfly larvae. We then quantified behavioural responses to predators in the two most abundant mosquito species, and the effects of these behaviours on predator consumption rates. In the absence of damselflies, Wyeomyia was the most abundant mosquito genus in natural bromeliads. However, Wyeomyia numbers were reduced in the presence of damselflies. Numbers of the genus Culex increased with bromeliad size irrespective of the presence of damselflies. As a result of the differing effects of plant size and damselflies on the two genera of mosquito larvae, Culex were more numerous in large bromeliads containing damselflies. The most abundant Culex species, Culex jenningsi, had two kinds of behavioural defences: reduced movement and increased time at the water surface. These defences reduced damselfly attack rate on C.jenningsi, but not handling time. Consequently, consumption rate was reduced at all but the highest prey densities, altering the damselfly's functional response. Inducible defences were not seen in the most abundant Wyeomyia species, Wyeomyia abebela, and pre-exposure to predation risk did not reduce predation on this species. Inducible behavioural defences, and the associated reductions in predation rate, evidently allow C.jenningsi to coexist with predators at a higher density than W.abebela. As predation risk is non-randomly distributed amongst bromeliads, divergence between mosquito species in their response to predation may contribute to the coexistence of a number of mosquito species across the landscape.","[Hammill, Edd; Corvalan, Paloma; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Hammill, Edd; Corvalan, Paloma; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Corvalan, Paloma] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","Hammill, E (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Cnr Harris & Thomas St, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",edd_hammill@hotmail.com,,"Corvalan, Paloma/0000-0001-8932-4017",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The authors would like to thank Jose Mario Moraga Rios and Sarah and Trevor Amundrud for invaluable help in the field.

Not surprisingly, studies examining the drivers of biological invasion have increased in number over the past few decades in an effort to curtail invasive species success by way of informing management decisions. The common house gecko,Hemidactylus frenatus, has successfully invaded the Pacific islands where it appears to thrive in and dominate non-natural habitats offering high food availability (i.e., well-lit human dwellings) compared to native geckos. Previous work demonstrated thatH. frenatuscan outperform the native gecko,Lepidodactylus lugubris, in terms of maximal sprint speed on relatively simple planar surfaces (e.g., building walls).Lepidodactylus lugubrisand other native geckos, however, may have superior locomotor performance in three-dimensional, structurally complex habitats. Results Here we compared the locomotor behaviour and exertion capacity of the native gecko,Gehyra oceanica, and the invasive gecko,Hemidactylus frenatus, on the island of Mo'orea, French Polynesia, on fabricated structures simulating structurally complex substrates. We found that the native gecko exhibits improved locomotor performance compared to the invasive gecko on structurally complex substrates. We also completed encounter surveys to document free-ranging habitat use and behaviour of these two species. We discovered thatH. frenatuswere more common in natural habitats than previously observed and used similar substrates asG. oceanica, althoughG. oceanicaappeared to use substrates with greater perch heights (i.e., trees). Conclusions Our findings revealed that locomotor performance in complex environments may contribute to the previously observed habitat segregation between native and invasive Pacific island geckos. Furthermore, our locomotor and habitat use data are consistent with the hypothesis thatG. oceanicamay be resistant to invasion ofH. frenatusin natural environments. Our study calls for more detailed ecophysiological and ecomorphological studies of both native and invasive Pacific gecko species.","[Garner, Austin M.; Pamfilie, Alexandra M.; Hamad, E.

It was a Pseudomonas species, designated strain 679-2. It attacked most other nonobligate bacterial predators and hence could control their predatory and other activities in nature. It also inhibited various fungi. It attached to prey cells and produced a toxic, copper-related, growth initiation factor like that produced by Cupriavidus necator. In addition, it produced a second, novel compound that was both antibacterial and antifungal. Strain 679-2 appeared to have only a very limited natural occurrence. It was found only in the soil from one small area in one field. It was absent on the leaves of the plant species that were examined. Regardless of its rarity, however, it was highly competitive in soil. An inoculum consisting of only a few cells added to soil multiplied rapidly to become a major component of the soil microflora within 24 h. A small amount of glutamic acid could be added along with the cells to stimulate production of the toxic compounds noted above, but this was not necessary. After this multiplication, or when large numbers of cells were added to soil, the numbers decreased only slowly during the next several months. Cell survival also was good on plant leaves. The survival in soil and on plant leaves occurred in both laboratory and field experiments. Other than desiccation, the natural mechanism for controlling the numbers or activities of strain 679-2 in soil is not known. The, various characteristics of this bacterium, as noted above, are of particular interest because they indicate a possible use of the cells or inhibitor compounds for controlling organisms in soil or on plant surfaces.",,"CASIDA, LE (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV, MICROBIOL PROGRAM, 202 S FREAR, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,15,12,14,0,2,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,1098-5336,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

To better understand the mechanisms that impact the stability of obligate mutualists, I conducted several field experiments within a sandy coral reef lagoon in Moorea, French Polynesia that manipulated densities of fish (gobies) that interact mutualistically with shrimp. Obligate, mutualistic partnerships of gobies and shrimp are common on Indo-Pacific coral reefs and have been shown previously to interact as follows: shrimp construct burrows in which both species reside, and gobies warn shrimp of predators through tactile communication. Augmentation of gobies by up to 100% above ambient densities within 9 m(2) plots produced no change in overall density of gobies or shrimp because gobies competed intraspecifically for a limited number of shrimp burrows and smaller gobies were outcompeted by larger individuals. I used predators to assess the impact of goby removal on the stability of goby and shrimp populations. First, although surveys taken throughout the lagoon revealed no relationship between goby and predator densities, predators correlated negatively with the proportion of adult gobies and positively with the proportion of small gobies paired with large shrimp. Second, experimental augmentation of predators resulted in a dramatic reduction of adult gobies within predator-addition plots, but had no impact on overall densities as immigrants rapidly replaced the missing adult gobies. Furthermore, goby turnover resulted in an increase in the proportion of small gobies paired with large shrimp because body sizes of gobies and shrimp in a burrow were similar prior to predator introduction, and predators apparently had a greater impact on gobies than shrimp. The mechanisms that prevent expansion (intraspecific competition) and collapse (immigration) of goby-shrimp populations likely contribute to local-scale stability of mutualistic populations in other terrestrial and aquatic environments.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Thompson, AR (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, 900 Exposit Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",andrew2112@yahoo.com,,,,,,39,34,35,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2005,143,1,,,,,61,69,,10.1007/s00442-004-1775-0,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,902PT,WOS:000227369700006,15583942,,,,2021-09-27,

Increasing populations of alternative prey through detrital. subsidies is one way to foster these predators. However, alternative prey may also distract generalist predators from their prey thereby diminishing the efficiency of biological control. To develop reliable predictions for biological control, it is essential to evaluate the relative importance of generalist predators, pests, alternative prey and their respective interactions. We investigated the effects of an assemblage of generalist predators on the grain aphid Sitobion avenae in winter wheat. Treatments with 10, 100 and 1000 aphids were established inside 2 m(2) sized caged plots with control and reduced density of predators. Three weeks after the experiment started, samples were taken to estimate the size of aphid populations and those of alternative prey. Three prey taxa were significantly reduced by generalist predators: the grain aphid S. avenae (Aphidina), the click beetle Adrastus pallens (Elateridae) and the springtail. Isotoma viridis (Collembola). Springtails were decreased by generalist predators independent of aphid densities, indicating complementary predation of springtails and aphids. At high aphid densities, grain aphid population peaks were decreased to the threshold level, of economic damage, demonstrating efficient aphid suppression by the predator community. Click beetle numbers declined only at low and medium aphid densities. The results suggest that generalist predators preferentially fed on click beetles at low and medium aphid densities and switched to aphids at high aphid densities. Early-season predators likely had the greatest influence on aphid suppression. Our results indicate that alternative prey from the belowground system forms a substantial food resource for generalist predators, suggesting that the belowground subsystem modulates predator-prey interactions above the ground.

As tools for managing risk, clever prey can use time allocation and apprehension (redirecting attention from foraging to predator detection). One such foraging game occurs between gerbils and their predators on the sand dunes of the Negev Desert. Here, interacting species of gerbils compete for patches of seeds that renew daily by afternoon winds. In such circumstances, gerbils are expected to deplete resource patches over the course of the night, the predators are expected to hunt when gerbil activity is highest, and gerbils are expected to be most apprehensive when predators are most active and most deadly. We tested these predictions for gerbils in two field experiments using seed trays to measure resource depletion, gerbil activity and apprehension over the course of the night, between the bush and open microhabitats and at four moon phases (new, half waxing, full and half waning). Gerbils depleted seed resources more quickly in the bush microhabitat than the open and more quickly at new moon than at other moon phases. Gerbil activity at new moon was high throughout most of the night, but decreased towards dawn. In contrast, activity at full moon was generally low, but increased towards dawn. The two gerbil species Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi and G. pyramidum partitioned the night, with G. pyramidum visiting resource patches earlier in the night and encountering a richer, but more risky environment, and G. a. allenbyi foraging later in an environment characterized by fewer seed resources, but lower risk. The same pattern extended over moon phases, with G. pyramidum foraging relatively more at full and waning half moon. Apprehension by gerbils was higher early in the night than later and higher at full moon than new moon. Schedules of apprehension changed according to moon phase and may have differed between the two gerbils. Finally, apprehension was higher in the open microhabitat, although the opposite was true at the beginning of the night. This foraging game affects three trophic levels, including the effect of the gerbils on the availability and distribution of seeds, the competitive interaction between the two gerbil species and the predator-prey interaction between gerbils and owls.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel","Kotler, BP (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",kotler@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; Bouskila, Amos/B-4847-2010; Kotler, Burt/F-1381-2012; Dall, Sasha/B-2642-2010","Bouskila, Amos/0000-0002-6995-5070; Kotler, Burt/0000-0003-2693-8788; Dall, Sasha/0000-0001-9873-6507",,,,47,135,138,0,53,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

The presence of conspecific immature stages in a potential oviposition site could, on the one hand, indicate the suitability of that site but on the other hand could indicate the potential for intraspecific competition. In this paper, we present a graphic model suggesting that the trade-off between these two opposing forces could result in a hump-shaped density-dependent relationship between oviposition rate and conspecific immature stage density (hereafter, the Hump-shaped regulation model'') with positive effects of aggregation prevailing at low densities and negative effect of intraspecific competition prevailing at higher densities. We field-tested the predictions of this model at both the egg-and the larval levels with Aedes albopictus and evaluated if and how these relationships are affected by resource enrichment. We found support for the hump-shaped regulation model at both the larval and the egg levels. Using oviposition cups containing varying numbers of conspecific larvae, we showed that the oviposition activity of Ae. albopictus first increases and then decreases with larvae number. Medium enrichment resulted in higher hatching rate, and demonstrated linear relations for the no-enrichment treatment where larvae density range was low and hump-shaped relationship for the enriched medium that had a wider larvae density range. Using pairs of oviposition cups, we showed that at low egg densities mosquitoes laid more eggs on substrates containing pre-existing eggs. However, at higher egg densities, mosquitoes laid more eggs on a virgin substrate. Based on our results and on a meta-analysis, we suggest that due to study design or methodological shortcomings the hump-shaped regulation model is often left undetected and that it is likely to be more common than currently thought.","[Wasserberg, Gideon; Yeoman, Kim] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Bailes, Nicholas] Villanova Univ, Inst Global Interdisciplinary Studies, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Davis, Christopher] Messiah Univ, Dept Biol, Mechanicsburg, PA USA","Wasserberg, G (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",g_wasser@uncg.edu,,,UNC-Greensboro Office of Undergraduate Research; Biology Department; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS 0850465],"The authors thank the UNC-Greensboro Office of Undergraduate Research and the Biology Department for providing support for this study.

Working on a remote predator-dominated coral reef on Palmyra Atoll, USA, we used behavioral foraging observations to quantify the roles of common parrotfish and surgeonfish in the roving herbivore guild. We recorded species-specific bite rates on different benthic organisms, quantified the relative abundance of those benthic organisms, and estimated benthos-specific grazing intensities as a function of bite rates, fish abundance, and percent cover. These grazing metrics were compared between the exposed fore reef (similar to 10 m depth) and protected reef terrace (similar to 5 m depth) habitats. We observed large differences in feeding rates and substrate selectivity among fish species. Most species fed predominately on algal turfs; however, some species foraged broadly among fleshy macroalgal taxa, while others specialized on calcified green algae of the genus Halimeda. The highest bite rates were recorded from species targeting algal turfs, while the highest rates of defecation were recorded from species targeting Halimeda. Per capita bite rates of all species were higher in the fore reef habitat (mean 45% more bites min(-1)); however, overall grazing intensities on turf algae (bites cm(-2) d(-1)) were 5 times higher on the reef terrace than on the fore reef. Despite habitat-specific differences in the herbivore assemblages, the estimated distribution of total bites showed consistency among habitats, with strong guild-level positive foraging selectivity for algal turf. Comparisons of bite and defecation rate data for these herbivores across the Indo-Pacific highlight phylogenetic constraints on grazing activities. Overall, this study illustrates the importance of herbivore functional redundancy, variability in species-specific grazing, and provides a framework for assessing guild-wide grazing impacts on coral reefs.","[Hamilton, Scott L.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Smith, Jennifer E.; Price, Nichole N.; Sandin, Stuart A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biol & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Sandin, SA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biol & Conservat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ssandin@ucsd.edu,,"Price, Nichole/0000-0001-6773-3215",MarIsla Foundation,"For logistical support we thank the Nature Conservancy, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Fish and Wildlife Refuge System, and PARC (Palmyra Atoll Research Consortium).

We tested the hypothesis that ant-aphid mutualism can mediate competition and promote the coexistence of aphid natural enemies. A quadrate in the field measuring 30 x 30 meters (10 plants in 10 rows = 100 plants) was established in a cacao plantation and a whole quadrate survey was carried out in vegetative shoot flushings from the trunk. The number of ants and predators, the identity of ant and natural enemy species and colony occupancy by ants were recorded. Spatial association indexes were used to evaluate the degree of overlap in ant-ant and ant-predator spatial distributions. The ant Crematogaster victima F. Smith was selected for a test on differences in its attack behavior against larvae of the syrphid Ocyptamus antiphates (Walker) and a species of ladybird beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinelidae). Five species of ants were found tending aphids more frequently and their level of spatial association was slightly negative with remarkable mutual exclusion from aphid colonies. Two of them, Cr. victima and Cr. erecta Mayr, were potential defendants of aphids and were selected to study their spatial association with the distribution of natural enemies. It was found that spatial association between ants and aphid predators is slightly positive. The results suggest that the occurrence of attack behavior of Cr. victima against syrphids, but not against coccinellids, can increase coexistence of predators by generating independent spatial distribution.","[Silva, E.

This study compared the relative and interacting effects of competition and predation on two competing species of coral reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. moluccensis (Pomacentridae), using a multifactorial experiment. Fish were subjected to the sight and smell of a known predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), the presence of the heterospecific competitor (i.e., P. amboinensis vs. P. moluccensis), or a combination of the two for a period of 19 days. The sub-lethal effects of predator/competitor treatments were compared with controls; a combination of otolith microstructure analysis and observations were used to determine otolith growth patterns and behaviour. We predicted that the stress of competition and/or predation would result in strong sub-lethal impacts, and act synergistically on growth and behavioural patterns. We found strong evidence to support this prediction, but only for P. amboinensis, which suffered reductions in growth in both predator and competitor treatments, with the largest reductions occurring when subjected to both predation and competition concurrently. There was strong evidence of asymmetrical competition between the two damselfish species, with P. moluccensis as the dominant competitor, displaying strong aggressive behaviour towards P. amboinensis. Growth reductions for P. amboinensis in predator/competitor treatments appeared to come about primarily due to increases in shelter seeking behaviour, which significantly reduced the foraging rates of individuals compared with controls. These data highlight the importance of predator/competitor synergisms in influencing key behaviours and demographic parameters for juvenile coral reef fishes.","[Hall, April] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Hall, A (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",april.hall3110@gmail.com,"Kingsford, Michael J/C-2015-2008","Kingsford, Michael J/0000-0003-1704-6198; Hall, April/0000-0003-3672-2761",ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies grantAustralian Research Council,All funding was from an ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies grant to Michael Kingsford.,,71,6,6,0,23,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 18,2016,11,3,,,,,,,e0151778,10.1371/journal.pone.0151778,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,DH1ZE,WOS:000372582800101,26992169,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-27,

The aim of this review is to compile and summarize major findings of studies that have experimentally tested if a given macrofauna species affects some aspect of a meiobenthic assemblage. Altogether 77 studies on 44 macrofaunal species are reviewed. The bulk of the macrofaunal species are conspicuous members of the phyla Crustacea, Annelida and Mollusca, namely 20, 9 and 8 species respectively. Almost all the studies (86%) investigating biogenic structures of macrobenthos indicate some sort of effects on meiofaunal assemblages. Those studies in which diversity of a particular animal group has been considered, almost all agree on enhanced species diversity as a result of biogenic structures. The results of studies that have considered overall effects of macrofauna originating from processes such as predation, physical disturbance, competition for food and biogenic structures also indicate effects on meiobenthos. In only a few studies, researchers have used 3 or more density levels of disturbing macrofauna in their experimental manipulations, including natural levels, for the understanding of ecological rules behind biological disturbances. As biological disturbance created by macrofauna is incredibly variable among species and difficult to rate or categorise, it seems as yet difficult to apply theories to macrofaunal disturbance in general, predicting diversity or abundance patterns in meiofaunal assemblages.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Olafsson, E (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",emil.olafsson@zoologi.su.se,"Olafsson, Emil/D-4916-2012",,,,,97,70,72,2,27,OBSERVATOIRE OCEANOLOGIQUE BANYULS,BANYULS-SUR-MER CEDEX,"LABORATOIRE ARAGO, BP 44, 66651 BANYULS-SUR-MER CEDEX, FRANCE",0240-8759,,,VIE MILIEU,Vie Milieu,DEC,2003,53,4,,,,,249,265,,,,,17,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,779UB,WOS:000189318600011,,,,,2021-09-27,

Two opposing views dominate the field. One posits that the ability to establish at a site is determined by the availability of suitable microsites (establishment limitation), while the second asserts that recruitment is limited by the availability of seeds (seed limitation). An underlying problem is that establishment and seed limitation are typically viewed as mutually exclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis of seed addition experiments to assess the relative strength of establishment and seed limitation to seedling recruitment. We asked (1) To what degree are populations seed and establishment limited? (2) Under what conditions (e. g., habitats and life- history traits) are species more or less limited by each? (3) How can seed addition studies be better designed to enhance our understanding of plant recruitment? We found that, in keeping with previous studies, most species are seed limited. However, the effects of seed addition are typically small, and most added seeds fail to recruit to the seedling stage. As a result, establishment limitation is stronger than seed limitation. Seed limitation was greater for large-seeded species, species in disturbed microsites, and species with relatively short-lived seed banks. Most seed addition experiments cannot assess the relationship between number of seeds added and number of subsequent recruits. This shortcoming can be overcome by increasing the number and range of seed addition treatments.","Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Clark, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",cclark@zoo.ufl.edu; jpoulsen@zoo.ufl.edu; dlevey@zoo.ufl.edu; osenberg@zoo.ufl.edu,"Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008; Osenberg, Craig/M-9904-2013; Poulsen, John/O-5332-2019","Poulsen, John/0000-0002-1532-9808; Osenberg, Craig/0000-0003-1918-7904",,,,70,334,345,3,190,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

These effects can be both direct through removal of herbivores [density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs)] or indirect through changes in the behavior of the herbivores [trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs)]. How the relative importance of these two indirect interactions varies with predator diversity remains poorly understood. We tested the effect of predator diversity on both TMIIs and DMIIs on phytoplankton using two competitive invasive dreissenid mussel species (zebra mussel and quagga mussel) as the herbivores and combinations of one, two or all three species of the predators pumpkinseed sunfish, round goby, and rusty crayfish. Predators had either direct access to mussels and induced both TMII and DMII, or no direct access and induced only TMII through the presence of risk cues. In both sets of treatments, the predators induced a trophic cascade which resulted in more phytoplankton remaining with predators present than with only mussels present. The trophic cascade was weaker in three-predator and two-predator treatments than in one-predator treatments when predators had direct access to dreissenids (DMIIs and TMIIs). Crayfish had higher cascading effects on phytoplankton than both pumpkinseed and round goby. Increased predator diversity decreased the strength of DMIIs but had no effect on the strength of TMIIs. The strength of TMIIs was higher with zebra than quagga mussels. Our study suggests that inter-specific interference among predators in multi-species treatments weakens the consumptive cascading effects of predation on lower trophic levels whereas the importance of predator diversity on trait mediated effects depends on predator identity.","[Naddafi, Rahmat] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Rudstam, Lars G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Cornell Biol Field Stn, Bridgeport, NY USA","Naddafi, R (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Rahmat.Naddafi@slu.se,,"Rudstam, Lars/0000-0002-3732-6368",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [623-2008-486]; Cornell Agricultural Experiment Station; Swedish University of Agricultural Science,"This study was supported by the Swedish Research Council (http://vr.se/) (registration number: 623-2008-486) to RN and by a grant from the Cornell Agricultural Experiment Station (http://cuaes.cornell.edu/) to LGR and by the Swedish University of Agricultural Science (http://www.slu.se/viltfiskmiljo).

Changes in one prey species' density can indirectly affect the abundance of another prey species if a shared predator eats both species. Sometimes, indirect effects occur when prey straddle habitats, including when riparian predator populations grow in response to emergent aquatic insects and increase predation on terrestrial prey. However, predators may largely switch to aquatic insects or become satiated, reducing predation on terrestrial prey. 2. To determine the net indirect effect of aquatic insects on terrestrial arthropods via generalist spider predators, a field experiment was conducted mimicking midge influx and a wolf spider numerical response inside enclosures near an Icelandic lake. Lab mesocosms were also used to assess per capita rates of spider predation u nder differing levels of midge abundance. 3. Midges always decreased sentinel prey predation, but this effect increased with predator density. When midges were absent, predation increased 30% at a high spider density, but predation was equal between spider treatments when midges were present. In situ arthropods showed no effect of midge or spider treatments, although non-significant abundance patterns were observed congruent with sentinel prey results. 4. In lab mesocosms, prey survivorship increased >= 50% where midges were present and rapidly saturated; the addition of 5, 20, 50, and 100 midges equivalently reduced spider predation, supporting predator distraction rather than satiation as the root cause. 5. The present results demonstrate a strong positive indirect effect of midges and broadly support the concept that predator responses to alternative prey are a major influence on the magnitude and direction of predator-mediated indirect effects.","[Dreyer, Jamin; Gratton, Claudio] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hoekman, David; Gratton, Claudio] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hoekman, David] Southern Nazarene Univ, 6729 NW 39th Expressway, Bethany, OK 73008 USA","Dreyer, J (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, S-225 Agr Sci Ctr North, Lexington, KY 40508 USA.",jamin.dreyer@uky.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717148]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0718123]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1052160] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"No work at Myvatn could be done without Arni Einarsson.

We show that an ecoinformatics approach that leverages existing data on pesticides, pests, and beneficials across multiple fields can provide complementary insights. We do this using a multi-year dataset (2002-2013) on pesticide applications and density estimates of two pests, citrus thrips (Scirtothrips citri (Moulton [Thysanoptera: Thripidae])) and citrus red mites (Panonychus citri McGregor [Acari: Tetranychidae]), and a natural enemy (Euseius spp. predatory mites) collected from citrus groves in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Using correlative analyses, we investigated the long-term consequences of pesticide use on S. citri and P. citri population densities to evaluate the hypothesis that the pest status of these species is largely due to the disruption of natural biological control-i.e., these are induced pests. We also evaluated short-term pesticide efficacy (suppression of citrus thrips and citrus red mite populations immediately post-application) and asked if it was correlated with the suppression of Euseius predator populations. Although the short-term efficacy of different pesticides varied significantly, our dataset does not suggest that the use of citrus pesticides suppressed Euseius densities or worsened pest problems. We also find that there is no general trade-off between pesticide efficacy and pesticide risk to Eusieus, such that highly effective and minimally disruptive compounds were available to citrus growers during the studied time period.","[Livingston, George; Hack, Lindsey; Rosenheim, Jay A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Steinmann, Kimberly P.] Calif Dept Pesticide Regulat, 1001 I St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Grafton-Cardwell, Elizabeth E.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Rosenheim, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jarosenheim@ucdavis.edu,,"Rosenheim, Jay/0000-0002-9228-4754","California Department of Pesticide Regulation, University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources [11-C0089, 13-C0064, 15-3693]; United States Department of Agriculture - National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2015-70006-24164]","Thanks to Yoni Ackerman for help with coding, Ten2Eleven Business Solutions for building the Citrusformatics database software application, and to Michael Grieneisen for helpful comments.

Multiple simultaneous interactions may constrain the ability of native species to trade fitness components (i.e., reduced growth for reduced risk of predation) causing a spiral to extinction. We found evidence for five types of interactions between the adults and juveniles of introduced western mosquitofish ( Gambusia affinis) and the juveniles of native least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis). We added ten large ( 23 - 28 mm) and seven small ( 9 - 13 mm) young-of-the-year (YOY) least chub to replicate enclosures with zero, low, and high densities of mosquitofish in a desert spring ecosystem. Treatments with mosquitofish reduced the average survival of least chub by one-third. No small YOY least chub survived in enclosures with high mosquitofish densities. We also performed two laboratory experiments to determine mortality to predation, aggressiveness, and habitat selection of least chub in the presence of mosquitofish. Mean mortality of least chub due to predation by large mosquitofish was 69.7% over a 3-h trial. Least chub were less aggressive, selected protected habitats (Potamogeton spp.), and were more stationary in the presence of mosquitofish where the dominance hierarchy was large mosquitofish>> large least chub approximate to small mosquitofish>> small least chub. Least chub juveniles appear to be figuratively caught in a vice. Rapid growth to a size refuge could reduce the risk of predation, but the simultaneous effects of competition decreased least chub growth and prolonged the period when juveniles were vulnerable to mosquitofish predation.","Brigham Young Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, WIDB 401, Provo, UT 84602 USA","Rader, RB (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, WIDB 401, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",russell_rader@byu.edu,,,,,,51,137,144,1,91,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2004,141,4,,,,,713,721,,10.1007/s00442-004-1695-z,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,869QT,WOS:000224999800016,15322899,,,,2021-09-27,

However, interference competition among conspecifics when invasive species are at high densities could limit such effects. These alternative hypotheses inspired us to test the density-specific effects of red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii on experimental populations of the Amargosa Pupfish Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae. The presence of crayfish had a significant influence on the survival of adult pupfish. In allopatry, adult pupfish survival was nearly 100%. However, the presence of crayfish resulted in significantly lower survival rates for adult pupfish, 84% and 69% survival for the low- and high-density crayfish treatments, respectively. Crayfish also significantly affected the production of juvenile pupfish, with high juvenile production in the allopatric (705 juveniles/mesocosm) and low-density crayfish treatments (705 juveniles/mesocosm). Juvenile production in both of these groups was significantly higher than that in the groups sympatric with high-density crayfish (271 juveniles/mesocosm). The same pattern was observed when we evaluated the number of juvenile pupfish that were produced per adult female. We tested the hypothesis that interference competition among the crayfish would decrease predator efficacy by comparing the high-density crayfish treatment with a fourth high-density crayfish treatment wherein the crayfish were tethered. There was no significant difference in the rate of adult survivorship of the Amargosa Pupfish in the tethered and untethered high-density treatment groups (70% and 69%, respectively). However, tethering resulted in a significant increase in juvenile production in the high-density crayfish treatments (493 and 271 juveniles per mesocosm were produced in the tethered and untethered groups, respectively). The same patterns were observed when we examined the number of juvenile pupfish that was produced per adult female. These findings are inconsistent with the interference competition hypothesis, while supporting the hypothesis of density-dependent effects of crayfish on Amargosa Pupfish populations. These findings suggest that reducing crayfish density will be a beneficial management tool for reducing the effects of crayfish on benthic fish populations.","[Paulson, Brandon L.] North Dakota State Univ, Environm & Conservat Sci Grad Program, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Paulson, Brandon L.; Stockwell, Craig A.] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND 58108 USA","Stockwell, CA (corresponding author), North Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",craig.stockwell@ndus.edu,,,,,,37,1,1,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

In field experiments we evaluated the effect of the release of Kampimodromus aberrans (Oudemans) and Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten strains showing field resistance to organophosphates and dithiocarbamates. Predatory mites were released in two vineyards infested by spider mites despite the occurrence of Amblyseius andersoni (Chant) and/or Phytoseius finitimus Ribaga. Single or mixed releases were planned. Spider mite populations were not effectively controlled by local predatory mites while successful control was achieved by released species. The effects of re leases were higher in the second experimental year. In most cases A. andersoni densities were reduced by T. pyri and K. aberrans releases. Ph. finitimus suffered less than A. andersoni from intraguild predation. Among released species, the effect of the presence of a competitor was higher on T. pyri than on K. aberrans. Results suggest that the outcome of intraguild predation is prey-mediated. The equilibrium level between K. aberrans and T. pyri may depend on which spider mite species is the shared prey.

In tropical Australia, invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) breed in many of the same waterbodies that are used by native frogs, and males of both the invader and the native taxa rely on vocal signals to attract mates. We conducted playback experiments to test the hypothesis that calls of toads may influence the calling behaviour of frogs (Limnodynastes convexiusculus and Litoria rothii). Male L. convexiusculus adjusted their calling rate and the variance in inter-call interval in response to a variety of sounds, including the calls of cane toads as well as those of other native frog species, and other anthropogenic noise, whereas L. rothii did not. Within the stimulus periods of playbacks, male L. convexiusculus called more intensely during long silent gaps than during calling blocks. Thus, males of one frog species reduced their calling rate, possibly to minimise energy expenditure during periods of acoustic interference generated by cane toads. In spite of such modifications, the number of overlapping calls (within stimulus periods) did not differ significantly from that expected by chance. In natural conditions, the calls of cane toads are continuous rather than episodic, leaving fewer gaps of silence that male frogs could exploit. Future work could usefully quantify the magnitude of temporal (e.g. diel and seasonal) and spatial overlap between calling by toads and by frogs and the impact of call-structure shifts on the ability of male frogs to attract receptive females.","[Bleach, Iris T.; Both, Camila; Brown, Gregory P.; Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Beckmann, Christa] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia; [Both, Camila] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Sistemat Vertebrados, Fac Biociencias, BR-90619900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","Beckmann, C (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, 75 Pigdons Rd, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia.",c.beckmann@deakin.edu.au,"Brown, Gregory P./F-9897-2011; Beckmann, Christa/G-2754-2012","Brown, Gregory P./0000-0002-2924-9040; Beckmann, Christa/0000-0002-7904-7228; Both, Camila/0000-0002-4590-7242",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"The Northern Territory Land Corporation provided facilities for the study.

However, due to habitat loss and over-hunting, top predators are being made rare worldwide. Considering that apparent competitors share similar resources, we would expect the absence of top predators to reflect in changes on prey realized trophic niches. To test our hypothesis, we developed a model to predict the abundance ratio of apparent competitor species based on changes in their realized trophic niches. We tested our model against field data on the Neotropical marsupials Didelphis aurita and Metachirus nudicaudatus. Our results revealed that D. aurita and M. nudicaudatus are two species under apparent competition and their realized trophic niche and diet overlap change according to the presence of top predators. The model was able to predict the actual relative abundances of D. aurita and M. nudicaudatus in the three empirical studies analyzed. Our study presents quantitative support to the apparent competition theory; however, the model's applications to other groups still need to be verified. Additionally, our study shows that the lack of top predators has consequences on the realized trophic niche of their prey, and therefore, we reinforce that conservation plans need to focus on the effects of top predator loss on ecosystems.

In 1962, Kuhn proposed that paradigms form within the dual contexts of empirical evidence and intellectual history. Facts potentially contradictory to a paradigm may not be recognized until they are observed repeatedly and incorporated as supportive evidence into a new theory. Support for this interpretation can be found in the history of a paradigm of predation in rocky intertidal communities. Hypotheses were developed in the contexts of innovative field experiments and historical arguments of competition theory. The resulting paradigm proposed that predators restrict populations of competitively dominant prey to refuges. Different types of refuge, or no refuge, prevail in different areas of the intertidal zone, accounting for patterns of prey distribution, the coexistence of natural enemies, and the local maintenance of diversity. An ensuing period of criticism made reference to potential contradictions. Rather than by predation alone, prey abundances are determined largely by an interplay of varying rates of predation and prey production. Furthermore, prey refuges are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain all observed instances of local coexistence of predators and prey. We present a model in which intertidal boundaries of prey are set by equilibria between predation and prey production. Predation and prey productivity vary with environmental Gradients and with explicit spatial configurations of the prey. This synthesis relies on insights of the original paradigm, incorporates the contradictory observations, and depends on novel capabilities afforded by spatially explicit computer simulations. The resulting synthesis provides explanations for distinctive aspects of zonation, including abrupt prey boundaries in continuous gradients of predation, and converging upper and lower prey boundaries in gradients of decreasing wave exposure.","Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA","Robles, C (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",,,,,,,165,65,67,0,52,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2002,83,6,,,,,1521,1536,,10.2307/3071971,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,565ZQ,WOS:000176400800005,,,,,2021-09-27,

In a series of experiments, we have studied the behavioural responses of goldfish (prey) and little egrets (predator) when brought together in a large laboratory apparatus - an aviary with three pools of water. To obtain a baseline, we measured their behaviour in an aviary without manipulating any variable (Katz et al., 2010). Because the results of that study suggested that both fish and egrets follow the rules of optimal foraging, we undertook a series of experiments in which we manipulated the number of food patches (Katz et al., 2014a), the number of fish per pool (Katz et al., 2014b; Vijayan et al., 2018a), and the size of goldfish refuges (vijayaa et al., 2018b). In each case, the results supported the hypothesis of optimal behaviour. Mitchell (2018, this issue) makes four predictions about the behaviours of both species as the abundance of fish resources changes in a system such as the aviary. Specifically: (1) Prey should respond very weakly, if at all, to variation in the food ration among patches. (2) The predator should allocate more time to patches with a higher prey-food ration. (3) When moving to another patch, the predator should choose the patch with the higher prey-food ration more often than it would at random. (4) The predator will kill more prey in patches receiving a larger ration of prey-food. Aims: Explore the effect of varying the abundance of fish-food on the behaviours of goldfish and little egrets in the aviary. Determine whether variation in their behaviours agrees with the predictions of Mitchell's theoretical model. Methods: We used little egrets (the predators) and goldfish (the prey). We conducted experiments in two identical aviaries (7 m diameter). Each aviary contained three separate patches, i.e. three pools (1.52 m diameter, 0.60 m deep, similar to 1000 litres), each open to foraging by a single egret in the aviary. A fixed cover (22.75 cm radius) at the centre of each pool provided a refuge for the goldfish. Each pool had 15 fish. We manipulated intraspecific competition by offering three different amounts of goldfish food in an aviary each day: full (1.13 g per day), half (0.56 g per day), and quarter (0.28 g per day) rations. We then observed and recorded the behaviours of both players for 6 hours. Results: Patch-to-patch variation in the food ration had no effect on fish activity. But the egret allocated more time to foraging in the patch where the prey-food ration was highest (1.13 g). When moving to another patch, the egret moved to the patches containing high food rations (1.13 and 0.56 g) rather than the patch with the lowest food ration (0.28 g). And the predator caught significantly fewer goldfish in these poorest patches. Thus all four predictions were validated.","[Vijayan, Sundararaj; Balaban-Feld, Jesse; Tovelem, Lotan Tamar; Abramsky, Zvika] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Mitchell, William A.] Indiana State Univ, Dept Life Sci, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Rosenzweig, Michael L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Desert Ecol, Sde Boker Campus, Sede Boqer, Israel","Vijayan, S (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zvika@bgu.ac.il,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Mitchell, William/0000-0002-5494-2445",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [05/14]; Azrieli Foundation,"We thank Israel Science Foundation grant 05/14 to Zvika Abramsky for supporting this research.

This assemblage occurs naturally in fallen fruit capsules of the Brazil nut tree, Bertholletia excelsa (family Lecythidaceae), in lowland tropical forest in Amazonian Brazil. Three of the species (the tadpole of a poison frog and the larvae of a giant damselfly and a culicid mosquito) are predators in the system and form a guild in which all are capable of feeding mutually on smaller individuals of the other two species. The larvae of the two insects are also cannibalistic, although the tadpole is not. Predator-prey experiments among certain pairs of these three species revealed size-related intra-guild predation. The results of these experiments and observations on naturally occurring capsules indicate that only one individual of any species per fruit capsule will survive to adulthood. Field-sampled capsules revealed low densities of guild members, with few co-occurrences among them. Whether this is due to the timing of the study in the early part of the rainy season or some other factor limiting accessibility to the fruit capsules is unknown. Although priority effects are well known among assemblages of competitors, this study reveals that potentially they can significantly affect predator-structured systems. The larva of a fourth species in the assemblage, a small bufonid toad, is detritivorous and palatable to the three predaceous species. In the presence of one of the three predaceous species, survival of the bufonid larvae depends on a rapid time to metamorphosis and on saturation of the microcosm with enough individuals in a clutch that some will survive to metamorphosis.","UNIV OKLAHOMA, OKLAHOMA MUSEUM NAT HIST, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA","CALDWELL, JP (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.",,,,,,,31,52,55,0,24,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

The contention that artificial habitats in estuaries are more invasible than other habitats may result from variation in propagule supply, however, as artificial habitats are closely linked to vectors of non-native propagules, such as ships and boats. True comparisons of habitat invasibility require manipulations of propagule pressure, which has been historically difficult in marine systems. Using in-situ larval dosing, we delivered propagules of the widespread invasive ascidian Botrylloides violaceus into field mesocosms and assessed how habitat type (floating dock vs. benthic rock), resource availability (occupied vs. unoccupied plates), and propagule number (5, 25 and 50 larvae 225 cm(-2)) affected settlement (survival after 24 h) and recruitment (survival after 56 days) success. In-situ larval dosing was successful, and after eight weeks there were significant differences in recruitment due to initial dose-size, habitat type, and space availability. At the habitat scale, despite equal propagule delivery, PVC plates in natural benthic rock were not equally invasible and few propagules survived to recruitment. At the organism scale, increased habitat complexity, through facilitation by established fouling species, rather than freedom from space competitors, appears to be more important for B. violaceus to establish. Our results offer greater mechanistic understanding of broader invasion patterns between artificial and natural habitats. This work extends the possibilities for further research to counteract the confounding issue of unknown and unknowable propagule delivery when attempting to explain variation in invasion success.","[Simkanin, Christina; Davidson, Ian C.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Simkanin, Christina; Dower, John F.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Therriault, Thomas W.; Jamieson, Glen] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Pacific Biol Stn, Nanaimo, BC, Canada","Simkanin, C (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",csimkanin@gmail.com,"Therriault, Thomas W./AAS-5883-2020","Therriault, Thomas W./0000-0002-6215-3331; Simkanin, Christina/0000-0003-3091-9109; Davidson, Ian/0000-0002-8729-6048",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) through the Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Aquatic Invasive Species program of Fisheries and Oceans Canada,"We are very grateful to marina managers and staff at the Institute of Ocean Sciences and the Royal Victoria Yacht Club who accommodated our sampling.

In this study, we assessed the effects of the invasive crayfish Procambanis clarkii (Girard, 1852) on leaf litter decomposition (a key ecosystem process) and associated invertebrates using laboratory and field manipulative experiments. The crayfish had significant impacts on leaf decomposition due to direct consumption of leaf litter and production of fine particulate organic matter, and indirectly due to consumption of invertebrate shredders. The invertebrate community did not appear to recognize P. clarkii as a predator, at least in the first stages after its introduction in the system; but this situation might change with time. Overall, results suggested that the omnivore invader P. clarkii has the potential to affect detritus-based food webs through consumption of basal resources (leaf litter) and, or consumers.

The horse conch-A. rigida predator-prey interaction was quantified by measuring predator feeding rate and distribution across a range of prey density. To determine the effect of A. rigida mortality on fish reproduction, the rate of shell availability was experimentally manipulated and egg production measured in four fish species. Horse conch feeding rate and distribution were not functions of prey density, but A. rigida mortality was correlated with conch abundance, supporting previous evidence that horse conchs regulate new shell availability. increased rates of shell availability caused increases in the number of clutches laid and average clutch size in one fish species, Chasmodes saburrae Jordan & Gilbert, probably because new shells provide a greater surface area for eggs compared to older shells. These results suggest that horse conchs indirectly affect C. saburrae reproduction both at the level of the individual (clutch size) and the population (egg production) by regulating the availability of new shells, Because prey density had little effect on the predator, variation in the indirect effect of conchs on fish reproduction win be primarily influenced by the distribution of the predator, not A. rigida.

However, the effects of behavioural changes on survival and reproduction may vary with prey density due to intraspecific competition. In field experiments, we varied grasshopper density and threat of avian predation and measured grasshopper behaviour, survival and reproduction. Grasshopper behaviour changed with the threat of predation and these behavioural changes were invariant with grasshopper density. Behavioural changes with the threat of predation decreased per capita reproduction over all grasshopper densities; whereas the behavioural changes increased survival at low grasshopper densities and then decreased survival at high densities. At low grasshopper densities, the total reproductive output of the grasshopper population remained unchanged with predation threat, but declined at higher densities. The effects of behavioural changes with predation threat varied with grasshopper density because of a trade-off between survival and reproduction as intraspecific competition increased with density. Therefore, resource availability may need to be considered when assessing how prey behavioural changes with predation threat affect population and food web dynamics.","[Belovsky, Gary E.; Laws, Angela Nardoni; Slade, Jennifer B.] Univ Notre Dame, Environm Res Ctr, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Belovsky, Gary E.; Laws, Angela Nardoni; Slade, Jennifer B.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Belovsky, GE (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Environm Res Ctr, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",belovsky.1@nd.edu,"Belovsky, Gary/C-1255-2014",,,,,49,15,16,1,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We observed the growth of individual Epitheca protected from competition and predation in small (0.03 m2) in situ enclosures. Approximately 70% of the larvae followed univoltine development; this contrasts sharply with earlier studies in Bays Mountain Lake where only 25% of emerging imagoes were thought to be univoltine. We also conducted a study of the diets of large sunfish to identify the predator with the greatest potential impact on Epitheca population densities. Redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus) consumed large numbers of Epitheca during mid-July, and the dragonflies consumed were larger than expected based on size-distributions found in the lake. In fact, those eaten were often from sizes identified as potentially following univoltine development, suggesting that predation from large fish could reduce the success of the univoltine strategy. We also conducted an experiment in small (0.15 m2) in situ enclosures to examine competition between small sunfish and Epitheca. We found that while small sunfish had little influence on larval survival, larvae grew more slowly in their presence than in their absence. Thus small sunfish potentially hindered the ability of larvae to develop in a univoltine manner. Lastly, we conducted an experiment in large (24 m2) enclosures to test hypotheses generated by the studies above. Small sunfish produced a statistically significant reduction in the ratio of univoltine to semivoltine Epitheca larvae; and both large and small fish decreased the number of successfully emerging univoltine Epitheca. These studies show that in the absence of potentially deleterious biotic interactions, most Epitheca larvae in Bays Mountain Lake follow univoltine development; but competition and predation from sunfish result in lowered success of the univoltine strategy.",,"MARTIN, TH (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,CTR LIMNOL,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,,,,,,0,26,27,0,8,NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0887-3593,,,J N AM BENTHOL SOC,J.

Habitat selection by one species will often be influenced by presence and abundance of competitors that interact directly and indirectly with each other (such as through shared predators). The optimal habitat choice will thus depend on competition for resources by other species that can also modify predation risk. It may be possible to disentangle these two effects with careful analysis of density-dependent habitat selection by a focal prey species. We tested this conjecture by calculating habitat isodars (graphs of density assuming ideal habitat selection) of chital deer living in two adjoining dry-forest habitats in Gir National Park and Sanctuary, western India. The habitats differed only in presence (Sanctuary) and absence (National Park) of domestic prey (cattle and buffalo). Both species are preyed on by Asiatic lions. The habitat isodar revealed at low densities, that chital live in small groups and prefer habitat co-occupied by livestock that reduce food resources, but also reduce predation risk. At higher densities, chital form larger groups and switch their preference toward risky habitat without livestock. The switch in chital habitat use is consistent with theories predicting that prey species should trade off safety in favor of food as population density increases.","[Vijayan, Sundararaj; McLaren, Brian E.] Lakehead Univ, Fac Nat Resources Management, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Vijayan, S (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Fac Nat Resources Management, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",vsundara@lakeheadu.ca,,"Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Rufford Small Grants Foundation for Nature Conservation (UK); Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); DWM; BEM,"We are grateful to officials of Gujarat State Forest Dept for permission to work in Gir National Park and Sanctuary.

Patterns are analyzed in relation to size of organisms and to geographical distributions of organisms. Deviations from randomness in the number of multi-species assemblages suggest that biotic interactions influence co-occurrences, but size relationships in several co-occurring pairs indicate that competition for resources is not a factor influencing co-occurrence. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that the large Boeckella triarticulata consumes immature stages of the small Calamoecia tasmanica but provides a partial refuge for C. tasmanica when the planktivorous fish Gambusia, which consumes Boeckella more rapidly than Calamoecia, is present. These results indicate that co-occurrence patterns may be related to the intensity of predation by fish: in the absence of fish predation, Boeckella can prevent invasion of Calamoecia, while moderate predation by fish will reduce Boeckella density, consequently allowing Calamoecia to invade.","Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada","Maly, EJ (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",,,,,,,49,13,14,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP 26,1997,354,,,,,,41,50,,10.1023/A:1003042902584,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,YU856,WOS:000071762900003,,,,,2021-09-27,

We. used manipulative field experiments to determine the relative roles of abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in structuring deep-sea (2500 m depth) communities along environmental gradients around hydrothermal vents of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (East Pacific Rise, at 9degrees50' N). We tested (1) whether predation by crabs and fishes affects the recruitment of benthic species and subsequent community structure and (2) whether the effects of predation vary along the steep gradients of temperature, oxygen, sulfide, and metal concentrations near vents. Recruitment substrates (basalt cubic blocks, roughly 10 cm on a side), both uncaged and caged to exclude predators (crabs, fishes, whelks, and octopi), were deployed along a decreasing vent fluid-flux gradient. The exclusion of predators for 8 mo increased the abundance of small mobile gastropods and amphipod crustaceans but decreased the abundance of sessile invertebrates, including juvenile vestimentiferan worms, tubiculous polychaetes, and mussels. Effects of predation were strongest nearest to hydrothermal vents, where abiotic environmental conditions were most extreme but productivity and the overall abundances of benthic invertebrates and mobile predators were the greatest. Additional 5-mo experiments conducted at three different locations showed similar trends at all sites, indicating that these effects of predation on benthic community structure are repeatable. Stomach-content analyses of the most abundant predators found at vents indicated that the zoarcid fish (Thermarces cerberus) primarily feeds on the vent snail Cyathermia naticoides, the limpet Lepetodrilus elevatus, and the amphipod crustacean Ventiella sulfuris, the very species that showed the greatest increase following predator exclusion. In contrast, brachyuran (Bythograea thermydron) and galatheid (Munidopsis subsquamosa) crab stomachs did not contain small mobile grazers, and crabs presented with arrays of the most common vent invertebrate species preferred mussels and vestimentiferans over limpets. Our results indicate that predation by large mobile predators influences the structure of hydrothermal vent communities, directly by reducing the abundance of gastropod prey species, and indirectly by reducing gastropod grazing and by bulldozing of recruits of sessile invertebrates.","Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Micheli, F (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",micheli@stanford.edu,"Fisher, Charles/H-7912-2012","Micheli, Fiorenza/0000-0002-6865-1438; Mullineaux, Lauren/0000-0002-8932-2625",,,,55,129,130,2,96,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

The common European cockle Cerastoderma edule is an example of a patchily distributed species. Predation during the post-larval period is probably critical in determining the recruitment success and potentially the spatial distribution of this species. We investigated if aggregation (being 'patchy') of C. edule post-larvae increases survival from predation from juvenile shore crabs Carcinus maenas when compared to a uniformly dispersed distribution. We hypothesised that this will be caused by interference competition between C. maenas. Aquarium based experiments were conducted testing two factors of prey arrangement (aggregated and dispersed) and predator number (one or 5 crabs), and their interaction in controlling prey mortality and predator behaviour. Prey mortality was higher by 30-40% for both predator treatments when aggregated, and there was no interaction between factors. This indicates that the presence of conspecifics has no more significant influence on foraging efficiency than prey arrangement. An individual crab spent 30% longer searching when prey was dispersed, indicating that prey encounter rates limit foraging efficiency when conspecifics are absent. When multiple crabs foraged together they engaged in antagonistic interactions (8.5% of the total time) in both prey arrangements with no significant difference, and other behaviours did not explain clearly the difference in prey mortality. These results indicate that juvenile C. maenas are able to maintain a higher foraging efficiency on aggregated prey, despite the presence of conspecifics and associated interference competition. From this laboratory predator-prey system there is no evidence that aggregated cockle post-larvae are afforded greater protection from predation than uniformly distributed cockles. Therefore the migratory behaviour of C. edule post-larvae that may create or maintain dispersed distributions could be significant for post-settlement survival. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I report the results of an artificial pond experiment testing for interactions between the red spotted newt, Notophthalmus viridescens and the banded sunfish, Enneacanthus obesus. Increased E. obesus density reduced growth and survival of N. viridescens, but increased N. viridescens density did not significantly affect growth or survival of E. obesus. Increased intraspecific density reduced the growth of both species. There were no significant density effets of either Notophthalmus or Enneacanthus on the number, mass at metamorphosis, or larval period of N. viridescens efts, perhaps due to low reproduction in all treatments. Reproduction of E. obesus varied greatly among replicates, and did not respond to density treatments. A negative correlation between number of juvenile fish and mass indicated competition among juvenile E. obesus. Correlations among mass of adult and juvenile newts and fish were also negative, further suggesting competition between newts and fish. The strong negative effect of Enneacanthus on Notophthalmus provides a possible mechanism for the absence of newts from ponds in the Pine Barrens that contain sunfish.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",,,,,,,,32,12,13,0,5,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 7,1991,,1,,,,,1,8,,,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,EY838,WOS:A1991EY83800001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although cannibalistic species are frequently subject to predation, the consequences of cannibalism in the prey for predator-prey interactions are poorly understood. Using a dragonfly larvae system, I provide the first experimental evidence that cannibalism in the prey creates behavior- and density-mediated indirect effects that result in nonlinear predator-prey interactions. As a consequence, cannibalism in the prey altered the functional relationship of the predator and its prey and reduced the impact of the predator on prey mortality by 47%. By parameterizing a mechanistic predation model, I show that the nonlethal interaction between cannibals and predators reduced cannibalism rates, which explained almost two times more of the observed mortality reduction than the consumption of cannibals. However, only a model that accounted for both behavioral interactions and the consumption of cannibals could predict similar to 100% of the observed mortality. Using the mechanistic model, I discuss the long-term effects of cannibalism on community dynamics and how they can differ from effects of simple density-dependent mortality.

In Mediterranean forests drought is a major constraint for regeneration, but likely not the only factor determining the observed spatial patterns. We carried out a sowing experiment aimed at identifying main filters during seed-seedling transition. Specifically, we studied seed fate (predation, fungi infection, emergence) and subsequent seedling performance (mortality during the first summer and overall recruitment after 2 years) of four co-occurring Mediterranean tree species (Quercus ilex, Quercus faginea, Juniperus thurifera, Pinus nigra). We related these processes to the dominant species composition, microhabitat heterogeneity, herb cover and seed mass. The identity of the dominant species in the forest canopy was more important for recruitment than the forest canopy being dominated by conspecific vs. heterospecific species. The patterns we found suggest that biotic interactions such as facilitation (lower mortality under the canopies) and herb competition (during emergence of J. thurifera) are relevant during recruitment. Moreover, our results pointed to ontogenetic conflicts regarding the seed mass of Q. faginea and to density-dependent seed mortality for Q. ilex, rarely described in Mediterranean ecosystems. We propose that our study species experience population growth in forests dominated by heterospecifics where the recruitment success depends on habitat heterogeneity and on moderated biotic and abiotic stresses created by each species. Our results reveal patterns and mechanisms involved in recruitment constraints that add complexity to the well-known drought-related processes in Mediterranean ecosystems.","[Granda, Elena; Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, MNCN, Dept Biogeog & Cambio Global, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Escudero, Adrian; Valladares, Fernando] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, ESCET, Dept Biol & Geol, Mostoles 28933, Spain","Granda, E (corresponding author), CSIC, MNCN, Dept Biogeog & Cambio Global, Serrano 115 Dpdo, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",elena.granda.f@gmail.com,"Granda, Elena/AAH-2801-2019; Escudero, Adrian/H-5046-2015","Granda, Elena/0000-0002-9559-4213; Escudero, Adrian/0000-0002-1427-5465","Spanish Ministry for Innovation and Science [CGL2007-66066-C04-02, CSD2008 00040, CGL2010 22180 C03 03, CGL-2012-38427]; Community of Madrid grant REMEDINAL 2 [CM S2009 AMB 1783]","We are very grateful to Mario Diaz for assistance in rodent sampling, Sasha Wright for comments on statistical methods and to all the people who helped in the field, especially David Lopez and Gonzalo Caballe.

The strength of the interactions between a given plant species and different frugivore guilds (e.g., seed dispersers, seed predators) often vary in space due to changes in plant extrinsic factors (e.g., frugivore abundances) and plant traits (e.g., fruit size and reward). By reciprocally translocating Pyrus bourgaeana ripe fruits representative of five Mediterranean localities during 2 consecutive years, we experimentally quantified guild-specific variations among populations in frugivory strength, while accounted for plant-intrinsic and- extrinsic factors. Though overall fruit removal did not differ among localities, there were strong guild-specific differences in fruit removal strength. Fruit removal by pulp feeders, seed dispersers, and fruit predators varied among populations up to 8.5-, 5.6-, and 4.0-folds, respectively. These strong variations seemed mediated by changes in frugivore relative abundances rather than on availability of alternative fruits. As expected, all fruit traits considered (e.g., fruit size, pulp amount) markedly varied among tree populations. However, no frugivore guild showed preference for fruits from any locality, suggesting that fruit traits did not contribute much to differences in frugivory strength among populations. Since the functional diverse frugivore guilds played contrasting roles in P. bourgaeana dynamics (e.g., seed dispersal vs. seed predation), our study highlights the importance of accounting for functional diversity in frugivore guilds when estimating spatial variations in the strenght of seed dispersal. This investigation also illustrates a neglected but widely applicable experimental approach to identify the relative importance of extrinsic factors and fruit traits in mediating fruit-frugivore interactions.","[Garrote, Pedro J.; Zywiec, Magdalena; Fedriani, Jose M.] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves, InBio, Lisbon, Portugal; [Calvo, Gemma; Delibes, Miguel; Fedriani, Jose M.] CSIC, EBD, Estn Biol Donana, C Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Zywiec, Magdalena] Polish Acad Sci, W Szafer Inst Bot, Ul Lubicz 46, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland; [Suarez-Esteban, Alberto] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Suarez-Esteban, Alberto] Yukon Coll, 500 Coll Dr, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5D4, Canada","Fedriani, JM (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves, InBio, Lisbon, Portugal.; Fedriani, JM (corresponding author), CSIC, EBD, Estn Biol Donana, C Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",fedriani@ebd.csic.es,"Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018","Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621; Zywiec, Magdalena/0000-0002-5992-4051","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2007-63488/BOS]; FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; National Funds through FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/BIA/50027/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006821]; Portuguese FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [IF/00728/2013]; Wladyslaw Szafer Institute of Botany of the Polish Academy of Sciences",We are indebted to many volunteers for their essential field assistance.

Considerable disagreement exists over the relative contribution of each process to patterns of abundance. Using multifactorial experiments, I assessed the effects of resident conspecifics, potential interspecific competitors, predators, and reef location on patterns of recruitment of two temperate reef fishes. Recruitment of bluebanded gobies (Lythrypnus dalli) and blackeye gobies (Coryphopterus nicholsii) consistently increased with distance from a nearby large reef. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was enhanced by the presence of older resident conspecifics. I found no strong evidence of any competitive effects between the two species. Predators had a variety of important effects on the density of recruits. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was halved by predators; this was the result of direct and indirect effects of predators: in addition to directly reducing recruit density, predators also reduced recruitment indirectly by reducing the density of older residents to which recruits responded. I developed two related methods for quantifying the contributions of the direct and indirect components of the predator effect. The effect of predation was spatially variable for both species: the net effect of this variability was the elimination of recruitment patterns related to reef location. Hence, the effects of spatially variable input of recruits was dependent upon the presence of predators, and thereby, predation altered the relative importance of the other factors that affected recruitment of the gobies. I argue that a much broader understanding of the ''relative importance'' of multiple causal processes will be gained by striving to understand how the contribution of each process is modified by other processes than by attempting to quantify the ''importance'' of each process.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA",,,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917",,,,56,57,57,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1997,78,1,,,,,129,145,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0129:TRIOPA]2.0.CO;2,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD345,WOS:A1997WD34500010,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

In laboratory experiments, we determined whether habitat and temperature could mediate competitive and predatory interactions between juveniles of both species. We examined how density and predator presence affect habitat choice by red and blue king crabs. Further experiments determined how temperature and habitat affect predation by year-1 red king crab on year-0 blue king crab. Finally, long-term interaction experiments examined how habitat and density affected growth, survival, and intra-guild interactions between red and blue king crab. Red king crabs had a greater affinity for complex habitat than blue king crabs and the presence of predators increased preference for complex habitat for both species. Predation on year-0 blue king crabs by year-1 red king crabs was lower in complex habitats and at colder temperatures. When reared alone, red king crab survival was higher at low densities and in complex habitats. When reared with blue king crab, survival of red king crab was higher in complex habitats and in the presence of blue king crab. Blue king crab survival was substantially lower in the presence of red king crabs regardless of habitat. In both rearing experiments, differences in changes in crab size appeared to be driven by mortality rates and size-selective predation. This demonstrates that interactions between juvenile red and blue king crabs are primarily driven by intra-guild predation and not competition for resources. These results, suggest that juvenile red king crabs have an advantage over blue king crabs which could lower productivity of the Pribilof Islands blue king crab stock since the former became dominant in that system.

Males of the study species, the bridled goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum Gill), defend benthic nest sites, within which they spawn with females, and females can spawn repeatedly over an extended breeding season. In small areas, usually only a single male nested at any one time regardless of how many males were present, so the probability of nesting was inversely proportional to density. Nesting males were almost always the largest in the vicinity, suggesting that, for males whose home ranges overlap, social interactions dictate opportunities to nest. Both the per capita rate at which clutches were laid and the number of eggs produced per clutch declined with increasing density, so the per capita rate of egg production was also density dependent. All three measures of fecundity were better predicted by numerical density (numbers per unit area) than biomass (mass of fish per unit area), and were well described as an inverse function of the number of gobies in the vicinity. A simple hypothesis consistent with these results is that a constant number of females spawn, regardless of density. Alternately, the effect of crowding may depend primarily on the number of interacting individuals and affect all females relatively equally. This density dependence could thus contribute to population regulation at the spatial scale over which populations become reproductively closed.","[Forrester, Graham] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Harmon, Lindsay; Karis, Rebecca] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Helyer, Jason] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Marine Affairs, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Holden, William] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Forrester, G (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",gforrester@mail.uri.edu,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0222087]; RI-EPSCoR; Falconwood Foundation,"We thank Linda Forrester and Sandra Giovannini for assistance in the field, Jameal Samhouri and the anonymous reviewers for comments on the manuscript, plus Lianna Jarecki and the staff on Guana Island for valuable logistical support.

The limited combination of parameter values over which coexistence can occur in most models of competing species suggests that coexistence may not be a general phenomenon, yet observations of communities demonstrate that coexistence of competitors is common. In this paper, I use a well-studied host-parasitoid system, California red scale and its parasitoids, to explore whether intraguild predation (IGP) is a likely coexistence mechanism for these species and to motivate an exploration of how the level of biological detail in theoretical models influences conclusions about the likelihood of coexistence via IGR Although prior work has shown that parasitoid and host densities in the field follow the patterns predicted by simple IGP theory, in this detailed model parameterized with empirically derived values, coexistence is not predicted. Thus, in spite of the concordance between field observations and simple model predictions, the current model demonstrates that IGP is unlikely to be the sole coexistence mechanism for the parasitoids of California red scale. Furthermore, IGP is an equalizing coexistence mechanism, and these results demonstrate that adding biological detail to this type of mechanism does not substantially increase the predicted coexistence region. This important result adds to the growing literature showing that simple models often can capture the fundamental processes operating in more complex models and may be sufficient to capture underlying ecological patterns. Because models lacking system-specific details are better able to produce general conclusions, the current result suggests that general theory may be used to gain insights into a diversity of ecological systems.

We also tested how illumination and habitat structure affected rates of predation by owls on the two gerbil species. In a large aviary, we manipulated presence and absence of owls, owl species, presence and absence of illumination, and shrub cover. In response to the presence of owls or to increased illumination, gerbils foraged less, shifted foraging activity to the bush microhabitat, and quit patches at a higher giving-up density of resources. In accord with moonlight avoidance, both gerbil species suffered higher predation rates under illumination than in the absence of illumination. In addition, G. pyramidum distinguished among owl species, as indicated by changes in patch use and habitat selection. Habitat structure also affected foraging behavior and rates of predation. Gerbils foraged less in the open than in the bush microhabitat, foraged less when there was no cover present, and foraged less in the bush microhabitat when patches were encumbered by entangling branches. In accord with avoidance of open areas, both gerbil species suffered higher rates of predation when shrub cover was 0% than when shrub cover was 10%. With 0% cover, G. allenbyi suffered higher predation rates than G. pyramidum, but with 10% cover, rates of owl predation did not differ between gerbil species. Rates of owl predation on the two species corresponded to their natural patterns of macro- and microhabitat partitioning; relative to G. allenbyi, G. pyramidum predominates on open sand dunes and biases its behavior toward the open microhabitat. The results suggest that predation interacts with resource competition to determine the distribution and habitat separation of G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,CHICAGO,IL 60680","KOTLER, BP (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,IL-84993 SEDE BOQER,ISRAEL.",,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; ",,,,56,427,440,6,210,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1991,72,6,,,,,2249,2260,,10.2307/1941575,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV769,WOS:A1991GV76900031,,,,,2021-09-27,

Interspecific larval competition studies have shown Ae. albopictus to be a superior competitor over many species. A laboratory experiment was conducted in artificial containers to evaluate the effects of malathion on larval interactions between Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus. The survivorship of Ae. albopictus increased with increasing Ae. atropalpus densities in control but decreased with increasing Ae. atropalpus densities in the presence of malathion. Alternatively, Ae. atropalpus survivorship did not differ between control and malathion treatments. Developmental times were not affected by interspecific competition in both treatments for either species. These results show that malathion could facilitate coexistence between Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus. This demonstrates how sublethal concentrations of malathion (and perhaps other pesticides with similar modes of action) can enable an inferior competitor to coexist in the same habitat with a superior competitor. This is the first report of synergistic survival of a weaker mosquito competitor in the presence of a pesticide due to condition-specific competition.","[Kesavaraju, Banugopan; Brey, Christopher W.; Farajollahi, Ary; Evans, Heather L.; Gaugler, Randy] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Vector Biol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Brey, Christopher W.] Marywood Univ, Dept Sci, Scranton, PA 18505 USA; [Farajollahi, Ary] Mercer Cty Mosquito Control, W Trenton, NJ 08628 USA","Kesavaraju, B (corresponding author), Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District, 2020 N Redwood Rd, Salt Lake City, UT 84116 USA.",banu@slcmad.org,"Gaugler, Randy/K-3898-2013",,New Jersey Agriculture Experiment Station [D-08-08193-03-11],"Many thanks to Linda McCuiston for supplying Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus eggs and Kavitha Damal and Richard Marin for technical assistance.

Theory predicts that intraguild predation hampers coexistence of species involved, but it is common in nature. It has been suggested that increasing habitat complexity and the presence of alternative food may promote coexistence. Reciprocal intraguild predation limits possibilities for coexistence even further. Habitat complexity and the presence of alternative food are believed to promote coexistence. We investigated this using two species of predatory mites, Iphiseiodes zuluagai and Euseius concordis, by assessing co-occurrence in the field and on arenas differing in spatial structure in the laboratory. The predators co-occured on the same plants in the field. In the laboratory, adults of the two mites fed on juveniles of the other species, both in the presence and the absence of a shared food source, showing that the two species are involved in reciprocal intraguild predation. Adults of I.zuluagai also attacked adults of E.concordis. This suggests limited possibilities for coexistence of the two species. Indeed, E.concordis invariably went extinct extremely rapidly on arenas without spatial structure with populations consisting of all stages of the two predators and with a shared resource. Coexistence was prolonged on host plant leaves with extra food sources, but E.concordis still went extinct. On small, intact plants, coexistence of the two species was much longer, and ended with the other species, I.zuluagai, often going extinct. These results suggest that spatial structure and the presence of alternative food increase the coexistence period of intraguild predators.","[Marques, Renata Vieira; Pallini, Angelo] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Sarmento, Renato Almeida; Oliveira, Adriana Goncalves; Rodrigues, Diego de Macedo; Pedro-Neto, Marcal] Fed Univ Tocantins UFT, Gurupi, Tocantins, Brazil; [Venzon, Madelaine] Agr & Livestock Res Enterprise Minas Gerais EPAMI, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Dept Evolutionary & Populat Biol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Dept Evolutionary & Populat Biol, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",arne.janssen@uva.nl,"Venzon, Madelaine/C-5856-2014; Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Sarmento, Renato/0000-0002-5379-9595; Venzon, Madelaine/0000-0001-9184-6818","FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [CBB-30003/09]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [475408/2008-0, 620028/2008-4]","FAPEMIG, Grant/Award Number: CBB-30003/09; CAPES; CNPq, Grant/Award Number: 475408/2008-0 and 620028/2008-4",,62,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Perca fluviatilis were more streamlined and smaller headed in a lake with the highest abundance of cyprinids, but lowest abundance of predators (Lake Tuopanjarvi), indicating adaptation to planktivorous feeding and low predator density. Highest bodied fish were found from a lake with the lowest cyprinid but highest predator abundance (Lake Koppelojarvi), which conversely indicates adaptation to more effective predator avoidance. Furthermore, the length of the paired fins was longest in Lake Kinnasjarvi and Lake Tuopanjarvi, where the abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates was lowest, suggesting selection for more effective benthivory. Clear morphological differences of P. fluviatilis between habitats were found only in Lake Kinnasjarvi, whereas in Lake Koppelojarvi and Lake Tuopanjarvi only the length of the paired fins differed and in Lake Harkkojarvi no differences were found. Taken together, these results suggest that inter and intrapopulation morphological differences are probably highly dependent on different biotic factors (i.e. predation risk, resource availability and competition). Spatial and temporal variations in these factors may have a great effect on body morphology of P. fluviatilis.","[Kekalainen, J.; Kahkonen, J.; Huuskonen, H.] Univ Joensuu, Fac Biosci, Inst Ecol Res, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Kekalainen, J.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Kiviniemi, V.] Univ Kuopio, Ctr Informat Technol, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland","Kekalainen, J (corresponding author), Univ Joensuu, Fac Biosci, Inst Ecol Res, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",jukka.kekalainen@joensuu.fi,,"Huuskonen, Hannu/0000-0001-5609-768X",North Karelia Regional Environment Centre; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [7121694],"We thank I.

In the Great Lakes, the exotic round goby (Apollonia melanostoma) is very abundant in littoral areas used by the native yellow perch (Perca flavencens). We examined yellow perch-round goby interactions using multiple approaches. Field surveys analyzing dietary overlap among three size classes of yellow perch and round goby detected significant overlap only between juvenile perch (< 95 mm TL) and gobies (< 60 mm TL). laboratory experiments using juvenile stages tested for habitat preference differences (open sand, macrophytes and dreissenids) in solitary, intraspecific (2 perch) and interspecific (1 perch, 1 goby) treatments. In macrophyte and dreissenid habitats, we tested for treatment differences in fish behavior (intraspecific vs. interspecific) and yellow perch growth (solitary, intraspecific and interspecific). Round goby consistently preferred complex habitats. Yellow perch showed diurnal preference of complex habitats, but increased nocturnal use of sand in the solitary and interspecific treatments. Activity was greater in dreissenid than macrophyte habitat, but prey attacks showed the opposite trend. Activity and prey attacks were greater in the intraspecific than interspecific treatments. The trend was due to lower prey attacks executed by round goby. In macrophytes, individual yellow perch growth was lower in the intraspecific than in the solitary and interspecific treatments. In dreissenids, intraspecific and interspecific competitors equally decreased yellow perch growth. Our results suggest differences in diet, habitat preference and behavior between juvenile round goby and yellow perch may allow their coexistence in nearshore areas.

However, interactions of these factors with parasitism remain understudied. Here we investigate interactions among competition, predation and parasitism by crossing tadpole density (Bufo americanus), presence of a caged predator (Notophthalmus viridescens), and Echinostoma trivolvis trematodes, experimentally partitioning their effects on tadpole exposure and susceptibility to infection. Predation did not affect E. trivolvis infection but accelerated tadpole development and growth, and decreased activity. The presence of E. trivolvis caused the opposite effects on these three responses and reduced tadpole survival. High conspecific density reduced tadpole survival, growth, and development, and increased tadpole activity. Effects of predation and parasitism on activity were only evident at low tadpole density. High-density mesocosms also had twice the number of E. trivolvis infections as low-density mesocosms, despite a lack of evidence for stress-induced immunomodulation. Instead, this effect was explained by high density delaying tadpole development, which increased both the duration of exposure to cercariae and susceptibility to infection, because tadpoles spent more time in highly susceptible early stages. These results highlight the importance of accounting for trait-mediated effects, host plasticity, and exposure vs. susceptibility in parasite ecology.","[Raffel, Thomas R.; Halstead, Neal T.; Michel, Patrick J.; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Hoverman, Jason T.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Forestry Fisheries & Wildlife, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Raffel, TR (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",traffel@cas.usf.edu,"Hoverman, Jason T/D-1756-2013; Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Hoverman, Jason T/0000-0002-4002-2728; ",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0516227]; U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI 2006-01370]; U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R833835],"We thank the members of the Hudson and Rohr labs for their advice and support.

However, livestock and native prey can also interact indirectly through their shared predator. Indirect interactions between two prey species occur when one prey modifies either the functional or numerical responses of a shared predator. This interaction is often manifested as negative effects (apparent competition) on one or both prey species through increased predation risk. But indirect interactions can also yield positive effects on a focal prey if the shared predator modifies its functional response toward increased consumption of an abundant and higher-quality alternative prey. Such a phenomenon between two prey species is underappreciated and overlooked in nature. Positive indirect effects can be expected to occur in livestock-dominated wildlife reserves containing large carnivores. We searched for such positive effects in Acacia-Zizhypus forests of India's Gir sanctuary where livestock (Bubalus bubalis and Bos indicus) and a coexisting native prey (chital deer, Axis axis) are consumed by Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica). Chital vigilance was higher in areas with low livestock density than in areas with high livestock density. This positive indirect effect occurred because lion predation rates on livestock were twice as great where livestock were abundant than where livestock density was low. Positive indirect interactions mediated by shared predators may be more common than generally thought with rather major consequences for ecological understanding and conservation. We encourage further studies to understand outcomes of indirect interactions on long-term predator-prey dynamics in livestock-dominated protected areas.","[Sundararaj, Vijayan; McLaren, Brian E.] Lakehead Univ, Fac Nat Resources Management, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Goyal, S.

We implemented an innovative trophic interaction framework for novel communities and quantified the interaction strength and impact potential of a truly novel species (marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis) with a resident non-native counterpart (spiny-cheek crayfish Faxonius limosus). As prey, we used Dreissena mussels, which are non-native as well and now hold a key position in many European and North American aquatic ecosystems. For both crayfish species, we predicted functional responses based on a mechanistic model that we parameterised with a set of experimental observations of foraging behaviour and satiation. We compared these predicted functional responses to empirically observed responses. In addition, we incorporated behavioural traits such as aggression, activity, and boldness in the comparisons between the species and individuals to determine their influence on functional responses. We tested individuals from aquarium stocks as well as naturalised individuals from invaded water bodies. Altogether, we performed 1,095 experiments with 26 individual crayfish. We found that per capita predation of spiny-cheek crayfish exceeded that of marbled crayfish from aquaria and naturalised individuals. Functional responses differed between species and were mostly higher for spiny-cheek crayfish males. Marbled crayfish, however, were more voracious and reached satiation more slowly. Consumption rates correlated with aggression for marbled crayfish and with an aggressive threat response for spiny-cheek crayfish. We conclude that spiny-cheek crayfish can reach higher short-term consumption rates than marbled crayfish, but both species probably do not substantially affect Dreissena mussel populations in the field. For marbled crayfish, high long-term consumption, interspecific aggression, and reproduction rates can promote their establishment and spread. Risk assessments of these invaders should be improved by considering numerical responses, and different prey organisms and predators.","[Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Chem Pharm, Berlin, Germany; [Linzmaier, Stefan M.; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany","Linzmaier, SM (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.",stefan.linzmaier@gmail.com,"Jeschke, Jonathan M/A-2707-2008","Jeschke, Jonathan M/0000-0003-3328-4217","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [JE 288/9-1, JE 288/9-2]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: JE 288/9-1 and JE 288/9-2",,132,3,3,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The impact of introduced non-mammalian competitors, however, is poorly understood. The house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, is one of the most successful invasive reptiles and has been implicated in the decline of endemic geckos and other taxa on a number of tropical and subtropical islands. We investigated the patterns of niche utilization between the house gecko and endemic ornate day gecko, Phelsuma ornata, in Mauritius, two species which were not believed to compete because they had different diel activity periods. The dietary and temporal niche partitioning of the two species were examined in relation to seasonal invertebrate prey abundance for three seasons. Dietary overlap between the two species was least when prey abundance was lowest and temporal overlap in activity greatest. Exploitative competition was therefore inferred, whereby changes in dietary overlap were attributed to shifts in prey selection by the day, but not the house, gecko, which was hypothesized to deplete prey. The compensatory response of the day gecko may have been to increase its tendency for cannibalism, such that the smaller house gecko was indirectly responsible for population reduction of its larger competitor. This is the first study to show how an invasive nocturnal gecko may be affecting a predominantly diurnal species.","[Cole, Nik C.; Harris, Stephen] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England","Cole, NC (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England.",nik.cole@durrell.org,,,"Mauritian Wildlife Foundation; National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Ago-Industry, Mauritius; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust; Dulverton Trust","We thank the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, particularly Asha Poonyth and Poonam Gangaram for phenology data, and the National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Ago-Industry, Mauritius for supporting this study, Lisa Cole for assistance in the field, and Phil Baker and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments that improved the manuscript.

I investigated how habitat variation and conspecific interactions influence the abundance and distribution of different life history stages of the intertidal fish Oligocottus snyderi. I first examined the role of priority recruitment effects and found that prior recruitment had no effect on subsequent O.snyderi recruitment. I then examined how habitat variation influences adult and recruit abundances by manipulating surfgrass Phyllospadix spp. cover in tide pools, a habitat attribute that positively covaries with both O. snyderi life history stages. Surprisingly, whereas O. snyderi adults showed the expected negative response to surfgrass removal, the recruit response was positive. Additional experiments investigated whether these contrasting results were due to an ontogenetic change in habitat preference or to negative interactions between adults and recruits. Direct manipulation of adult abundance in the field determined that O. snyderi recruit abundance increases when adult abundance decreases. Laboratory studies indicated that although O. snyderi recruits have little to no preference for surfgrass cover, they do exhibit a strong negative reaction to conspecific adults and adjust their distributions accordingly. This combination of field and laboratory studies suggests that the ontogenetic habitat shift of O. snyderi is actually a result of negative interactions between size classes, such that recruits settle into sub-optimal tide pools in order to avoid interacting with adults.","[Ritter, Amy F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ritter, Amy F.] CNRS, USR2935, Stn Ecol Expt, F-09200 Moulis, France","Ritter, AF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.; Ritter, AF (corresponding author), CNRS, USR2935, Stn Ecol Expt, F-09200 Moulis, France.",ritter@biology.ucsc.edu,,,Project for the Interdisciplinary Studies of the Coastal Oceans (PISCO) - David and Lucile Packard Foundation; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation [479]; University of California Office of the PresidentUniversity of California System; Center for Dynamics of the Land Sea Interface at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC); Myers Oceanographic Trust; Friends of Long Marine Laboratory (UCSC),"I thank A.

In a manner that resembles the childhood game of musical chairs, many prey species rapidly retreat to shared, unguarded refuges whenever a predator threatens, and only when refuges are relatively abundant do all prey individuals actually escape. The key feature of this process is that the per capita prey mortality rate depends on the ratio of prey individuals to refuges. We introduce a new class of mortality functions with this feature and then demonstrate statistically that they describe field mortality data from a well-studied coral reef fish species, the Caribbean bridled goby Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, substantially better than do several mortality functions of more conventional form.","[Samhouri, Jameal F.] NOAA Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Samhouri, Jameal F.; Vance, Richard R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Forrester, Graham E.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Steele, Mark A.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA","Samhouri, JF (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",Jameal.Samhouri@noaa.gov,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); AMNH Lerner-Grey Fund; ASIH Raney Fund; IWFA Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; NOAA-NURPNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [CMRC05-PRRV-01-05A, CMRC-01-NRME-01-03C, CMRC-03-NRME-01-04A, CMRC-03-NRME-01-05C]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0222087]","This research benefited greatly from discussions with S.

They threaten a native species of similar biology, the European bullhead, by displacing them from shelters. These shelters are necessary for reproduction as well as for protection against predators and hydrodynamic forces. However, abiotic conditions may strongly modify the outcome of an interspecific competition in the wild. Nevertheless, little is known of the effect of flow velocity on the competition between these rheophilic species, although this factor is crucial for their distribution in the field. We video-recorded fish behaviour for 2h in single-species and mixed-species pairs in the presence of single shelters at three flow velocities: 0, 10 (a velocity preferred by the racer goby) and 30cms(-1) (a velocity greater than preferred by the racer goby) to determine whether the invader can deprive the native species of its shelter. At the flow of 0 and 10cms(-1), the racer goby exhibited aggressive behaviour towards bullhead, and this restricted the time spent by the bullhead in the shelter. Moreover, although the flow of 30cms(-1) inhibited racer goby aggression, the time spent by the bullhead in the shelter in interspecific competition was still reduced when compared to intraspecific controls. Our results suggest that under natural conditions, the racer goby displace bullheads from their shelters even at flow velocities greater than optimal for the racer goby.","[Jermacz, Lukasz] Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Jermacz, Lukasz; Kobak, Jaroslaw; Dzierzynska, Anna] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland; [Kakareko, Tomasz] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Hydrobiol, Torun, Poland","Jermacz, L (corresponding author), Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",lukasjermacz@gmail.com,"Jermacz, Lukasz/B-8728-2017; Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013","Jermacz, Lukasz/0000-0001-9182-116X; Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Kakareko, Tomasz/0000-0001-5054-7416","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [N N304 371539]","Our research was supported by a Grant of the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education No. N N304 371539.

Predators may in turn play an important role in structuring prey populations and communities. Responses of predators to variation in prey abundance have most commonly been demonstrated in low-diversity communities where food webs are relatively simple. How predators respond in highly diverse assemblages such as in coral reef habitats is largely unknown. This study describes an experiment that examined how the movement, diet and growth of the coral reef piscivore, Cephalopholis boenak (Serranidae) responded to variation in the abundance of its prey. Predator densities were standardised on small patch reefs made from the lagoonal reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica. These patch reefs exhibited natural variation in the abundance and community structure of multiple species of prey. However, our experiment generated a relatively simple predator-prey relationship, with C. boenak primarily responding to the most abundant species of prey. Three responses of predators were observed: aggregative, functional and developmental. Thirty-one per cent of individuals moved between patch reefs during the experiment, all from areas of relatively low to high prey density. Feeding rates were higher on patch reefs of high prey density, while growth rates of fish that remained on low prey density reefs throughout the experiment were lower. Growth rates of C. boenak on the experimental reefs were also much higher than for those living on natural patch reefs over the same time period, corresponding with overall differences in prey abundance. These results suggest that local abundance, feeding rate and growth of C. boenak were closely linked to the abundance of their main prey. This combination of predatory responses is a potential mechanism behind recent observations of density-dependent mortality and population regulation of prey in coral reef fish communities.","[Beukers-Stewart, B.

The prey (free-living tubificid oligochaetes and the tube-building polychaete, Pygospio elegans (Claparede)) were given different acclimation periods (1, 2 or 24 h) prior to predator (brown shrimp, Crangon crangon L.) introduction. Oligochaetes and Pygospio were tested both separately and combined at prey densities of 7500 ind.m(-2). Results showed that increasing acclimation period increased the survival of both prey types when tested separately. Significant differences were found between 1 and 2 h, but not after 24 h of acclimation. The survival of Pygospio was higher than that of oligochaetes. Survival of prey did not, however, increase with increasing acclimation period when the species were combined. Instead, the survival of oligochaetes was significantly lower after 24 h than after a l-h acclimation period. Overall, the results gave only weak support for the a priori hypothesis, but indicate that physical disturbance (simulated by short acclimation period) may increase the predation effect of Crangon on both oligochaetes and Pygospio. When present together the interference (competitive interaction) between the prey species particularly decreases the survival of oligochaetes.

Nevertheless, not all animals that defend resources evolve advanced forms of cooperation and sociality-many non-cooperative species occupy resources that do not differ in obvious ways from those inhabited by cooperative species. A key question is thus whether cooperation confers more subtle benefits, for example by allowing access to higher quality resources through competitive exclusion of less social rivals. In other words, it is not clear whether defendable resources are a necessary precondition for sociality or whether they also contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of cooperative societies. Here, we highlight how advances in imaging technology, machine-learning, and environmental reconstruction enable the collection of behavioural and ecological data in unparalleled quantity and quality to address this question. These new techniques are especially suited to compare small-scale differences in resource use between cooperative and non-cooperative species that share a general habitat and have similar ecologies. The lamprologine cichlids of Lake Tanganyika are a prominent example of such a system and Michael Taborsky's pioneering work on this group has done much to promote these fishes as models of social evolution. We show that habitat features indicative of increased resource quality, namely increased stone cover, are indeed associated with the distribution of cooperative cichlids-at least where these resources are relatively scarce. We thus support a point Michael Taborsky made in 1981: the evolution of cooperative behaviour among cichlids is tied to their close association with a crucial resource, the substrate in which they hide and breed. In the future, the techniques we introduce here will allow to also investigate whether this substrate is indeed more than just the necessary precondition for cooperation among fishes; in addition, they will likely find application in a wide range of research fields interested in the interplay between biotic and abiotic environmental factors.","[Jungwirth, Arne] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Dept Interdisciplinary Life Sci, Savoyenstr 1a, A-1160 Vienna, Austria; [Nuehrenberg, Paul; Jordan, Alex] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Nuehrenberg, Paul; Jordan, Alex] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, Constance, Germany","Jungwirth, A (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Vienna, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Dept Interdisciplinary Life Sci, Savoyenstr 1a, A-1160 Vienna, Austria.",arne.jungwirth@gmx.net,"; Jordan, Alex/D-8243-2011","Nuhrenberg, Paul/0000-0001-6352-3560; Jordan, Alex/0000-0001-6131-9734; Jungwirth, Arne/0000-0002-2962-4015",,,,118,2,2,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,OCT,2021,127,10,,,,,872,885,,10.1111/eth.13143,,,14,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,UO3OI,WOS:000694606400013,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2021-09-27,

Intra-guild predation between early larval instars of two co-existing dragonflies, Sympetrum fonscolombii and Trithemis kirbyi , was investigated with respect to temporal advantage and growth. Three situations were simulated experimentally: (1) Sympetrum fonscolombii began development 11 days before T. kirbyi . (2) Trithemis kirbyi began development 11 days before S. fonscolombii . (3) Both species began on the same day. 2. With a temporal advantage of 11 days to the second species, the resulting larval density of the respective first species was significantly higher than that of the second species. 3. Without a temporal advantage, the survival of S. fonscolombii was higher than that of T. kirbyi , and S. fonscolombii had a larger size due to faster growth than T. kirbyi . Hence, it is assumed that survival depended on early oviposition as well as on larval growth. 4. To test the relevance of the laboratory results, observations at artificial ponds in the Namibian semi-desert were conducted. Trithemis kirbyi was the first species colonising these ponds while S. fonscolombii arrived 15 days later. In field samples, many more Trithemis larvae than Sympetrum larvae were found, a pattern similar to the laboratory experiments in which T. kirbyi enjoyed a temporal advantage.","Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Zool, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany","Suhling, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Fasanenstr 3, D-38102 Braunschweig, Germany.",f.suhling@tu-bs.de,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",,,,40,32,37,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The relative strengths of these pathways are often compared using experimental approaches, but their evaluation in situ has been less frequent. We examined how individual and aggregate impacts of direct and indirect effects of species densities, proxies for competition and predation pressure, and habitat variables influenced patterns of larval density and body size of ringed (Ambystoma annulatum) and spotted salamanders (A. maculatum). We surveyed > 150 ponds in Missouri, USA, from 2012 to 2014 to measure the density and body size of each focal species, the density of co-occurring pond food web members, and select habitat features. We used structural equation modeling to quantify the relative importance of direct and indirect pathways on both body size and larval density. Overall, both responses were explained through a combination of direct and indirect effects. However, the magnitudes of direct effects were often greater than indirect effects. Some of the direct and indirect relationships with larval salamander size and density were also consistent with results from experimental studies. Finally, total direct and indirect effects were often weaker due to habitat and density variables negating each other's impacts. Overall, our study shows that direct effects were equivalent to, or more important than, indirect effects. We also demonstrate that the effects stemming from individual relationships can sum to produce net patterns that are negligible in magnitude. Further work on direct and indirect effects with observational data are needed to examine their magnitudes in natural communities.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Ousterhout, Brittany H.; Rowland, Freya E.; Drake, Dana L.; Burkhart, Jacob J.; Peterman, William E.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Anderson, Thomas L.] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Biol, Box 1651, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Rowland, Freya E.] Yale Univ, Sch Environm, New Haven, CT USA; [Drake, Dana L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Peterman, William E.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.; Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Biol, Box 1651, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",thander@siue.edu,"Rowland, Freya/AAE-4733-2021","Rowland, Freya/0000-0002-1041-5301","Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [SERDP RC-2155, SERDP RC-2703]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0943941]; GAANN FellowshipUS Department of Education","We thank R.

Different availabilities of decorating materials had a positive correlation on decorating amount by juveniles, while the correlation was not so clear in subadults. The amount of decorating decreased with increasing density of conspecific crabs in the presence of a predator, but there was so clear relationship in the absence of a predator. The decrease in decorating under high density could be due to intra-specific aggression, because the superior crab, in fighting, was found to be decorated with more algae. Tiarinia cornigera was found to be superior to the co-occurring different majid species Micippa platipes in fighting. When T. cornigera and M. platipes were housed together, the former was decorated with more algae than the latter in the presence of a predator, but in the absence of a predator, the amount of algae was not different.

In spite of this, it is difficult to assess just how important parasitism is for community structure because very few studies have been designed specifically to address the role of parasites at the community level, no doubt because it is difficult to manipulate the abundance of parasites in field experiments. Here, we bring together a large amount of published information on parasitism in intertidal communities to highlight the potential influence of parasites on the structure and biodiversity of these communities. We first review the impact of metazoan parasites on the survival, reproduction, growth and behaviour of intertidal invertebrates, from both rocky shores and soft-sediment flats. Published evidence suggests that the impact of parasites on individuals is often severe, though their effects at the population level are dependent on prevalence and intensity of infection. We then put this information together in a discussion of the impact of parasitism at the community level. We emphasize two ways in which parasites can modify the structure of intertidal communities. First, the direct impact of parasites on the abundance of key host species can decrease the importance of these hosts in competition or predator-prey interactions with other species. Second, the indirect effects of parasites on the behaviour of their hosts, e.g. burrowing ability or spatial distribution within the intertidal zone, can cause changes to various features of the habitat for other intertidal species, leading to their greater settlement success or to their local disappearance. Our synthesis allows specific predictions to be made regarding the potential impact of parasites in certain interridal systems, and suggests that parasites must be included in future community studies and food web models of intertidal ecosystems.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Poulin, R (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",robert.poulin@stonebow.otago.ac.nz,"Mouritsen, Kim N/N-3934-2014; Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008; Mouritsen, Kim N/K-6569-2013","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Mouritsen, Kim N/0000-0003-3564-8328",,,,139,249,257,3,141,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,,2002,124,,,S,,,S101,S117,,10.1017/S0031182002001476,,,17,Parasitology,Parasitology,607VD,WOS:000178810700008,12396219,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

We conducted experiments to determine the short-term response of two blowfly species to these interactions with respect to their persistence. A mathematical model was employed to extend the results obtained from these experiments to the long-term consequences of these interactions for the persistence of the blowfly species. Our experimental results revealed that IGP attenuated the strength of the effects of cannibalism and parasitism between blowfly host species, increasing the probability of persistence of both populations. The simulations obtained from the mathematical model indicated that IGP is a key interaction for the long-term dynamics of this system. The presence of different species interacting in a tri-trophic system relaxed the severity of the effects of a particular interaction between two species, changing species abundances and promoting persistence through time. This pattern was related to indirect interactions with a third species, the parasitoid species included in this study.","[Reigada, Carolina; Martinez de Aguiar, Marcus Aloizio] Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, Inst Fis Gleb Wataghin, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Lino Araujo, Sabrina Borges] Univ Fed Parana, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-81531990 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Giao, Juliana Zibordi] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Dept Parasitol, BR-18618000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Guimaraes, Paulo Roberto, Jr.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Trinca, Luzia Aparecida] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bioestat, UNESP, BR-18618000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Conde Godoy, Wesley Augusto] Escola Super Agr Luis Dequeiroz, Dept Entomol & Acarol, BR-13418900 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Reigada, C (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, Inst Fis Gleb Wataghin, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",ca.reigada@gmail.com; araujosbl@gmail.com; aguiar@ifi.unicamp.br; julianagiao@yahoo.com.br; prguima@usp.br; ltrinca@ibb.unesp.br; wacgodoy@usp.br,"Trinca, Luzia/C-7849-2012; Reigada, Carolina/A-2297-2013; Araujo, Sabrina Borges Lino/I-9274-2012; Guimaraes-Junior, Paulo R/M-1298-2016; Guimaraes, Paulo/B-1099-2008; Godoy, Wesley AC/B-9787-2012; de Aguiar, Marcus A M/C-9137-2012; Guimaraes, Paulo R./E-1915-2016; de Aguiar, Marcus A.

Whether successional paths dampen, track, or magnify extrinsic variation in initial conditions influences how much historical and site-specific detail is required to explain variation in patch composition. I investigated the patterns and importance of historical effects in a successional marine rocky intertidal community on the central coast of Oregon, USA. Patches in the mid-intertidal mussel bed (M. californianus) were manually cleared in a way that mimicked natural disturbances. In four separate blocks (large patches similar to 9 m(2)), three sets of plots were initiated with their starting dates staggered by one year. Within each set of plots, I manipulated the presence/absence of two groups of early successional sessile species under each of three predator densities. This design allowed me to address the following general questions: (1) What are the separate and interactive effects of successional age, yearly variation, and initial conditions on the temporal changes observed after disturbance? (2) When do interactions between early species act to dampen or magnify natural variation between years or starting dates? Succession in mid-intertidal patches in the mussel bed displayed complex patterns of historical effects, which varied among species and between different stages of succession. Embedded in this potential complexity were some consistent and repeatable successional trends. Some potentially important canalizing, or ''noise-dampening'' forces in this system included: (1) physiological and/or life history trade-offs between dispersal ability and competitive ability, (2) strong direct biotic interactions, which buffer environmental variability, and (3) compensatory (''buffering'') responses of species within an important functional group. ''Noise-amplifying'' forces included: (1) variable indirect effects of predators, (2) prey size escapes, and (3) predator saturation (or prey ''swamp'' escapes). Understanding the patterns and causes of consistency or contingency in succession will be critical for managing variability in landscapes that are increasingly dominated by anthropogenic disturbance regimes.","OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,128,101,102,0,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

On Pacific coral reefs, predation by the crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster planci, is associated with broad-scale losses of coral cover and increases of macroalgal cover. Macroalgal blooms increase coral macroalgal competition and can generate further coral decline. However, using a combination of manipulative field experiments and observations, we demonstrate that macroalgae, such as Sargassum polycystum, produce associational refuges for corals and dramatically reduce their consumption by Acanthaster. Thus, as Acanthaster densities increase, macroalgae can become coral mutualists, despite being competitors that significantly suppress coral growth. Field feeding experiments revealed that the protective effects of macroalgae were strong enough to cause Acanthaster to consume low-preference corals instead of high-preference corals surrounded by macroalgae. This highlights the context-dependent nature of coral-algal interactions when consumers are common. Macroalgal creation of associational refuges from Acanthaster predation may have important implications for the structure, function and resilience of reef communities subject to an increasing number of biotic disturbances.","[Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Aquat Chem Ecol Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Hay, ME (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",nnark.hay@biology.gatech.edu,"Hay, Mark E/D-9752-2011","Hay, Mark E/0000-0002-6130-9349","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE- 0929119]; NIH ICBG grants [U01-TW007401, U19TW007401]; Teasley Endowment to Georgia Tech; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [0929119] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [U19TW007401, U01TW007401] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Financial support provided by NSF grant no.

This is surprising not because competition is rare but because for a biogeographic pattern caused by species interactions to be detectable, it must be strong enough to override the many physical and historical differences that exist among real islands. Moreover, the direct pairwise links between species, once embedded in the complicated network of species interactions in entire communities, may become diluted and confused by the indirect interactions of still other species, particularly predators.

Theoretically, invasive species could have negligible or even positive effects if they sufficiently reduce the intensity of processes regulating native populations. Understanding such mechanisms is crucial to predicting ultimate ecological impacts. We used a mesocosm experiment to quantify the impact of eggs and larvae of the introduced cane toad (Bufo marinus) on fitness-related traits (number, size and time of emergence of metamorphs) of a native Australian frog species (Opisthodon ornatus). The results depended upon the timing of oviposition of the two taxa, and hence the life-history stages that came into contact. Growth and survival of O. ornatus tadpoles were enhanced when they preceded B. marinus tadpoles into ponds, and reduced when they followed B. marinus tadpoles into ponds, relative to when tadpoles of both species were added to ponds simultaneously. The dominant tadpole-tadpole interaction is competition, and the results are consistent with competitive priority effects. However, these priority effects were reduced or reversed when O. ornatus tadpoles encountered B. marinus eggs. Predation on toxic toad eggs reduced the survival of O. ornatus and B. marinus. The consequent reduction in tadpole densities allowed the remaining O. ornatus tadpoles to grow more rapidly and to metamorphose at larger body sizes (> 60% disparity in mean mass). Thus, exposure to B. marinus eggs reduced the number of O. ornatus metamorphs, but increased their body sizes. If the increased size at metamorphosis more than compensates for the reduced survival, the effective reproductive output of native anurans may be increased rather than decreased by the invasive toad. Minor interspecific differences in the seasonal timing of oviposition thus have the potential to massively alter the impact of invasive cane toads on native anurans.","[Crossland, Michael R.; Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Alford, Ross A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Shine, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rics@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Alford, Ross A/H-1577-2011; Crossland, Michael R/G-1091-2012","Alford, Ross A/0000-0002-3010-6768; Crossland, Michael R/0000-0001-9967-7158",CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and the Australian Research Council,"We thank Kay Bradfield for assistance with experimental work, the members of TeamBufo for encouragement and discussion, and the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and the Australian Research Council for financial support.

Using a set of field experiments conducted on small artificial patch reefs, we measured the relative importance of the effects of predators and conspecific competitors on the growth of a temperate reef fish, the blackeye goby Coryphopterus nicholsii, and we measured how the importance of the 2 processes varied over time. We found that predators and competitors reduced the growth of the gobies at some times, but not others, and that the relative importance of the 2 processes varied among time periods. Moreover, the importance of the 2 processes varied as a function of body size, with large, fast-growing individuals suffering relatively more from the effects of predators than small, slow-growing individuals, which felt the effects of competition more keenly. Competition increased the variation (CV) in growth rates within populations, but exposure to predators had no effect on growth variability. The strength of both the competitive and predatory effects on growth rates declined from summer to winter, but the effect of competition on growth variability did not change appreciably over time. The decline in the effects of competitors and predators on growth rates corresponded to predictable seasonal declines in water temperature and predator abundance. The relative importance of the sublethal effects of predators was greatest during the summer, when predators were most abundant. This study highlights the potential importance of sublethal effects of predators in marine systems and it suggests that the relative importance of predatory and competitive effects may vary in predictable seasonal and ontogenetic ways.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Steele, MA (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, 100 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",steele@uri.edu,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X",,,,63,10,10,0,7,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The spatial distributions of these beetles at the microhabitat scale were negatively correlated. We performed a removal experiment, progressively removing first 25% and then a further 25% of the population of the most abundant species, P. globosa, under the trees where most of the preferred food of both species is concentrated. There was no response of O. rugatipennis to this removal in the tree habitat. In the open, barely-vegetated habitat where most O. rugatipennis are found, the number of this species caught in pitfall traps increased following both removals and decreased following P. globosa replacement under the trees. It appears that intraspecific competition forces some P. globosa to occupy the open habitat. Interspecific competition between P. globosa and O. rugatipennis in the open habitat reduces the number of O. rugatipennis that can co-exist with P. globosa there. Removal of P. globosa under the trees allows conspecifics in the open habitat to move under the trees, releasing O. rugatipennis in the open habitat from competition. This then results in an increase in the numbers of O. rugatipennis in the open habitat as a result of immigration from neighbouring areas. We found that differences in foraging efficiency, measured as giving-up times in artificial food patches, create a likely mechanism of co-existence that explains the distinct preferences of these two species for tree and open habitats.","DESERT ECOL RES UNIT NAMIBIA,SWAKOPMUND 9000,NAMIBIA",,,"Ward, David/E-9814-2010; Seely, Mary Kathryn/AAI-1072-2019",,,,,64,14,14,0,14,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Three predatory chironomid species constituted numerically 8.8% (+/- 95% CL 2.2) of the macro-and meiobenthic community at the sediment surface and in the hyporheic zone of Oberer Seebach, a gravel stream in Lower Austria. Larvae of Thienemannimyia geijskesi (Goetghebuer) and Nilotanypus dubius (Meigen) occurred in higher densities in sediment depths between 10) and 40 cm, whereas Conchapelopia pallidula (Meigen) achieved higher densities at the sediment surface. The three species completed one generation in a year. 2. A total of ninety-seven prey species and instars were identified by gut analyses, of which forty-one benthic rotifer species constituted 69.5% of individuals and twenty-three chironomid species and their instars, 22.9%. The three tanypod species showed shifts from mainly rotifer species in early instars to chironomids and diverse other meio- and macrofaunal taxa in later instars. Rather than shifting towards larger prey sizes, growing predators expanded their upper size thresholds and continued to include smaller prey species in their diet. The extent to which tanypod instars fed on similar prey size classes declined with increasing larval size. Predation by tanypods amounted to 2.2% (+/- 95% CL 0.1) of the combined prey densities and prey consumption averaged 1.32 (bootstrap 95% CL 1.26-1.39) individuals per predator individual. 3. Preferences for microhabitat flow differed between predator species and in the prey assemblage. Prey densities and densities of T. geijskesi and C. pallidula were highest in pool areas, whereas N. dubius achieved high densities in riffle sites. 4. Tanypod larvae fed non-selectively among prey types. To test the significance of observed size(instar)-specific spatial and dietary overlap values amongst tanypod species, simulations were generated from random models for pairs of intra-and interspecific associations of individuals and groups of prey and predator species. Groups and individuals of tanypod instars fed near randomly on groups of prey types and a high proportion (P > 0.60) of prey individuals are quasi-randomly chosen by tanypods in those patches. Tanypod instar-pairs did not show a sustained trophic resource partitioning in time, thus reducing the degree of competitive interactions for food in this predator guild. Spatially segregated and non-segregated tanypod instars formed random aggregations independent of each other at different flow microhabitats. 5.

The impact of these declines on key ecological processes hinges on the degree of functional redundancy within large-herbivore assemblages, a subject that has received little study. We experimentally quantified the effects of three browser species (elephant, impala and dik-dik) on individual- and population-level attributes of Solanum campylacanthum (Solanum incanum sensu lato), an encroaching woody shrub, using semi-permeable exclosures that selectively removed different-sized herbivores. After nearly 5 years, shrub abundance was lowest where all browser species were present and increased with each successive species deletion. Different browsers ate the same plant species in different ways, thereby exerting distinct suites of direct and indirect effects on plant performance and density. Not all of these effects were negative: elephants and impala also dispersed viable seeds and indirectly reduced seed predation by rodents and insects. We integrated these diffuse positive effects with the direct negative effects of folivory using a simple population model, which reinforced the conclusion that different browsers have complementary net effects on plant populations, and further suggested that under some conditions, these net effects may even differ in direction.","[Pringle, Robert M.; Tarnita, Corina E.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82070 USA; [Palmer, Todd M.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [DeFranco, Elyse] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pringle, Robert M.; Goheen, Jacob R.; Palmer, Todd M.; Charles, Grace K.; DeFranco, Elyse; Hohbein, Rhianna; Ford, Adam T.; Tarnita, Corina E.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Ford, Adam T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Pringle, RM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rpringle@princeton.edu,,"Charles, Grace/0000-0003-2080-878X; Hohbein, Rhianna/0000-0003-2935-426X; Palmer, Todd/0000-0001-5710-9750",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-0852961]; Princeton Environmental Institute's Grand Challenges Programme; Canada's National Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Sherwood Family Foundation; Templeton Foundation FQEB grant; National Geographic's Committee for Research and ExplorationNational Geographic Society [CRE-9291-13],"Financial support was provided by the US National Science Foundation (OISE-0852961), the Princeton Environmental Institute's Grand Challenges Programme, Canada's National Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Sherwood Family Foundation, a Templeton Foundation FQEB grant and National Geographic's Committee for Research and Exploration (CRE-9291-13).",,42,41,41,1,79,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Females of T. towadensis laid a number of eggs into one oviposition cup irrespective of the existence of conspecific larvae in the laboratory. These results suggest that intense cannibalism by fourth instars to younger larvae occurred in the field. Seven species of mosquitoes including two predatory species, T. towadensis and Culex halifaxii, were observed. The number of prey larvae in pools decreased with an increase of the number of larvae of T. towadensis and the development of the predator.

Due to the large variety of insects that utilize carrion resources, predators are also often in high abundance, placing selective pressures on necrophagous insects to develop antipredator defenses. Blow fly antipredator defenses are largely studied for larval stages as they are heavily predated on when feeding on a carcass. Consequently, our understanding of adult defenses are limited. In this paper, a potential antipredator defense against the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta (Buren) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)), an invasive species to the Southeastern United States that is known to compete with and prey on necrophagous insects, was observed. During the summer and winter of 2019 in central Texas, USA adult blow flies (Lucilia spp. and Calliphora vicina (Robineau-Desvoidy) (Diptera: Calliphoridae)) were observed attempting to colonize chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) and rat (Rattus norvegicus) carcasses already colonized by fire ants. Ovipositing flies approached by fire ants buzzed their wings, seemingly to repel fire ants as they did not buzz their wings for flight unless engagement by fire ants was persistent or severe enough to drive the fly from the carcass. Wing buzzing is a common phenomenon across several insect orders and is thought to be used in part for defensive purposes. The primary non-flight related behavior regarding wing movements in blow flies is a mating display involving wing fanning in Lucilia sericata(Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae). However, this behavior is generally slower and more rhythmic than the aggressive buzzing flies exhibited against fire ants. Wing buzzing as an antipredator defense has been shown to increase survivorship in other insects, though wing damage may occur and wing movements cost energy. Further investigation of adult blow fly interactions with native and non-native predators will increase our understanding of wing buzzing as a potential antipredator defense in blow flies, and their consequences in applied fields.

Three common crayfish in northern Wisconsin and Michigan (native Orconectes virilis, non-native O.propinquus and non-native and invasive O.rusticus) are intermediate hosts for trematode parasites, Microphallus spp. Some species in the genus Microphallus alter host behaviour, increasing their predation risk, but the effects of microphallids on crayfish are unknown. Orconectes propinquus replaces O.virilis in most lakes where they are introduced, and O.rusticus replaces both. These species replacements have major effects on macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish. Therefore, differential parasite impacts on crayfish could have community-level effects if competitive outcomes are altered. We examined the shelter affinity of infected and uninfected individuals of all three species in laboratory experiments in the presence and absence of a conspecific. We also observed behaviour during agonistic interactions, and measured boldness by quantifying how quickly crayfish emerged from shelter with a predatory fish present. Infection with Microphallus substantially altered crayfish shelter affinity, shelter competition and boldness, though infection affected each species differently. Infection reduced shelter affinity in O.propinquus and the ability of O.virilis to compete for shelter against uninfected conspecifics. Infected crayfish were bolder in the presence of a predatory fish. Our results suggest that infection with Microphallus alters crayfish behaviour so that all three species are more vulnerable to predation. Orconectes propinquus is likely to suffer the greatest increase in predation when infected, due to a reduced affinity for shelter coupled with increased boldness. In lakes where crayfish species coexist, O.rusticus will probably be less affected by the parasite than either congener. Therefore, crayfish parasites could alter crayfish abundance and species composition in north temperate lakes via behavioural modifications.","[Reisinger, Lindsey S.; Petersen, Iris; Davila, Ryan L.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hing, Jing Sheng] Bemidji State Univ, Dept Biol, Bemidji, MN USA; [Lodge, David M.] Univ Notre Dame, Environm Change Initiat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Lodge, David M.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Reisinger, LS (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",lsargen1@nd.edu,"Reisinger, Lindsey S/F-8030-2016; Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021","Reisinger, Lindsey S/0000-0001-6685-5958; ",Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources; University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center; University of Notre Dame College of Science; NSF IGERTNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0504495],"We thank K.

As mosquito-borne diseases are undergoing a global resurgence, there is a need to better understand the factors that influence mosquito production in wetlands. Seasonal pools offer a model system in which to study mosquito production as they provide breeding habitat for many mosquito species. In the northeastern US, larval spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frog tadpoles (Lithobates sylvaticus) are common in pools and may affect mosquito growth and survival through predation or competition. To determine if these species interact, we conducted surveys of pools and found that larval mosquitoes were less abundant in pools with higher densities of larval salamanders. Experiments on mosquito oviposition and survival found that mosquitoes avoided ovipositing in habitats containing larval salamanders and tadpoles and had low survival in the presence of salamanders. These data indicate that predation by larval salamanders may influence the breeding distribution of mosquitoes by imposing selective pressure on ovipositing adults. Therefore, developing measures to protect amphibians in seasonal pools may contribute to controlling mosquito production in wetlands, potentially minimizing disease risk to humans.","[Rubbo, Michael J.] Teatown Lake Reservat, Ossining, NY 10562 USA; [Lanterman, Jessie L.] Hiram Coll, Dept Biol, Hiram, OH 44234 USA; [Falco, Richard C.] Fordham Univ, Arthropod Borne Dis Program, New York State Dept Hlth, Louis Calder Ctr, Armonk, NY 10504 USA; [Daniels, Thomas J.] Fordham Univ, Vector Ecol Lab, Louis Calder Ctr, Armonk, NY 10504 USA","Rubbo, MJ (corresponding author), Teatown Lake Reservat, 1600 Spring Valley Rd, Ossining, NY 10562 USA.",mrubbo@teatown.org,,,NSF REUNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [0552630]; Louis Calder Center-Biological Field Station of Fordham University; Div Of Biological InfrastructureNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1063076] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,We thank J.

It is not clear whether all interactions accounted for in such models will be realized in real communities. Here, we use community modules to experimentally explore whether the number of trophic links among species scales with community complexity (i.e. by adding species known to feed on each other from pairwise trials) in a simple mite community present in avocado orchards (Persea americana). By varying the presence of each of two predators (Euseius stipulatus and Neoseiulus californicus), one herbivore as shared prey (Oligonychus perseae) and pollen of Carpobrotus edulis as an alternative food resource, we mimicked communities with simple trophic chains, intraguild predation and/or apparent competition. We then assessed predation rates and the conversion of food into offspring in those communities. We found that increasing the number of potential interactions did not result in more complex realized community modules. Instead, all species effectively fed upon a single food item, hence all community modules actually corresponded to one or two linear trophic chains. Therefore, trophic links assumed to occur when species are assembled in pairs do not necessarily occur when other components of the community are present. Consequently, food web structure may be much less complex than predicted by theory.

Research conducted in Florida to understand the role of biotic factors in limiting the abundance of the western flower thrips is reviewed. Orius spp. (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) are effective predators that suppress populations of thrips on crop and non-crop hosts in southern and northern Florida. Orius are more effective predators of the western flower thrips than the native flower thrips, F. tritici (Fitch) and F. bispinosa (Morgan). The native species are competitors of the western flower thrips. Excessive fertilization and the use of broad-spectrum insecticides in crop fields further enhances populations of the western flower thrips. Interactions with native species clearly limit the abundance of western flower thrips in Florida, but populations are abundant in fertilized crop fields where application of insecticides excludes predators and competitor species.","[Funderburk, Joe; Srivastava, Mrittunjai] Univ Florida, North Florida Res & Educ Ctr, 155 Res Rd, Quincy, FL 32351 USA; [Frantz, Galen; Mellinger, Charles; Tyler-Julian, Kara] Glades Crop Care Inc, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA","Funderburk, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, North Florida Res & Educ Ctr, 155 Res Rd, Quincy, FL 32351 USA.",jef@ufl.edu,,,,,,39,11,11,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1672-9609,1744-7917,,INSECT SCI,Insect Sci.,APR,2016,23,2,,,,,175,182,,10.1111/1744-7917.12250,,,8,Entomology,Entomology,DH7YO,WOS:000373010300002,26149353,,,,2021-09-27,

(1) Field observations of tadpole aggregations revealed ecological factors that may interact with kinship to influence tadpole interactions. (2) In an experiment conducted in mesocosms, food distribution, predator presence, thermal heterogeneity, and kinship all interacted to influence tadpole dispersion. (3) In a field experiment conducted in natural ponds, kinship significantly influenced group size at artificially established food patches. (4) In a field enclosure experiment, density, access to the substrate, and kinship all interacted to significantly influence growth and survivorship of tadpoles. Subsequent analysis revealed that kinship affected the distribution of individual tadpole body size: mass was more skewed (i.e., more small individuals) in groups of mixed relatedness than in kin groups. The interaction among kinship, density, and substrate factors resulted in context-dependent effects on tadpole size distribution and survivorship.

Increased presence of juvenile and adult lane snapper could result in important competitive interactions with nGOM reef fishes, such as economically important red snapper L. campechanus, at multiple life stages and cause shifts in resource utilization and species composition of offshore fish assemblages. We investigated interactions between adult and juvenile lane and red snapper within experimental mesocosms. Although no significant effects on prey consumption were observed, interspecific competition between adults and juveniles was strongest, as adult lane snapper utilized habitats at higher rates than single juvenile red snapper in interaction trials. Additionally, adult red snapper most strongly displaced single juvenile lane snapper and increased their swimming activities in the presence of heterospecific juveniles. Adult red snapper also aggressively chased juvenile lane snapper and displaced them from habitats. However, less pronounced effects were observed for grouped juveniles in the presence of adults, especially juvenile red snapper, while adult lane snapper swam less in the presence of grouped juvenile lane and red snapper. Additionally, single juvenile red snapper swimming activities and prey consumption in the presence of adult snappers did not significantly differ from control values. Therefore, at small scales adult lane snapper may partially displace single juvenile red snapper, but clusters of red and lane snapper juveniles may be resilient to competitive effects of adult lane snapper and exert partial competitive pressures on them. As expected, we found that elevated aggressiveness by larger individuals resulted in dominance in space occupancy in one-on-one interactions. These findings suggest that prior occupation of preferred hard bottom habitat may be a determining factor for grouped juvenile red snapper competing against similar sized or larger individuals. Overall, our results indicate varying competitive vulnerabilities of red snapper to climate-related range expansions of tropical congeners.","[Marshak, Anthony R.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Marshak, Anthony R.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Marshak, Anthony R.] ECS Fed LLC, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Sci & Technol, 1315 East West Highway,F-ST7, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","Marshak, AR (corresponding author), Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA.; Marshak, AR (corresponding author), Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA.; Marshak, AR (corresponding author), ECS Fed LLC, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Sci & Technol, 1315 East West Highway,F-ST7, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",tony.marshak@noaa.gov,,,Richard C.

The competitors are two damselfishes, three-spot dascyllus (Dascyllus trimaculatus) and orange-fin anemonefish (Amphiprion chrysopterus), that vie for shelter space on a sea anemone (Heteractis magnifica). Anemonefish have an indirect positive effect on dascyllus populations due to the faster growth that anemones experience when they are occupied by Amphiprion. A long-term experiment revealed that anemonefish depressed dascyllus density (number of individuals per area of anemone per area of reef) more than abundance (number of individuals per reef area) because anemonefish caused a greater net increase in anemone surface area. We calculated that the effect of competition alone would depress dascyllus populations to near zero. The indirect positive interaction compensated for similar to67% of the direct negative effect. Failure to consider the indirect positive interaction in this system would lead to a gross underestimate of the strength of competition, and would not reveal the critical importance of the indirect mutualism in maintaining local populations of the inferior competitor. Indirect mutualisms are common in nature, and assessing how they mediate effects of other processes is crucial to a more accurate understanding of natural communities.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Holbrook, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",holbrook@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,,,,,37,29,30,1,31,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2004,85,4,,,,,979,985,,10.1890/03-0406,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,811IW,WOS:000220766600009,,,,,2021-09-27,

Often, predators on the same plant represent different life stages and different species. In these situations intraguild predation (IGP) may occur and may decrease the efficacy of that defense. Recently, several sticky plants have been found to increase indirect defense by provisioning predatory insects with entrapped insects (hereafter: carrion). We conducted observational studies and feeding trials with herbivores and predators on two sticky, insect-entrapping asters, Hemizonia congesta and Madia elegans, to construct food webs for these species and determine the prevalence of IGP in these carrion-provisioning systems. In both systems, intraguild predation was the most common interaction observed. To determine whether IGP was driven by resource abundance, whether it reduced efficacy of this indirect defense and whether stickiness or predator attraction was induced by damage, we performed field manipulations on H. congesta. Carrion supplementation led to an increase in predator abundance and IGP. IGP was asymmetric within the predator guild: assassin bugs and spiders preyed on small stilt bugs but not vice versa. Despite increased IGP, carrion provisions decreased the abundance of the two most common herbivores (a weevil and a mealybug). Overall seed set was driven by plant size, but number of seeds produced per fruit significantly increased with increasing carrion, likely because of the reduction in the density of a seed-feeding weevil. Observationally and experimentally, we found that carrion-mediated indirect defense of tarweeds led to much intraguild predation, though predators effectively reduced herbivore abundance despite the increase in IGP.","[LoPresti, Eric; Krimmel, Billy] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [LoPresti, Eric] Restorat Landscaping Co, Sacramento, CA USA; [Pearse, Ian S.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO USA","LoPresti, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",lopresti.eric@gmail.com,,,NSF-GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD); Jastro-Shields Fund at UC-Davis; Center for Population Biology Hardmann Native Plant Award,EL and BK were funded by NSF-GRFP during these studies; additional money came from the Jastro-Shields Fund at UC-Davis and the Center for Population Biology Hardmann Native Plant Award.,,52,10,11,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2018,127,7,,,,,1033,1044,,10.1111/oik.04806,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GL1JE,WOS:000436856200013,,,,,2021-09-27,

The IGP system is modeled here by a lattice gas model of the mean-field theory. First, we consider the IGP system of one species in which individuals of the same species cannibalize each other. The dynamical behavior of the model demonstrates a mechanism by which the intraspecific predation promotes persistence of the species. Then we consider the IGP system of two species with mutual predation. Global dynamics of the model exhibit basic properties of IGP: (i) When both species' efficiencies in converting the consumptions into fitness are large, the outcome of their interaction is mutualistic in form and the IGP promotes persistence of both species. (ii) When one species' efficiency is large but the other's is small, the interaction outcomes become parasitic in nature, in which an obligate species can survive through the mutual predation with a facultative one. (iii) When both species' efficiencies are small, the interaction outcomes are competitive in nature and the IGP leads to extinction of one of the species. A novel result of this work is that varying one parameter or population density of the species can lead to transition of interaction outcomes between mutualism, parasitism and competition. On the other hand, dynamics of the models demonstrate that over-predation or under-predation will result in extinction of one/both species, while intermediate predation is favorable under certain parameter ranges.

Among-species differences in the expression of constitutive and plastic traits may shape species distributions within a community. For many systems, the relationships among individual species' phenotypes, particularly morphological plasticity, and performance and distribution are poorly understood. 2. I tested whether three co-occurring species of marine snails in the genus Nucella differed in their constitutive and inducible defences against crabs, in terms of growth and shell architectural defence. I also tested whether among-species trait differences were associated with interspecific differences in antipredator performance (resistance to crushing) and distributions along a vertical tidal emersion gradient on rocky shores where the snails co-occur. 3. Species distributed lower on the shore and thus exposed to crabs for longer periods of time exhibited higher constitutive growth rates than the upper-shore species. Lower-shore species also exhibited greater inducible reductions in somatic growth and increases in shell thickening than the upper-shore species. Plastic alterations of the scaling relationship between shell-thickness and somatic growth (i.e. greater shell mass per body mass) enabled the two lower-shore species to produce stronger, more crab-resistant shells in the presence of crabs than their upper-shore congener. 4. Results suggest that species-specific differences in both constitutive and inducible shell defence and growth reflect growth/mortality tradeoffs that are associated with species' vertical distributions along a predation risk gradient. Thus, adaptive differences in inducible morphological defenses should be considered along with more traditionally studied traits such as behaviour and constitutive morphological defenses, when examining traits that influence patterns of species distribution along environmental gradients.","[Bourdeau, Paul E.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Bourdeau, PE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bourdea7@msu.edu,"Bourdeau, Paul/AAA-3551-2019","Bourdeau, Paul/0000-0002-8927-1899",A Ruth and Stephen Wainwright Fellowship,"I would like to thank the Director and Staff at Friday Harbor Labs for logistical support.

Intraspecific and interspecific competition are expected to result in additional stress and might increase the sensitivity of aquatic populations to pesticide contamination. To test this hypothesis, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the population dynamics of the micro-crustacean Daphnia magna under different levels of intraspecific and interspecific competition for an algal food resource, using the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus as competing species. The experiments were performed in glass jars with three different carbendazim concentrations (i.e., 50, 100 and 150 A mu g/L), and had a duration of 25 days, with a 4-day pre-treatment period in which competition was allowed to take place and a 21-day exposure period. The endpoints evaluated were D. magna total population abundance and population structure. Results of these experiments show that competition stress on its own had a significant influence on shaping D. magna population's structure, however, a different response was observed in the intraspecific and interspecific competition experiments. The use of a 4-day pre-treatment period in the intraspecific experiment already led to an absence of interactive effects due to the quick abundance confluence between the different intraspecific treatments, thus not allowing the observation of interactive effects between competition and carbendazim stress. Results of the interspecific competition experiment showed that rotifers were quickly outcompeted by D. magna and that D. magna even profited from the rotifer presence through exploitative competition, which alleviated the original stress caused by the algal resource limitation. These experiments suggest that competition interactions play an important role in defining population-level effects of pesticides in a more complex way than was hypothesized (increasing competition leading to a sensitivity increase), as the interspecific experiment showed. Therefore, these should be taken into account in the extrapolation of single-species toxicity data to protect higher levels of biological organization.","[Isabel Del Arco, Ana] Univ Jaen, Dept Plant Biol Anim Biol & Ecol, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Rico, Andreu; van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van den Brink, Paul J.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Del Arco, AI (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Dept Plant Biol Anim Biol & Ecol, B3 078 Campus Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain.",aarco@ujaen.es,"van den brink, Paul/AAT-7144-2020; Rico, Andreu/G-1102-2016","van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347; Rico, Andreu/0000-0002-1820-4218; del Arco Ochoa, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-5690-4979",Long Range Initiative of CEFIC [LRI-ECO19]; Jaen University,"The authors thank John Beijer, Marie-Claire Boerwinkel and Ivo Roessink for providing useful advices, and Carry van Mameren and Steven Crum for performing the chemical analysis.

This is the first quantitative model that simulates characteristic population dynamics in the system. A striking feature of the experiment was three consecutive regimes of limit cycles, chaotic dynamics and a fixed point. Our model reproduces this pattern. Numerical simulations of the system reveal the presence of a chaotic attractor in the intermediate parameter window between two regimes of periodic coexistence (stable limit cycles). In particular, this intermediate structure can be explained by competition between the two distinct periodic dynamics. It provides the basis for stable coexistence of all three species: environmental perturbations may result in huge fluctuations in species abundances, however, the system at large tolerates those perturbations in the sense that the population abundances quickly fall back onto the chaotic attractor manifold and the system remains. This mechanism explains how chaos helps the system to persist and stabilize against migration. In discrete populations, fluctuations can push the system towards extinction of one or more species. The chaotic attractor protects the system and extinction times scale exponentially with system size in the same way as with limit cycles or in a stable situation.","[Groll, Fanny; Altland, Alexander] Univ Cologne, Inst Theoret Phys, Zulpicher Str 77, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Arndt, Hartmut] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Gen Ecol, Bioctr, Zulpicher Str 47b, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Groll, F (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Theoret Phys, Zulpicher Str 77, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.",fgroll@thp.uni-koeln.de,"Arndt, Hartmut/K-9364-2017","Arndt, Hartmut/0000-0003-2811-3595; Groll, Fanny/0000-0003-1230-5891","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB TR12, SPP 1162 (AR 288/14), SPP 1374 (AR 288/16)]","We thank Lutz Becks for useful discussion and helpful comments.

Therefore, the ecosystemimpacts of their possible loss remain mostly unknown. We assessed whether the presence/absence of an endangered predatory fish (Barbus meridionalis (A. Risso, 1827)) in an intermittent stream affects leaf fungal biomass and leaf quality (i.e. leaf carbon: nitrogen ratio and leaf toughness), macroinvertebrate assemblages colonizing leaf packs, and leaf breakdown rates. We conducted a leaf bag experiment comparing a control reach with a population of B. meridionalis with an adjacent upstream fishless reach. In the fishless reach, leaf fungal biomass and microbially mediated breakdown rate were lower compared to the control reach. This was probably caused by the lack of the bottom-up stimulation through nutrient recycling by fish. Shredders and scrapers were found at higher abundance and biomass in the fishless compared to the control reach, and the whole macroinvertebrate community composition changed with fish absence. Consequently, macroinvertebrate mediated leaf breakdown was faster in the fishless than in the control reach, not only compensating for the lower microbially mediated leaf breakdown in the fishless reach, but accelerating the overall leaf breakdown rate. Our study contributes to understand the potential cascading effects produced by the extirpation of endangered small-bodied fish. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Evolutionary studies of plasticity can predict conditions under which shifts in phenotypes will occur and, therefore, may modify species interactions. We studied evolutionary mechanisms maintaining an induced response to predators in Triturus newt larvae, which are among many taxa in freshwater habitats exhibiting predator-induced plasticity. When exposed to caged (nonlethal) Aeshna dragonfly larvae, newts of two species (T. alpestris and T. helveticus) spent more time hiding in the leaf litter, had darker pigmentation in the tail fin, and developed larger heads and larger tails relative to their body size, in comparison with newts in predator-free ponds. The two phenotypes faced a performance trade-off across environments with and without odonates: the predator-induced phenotype survived twice as well as the no-predator phenotype when exposed to free dragonflies, but the predator-induced phenotype of both species grew more slowly until just before metamorphosis. For Triturus alpestris, a direct comparison of performance between phenotypes was;complicated because predator-induced newts emerged later in the summer but at a larger body size. Nonrandom mortality imposed by hunting dragonflies caused selection favoring increasing tail size, but we found no selection on specific traits in predator-free ponds. Head shape was not subject to selection in either environment; we suspect that head shape is involved in consuming different prey in the presence and absence of predators and is unrelated to predator escape. Triturus in 25 natural populations from which we collected quantitative samples in 1997 and 1998 exhibited extreme spatial variation in predation regime (density of large predators ranged from 0 to 24 individuals/m(2)). Variation among populations in head shape was exactly as predicted by experimental results (Triturus of both species had relatively large heads when exposed to predators), but results for tail shape were consistent with the experiments in only one of the two years. The evolutionary mechanisms maintaining plasticity in Triturus and other amphibian larvae should apply to many organisms inhabiting freshwater ponds, so trait-mediated indirect effects seem especially likely to occur in these habitats.","Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Basel, Inst Zool, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland","Van Buskirk, J (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",jvb@zool.unizh.ch,"Langerhans, R.

In the laboratory, caterpillars eat the largest available ant larvae, although eggs, small larvae and prepupae are also palatable. This is an efficient way to predate. It ensures that newly-adopted caterpillars consume the final part of the first cohort of ant brood in a nest, before this pupates in early autumn and becomes unavailable as prey. At the same time, the fixed number of larvae in the second cohort is left to grow larger before being killed in late autumn and spring. Caterpillars also improve their feeding efficiency by hibernating for longer than ants in spring, losing just 6% of their weight while the biomass of ant larvae increases by 27%. Final instar caterpillars acquire more than 99% of their ultimate biomass in Myrmica nests, growing from 1.3 mg to an estimated 173 mg. A close correlation was found between the weights of caterpillars throughout autumn and the number of large ant larvae they had eaten. This was used to calculate the number of larvae eaten in spring, allowing both for the loss of caterpillar weight during winter and the increase in the size of their prey in spring. It is estimated that 230 of the largest available larvae, and a minimum nest size of 354 M. sabuleti workers, is needed to support one butterfly. Few wild M. sabuleti nests are this large: on one site, it was estimated that 85% of nests were too small to produce a butterfly, and only 5% could support two or more. This prediction was confirmed by the mortalities of 376 caterpillars in 151 wild M. sabuleti nests there. Mortalities were particularly high in nests that adopted more than two caterpillars, apparently due to scramble competition and starvation in autumn. Survival was higher than predicted in wild nests that adopted one caterpillar. These caterpillars seldom exhaust their food before spring, when there is intense competition among Myrmica for nest sites. Ants often desert their nests in the absence of brood, leaving the caterpillar behind. Vacant nests are frequently repopulated by a neighbouring colony, carrying in a fresh supply of brood. Maculinea arion caterpillars have an exceptional ability to withstand starvation, and sometimes survive to parasitize more than one Myrmica colony. Despite these adaptations, predation is an inefficient way to exploit the resources of a Myrmica nest. By contrast, Maculinea rebeli feeds mainly at a lower trophic level, on the regurgitations of worker ants. Published data show that Myrmica nests can support 6 times more caterpillars of Maculinea rebeli than of M. arion in the laboratory. This is confirmed by field data.",,"THOMAS, JA (corresponding author), INST TERR ECOL,FURZEBROOK RES STN,WAREHAM BH20 5AS,DORSET,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,30,95,97,0,25,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1992,91,1,,,,,101,109,,10.1007/BF00317247,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JG187,WOS:A1992JG18700015,28313380,,,,2021-09-27,

We used a food web approach to investigate the population dynamics of an abundant Arctic mosquito species,Aedes nigripes(Diptera: Culicidae). Specifically, we evaluated the importance of bottom-up variation in aquatic biofilms (food) and top-down predation from diving beetles (Colymbetes dolabratus, Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) on mosquito population performance. In spring 2018, we tracked mosquito and predator populations across eight ponds in western Greenland, measured biofilm productivity with standardized samplers, and estimated grazing pressure by invertebrate consumers with an in situ exclosure experiment. We also assessed the quality of biofilms as nutrition for mosquito larvae and evaluated pond attributes that might influence biofilm productivity and food quality. Our results indicated that mosquito population dynamics were more related to resource quality and intraspecific competition than to the density of predaceous diving beetles. Ponds with better quality biofilm tended to have more hatching larvae and those populations experienced higher per capita mortality. This aggregation of larvae in what would otherwise be the best mosquito ponds was enough to produce relatively low fitness. Thus, the landscape would support more mosquitoes if they instead distributed themselves to match predictions of the ideal free distribution. Although mortality rates were highest in ponds with the highest initial densities, the increased mortality was not generally enough to compensate for initial abundance, and 78% of the variation in the density of mosquitoes emerging from ponds was explained by the initial number of larvae in a pond. Resource quality was a strong predictor of consumer abundance, yet there was no evidence that biofilm grazing pressure was greater in ponds where mosquito density was higher. Collectively, our results suggest that mosquito ponds in western Greenland are a mosaic of source and pseudo-sink populations structured by oviposition tendencies, biofilm resource quality, and density-dependent larval mortality.","[DeSiervo, Melissa H.; Ayres, Matthew P.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Ayres, Matthew P.; Virginia, Ross A.; Culler, Lauren E.] Dartmouth Coll, Inst Arctic Studies, Dickey Ctr Int Understanding, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Virginia, Ross A.; Culler, Lauren E.] Dartmouth Coll, Environm Sci Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","DeSiervo, MH (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",mhd.gr@dartmouth.edu,"Ayres, Matthew/AAI-6873-2020","Ayres, Matthew/0000-0001-6120-9068; DeSiervo, Melissa/0000-0002-6373-025X; Culler, Lauren/0000-0003-2300-5405; Virginia, Ross/0000-0002-0890-0981","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OPP-1506155, OPP-1748137]; Dickey Center for International Understanding (McCulloch fellowship)","We thank Balthasar Von Huene, Alex Stendahl, Hanna Bliska, and Reyn Hutton for their help in the field and Ali Prevost-Reilly for her help in the lab.

Interaction chains result from linked direct interactions between species pairs. Interaction modifications, emergent effects of a multispecies assemblage, result when a third species changes how a pair of other species interacts. Experiments and patterns of abundance in the upper zone of a rocky intertidal community provide examples of both types of indirect effects. By consuming limpets (Lottia digitalis), bird predators indirectly enhance acorn barnacle (Balanus glandula) abundance on horizontal rock benches because limpets dislodge or inadvertently consume young acorn barnacles, an example of an interaction chain. Because L. digitalis has a light-colored shell that is similar in color to barnacle shells, barnacles alter the bird-limpet interaction by changing the ability of birds to find limpets, an example of an interaction modification. Distinguishing between interaction chains and interaction modifications is important because interaction chains can be predicted with only a knowledge of pairwise species interactions while descriptions of interaction modifications require a knowledge of all species combinations involved, precluding a priori prediction. By classifying empirically determined indirect effects, the degree to which indirect effects can be predicted from a knowledge of pairwise interactions can be determined, and the mechanisms that cause interaction modifications can be identified to aid in future prediction.","UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT ZOOL, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,"Langerhans, R.

The mesopredator suppression hypothesis predicts that a superpredator may either simultaneously repress two mesopredators, restrain the dominant one and thereby release the subdominant mesopredator, or elicit different responses by both mesopredators. We show the outcome arising from such conditions in a three-level predator assemblage (Eurasian eagle owl Bubo bubo L., northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis L. and common buzzard Buteo buteo L.) studied over 25years. In the second half of the study period, the eagle owl re-colonized the study area, thereby providing a natural experiment of superpredator introduction. We combined this set-up with detailed GIS analysis of habitat use and a field experiment simulating intrusion by the superpredator into territories of the subdominant mesopredator, the buzzard. Although population trends were positive for all three species in the assemblage, the proportion of failed breeding attempts increased significantly in both mesopredators after the superpredator re-colonized the area. We predicted that superpredator-induced niche shifts in the dominant mesopredator may facilitate mesopredator coexistence in superpredator-free refugia. We found significant changes in nesting habitat choice in goshawk, but not in buzzard. Since competition for enemy-free refugia and the rapid increase in population density may have constrained niche shifts of the subdominant mesopredator, we further predicted behavioural changes in response to the superpredator. The field experiment indeed showed a significant increase in aggressive response of buzzards towards eagle owl territory intrusion over the course of 10years, probably due to phenotypic plasticity in the response towards superpredation risk. Overall, our results show that intraguild predation can be a powerful force of behavioural change, simultaneously influencing habitat use and aggressiveness in predator communities. These changes might help to buffer mesopredator populations against the negative effects of intraguild predation.","[Mueller, Anna-Katharina; Chakarov, Nayden; Heseker, Hanna; Krueger, Oliver] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Chakarov, Nayden] Lund Univ, Dept Biol Mol Ecol & Evolut Lab, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Mueller, AK (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",annakatharinamueller@web.de,,,Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt; Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen,We are indebted to Ulrich Stefener who gathered a large part of the goshawk field data.

A trophic cascade occurs when predators directly decrease the densities, or change the behaviour, of herbivores and thus indirectly increase plant productivity. The predator-herbivore-plant context is well known, but some predators attack species beneficial to plants (e. g. pollinators) and/or enemies of herbivores (e.g. parasites), and their role in the dynamics of mutualisms remains largely unexplored. 2. We surveyed the predatory ant species and studied predation by the dominant ant species, the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina, associated with the fig tree Ficus racemosa in southwest China. We then tested the effects of weaver ants on the oviposition behaviour of pollinating and non-pollinating fig wasps in an ant-exclusion experiment. The effects of weaver ants on fig wasp community structure and fig seed production were then compared between trees with and without O. smaragdina. 3. Oecophylla smaragdina captured more non-pollinating wasps (Platyneura mayri) than pollinators as the insects arrived to lay eggs. When ants were excluded, more non-pollinators laid eggs into figs and fewer pollinators entered figs. Furthermore, trees with O. smaragdina produced more pollinator offspring and fewer non-pollinator offspring, shifting the community structure significantly. In addition, F. racemosa produced significantly more seeds on trees inhabited by weaver ants. 4. Oecophylla smaragdina predation reverses the dominance of the two commonest wasp species at the egg-laying stage and favours the pollinators. This behavioural pattern is mirrored by wasp offspring production, with pollinators' offspring dominating figs produced by trees inhabited by weaver ants, and offspring of the non-pollinator P. mayri most abundant in figs on trees inhabited by other ants. 5. Overall, our results suggest that predation by weaver ants limits the success of the non-pollinating P. mayri and therefore indirectly benefits the mutualism by increasing the reproductive success of both the pollinators and the plant. Predation is thus a key functional factor that can shape the community structure of a pollinator-plant mutualistic system.","[Wang, Bo; Geng, Xiang-Zong; Wang, Rui-Wu] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Menglun 666303, Peoples R China; [Geng, Xiang-Zong] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Biol Engn, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Li-Bin] NE Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Cook, James M.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Cook, James M.] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AS, Berks, England","Wang, RW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",ruiwukiz@hotmail.com,"Cook, James/S-2128-2019; Cook, James M/D-6423-2011","Cook, James/0000-0001-8447-6126; Cook, James M/0000-0001-8447-6126; Wang, Bo/0000-0002-3541-4639","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31300318, 31170408, 31270433]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2013M531993]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young ScholarsNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [31325005]; NSFC-Yunnan United fund [U1302267]; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences; Special Fund for the Excellent Youth of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-EW-Q-9]","We thank professor Yan-Qiong Peng for classification of fig wasps; professor Da-Rong Yang (Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for field assistance; Dr. Min Lu (Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science) for his suggestions and comments on an early version of this manuscript; and Kimihiro Noguchi (University of California, Davis) and Lei Shi (Yunnan University of Finance and Economics), who kindly provided instructions on the use of the R package nparLD and statistics analysis suggestions.

An outplanting experiment using Acropora cervicornis, Montastraea cavernosa, and Orbicella faveolata was conducted to compare performance among species and evaluate the impacts of contact interactions with macroalgae and the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum. Montastraea cavernosa and O. faveolata showed high survivorship (78% and 92%, respectively) over 18 mo. However, surviving colonies had limited growth and lost tissue due to factors like predation and disease. In contrast, A. cervicornis showed exponential growth. Colonies in contact with macroalgae showed the lowest survivorship. Removing macroalgae provided no long-term benefits in growth and a slight improvement in colony survivorship. Acropora cervicornis in contact with Palythoa grew 45% less than controls. Our study showed that: (1) coral taxa with massive morphologies (40-130 cm(2)) can be transplanted with low colony mortality but that their slow growth is not enough to balance partial tissue mortality caused by multiple chronic stressors; (2) removal of macroalgae at the time of outplanting improves colony survivorship; (3) periodic removal of macroalgae does not enhance growth; and (4) contact with Palythoa should be avoided. The impacts of contact competition were variable among species with different colony morphologies, with A. cervicornis showing the highest susceptibility to competition from algae and Palythoa. While restoration can rapidly increase coral abundance, long-term success will require a multifaceted approach to reduce the impacts of chronic reef stressors on wild and outplanted corals alike.","[Lustic, Caitlin] Nature Conservancy, 127 Ind Rd,Suite D, Big Pine Key, FL 33043 USA; [Maxwell, Kerry; Reckenbeil, Brian] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 2796 Overseas Hwy,Suite 119, Marathon, FL 33050 USA; [Bartels, Erich] Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, 24244 Overseas Hwy, Summerland Key, FL 33042 USA; [Utset, Emily] Columbia Univ, 116th St & Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Schopmeyer, Stephanie] Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Zink, Ian] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Lirman, Diego] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Lirman, D (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",dlirman@rsmas.miami.edu,,,Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's program; Florida's Wildlife Legacy Initiative; US Fish and Wildlife Service's State Wildlife Grants programUS Fish & Wildlife Service [F15AF00517]; Nature Conservancy,"Funding for this project was provided by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's program, Florida's Wildlife Legacy Initiative, the US Fish and Wildlife Service's State Wildlife Grants program (F15AF00517), and The Nature Conservancy.

Such phenomena may be demonstrated in terms of diet, and the quantities and types of resources that are consumed are commonly considered. The marine amphipod Echinogammarus marinus, a recently demonstrated predator on intertidal rocky shores, has been shown to consume a wide range of food types but it is unknown how this may vary between individuals. Here, we investigated the variation that occurs both among and within individuals of a population of E. marinus with respect to the mean numbers consumed of a common prey item, the isopod Jaera nordmanni. First, by comparing the length of starvation times, used as a proxy for hunger level, individuals maintained without food for up to 24 h consumed significantly less prey during feeding trials than those starved for 48 hand longer. The degree of inter-individual variation within each starvation period was also found to differ, with greater variation among individuals starved for shorter periods of time than those starved for longer time periods. Secondly, we tested whether individual amphipods tracked over time consumed consistently similar numbers of prey or whether they showed intra-individual variation, and if so, to what degree. We found that the numbers of prey consumed per individual could be predicted in the short-term between consecutive feeding trials, however over the long-term this relationship broke down. These results are discussed with respect to potential physiological and behavioural mechanisms, as well as the implications that such variation may have for stability of prey populations in the field.

Alternatively, the release of multiple predator species may yield a lower than expected prey mortality due to competitive interactions (including intraguild predation) amongst predators. The question of whether and when multiple natural enemies interact to produce lower or higher prey mortality than each predator species acting alone depends on the details of predator-predator interactions. In this study, we investigated whether combined releases of Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus provide better biological control of Tetranychus cinnabarinus on strawberry than releases of each predator species alone. Experiments were conducted in two commercial strawberry fields (Fragaria ananassa Duch. cv. 'Camarosa'). The release of A persimilis alone and the combined release of N. californicus and P. persimilis reduced the numbers of T cinnabarinus on strawberry equally. The densities of T. cinnabarinus in the treatment with N. californicus alone were significantly higher than in the other treatments, and this was the only treatment in which the economic injury level was surpassed. The densities of P. persimilis in absence of N. californicus were similar to those in presence of N. californicus. Hence, there was no significant adverse effect of the presence of N. californicus on the densities of P. persimilis. The densities of N. californicus in the absence of A persimilis were lower than the densities in the presence of P. persimilis, but this difference was not significant. We conclude that, compared to releases with P. persimilis alone, there is no advantage to releasing N. californicus, either alone or in combination with P. persimilis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To correctly interpret chironomid faunas for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, it is essential that we improve our understanding of the relative influence of ecosystem variables, biotic as well as physicochemical, on chironomid larvae. To address this, we analysed the surface sediments from 39 shallow lakes (29 Norfolk, U.K., 10 Denmark) for chironomid head capsules, and 70 chironomid taxa (including Chaoborus) were identified. 2. The shallow lakes were selected over large environmental gradients of aquatic macrophytes, total phosphorus (TP) and fish communities. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified two significant variables that explained chironomid distribution: macrophyte species richness (P < 0.001) and TP (P < 0.005). Generalised linear models (GLM) identified specific taxa that had significant relationships with both these variables. Macrophyte percentage volume infested (PVI) and species richness were significant in classifying the lake types based on chironomid communities under twinspan analysis, although other factors, notably nutrient concentrations and fish communities, were also important, illustrating the complexities of classifying shallow lake ecosystems. Lakes with plant species richness > 10 all had relatively diverse (Hill's N2) chironomid assemblages, and lakes with Hill's N2 > 10 all had TP < 250 mu g L-1 and total fish densities < 2 fish per m2. 3. Plant density (PVI), and perhaps more importantly species richness, were primary controls on the distribution of chironomid communities within these lakes. This clearly has implications for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions using zoobenthos remains (i.e. chironomids) and suggests that they could be used to track changes in benthic/pelagic production and could be used as indicators of changing macrophyte habitat. 4. Measuring key biological gradients, in addition to physicochemical gradients, allowed the major controls on chironomid distribution to be assessed more directly, in terms of plant substrate, food availability, competition and predation pressure, rather than implying indirect mechanisms through relationships with nutrients. Many of these variables, notably macrophyte abundance and species richness, are not routinely measured in such studies, despite their importance in determining zoobenthos in temperate shallow lakes. 5. When physical, chemical and ecological gradients are considered, as is often the case with palaeo-reconstructions rather than training sets chosen to maximise one gradient, complex relationships exist, and attempting to reconstruct a single trophic variable quantitatively may not be appropriate or reliable.","[Langdon, Peter G.] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Ruiz, Zoe; Wynne, Shirley] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Sch Geog Archaeol & Earth Resources, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Sayer, Carl D.; Davidson, Thomas A.] UCL, Dept Geog, Environm Change Res Ctr, London, England","Langdon, PG (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",p.g.langdon@soton.ac.uk,"Langdon, Peter G/B-4682-2013; Davidson, Thomas A/C-6542-2011","Davidson, Thomas A/0000-0003-2326-1564; Langdon, Peter/0000-0003-2724-2643","NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NER/B/S/2003/00824, GT5/98/21/CS, GR8/4350, NER/S/A/2001/06429]","We are grateful to all the landowners, land managers and gamekeepers who allowed access to the sites as well as publication of the data.

Ant-aphid food-for-protection mutualisms are suitable to study the implications of intra-guild service variation because they often involve several ant species with varying levels of aggressiveness. We studied an aphid species and its associated ant guild to address whether intra-guild defence variation against aphid natural enemies explains aphid performance on plants (thistles). We surveyed plants with natural abundances of aphids associated with different ant species and estimated aphid population growth. We conducted confrontation experiments between ant species and aphid natural enemies (ladybugs and hoverfly larvae). In plants patrolled by the most aggressive ant species, we determined the ant's probability of expelling aphid natural enemies and tested whether ant exclusion affects the abundance of aphids and their natural enemies. The antDorymyrmex tenerwas the most abundant and frequent species on plants and the most aggressive against aphid natural enemies. Aphid populations grew faster on plants patrolled byD. tenercompared to plants patrolled byCamponotus distinguendusorD. richteri. Field experiments confirmed thatD. tenereffectively expels aphid natural enemies from plants. WhenD. tenerwas excluded, the density of aphids decreased, while the abundance of aphid natural enemies increased. The disruption of aphid predation by aggressive and numerically dominant ant species is a determinant of aphid population dynamics. This study illustrates the importance of considering intra-guild service variation to better understand multi-partner mutualisms.","[Devegili, Andres M.; Lescano, Maria N.; Farji-Brener, Alejandro G.] UNComa, CONICET, Lab Invest Hormigas LIHO, Lab Ecotono,INIBIOMA, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Gianoli, Ernesto] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile; [Gianoli, Ernesto] Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile","Devegili, AM (corresponding author), UNComa, CONICET, Lab Ecotono, Pasaje Gutierrez 1125, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",andresdevegili@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,"Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/I-8372-2019; Devegili, Andres Matias/AAW-8644-2021; Gianoli, Ernesto/A-7984-2015","Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/0000-0001-7251-3866; Gianoli, Ernesto/0000-0003-4246-8640; Devegili, Andres/0000-0003-0750-4335",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas of ArgentinaConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"We thank Agustin Lovrich, Tomas Gonzalez, and Daniela Gonzalez for field assistance and Florencia Baudino and Guillermo Gonzalez for help with the identification of ladybug species.

Here, using two terrestrial Testudinidae (Stigmochelys pardalis and Kinbcys belliana) as study models, we (i) present basic demographic characteristics (sex-ratio, and density), (ii) describe correlates of their presence at two spatial scales (micro-habitat and macro-habitat), (iii) evaluate the effects of rainfall on their seasonal activity patterns, and (iv) analyze abundance patterns in relation to macro and micro-habitat characteristics. We also describe an experiment, using tortoise shells, that can allow to control, and eventually correct, the reliability of observed data by taking into account the detectability of the study species in the wild. On the basis of a suite of statistical analysis and GIS-based elaborations, we confirmed, and further uncovered, the remarkable ecological differences existing between S. pardalis and K. belliana. The habitat use was different interspecifically, with K. belliana being much more linked to dense vegetation spots, often nearby waterbodies, whereas S. pardalis being an habitat generalist, at both micro- and macmhabitat scale. Nonetheless, juveniles of both species were observed in areas with significantly higher % soil covered by vegetation taller than 200 cm than adults of both sexes. This different habitat selection is hypothesized to be due to antipredatory reasons. Overall, our data suggests that interspecific competition should be minimal between these species.","[Demaya, Gift Simon; Benansio, John Sebit] Univ Juba, Dept Wildlife, Juba, South Sudan; [Petrozzi, Fabio] Ecolobby, Via E Jenner 70, I-00151 Rome, Italy; [Di Vittorio, Massimiliano] Ecol Applicata Italia Srl, Termini Imerese, PA, Italy; [Fa, John E.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Div Biol & Conservat Ecol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Fa, John E.] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, CIFOR Headquarters, Bogor 16115, Indonesia; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, BP 6057, Lome, Togo; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, PMB 5080, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; [Dendi, Daniele; Luiselli, Luca] IDECC Inst Dev Ecol Conservat & Cooperat, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, BP 6057, Lome, Togo.",gftsimon@yahoo.co.uk; sebitbenansio@yahoo.co.uk; fapetrozzi@gmail.com; divittoriomassimiliano@gmail.com; jfa949@gmail.com; l.luiselli@ideccngo.org,"Dendi, Daniele/AAO-8569-2020","Dendi, Daniele/0000-0003-1417-9091","Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund [172515472, 182518886]; Rainforest Trust; Turtle Conservation Fund [TCF-0687]; National GeographicNational Geographic Society [NGS-52320C-18]; Quarters for Conservation Award","This study was supported by Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (grant no. 172515472 and 182518886), the Rainforest Trust, Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF-0687), National Geographic (NGS-52320C-18), and Quarters for Conservation Award (all funds to L.

Interspecific competition and facilitation between predators may either enhance or dampen trophic cascades, ultimately influencing total predator effects on communities and biogeochemical cycling of ecosystems. However, previous studies have only investigated the effects of a single predator species on CO2 flux of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we measured and compared the individual and joint effects of predatory damselfly larvae and diving beetles on total prey biomass, leaf litter processing, and dissolved CO2 concentrations of experimental bromeliad ecosystems. Damselfly larvae created strong trophic cascades that reduced CO2 concentrations by 46 % relative to no-predator treatments. Conversely, the effects of diving beetles on prey biomass, leaf litter processing, and dissolved CO2 were not statistically different to no-predator treatments. Relative to multiplicative null models, the presence of damselfly larvae and diving beetles together resulted in antagonistic relations that eliminated trophic cascades and top-down influences on CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, we showed that the antagonistic interactions between predators occurred due to a tactile response that culminated in competitive displacement of damselfly larvae. Our results demonstrate that predator identity and predator-predator interactions can influence CO2 concentrations of an aquatic ecosystem. We suggest that predator effects on CO2 fluxes may depend on the particular predator species removed or added to the ecosystem and their interactions with other predators.","[Atwood, Trisha B.; Richardson, John S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & C onservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Atwood, Trisha B.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4069, Australia; [Hammill, Edd; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hammill, Edd; Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hammill, Edd] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia","Atwood, TB (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & C onservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",tatwood16@gmail.com,"Richardson, John/G-1513-2012","Richardson, John/0000-0001-8135-7447",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada) grants,"We would like to thank J.

Microenvironmental variables-including light levels, litter depth, soil exposure, soil moisture, and soil organic matter content-were quantified in experimental plots where the fern understory was undisturbed, partially removed or completely removed and were related to natural recruitment and 1st-yr survival of Acer rubrum, Betula lenta, B, alleghaniensis, Fraxinus americana, Pinus strobus, and Quercus rubra. We conducted a series of three field emergence experiments to test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of fern interference with seedling emergence. The fern understory reduced light levels from 3.4% of full sun to 1.1% of full sun beneath its canopy. Soil exposure was lower and litter depth was greater under fern cover, whereas soil moisture and soil organic-matter content were not affected by fern cover. The understory filter differentially influenced tree-seedling emergence. Fern cover decreased emergence of Betula, Finns, and Quercus but did not affect the emergence of Acer or Fraxinus. The mechanism of fern interference was species-specific: Betula emergence was reduced primarily by low levels of soil exposure, Pinus emergence appeared to be related to reduced light levels, and Quercus suffered higher levels of seed predation under fern cover. The presence of understory fern cover also differentially influenced Ist-yr survival of natural tree-seedling recruitment. Although seedling survivorship during the first growing season was related to seed size, seedling survivorship below ferns by the end of the Ist yr was independent of seed size. Selectivity of the fern filter is caused by differential response of tree-seedling species to the presence of understory cover and was generally not affected by the species identity of the understory plant. The selectivity of the understory filter can influence the density and species composition of the seedling bank below its canopy and can determine patterns of seedling spatial distribution at the stand level.","Harvard Univ, Biol Labs, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","George, LO (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Biol Labs, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, 16 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,48,219,246,1,95,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1999,80,3,,,,,833,845,,10.2307/177021,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,228UP,WOS:000082154300009,,,,,2021-09-27,

Such associations, if driven by an underlying proximate mechanism, could limit the independent evolution of each behaviour. In contrast, a behavioural syndrome may be the result of selection favouring the behavioural correlation under certain ecological circumstances. In this context, investigating the stability and the potential drivers of behavioural syndromes is a fundamental step towards understanding how they might shape the evolution of behaviours. We assessed syndrome stability across time in two subpopulations of free-ranging juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris. We measured two behaviours, exploration in an open field and sociability in a group, over 5 years. We tested whether these behaviours were associated in a behavioural syndrome, how stable this syndrome was and whether its strength was predicted by ecological conditions in this system: predator abundance, juvenile survival, newborn recruitment and total subpopulation size. We found that a behavioural syndrome was only observed in the subpopulation where predatory shark abundance was higher. Across years, newborn recruitment was the main driver for the strength of the syndrome. During years of low recruitment, the subpopulations probably experienced lower competition due to fewer newborns joining the population. In these years, sharks that were more explorative were also less social. These results indicate that the behaviours we tested were plastic and responsive to ecological conditions. Since this could signify that they are only favoured under certain ecological conditions, we argue in this case that the correlation of two behavioural traits is adaptive.

We hypothesized that: (1) increased basal resources should maintain greater species richness and higher predator abundance; (2) dispersal should maintain greater species richness; and (3) predation should reduce species richness, especially in the high resource treatments relative to no-predator treatments. Our results support all three hypotheses. Further, we show that dispersal affects richness at the local community scale but not at the metacommunity scale. However, predation seems to have major effects at both the local and metacommunity scale. Overall, our results show that effects of resource enrichment, dispersal, and predation were mostly additive rather than interactive, indicating that it may be sometimes easier to understand their effects than generally thought due to complex interactive effects.","Univ Tennessee, Complex Syst Grp, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand","Cadotte, MW (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",mcadotte@utk.edu,"Cadotte, Marc/AAG-8147-2020; Fukami, Tadashi/A-2934-2010","Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693; Fukami, Tadashi/0000-0001-5654-4785",,,,52,43,45,1,120,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2006,149,1,,,,,150,157,,10.1007/s00442-006-0426-z,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,081SY,WOS:000240338500017,16639564,,,,2021-09-27,

However, the extent to which prey responses at the interface between natural and anthropogenic habitats may be compared to those at the interface between natural habitats is unclear. Here, we used a shared-predator system to investigate the spatial response of red-necked nightjars (Caprimulgus ruficollis) to changing predation risk on roads, measured as the abundance of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and their primary prey (rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus). Because all three species coexist closely on unpaved roads in Donana National Park (Spain), we predicted that nightjars would experience increased predation risk during periods of high fox and low rabbit abundances. Birds could then modify their space use at a broad scale by moving away from risky unpaved roads or, at a finer scale, by seeking foraging microsites facilitating escape from attacks. Between 2011 and 2012, mean rabbit abundance on roads increased by 50%, and fox abundance decreased by 80%, indicating a substantial decrease in predation risk for nightjars. Unexpectedly, nightjar occurrence on roads did not increase as a consequence of the decrease in fox predation risk. However, nightjars foraging on roads became less apprehensive in their use of linear strips of roadside cover, which is known to function as a physical barrier against fox attacks. Specifically, under high predation risk, most nightjars perched on the ground nearby (< 15 cm) tall (> 150 cm) vegetation, whereas when predation risk decreased, they shifted to more exposed microsites near shorter (< 1 m) stands, but rarely close to cover (> 45 cm). Nightjars' preference for areas of high predator abundance strongly suggests that flexible microhabitat selection allows them to manage the overall predation risk independently of predator abundance. Our results highlight the importance of linear developments in determining risk exposure and prey use of apparently dangerous habitats and thus may contribute to a better understanding of risky behaviors of prey.","[Camacho, Carlos; Potti, Jaime] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Av Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain; [Saez-Gomez, Pedro] Univ Huelva, Dept Integrat Sci, Campus Univ El Carmen,Av Andalucia, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Maria Fedriani, Jose] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Av Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain; [Maria Fedriani, Jose] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, InBIO, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal","Camacho, C (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Av Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain.",ccamacho@ebd.csic.es,"Camacho, Carlos/AAC-7877-2019; Saez-Gomez, Pedro/P-6195-2019; Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018","Camacho, Carlos/0000-0002-9704-5816; Saez-Gomez, Pedro/0000-0001-5105-3960; Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621; Potti, Jaime/0000-0002-2284-0022","Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [IF/00728/2013, PEst/CC6316]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SVP-2013-067686]","We thank Sonia Sanchez and Basti Palacios for help during data collection, Carlos Davila and Carlos Molina for logistic support, and Lorenzo Perez for scientific discussion.

Larval anurans are said to support the trade-off model, but there are few comparable and quantitative habitat data available to assess this claim. I performed a survey of field biologists to evaluate the habitats of similar sets of species in the northern parts of Europe (40 respondents and 12 species) and eastern North America (30 respondents and 8 species), using a standard set of criteria. For six European species I also had quantitative field sampling data, and found close agreement between survey results and predator densities experienced by tadpoles in the field. Distributions of most species were restricted to only part of the habitat gradient, as expected under the trade-off model. The survey confirmed reports that North American Rana species replace one another along the gradient, but this was not true in Europe. European Rana were no different from the North American species in their seasonal and geographical overlap, so the absence of habitat partitioning in European Rana may result from interactions with other species or the special impact of glaciation in Europe. Habitats were unrelated to evolutionary relationships among species, suggesting that changes in habitat evolve quickly. The survey approach was useful for comparing distributions of species, and for generating hypotheses about evolutionary responses to habitat gradients.","Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Van Buskirk, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,,,,,50,54,56,0,20,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9516,,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Fish community composition and diet overlap between round gobies and native species were surveyed in 1994 and compared with similar data from 2011. Fish were collected in trawls (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 m depths) and seines (1 m) in May, June, and September 1994, and May, July, and September 2011. Between 1994 and 2011, relative abundance of northern madtom (Noturus stigmosus) decreased significantly in the offshore zone, catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) for rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) and round goby significantly decreased in the nearshore zone while CPUE for channel darter (Percina copelandi), johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum), mottled sculpin (Cottus bardii), and round goby significantly decreased in the offshore zone. In 1994 and 2011, adult round gobies consumed mainly zebra or quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha; D. bugensis). Significant diet overlap between large round gobies and native rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), logperch (Percina caprodes), and trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) occurred infrequently in 2011. Decreasing round goby abundance may be due to increased predation by native species. Negative impacts of the round goby invasion and establishment on fish species diversity within this part of the St Clair River were confined to a few species and possibly due to competition for other resources, such as space.

However, little is known about how, the most intense human activity, urbanization, alters food webs and trophic structure in biological communities. Studies of the Phoenix area, situated amid the Sonoran Desert, reveal some surprising alterations in the control of trophic dynamics. Species composition is radically altered, and resource subsidies increase and stabilize productivity. Changes in productivity dampen seasonal and yearly fluctuations in specics diversity, elevate, abundances, and alter feeding behaviors of some key urban species. In urban systems contrast to the trophic systems in outlying deserts, which are dominated by limiting resources-predation by birds becomes the dominant force controlling arthropods on plants. Reduced predation risk elevates the abundance of urban birds and alters their foraging behavior such that they exert increased top-down effects on arthropods. Shifts in control of food web dynamics are probably common in urban ecosystems, and are influenced by complex human social processes and feedbacks.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Nat Resources Conservat, Holdsworth Nat Resources Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Sutton Avian Res Ctr, Bartlesville, OK 74005 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Faeth, SH (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",s.faeth@asu.edu,,"Warren, Paige/0000-0003-0787-4635",,,,64,265,287,2,162,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-3568,1525-3244,,BIOSCIENCE,Bioscience,MAY,2005,55,5,,,,,399,407,,10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055[0399:TDIUC]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,924VR,WOS:000229009300007,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2021-09-27,

We investigated the potential role of two introduced predatory gastropods, the Japanese drill (Ocinebrina inornata) and the eastern drill (Urosalpinx cinerea), in limiting Olympia oyster recovery. We quantified the bay-wide distribution, local abundance, and per capita effects of drills, and asked how each of these three components of total invasion impact might be influenced by another dominant introduced species, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea g gas). Bay-wide sampling revealed differences in spatial distribution of the two drill species, with U. cinerea more abundant toward the head of the estuary and O. inornata more abundant toward the Mouth. Individual feeding trials indicated that both drill species preferred Pacific oysters to Olympia oysters of similar size, and preferentially attacked smaller oysters. We used field enclosures to quantify the direct effects of Japanese drill predation on Olympia and Pacific oysters, intra and interspecific competition, and indirect effects mediated by the shared predator. Predation reduced the survival of both oyster species, but the per capita impact of Japanese drills declined with increasing density of either Olympia or Pacific oysters, consistent with a type I I functional response. This positive indirect effect of Pacific oysters oil Olympia oysters was offset by asymmetric competition, in which Pacific oysters reduced Olympia oyster growth and survival but not vice versa. Despite the large drill impacts seen in these experiments, Olympia oysters transplanted to intertidal sites throughout the bay experienced low and variable rates of drill predation compared with other mortality sources. Introduced drills may be only one of a suite of factors that prevent rebuilding of Olympia oysters in the intertidal zone in Willapa Bay.","[Buhle, Eric R.; Ruesink, Jennifer L.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Buhle, ER (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",eric.buhle@noaa.gov,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to Washington Sea Grant Program, University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington [9NA16RG1044]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research fellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Achievement Rewards for College Scientists fellowship","The authors thank the organizers of the 2006 West Coast Native Oyster Restoration Workshop for coordinating this Special Issue.

However, the relationship between the fitness components of different life stages may be complex. Ontogenetic switch points such as hatching and metamorphosis do not represent new beginnings-carryover effects across stages can arise when environmental effects on the density and/or traits of early ontogenetic stages subsequently alter mortality or growth in later stages. In this study, I examine the effects of egg- and larval-stage predators on larval performance, size at metamorphosis, and post-metamorphic predation in the African tree frog Hyperolius spinigularis. I monitored the density and survival of arboreal H. spinigularis clutches in the field to estimate how much egg-stage predation reduced the input of tadpoles into the pond. I then conducted experiments to determine: (1) how reductions in initial larval density due to egg predators affect larval survival and mass and age at metamorphosis in the presence and absence of aquatic larval predators, dragonfly larvae, and (2) how differences in mass or age at metamorphosis arising from predation in the embryonic and larval environments affect encounters with post-metamorphic predators, fishing spiders. Reduction in larval densities due to egg predation tended to increase per capita larval survival, decrease larval duration and increase mass at metamorphosis. Larval predators decreased larval survival and had density-dependent effects on larval duration and mass at metamorphosis. The combined effects of embryonic and larval-stage predators increased mass at metamorphosis of survivors by 91%. Larger mass at metamorphosis may have immediate fitness benefits, as larger metamorphs had higher survival in encounters with fishing spiders. Thus, the effects of predators early in ontogeny can alter predation risk even two life stages later.","Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, Eureka, MO 63025 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Vonesh, JR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, POB 258, Eureka, MO 63025 USA.",voneshjr@yahoo.com,"Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988",,,,58,48,49,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2005,143,2,,,,,280,290,,10.1007/s00442-004-1806-x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907SN,WOS:000227738400012,15657758,,,,2021-09-27,

It is hypothesized that local and landscape-level abundances of non-native plants can affect the population size of generalist insects, although generalists are assumed to be less sensitive to habitat connectivity than specialists. In a heterogeneous landscape in Japan, the relationship between the density of a native pest of rice (Stenotus rubrovittatus (Matsumura) (Heteroptera: Miridae)) and the abundance of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. (Poales: Poaceae)), a non-native meadow grass known to facilitate S. rubrovittatus, was analyzed. Statistical analyses of data on bug density, vegetation, and the spatial distribution of fallow fields and meadows dominated by Italian ryegrass, obtained by field surveys, demonstrated that local and landscape-level abundances of Italian ryegrass (the unmowed meadow areas within a few hundred meters of a sampling plot) positively affected bug density before its immigration into rice fields. Our findings suggest that a generalist herbivorous insect that prefers non-native plants responds to spatial availability and connectivity of plant species patches at the metapopulation level. Fragmentation by selective mowing that decreases the total area of source populations and increases the isolation among them would be an effective and environmentally-friendly pest management method.","[Yoshioka, A.] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Takada, M.

The biogeochemical responses to wet-up are reasonably well understood and known to be microbially mediated. Yet, the population level dynamics, and the resulting changes in microbial community patterns, are not well understood as ecological phenomena. Here, we used sequencing of 16S rRNA genes coupled with heavy water ((H2O)-O-18) DNA quantitative stable isotope probing to estimate population-specific rates of growth and mortality in response to a simulated wet-up event in a California annual grassland soil. Bacterial growth and mortality responded rapidly to wet-up, within 3 h, and continued throughout the 168 h incubation, with patterns of sequential growth observed at the phylum level. Of the 37 phyla detected in the prewet community, growth was found in 18 phyla while mortality was measured in 26 phyla. Rapid growth and mortality rates were measurable within 3 h of wet-up but had contrasting characteristics; growth at 3 h was dominated by select taxa within the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, whereas mortality was taxonomically widespread. Furthermore, across the community, mortality exhibited density-independence, consistent with the indiscriminate shock resulting from dry-down and wet-up, whereas growth was density-dependent, consistent with control by competition or predation. Total aggregated growth across the community was highly correlated with total soil CO2 production. Together, these results illustrate how previously invisible population responses can translate quantitatively to emergent observations of ecosystem-scale biogeochemistry.","[Blazewicz, Steven J.; Brodie, Eoin L.; Firestone, Mary K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 137 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Blazewicz, Steven J.; Nuccio, Erin E.; Pett-Ridge, Jennifer] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Hungate, Bruce A.; Koch, Benjamin J.; Schwartz, Egbert] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Hungate, Bruce A.; Koch, Benjamin J.; Schwartz, Egbert] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Morrissey, Ember] West Virginia Univ, Div Plant & Soil Sci, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Brodie, Eoin L.; Firestone, Mary K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, 1 Cyclotron Rd MS70A-3317, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Blazewicz, Steven J.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, 7000 East Ave L-231, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Blazewicz, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 137 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Blazewicz, SJ (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.; Blazewicz, SJ (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, 7000 East Ave L-231, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",Blazewicz1@llnl.gov,"Brodie, Eoin L/A-7853-2008","Brodie, Eoin L/0000-0002-8453-8435; Morrissey, Ember/0000-0002-5810-1096","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1011093]; US Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Genomic Science Program LLNL Microbes Persist Scientific Focus AreaUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [SCW1632]; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Northern Arizona University [DE DE-SC0016207]","SJB and this experiment were supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant No. DEB-1011093 to UCB.

Leptodora kindtii, Bythotrephes longimanus, and Cercopagis pen got coexist in the waters of southeastern Lake Michigan near Muskegon, Michigan. Leptodora is indigenous, whereas Bythotrephes and Cercopagis are nonindigenous and became established in 1986 and 2000, respectively. To observe seasonal changes in their abundances, and relationships to each other, cladocerans were collected from 1994 to 2008 at an offshore (110-m) site, from 1998 to 2008 at a transitional (45-m) site and from 1999 to 2008 at a nearshore (15-m) site. Bythotrephes was most abundant at the offshore site compared to Leptodora and Cercopagis. Bythotrephes peak abundances usually occurred in autumn at all sites. Cercopagis tended to be more abundant at the nearshore site, and peak densities occurred in summer. At the mid-depth site, similar abundances occurred for all three predatory cladocerans, however, the date of peak abundance was usually earliest for Cercopagis, followed by Leptodora, and latest for Bythotrephes. In recent years, 2007 and 2008, densities of all three predatory cladocerans have increased. Temperature preference, fish predation, and competition between the invertebrate predators may all be important in allowing the dominance of one species over the other seasonally or spatially.

The analysis explores the effects of four factors on the range of consumer characteristics that allow coexistence: (1) whether resource growth is biotic or abiotic; (2) the efficiency of the consumers in reducing the resource population; (3) the rapidity of the demographic response of the consumers to changes in resource density; and (4) the period and amplitude of the periodicity in resource growth. Coexistence of two competitors differing greatly in the linearity of their responses is most likely when (1) resource growth is biotic and (2) the consumers are relatively inefficient. The effects on coexistence of the third and fourth factors can be more complicated, particularly when the resource is biotic. However, in most cases coexistence occurs over a wider range of conditions when the linear consumer has a more rapid numerical response than the nonlinear consumer and when the period of environmental fluctuation is much longer than the minimum doubling time of the consumer populations. If the resource is biotic, consumer-resource cycles can be produced by the nonlinear consumer, and environmental cycles may either interfere with or reinforce these, contracting or expanding the conditions allowing coexistence. However, the interaction of endogenous cycles and periodic variation in resource growth generally has highly nonadditive effects on coexistence. These findings help explain why few previous experimental studies have demonstrated coexistence due to the relative nonlinearity of consumer responses.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",abrams@zoo.utoronto.ca,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,42,34,34,1,30,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2004,85,2,,,,,372,382,,10.1890/02-0684,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,801PV,WOS:000220108700009,,,,,2021-09-27,

To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a literature review, focusing on studies that tested the behavioural and demographic impact of intraguild predation on individuals, populations, and assemblages of diurnal and nocturnal raptorial species. Overall, data were available for 39 empirical and experimental studies on 63 populations belonging to 11 killer species and 15 victim species. An overview of these studies suggested that intraguild predation was a widespread, size-based phenomenon. Results from multiple studies on the same species at different locations were usually consistent across wide geographical areas. Individual-level demographic impacts included reduced site-occupancy, breeding success and survival. Individuals of the prey species responded to predation pressure through direct spatial avoidance, risk-sensitive habitat selection, short-term behavioural avoidance (e.g. reduced vocal activity and escape to refugia after predator detection) and, possibly, temporal segregation. Population-level effects were common but mainly examined as spatio-temporal correlations between the abundance of killer and victim species. Correlative evidence also suggested that intraguild predation may have the potential to structure whole raptor assemblages. More studies on other species and different geographic areas are needed to increase our understanding of the causes and consequences of this widespread interaction. From a conservation point of view, intraguild predation may limit the success of raptor preservation programmes and could be used as a management tool through its effect on mesopredator release and its potentially positive, indirect effects on game species.","[Sergio, Fabrizio; Hiraldo, Fernando] Estac Biol Donana, Dept Appl Biol, E-41013 Seville, Spain","Sergio, F (corresponding author), Estac Biol Donana, Dept Appl Biol, E-41013 Seville, Spain.",fsergio@ebd.csic.es,"Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019; Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015","Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773",,,,99,99,109,1,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,AUG,2008,150,,,1,,,132,145,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00786.x,,,14,Ornithology,Zoology,346ZS,WOS:000259108700012,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

The potential impact of predation on armoured catfish was determined by combining laboratory measurements of predation rates on five early developmental stages of the armoured catfish H. thoracatum for 24 aquatic predators with field studies of the density of the predators in the swamps. The contribution of a particular predator to the total predation pressure on its prey was determined to a large extent by the density of the predator in the swamp. Seemingly innocuous predators with low or moderate predation rates in the laboratory may be extremely important in the swamps due to their high abundance. Small-sized omnivorous fishes and aquatic invertebrates were major predators of early developmental stages of armoured catfish. Both qualitative and quantitative ontogenetic changes in the predation pressure on armoured catfish were observed. Major predation on eggs, larvae and juveniles of H. thoracatum resulted from a different set of predators in each developmental stage of the prey. In all developmental stages of H. thoracatum the predation pressure involved several predator species and not a single, dominant predator. The potential predation pressure of the 24 predators taken together and the number of predators that were able to prey on N. thoracatum decreased sharply with increasing age (size) of the prey. Even if egg (nest) predation is prevented by the guarding male, the potential impact of the 24 predators on the populations of armoured catfish is large. Predation may account for the high mortality of H. thoracatum observed in the swamps. The high predation pressure on callichthyid catfishes may help to explain the coexistence of three closely related and morphologically quite similar armoured catfishes in Surinamese swamps.","UNIV SURINAME, CELOS, PARAMARIBO, SURINAME",,,"Mol, Jan/AAJ-2441-2020",,,,,74,12,15,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1996,107,3,,,,,395,410,,10.1007/BF00328457,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VC246,WOS:A1996VC24600014,28307269,,,,2021-09-27,

Predators also exert strong effects on ecological communities, through top-down regulation of prey and competitors, which can result in trophic cascades. Despite their ubiquity, ecological importance and potential to interact with fire, our general understanding of how predators respond to fire remains poor, hampering ecosystem management. To address this important knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of fire on terrestrial, vertebrate predators world-wide. We found 160 studies spanning 1978-2018. There were 36 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, from which we extracted 96 effect sizes (Hedges' g) for 67 predator species relating to changes in abundance indices, occupancy or resource selection in burned and unburned areas, or before and after fire. Studies spanned geographic locations, taxonomic families and study designs, but most were located in North America and Oceania (59% and 24%, respectively), and largely focussed on felids (24%) and canids (25%). Half (50%) of the studies reported responses to wildfire, and nearly one third concerned prescribed (management) fires. There were no clear, general responses of predators to fire, nor relationships with geographic area, biome or life-history traits (e.g. body mass, hunting strategy and diet). Responses varied considerably between species. Analysis of species for which at least three effect sizes had been reported in the literature revealed that red foxes Vulpes vulpes mostly responded positively to fire (e.g. higher abundance in burned compared to unburned areas) and eastern racers Coluber constrictor negatively, with variances overlapping zero only slightly for both species. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in predator responses to fire, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. Varied responses of predator species to fire likely depend on ecosystem context. Consistent reporting of ongoing monitoring and management experiments is required to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving predator responses to fire, and any broader effects (e.g. trophic interactions). The divergent responses of species in our study suggest that adaptive, context-specific management of predator-fire relationships is required.","[Geary, William L.; Doherty, Tim S.; Ritchie, Euan G.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Geary, William L.] Dept Environm Land Water & Planning, Biodivers Div, East Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Nimmo, Dale G.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW, Australia; [Tulloch, Ayesha I.

Teal Anas crecca, mallard A. platyrhynchos and pintail A. acuta start feeding in shallow areas, and later switch to deeper feeding methods. We show experimentally that the food intake rate is 1.5 times higher in shallow (5 cm) than in deep (35 cm) areas, which may explain why shallow feeding is the principal method used early in the winter season. In the field, the switch between foraging methods was neither related to the frequency of fly-overs by raptors nor to the density of competitors at a foraging site, although birds foraged deeper sooner at sites frequented more often. Thus, the potential role of interference competition remained unclear. Conversely, at each site, the proportion of deep foragers increased with increasing cumulative numbers of foragers, used as a measure of food depletion. We therefore have no evidence that disturbance by predators has an important effect on the foraging methods used, whereas competition through food depletion may play a major role.","Ctr Etud Biol Chize, CNRS, UPR 1934, F-79360 Beauvoir sur Niort, France","Guillemain, M (corresponding author), CNERA Avifaune Migratrice, Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, La Tour Valat, F-13200 Arles, France.",m.guillemain@oncfs.gouv.fr; fritzh@cebc.cnrs.fr,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661",,,,52,22,25,0,16,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,JUN,2002,8,2,,,,,81,90,,,,,10,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,566MU,WOS:000176432800001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Factors affecting host preference in herbivorous insects are actively discussed. Larval performance, competition and predation on each host, and host abundance are reportedly factors affecting the host preference of ovipositing females. In the present study, chronological changes in female host preference were examined by employing a flea weevil species that uses the original host and a newly introduced host simultaneously. 2. Orchestes hustacheiKlima (Coleoptera: Curclionidae) is an aphidophagous flea weevil that oviposits on aphid galls, and the larvae feed on aphids inside. The weevil's native hosts are galls of the Tetraneura species on Ulmus davidiana, while the novel hosts are galls of an introduced species, Paracolopha morrisoni on Zelkova serrata, an introduced hardwood. Choice experiments were conducted using Tetraneura galls and Paracolopha galls and the results were compared with experiments conducted 10 years ago. 3. More than 90% of ovipositing females selected Paracolopha galls. This result is in marked contrast with the result of the 2002 experiment, in which 66.3% of females selected Paracolopha galls. To explore driving forces of the preference change, mortality factors, pupal mass on the two hosts, and temporal changes in the abundance of the host galls were examined. 4. Abundance of Tetraneura galls decreased gradually throughout the last 26 years. By contrast, weevil survival and performance did not vary significantly between the two hosts. Therefore, it is concluded that temporal changes in the relative abundance of two hosts are main factors of the change in host preference.","[Muramatsu, Koichi; Akimoto, Shin-Ichi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan","Muramatsu, K (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Lab Systemat Entomol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",muram-k@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [P.11079, 23370037]",We are grateful to Takuma Yoshida for helping with the identification of the larval parasitoids.

Although the benefits from this effect vary among environmental contexts and through time, it has been the common explanation for high species abundance in complex habitats. We hypothesized that oviposition habitat selection for structural complexity depends on the expected trophic function of the progeny. In Salamandra infraimmaculata larvae, expected trophic function is dictated by their sequence of deposition. First cohorts cannibalize later-arriving cohorts, while all compete for shared prey resources. In a mesocosm experiment, we show that gravid salamanders facing conspecific-free pools preferred structurally simple habitats (no rocks), while females facing only pools with older conspecific larvae preferred complex habitats (with rocks). Context-dependent preference of habitat complexity for managing food/safety trade-offs may be extended from classic foraging patch decisions to breeding habitat selection. These trade-offs vary with dynamic larval processes such as priority effects and ontogenetic diet shifts, potentially leading to complex maternal parturition behaviours.","[Sadeh, Asaf; Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Sadeh, Asaf; Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Mangel, Marc] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Jack Baskin Sch Engn, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Mangel, Marc] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Jack Baskin Sch Engn, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Sadeh, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",asaffield@yahoo.com,"Sadeh, Asaf/A-3552-2010","Sadeh, Asaf/0000-0002-2704-4033",BSFUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2002-365],"We thank Hagai Shemesh, Yoni Shalev, Noam Elron and Alon Silberbush for helping construct the experimental mesocosm site and especially Noa Sadeh, Amos Sadeh and Noam Elron for joining field excursions for salamander collection.

Few studies have investigated density-dependence for fishes that spawn offshore and recruit to inshore estuaries for the juvenile stage prior to returning to offshore waters as adults (i.e. estuary-dependent). We conducted 2 replicated experiments at different spatial scales to test for density-dependent growth and mortality in juvenile spot Leiostomus xanthurus, a common estuary-dependent species. In the small-scale experiment, we stocked spot in 1 m(2) cages in a marsh creek at densities of 2, 5, and 10 fish m(-2) and determined their growth and mortality after 51 d. In the large-scale experiment, we stocked spot in 79 m(2) pond sections at 2, 5, and 10 fish m(-2) and determined their growth and mortality after 52 d. We sampled benthic infauna at the end of the pond experiment to determine if prey availability mediated the effects of density on spot growth and mortality. Average spot growth rates decreased 83 to 97 % and mortality increased 2- to 4-fold as density increased from 2 to 10 fish m(-2). The density of benthic infauna at the end of the pond experiment was inversely related to spot density, consistent with competition for food as the underlying mechanism. Estimates of spot density compiled from the literature indicate that the density-dependent effects we observed occurred within the range of reported field densities, Our results provide strong experimental support for the hypothesis that density-dependent processes during the demersal juvenile stage in estuaries can modify patterns in the abundance of spot, and perhaps other estuary-dependent species, that are established prior to settlement.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Zool, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Duke Ctr Marine Conservat, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; MarineLab, Marine Resources Dev Fdn, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA","Craig, JK (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, 3618 Highway 98, St Teresa, FL 32358 USA.",kevin_craig@ncsu.edu,,,,,,57,33,33,0,27,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

This study investigated the selective nature of predation by both a multi-species predator pool, and a single common predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), on the reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis. The study focused on the early post-settlement period of P. amboinensis, when mortality, and hence selection, is known to be highest. Correlations between nine different measures of body condition/performance were examined at the time of settlement, in order to elucidate the relationships between different traits. Single-predator (P. fuscus) choice trials were conducted in 57.4-l aquaria with respect to three different prey characteristics [standard length (SL), body weight and burst swimming speed], whilst multi-species trials were conducted on open patch reefs, manipulating prey body weight only. Relationships between the nine measures of condition/performance were generally poor, with the strongest correlations occurring between the morphological measures and within the performance measures. During aquaria trials, P. fuscus was found to be selective with respect to prey SL only, with larger individuals being selected significantly more often. Multi-species predator communities, however, were selective with respect to prey body weight, with heavier individuals being selected significantly more often than their lighter counterparts. Our results suggest that under controlled conditions, body length may be the most important prey characteristic influencing prey survival during predatory encounters with P. fuscus. In such cases, larger prey size may actually be a distinct disadvantage to survival. However, these relationships appear to be more complex under natural conditions, where the expression of prey characteristics, the selectivity fields of a number of different predators, their relative abundance, and the action of external environmental characteristics, may all influence which individuals survive.","[Holmes, Thomas H.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Holmes, TH (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",thomas.holmes@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; Ecological Society of Australia; Linnean Society of New South Wales,"We thank V.

They also serve as hosts for many micro- and macro-parasites. The importance of parasites and the necessity to include them in ecological studies has been increasingly recognized in the last two decades by ecologists and conservation biologists. Parasites are able to alter survival, growth, feeding, mobility, mating, fecundity and stressors' response of their amphipod hosts. In addition to their modulating effects on host population size and dynamics, parasites affect community structure and food webs in different ways: by increasing the susceptibility of amphipods to predation, by quantitatively and qualitatively changing the host diet, and by modifying competitive interactions. Human-induced stressors such as climate change, pollution and species introduction that affect host-parasite equilibrium, may enhance or reduce the infection effects on hosts and ecosystems. The present review illustrates the importance of parasites for ecosystem processes using examples from aquatic environments and amphipods as a host group. As seen from the literature, amphipod-parasite systems are likely a key component of ecological processes, but more quantitative data from natural populations and field evidence are necessary to support the results obtained by experimental research.","[Giari, Luisa; Fano, Elisa Anna; Castaldelli, Giuseppe] Univ Ferrara, Dept Life Sci & Biotechnol, L Borsari St 46, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Grabner, Daniel; Sures, Bernd] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Aquat Ecol, Univ Str 2, D-45141 Essen, Germany; [Grabner, Daniel; Sures, Bernd] Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Water & Environm Res, Univ Str 2, D-45141 Essen, Germany","Giari, L (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Dept Life Sci & Biotechnol, L Borsari St 46, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.",grilsu@unife.it; fne@unife.it; ctg@unife.it; daniel.grabner@uni-due.de; bernd.sures@uni-due.de,"Fano, Elisa Anna/M-6731-2015; Castaldelli, Giuseppe/Q-8301-2016","Fano, Elisa Anna/0000-0001-8552-9621; Castaldelli, Giuseppe/0000-0001-5954-1133",,,,198,1,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2020,12,9,,,,,,,2429,10.3390/w12092429,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OF5OJ,WOS:000581256500001,,gold,,,2021-09-27,

Inter-patch distance (lag) may be especially important in the interacting effects of aggregation and interference among predators on their search and prey-handling ability. Interactions of blue crabs Callinectes sapidus preying upon thin-shelled clams Macoma balthica in Chesapeake Bay provide a test of how the opposing forces of aggregation and interference interact with the spatial distribution of prey patches to influence rates of prey consumption. Blue crabs can detect clam patches from tip to 15 m away using chemosensory cues, and they aggregate on them, thus facilitating predation, but exhibit agonistic behaviors when closer than 5 in to another crab, thus reducing feeding efficiency. We used these patterns of aggregation and interference to modify a generalized functional response model to describe individual crab foraging efficiency as a function of distance between patches, The model predicted highest predation rates at an intermediate lag of 6.6 m. We tested this a priori hypothesis with a set of field experiments wherein prey patches were established with lags of 1, 7, 10, and 50 m. Predation rates were highest. at intermediate lags, as predicted. This work highlights the importance of the interaction between spatial scales and ecological processes, demonstrating that spatial heterogeneity is not. noise that obscures processes, but an active component of the predator-prey dynamic.","[Hines, Anson H.; Long, W.

However, because of its association with ciguatera fish poisoning, it is rarely fished for food. Previous research indicates that roi could have a negative impact on native reef fish assemblages because of their high densities and prey consumption rates. However, it is unclear whether roi add to the cumulative mortality of prey (predation hypothesis), or whether predation is instead compensatory (doomed surplus hypothesis). This study experimentally assessed the effects of roi on reef fish populations through a long-term (5.5 year) predator removal experiment. A Before-After-Control-Impact study design was used to assess changes in fish assemblages following the removal of roi on 1.3 ha of patch reef. Increases in the density of prey-sized fish (< 15 cm TL) were observed 18 months after roi removal. However, those effects did not translate into sustained increases in prey. While increases in potential competitors, wrasses (family Labridae), particularly the piscivorous ringtail wrasse Oxycheilinus unifasciatus, were observed on roi-free reefs, the fish assemblage did not diverge substantially in composition. Native reef fish appeared to resist the potential negative impacts of predation by roi, possibly through a refuge in size for some fish families. Management to protect intact fish assemblage size-structure could serve to bolster native resistance to invading species. In considering the threats facing coral reefs, and the possible solutions, roi removal alone will not likely replenish native fishery resources.","[Giddens, J. L.; Friedlander, A. M.; Stamoulis, K.

Introduced Mysis diluviana shrimp interact with planktivorous fishes such as kokanee salmon (lacustrine Oncorhynchus nerka) through both of these pathways, and effective management depends on understanding which interaction is more limiting under different conditions. An `` environmental matching'' hypothesis predicts the ecological impacts of Mysis are maximized under cool conditions near its thermal optimum. In addition, we hypothesized Mysis is more vulnerable to predation by lake trout in relatively shallow waters, and therefore Mysis enhances lake trout density and limits kokanee through apparent competition more strongly in shallower habitats. We tested whether these hypotheses could explain food web differences between two connected lake basins, one relatively shallow and the other extremely deep. The shallower basin warmed faster, thermally excluded Mysis from surface waters for 75% longer, and supported 2.5-18 times greater seasonal production of cladoceran zooplankton than the deeper basin, standardized by surface area. Mysis consumed 14-22% less zooplankton in the shallower basin, and lower ratios of total planktivore consumption to zooplankton production (C: P) indicated less potential for resource competition with kokanee, consistent with environmental matching. Lake trout diets contained more Mysis in the shallower basin and at shallower sampling sites within both basins. The catch rate of lake trout was seven times greater and the predation risk for kokanee was 4-5 times greater in the shallower basin than in the deeper basin, consistent with stronger apparent competition in shallower habitats. Understanding how the strengths of these interactions are mediated by temperature and depth would enable managers to select appropriate strategies to address the unique combinations of conditions in hundreds of affected systems.","[Schoen, Erik R.; Buettner, Anna R.; Overman, Nathanael C.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Washington Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Beauchamp, David A.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Washington Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Schoen, ER (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Alaska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 902 Koyukuk Ave, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",eschoen@alaska.edu,"Schoen, Erik/H-3829-2013","Schoen, Erik/0000-0001-8301-6419",U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; Chelan County Public Utility District; University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery SciencesUniversity of Washington; UW IACUC [3286-10],"This research was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the Chelan County Public Utility District, and the University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences.

Using Leucadendron sessile (Proteaceae), it was recently discovered that rodents are seed dispersers in the fynbos biome of South Africa. However, little is known about the characteristics of rodent-dispersed seeds and the selective influence rodents have on seed morphology in this biome. We investigated the caching behaviour of rodents and asked whether variation in seed traits (size, hull thickness) influenced whether seeds were more likely to be consumed or cached. Rodents tended to disperse and bury, rather than consume, medium sized L sessile seeds with medium hull thickness. In contrast, small or thin hulled seeds were preferentially eaten in situ and were seldom buried. Large seeds or seeds with thick hulls were often left untouched at depots. Our results suggest that rodents may impose stabilizing selective pressures on seed size and hull thickness, traits that may also have consequences for seedling mortality, dormancy, competitive interactions and the survival of fires.

Habitat suitability of a threatened species can vary temporally due to environmental changes. However, vegetation growth is rarely considered prior to mitigation attempts. The Green and Golden Bell Frog (Litoria aurea) is threatened by habitat loss and has been the subject of several habitat offsetting projects. Despite following recommended habitat templates, nearly all management projects have failed in creating a self-sustaining population. In this study, we examined differences in L. aurea occupancy among ponds with varied levels of vegetation density. We investigated extant occupancy patterns during a 2-y period among areas of sparse, medium, and dense vegetation growths. We also conducted a field manipulation experiment to determine differences in abundance and biotic and abiotic factors between waterbodies with either sparse (manually removed) or dense (naturally overgrown) vegetation covers. Occupancy by adult females and juveniles, but not adult males, differed among sites with different vegetation densities. Female occupancy was greater at sites with medium vegetation densities; whereas, juveniles occupied medium and densely vegetated waterbodies more frequently than sparsely vegetated waterbodies. We also detected differences in potential predators, aquatic competitors, food resources, and water quality between the sparsely and densely vegetated waterbodies. Our data should allow for better habitat management of future L. aurea compensatory projects, and underscores the importance of using both quantitative and qualitative pre-analysis to question temporal variances in habitat suitability prior to management offsets.","[Fardell, Loren] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Fardell, Loren; Valdez, Jose; Klop-Toker, Kaya; Stockwell, Michelle; Clulow, Simon; Clulow, John; Mahony, Michael] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Conservat Biol Res Grp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia","Fardell, L (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.; Fardell, L (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Conservat Biol Res Grp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",loren.fardell@gmail.com,"Fardell, Loren/Z-1773-2019; Valdez, Jose/I-5273-2019","Fardell, Loren/0000-0002-8090-854X; Valdez, Jose/0000-0003-2690-9952; Clulow, Simon/0000-0002-5700-6345; Klop-Toker, Kaya/0000-0002-8501-6671",Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Councils Code of Practice for the Care; Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and under the approval of the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of Newcastle [A-2012-244],"We thank Kim Colyvas for statistical advice, Jake Fardell, Adam Spring, and Sam Webb for their volunteer assistance on field surveys.

We investigated the importance of food value and refuge value in determining the plant utilization patterns of the herbivorous marine amphipod Ampithoe longimana. When offered a choice of five common seaweeds, this amphipod fed most readily on Dictyota and Hypnea and less readily on Sargassum, Chondria, and Calonitophyllum. Rates of feeding on the different seaweeds were unrelated to seaweed gross morphology, toughness, nitrogen, or protein content. When cultured on each of these seaweeds in the laboratory, amphipod survivorship was high on Dictyota (82%), intermediate (35 and 18%, respectively) on Sargassum and Hypnea, and low (0%) on the other seaweeds. Survivorship on the different diets was strongly correlated (r = 0.930) with algal protein content; however, neither protein content nor amphipod performance on the different diets was significantly related to feeding rates on those diets. Additionally, amphipods from the three seaweed species that produced some survivors did not differ in growth rate, fecundity, egg size, or age at first ovulation. Variance in survivorship, and related measures, among sibling groups of amphipods suggested that this amphipod population possessed heritable variation for performance on the different seaweed species. In the field, abundance of A. longimana on the different species of algae was more clearly related to the preference of omnivorous fishes for these algae than to feeding rates of the amphipods when given those algae in the laboratory. A. longimana was more abundant on Dictyota and Sargassum (both unpalatable to omnivorous fishes), than on Hypnea, Chondria, and Calonitophyllum (all of which are palatable to fishes). During the season when omnivorous fishes were abundant, density of A. longimana increased on Dictyota, which is chemically defended from fishes, but decreased or remained unchanged on the seaweeds that are more palatable to fishes. Competition with other amphipods as a group did not appear to explain the distribution of A. longimana among seaweeds, since there were no negative correlations between A. longimana abundance and total amphipod abundance in any month. The lack of any consistent relationship between host-plant use in the field and either feeding preference or diet value, as measured by survivorship and reproduction, suggests that host-plant use by A. longimana may be strongly constrained by requirements for shelter from predation.",,"DUFFY, JE (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",,"Hay, Mark E/D-9752-2011; Duffy, J.

Anopheles gambiae sensu lato exploit a variety of aquatic habitats, but the biotic determinants of its preferences are poorly understood. This study aimed to identify and quantify macroinvertebrates in different habitat types with determined water physico-chemical parameters to establish those preferred by An. gambiae s.l. larvae as well as their predators and competitors. Methods: A field survey was conducted in Kibuye and Kayonjo villages located in the vicinity of the River Sezibwa, north- eastern Uganda to identify Anopheline larval habitats shared by aquatic insects. Habitats were geo-recorded and as streams, ponds, temporary pools and roadside ditches. From October to December 2017, random microhabitats/quadrats were selected from each habitat type, their water physico-chemical parameters (electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, temperature and pH) were measured, and they were sampled for macroinvertebrates using standard dippers. All collected arthropod macroinvertebrates were then morphologically identified to family level and enumerated. Results: Principal component analysis showed that the four larval habitat types were characterized by distinct physico-chemical parameter profiles. Ponds and streams had the highest number and diversity of macroinvertebrate insect taxa and sustained few An. gambiae s.l. larvae. Anopheles gambiae s.l. were more common in roadside ditches and particularly abundant in temporary pools which it commonly shared with Dytiscidae (predaceous diving beetles) and Culex spp. Cluster correlation analysis conducted on the abundance of these taxa within quadrats suggested that An. gambiae s.l. and Dytiscidae have the most similar patterns of microhabitat use, followed by Cybaeidae (water spiders). Whilst Culex spp. co-occurred with An. gambiae s.l. in some habitats, there was only partial niche overlap and no clear evidence of competition between the two mosquito taxa. Conclusions: Ponds and streams are habitats that host the largest diversity and abundance of aquatic insect taxa. Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae distinctively preferred temporary pools and roadside ditches, where they were exposed to few predators and no apparent competition by Culex spp. Further studies should aim to test the impact of Dytiscidae and Cybaeidae on An. gambiae s.l. dynamics experimentally.","[Onen, Hudson; Odong, Robinson; Chemurot, Moses] Makerere Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Sch Biosci, Dept Zool Entomol & Fisheries Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Onen, Hudson; Kayondo, Jonathan K.] Uganda Virus Res Inst UVRI, Dept Entomol, POB 49, Entebbe, Uganda; [Onen, Hudson; Tripet, Frederic] Keele Univ, Ctr Appl Entomol & Parasitol, Sch Life Sci, Keele ST5 5BG, Sfd, England","Onen, H (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Sch Biosci, Dept Zool Entomol & Fisheries Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda.; Onen, H (corresponding author), Uganda Virus Res Inst UVRI, Dept Entomol, POB 49, Entebbe, Uganda.; Onen, H; Tripet, F (corresponding author), Keele Univ, Ctr Appl Entomol & Parasitol, Sch Life Sci, Keele ST5 5BG, Sfd, England.",honen@cns.mak.ac.ug; f.tripet@keele.c.uk,,,Target Malaria from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Open Philanthropy Project Fund; Silicon Valley Community Foundation; DELTAS Africa Initiative grant [DEL-15-011],"This study was funded by Target Malaria, which receives core funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Open Philanthropy Project Fund, an advised fund of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, and DELTAS Africa Initiative grant #DEL-15-011 to THRiVE-2.",,71,0,0,1,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,AUG 21,2021,14,1,,,,,,,420,10.1186/s13071-021-04926-9,,,15,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,UD4KZ,WOS:000687178100003,34419140,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-27,

We examined whether intraspecific density-dependence altered IG predator traits, as well as the subsequent interspecific effects among its intraguild prey within a larval salamander guild. Four densities of ringed salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum), the IG predator, were combined with the presence/absence of spotted salamanders (A. maculatum), the IG prey, within experimental mesocosms. We modeled the effects of A. annulatum density on both conspecific and heterospecific responses that would be indicative of density-dependent competition and predation, respectively. We also modeled the reciprocal interspecific effects of A. maculatum on A. annulatum. We found that increasing intraspecific density negatively affected morphological traits but not survival of A. annulatum. No interspecific effects of A. maculatum on A. annulatum were observed. Alternatively, traits of A. maculatum showed nonlinear relationships with increasing A. annulatum density. Thinning effects of A. annulatum on A. maculatum were observed, as survival was positively and size negatively related for A. maculatum with IG predator density. The temporal overlap of the IG predator and prey also increased nonlinearly with IG predator density, intensifying the potential encounter rate of the two species. Overall, this study shows that density-dependent processes in IG predators can significantly affect traits of both themselves, as well as IG prey, which could ultimately change whether competition or predation occurs between the two groups.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Anderson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 110 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",tlarkf@mail.missouri.edu,,"Semlitsch, Raymond/0000-0002-7999-5762",Department of Defense Strategic Environment Research and Development Program [RC-2155],"We would like to thank the Semlitsch lab for their input on study design, D.

However, the nature and strength of interactions among species remain unknown for most resource pulse-driven ecosystems. We considered five hypotheses concerning the influence of resource pulses on the interactions between rodents, predators, and bird reproduction with data from northern Switzerland collected between 2010 and 2015. In high-rodent-abundance-years (HRAYs), wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) nest survival was lower than in low-rodent-abundance-years, but rodents were not important nest predators, in contrast to rodent-hunting predators. The higher proportion of nests predated by rodent-hunting predators and their increased occurrence in HRAYs suggests a rodent-mediated aggregative numerical response of rodent-hunting predators, which incidentally prey on the wood warbler's ground nests. There was no evidence that rodent-hunting predators responded behaviorally by switching prey. Lastly, nest losses caused by nonrodent-hunting predators were not related to rodent abundance. We show that wood warblers and rodents are linked via shared predators in a manner consistent with apparent competition, where an increase of one species coincides with the decrease of another species mediated by shared predators. Mast seeding frequency and annual seed production appear to have increased over the past century, which may result in more frequent HRAYs and generally higher peaking rodent populations. The associated increase in the magnitude of apparent competition may thus at least to some extent explain the wood warbler's decline in much of Western Europe.","[Grendelmeier, Alex; Pasinelli, Gilberto] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland; [Grendelmeier, Alex; Arlettaz, Raphael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, Bern, Switzerland; [Arlettaz, Raphael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Valais Field Stn, Sion, Switzerland; [Pasinelli, Gilberto] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland","Grendelmeier, A (corresponding author), Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland.",alex.grendelmeier@vogelwarte.ch,,"Pasinelli, Gilberto/0000-0003-3704-4843",Styner-Stiftung; Basler Stiftung fur biologische Forschung; Lotteriefonds des Kantons Solothurn; Hilfsfonds fur die Schweizerische Vogelwarte Sempach; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [31003A_ 143879/1]; Emilia Guggenheim-Schnurr-Stiftung; Stotzer-Kastli-Stiftung; Carl Burger-Stiftung Munchenstein,"Styner-Stiftung; Basler Stiftung fur biologische Forschung; Lotteriefonds des Kantons Solothurn; Hilfsfonds fur die Schweizerische Vogelwarte Sempach; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_ 143879/1; Emilia Guggenheim-Schnurr-Stiftung; Stotzer-Kastli-Stiftung; Carl Burger-Stiftung Munchenstein",,69,10,11,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Our results indicate that crayfish are effective predators of anuran larvae regardless of the amount of vegetation present. Encounters between tadpoles and crayfish often resulted in nonlethal tail injury for tadpoles, suggesting that crayfish predation is prominent in ephemeral wetland communities. Leopard frog tadpoles in predator treatments also grew larger than their counterparts in nonpredator treatments, suggesting a reduction in intraspecific competition. Reduced competition and higher growth rates may allow anuran larvae to develop and metamorphose faster, allowing them to escape aquatic predators, drying wetlands, or both.","[Chandler, Houston C.; Gorman, Thomas A.; Haas, Carola A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA","Chandler, HC (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA.",houstonc@vt.edu,"Haas, Carola A./B-5056-2009","Haas, Carola A./0000-0002-5490-6882",Natural Resources Branch of Eglin Air Force Base; Hurlburt Field; Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program; Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation at Virginia Tech,"We thank the many people that have assisted with this work, especially K.

Temporal analyses of predator-prey interactions from the Tjornes deposits, Iceland, track naticid gastropod drilling predation across the trans-Arctic invasion (TAI: similar to 3.5 Ma). These deposits represent three zones subdivided into 25 marine fossil-bearing beds that correspond with the stages of invasion: Tapes (1-5) and Mactra (6-12) zones are pre-invasion, whereas the Serripes zone (13-25) represents the invasion. Bivalve and naticid gastropod specimens were analysed from the Baroarson (1925) samples at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History, which consisted of pre-invasion and invasion samples; we also bulk-sampled the Serripes zone. Height and length of specimens were measured to assess size changes, and the occurrence of complete and incomplete drill holes and drill hole diameter were recorded for whole bivalves and naticids. Drilling frequency (DF) and prey effectiveness (PE, the incidence of failed drilling) were calculated to track predator-prey interactions. Genus-level diversity increased through the Tjornes deposits, in part related to a shift from intertidal to sublittoral environments. DF increased and PE decreased significantly between the pre-invasion and Serripes zones. However, DF decreased from the early to the late Serripes zone, which could signify stabilization of the Tjornes community. An increase in competition among predators through the invasion is supported by an increase in abundance of naticids relative to bivalves, especially invasive species, a switch to smaller-sized bivalve prey, a decrease in naticid mean size and an increase in confamilial predation.","[Neely, Samuel H.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, 611 Ross St, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kelley, Patricia H.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, 601 South Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Friedman, Michelle M.] AECOM, 1600 Perimeter Pk Dr,Suite 400, Morrisville, NC 27560 USA","Neely, SH (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, 611 Ross St, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",SamuelHNeely@tamu.edu; Kelleyp@uncw.edu; Michelle.Friedman@aecom.com,,"Kelley, Patricia/0000-0003-1319-0571",Geological Society of America; Paleontological Society; University of North Carolina Wilmington Center for Marine Science,"We thank A.

We compared proportional habitat use at observation sites with randomly selected points and evaluated differences in distance to the water sources and to urban boundaries. Habitat use by both species was different from what we had expected from random points. Stone martens used high-density housing more frequently than red foxes and that expected from random points and avoided open and industrial areas, whereas red foxes used housing estates significantly more often than expected and avoided high-density housing. Both species used the other habitats according to their availability. Stone martens often selected habitats located closer to the city centre, whereas red foxes often selected habitats closer to urban borders than expected. The distribution of red foxes and stone martens is influenced by several factors including the availability of shelter and food, as well as the opportunity to move around undetected. Interspecific competition may also play an important role in habitat selection. Stone martens seem to be better adapted to urbanized areas than red foxes.

(2) In forested ecosystems, predation risk for small consumers should increase with the intensity of disturbance. (3) For the same level of disturbance. foragers living in higher-quality habitats should protect their assets by investing more in anti-predatory behaviours than those living in low-quality habitats. Organisms: Red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) living in sympatry with deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Place and time: Twenty-nine pairs of natural and logged habitats sampled during 2006 in managed boreal forest. Province of Quebec, Canada. Methods: We identified a gradient of habitat disturbance along principal components summarizing 12 habitat variables. We estimated competition by measuring the giving-up density of rodents along the gradient of habitat disturbance. We assessed predation risk by measuring the giving-up density of rodents foraging in safe and risky patches. We tested for differences with multi-level statistical modelling. Conclusions: Competition and predation risk increased with habitat disturbance in the boreal forest studied. Foragers living in higher-quality habitats experienced higher predation costs than foragers living in low-quality habitats. Intra- and inter-specific competition, rather than predation, was the main mechanism responsible for the decline of red-backed vole populations associated with forest harvesting.","[Lemaitre, Jerome; Fortin, Daniel] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Darveau, Marcel] Ducks Unlimited Canada, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Lemaitre, J (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jerome.lemaitre.1@ulaval.ca,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020; Lemaitre, Jerome/S-1337-2017","Lemaitre, Jerome/0000-0001-7736-111X",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologiesFQRNT,"This study would not have been possible without the outstanding help of our field assistants, who carried hundreds of filled food patches to experimental sites, counted thousands of sunflower seeds, and collected data on small mammals and habitat variables: L.

For furtive predators, like the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza which preys on aphids while simultaneously residing and remaining undetected within their colonies, oviposition behaviour is crucial because these slow moving offspring are restrained to their natal colony. Here we develop a new model for predicting the optimum number of eggs that a furtive predator should lay in an aphid colony, based on: (1) the number of available prey (aphids); (2) the protection from predation conferred by hiding in the colony and (3) the effects of interspecific and intraspecific competition. We also explore the effect of aphid attendance by ants on oviposition behavior. We compare model predictions with empirical field observations of the clutch sizes of A. aphidimyza in apple orchards. The simplest of the four models best fits the observed data and provides the first field evidence that a furtive predator adjusts its clutch size as a function of prey density. The slope of the relationship between clutch size and aphid number is quite close to that predicted by our models suggesting that intra-clutch competition is the main factor governing furtive aphid midge oviposition choice.","[Sentis, Arnaud; Lucas, Eric; Vickery, William L.] Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Sentis, A (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Dept Sci Biol, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",asentis@hotmail.fr,"Sentis, Arnaud/K-5004-2014","Sentis, Arnaud/0000-0003-4617-3620",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This work was funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grants to Eric Lucas and William L.

Belowground predators feeding on microbial grazers like Collembola could decelerate nutrient mineralization by reducing microbial turnover in the soil, which in turn could negatively influence plant growth. However, empirical evidences for the ecological significance of belowground predators on nutrient cycling and plant communities are scarce. Here, we manipulated predator density (Hypoaspis aculeifer: predatory mite) with equal densities of three Collembola species as a prey in four functionally dissimilar plant communities in experimental microcosms: grass monoculture (Poa pratensis), herb monoculture (Rumex acetosa), legume monoculture (Trifolium pratense), and all three species as a mixed plant community. Density manipulation of predators allowed us to test for density-mediated effects of belowground predators on Collembola and lower trophic groups. We hypothesized that predator density will reduce Collembola population causing a decrease in nutrient mineralization and hence detrimentally affect plant growth. First, we found a density-dependent population change in predators, that is, an increase in low-density treatments, but a decrease in high-density treatments. Second, prey suppression was lower at high predator density, which caused a shift in the soil microbial community by increasing the fungal: bacterial biomass ratio, and an increase of nitrification rates, particularly in legume monocultures. Despite the increase in nutrient mineralization, legume monocultures performed worse at high predator density. Further, individual grass shoot biomass decreased in monocultures, while it increased in mixed plant communities with increasing predator density, which coincided with elevated soil N uptake by grasses. As a consequence, high predator density significantly increased plant complementarity effects indicating a decrease in interspecific plant competition. These results highlight that belowground predators can relax interspecific plant competition by increasing nutrient mineralization through their density-dependent cascading effects on detritivore and soil microbial communities.","[Thakur, Madhav Prakash; Herrmann, Martina; Steinauer, Katja; Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Thakur, Madhav Prakash; Steinauer, Katja; Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Herrmann, Martina; Rennoch, Saskia] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Thakur, MP (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",madhav.thakur@idiv.de,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Cesarz, Simone/A-8468-2012; Cesarz, Simone/AAA-8702-2020; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019","Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Thakur, Madhav/0000-0001-9426-1313",German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ei 862/2],German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG; Ei 862/2).,,85,14,15,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) has traditionally been predicted to dominate native communities through mechanisms embodied in popular hypotheses such as direct plant-plant interactions (allelopathy) and plant-herbivore interactions (enemy escape). However, garlic mustard also interacts directly with native predators by providing habitat for web-building spiders, which colonize the dry fruit structures (siliques) that garlic mustard leaves behind after it senesces. This interaction may lead to altered food web structure, resulting previously unexamined invasion consequences. This idea was tested in a field experiment including three treatments in which garlic mustard siliques were left intact (S+), removed (S-), or native species dominated and garlic mustard was absent (N). When siliques were intact, estimated insect abundance was locally reduced in invaded plots compared to native plots, but this relationship disappeared when siliques were removed. Phosphorus availability and the growth of one native plant species were both elevated in invaded plots where siliques were intact compared to plots where siliques were removed. Results indicate that garlic mustard's close association with web-building spiders initiates cascading invader impacts on the native community and ecosystem properties. This work supports recent theory suggesting that taking a broader food web perspective may help predict invasion impacts in different environmental contexts.","[Smith-Ramesh, Lauren M.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Smith-Ramesh, LM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",laurensmithramesh@gmail.com,,"Smith-Ramesh, Lauren/0000-0001-7520-9675",Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies Donnelley Postdoctoral Environmental Fellowship; Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies; National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) - National Science Foundation through NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DBI-1300426]; Div Of Biological InfrastructureNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1300426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was funded by a Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies Donnelley Postdoctoral Environmental Fellowship and funds from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.

These life-history parameters relate to age and size at maturity, survival, fecundity, life-expectancy at birth, lifespan, gross, and net reproductive rates, generation time, the rate of population increase, peak population density and day of peak abundance. We also discuss the role of photoperiod and temperature on some of these life history parameters. We found a general paucity of experimental work and field data in tropics on cladocerans. There is very limited information on the few Daphnia species found in the tropics. The misconception of low species diversity of cladocerans in the tropics arose due to several reasons including lack of extensive and intensive field collections. Higher water temperatures apparently promote permanent infestation of tropical waters with toxic cyanobacteria, which reduce the zooplankton diversity. In addition to higher temperatures in the tropics, the year-round high predation pressure of planktivorous fish probably causes the tropical species, particularly in pelagic habitats, to reach maturity earlier (< 3 days) than in temperate regions. Species of Daphnia in temperate regions are particularly adapted to living at food concentrations that are much lower and seasonably more variable than those for tropical genera such as Diaphanosoma. This is further corroborated by the more than an order of magnitude higher threshold food concentration (TFC for tropical Cladocera than for their temperate counterparts. Fecundity patterns differ between tropical and temperate cladoceran taxa: cultured under optimal temperature regimes, tropical taxa have fewer eggs than temperate species of a comparable body size. Predation pressure may act differently depending on the size of the cladoceran neonates and thus on their population size structure. Global warming and climate changes seem to affect the behaviour (migration), distribution, and abundance of cladocerans. Apparently, in direct response to these changes, the possibility of encountering the tropical cladocerans in the northern, temperate hemisphere (bioinvasions) is on the rise.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Aquat Zool, Unit UMF, Div Res & Postgrad Studies, Tlalnepantla, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, UIICSE, Div Res & Postgrad Studies, Tlalnepantla, Mexico; Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Limnol, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands","Sarma, SSS (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Aquat Zool, Unit UMF, Div Res & Postgrad Studies, Campus Iztacala,AP 314, Tlalnepantla, Mexico.",sarma@servidor.unam.mx,"Gulati, Ramesh D/F-4943-2013; Sarma, S.S.S./G-3634-2010; Gulati, Ramesh D./A-3155-2011","Sarma, S.S.S./0000-0003-2820-1579; ",,,,127,147,171,2,100,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JUL 1,2005,542,,,,,,315,333,,10.1007/s10750-004-3247-2,,,19,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,964KE,WOS:000231879200030,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, experimentally demonstrating this role of resource partitioning in diverse communities has been difficult. We used an experimental response-surface design, varying intra- and interspecific consumer densities, to compare patterns of resource exploitation between simple and diverse communities of aphid predators. With increasing density, each single consumer species rapidly plateaued in its ability to extract more resources. This suggests intraspecific competition for a subset of the resource pool, a hallmark of resource partitioning. In contrast, more diverse-predator communities achieved greater overall resource depletion. By statistically fitting mechanistic models to the data, we demonstrated that resource partitioning rather than facilitation provides the better explanation for the observed differences in resource use between simple and diverse communities. This model-fitting approach also allowed us to quantify overlap in resource use by different consumer species.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Snyder, Gretchen B.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Snyder, WE (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",wesnyder@wsu.edu,"Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X; Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523; Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",,,,45,59,60,1,86,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

This prediction was tested in flock-feeding Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) depleting hidden tubers of fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) in a two-dimensional, continuous environment. The swans' patch residence time was measured by combining recordings of the foraging behaviour and movement paths. The tuber biomass density was measured before and after the period of exploitation, using the presumable foraging window of the swans as the scale of measurement. Swan foraging was simulated in order to predict the effects of flexible and fixed PLTs, respectively, on the patch residence time and the spatial heterogeneity of the tuber biomass density. Flexible PLTs were predicted to lead to short and decreasing patch residence times and a decrease in the coefficient of variation in tuber biomass densities, whereas the reverse was generally the case for fixed PLTs. Observed patch residence times did not decrease with time and were intermediate between those predicted for swans with flexible and fixed PLTs. Furthermore, an increase of the coefficient of variation in the tuber biomass density was observed. Given the observed giving-up biomass densities the most likely model was one with swans with a fixed rather than a flexible PLT. These results point at factors that may affect the spacing behaviour or constrain the use of a flexible PLT in swans.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO, KNAW, Dept Plant Anim Interact, NL-3600 BG Maarssen, Netherlands; Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO, KNAW, Dept Food Web Studies, NL-3600 BG Maarssen, Netherlands","Nolet, BA (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO, KNAW, Dept Plant Anim Interact, POB 1299, NL-3600 BG Maarssen, Netherlands.",b.nolet@nioo.knaw.nl,"Klaassen, Raymond/K-3027-2013; Nolet, Bart A/C-1416-2008; Mooij, Wolf M/C-2677-2008","Nolet, Bart A/0000-0002-7437-4879; Mooij, Wolf M/0000-0001-5586-8200",,,,33,17,17,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2006,112,2,,,,,342,352,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.13460.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,005CR,WOS:000234800700011,,,,,2021-09-27,

Dominant ant species are known to determine the structure of ant communities by interfering in the foraging of other ant species. Using bait and pitfall trapping experiments, we performed a pattern analysis at a fine spatial scale of an ant community in a very simplified and homogeneous agroecosystem, that is, a single-crop banana field in Martinique (French West Indies). We found that the community structure was driven by three dominant species (Solenopsis geminata, Nylanderia guatemalensis, and Monomorium ebeninum) and two subdominant species (Pheidole fallax and Brachymyrmex patagonicus). Our results showed that dominant and subdominant species generally maintained numerical dominance at baits across time, although S. geminata, M. ebeninum, and B. patagonicus displayed better abilities to maintain dominance than P. fallax and N. guatemalensis. Almost all interspecific correlations between species abundances, except those between B. patagonicus and N. guatemalensis, were symmetrically negative, suggesting that interference competition prevails in this ground-dwelling ant community. However, we observed variations in the diurnal and nocturnal foraging activity and in the daily occurrence at baits, which may mitigate the effect of interference competition through the induction of spatial and temporal niche partitioning. This may explain the coexistence of dominant, subdominant, and subordinate species in this very simplified agroecosystem, limited in habitat structure and diversity.","[Carval, Dominique; Cotte, Violaine; Resmond, Remi; Perrin, Benjamin] CIRAD, UPR GECO, Le Lamentin, Martinique, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CIRAD, UPR GECO, Montpellier, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CATIE, Dept Agr & Agroforesteria, Turrialba, Costa Rica","Carval, D (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR GECO, Le Lamentin, Martinique, France.",dominique.carval@cirad.fr,"Tixier, Philippe/C-2119-2008","Tixier, Philippe/0000-0001-5147-9777; Carval, Dominique/0000-0002-1525-2855; Resmond, Remi/0000-0003-4805-9688",CIRAD; E.U.

In two separate field experiments using P. coccineus L., sex ratios of emerging adults were observed to shift toward significant female-bias with increasing larval density within seeds. Because total (egg-to-adult) mortality was poorly related to sex ratio changes, differential mortality was most likely associated with overcrowding and competition among late instar larvae.

We quantified the effect of four temperature ranges (2-3, 4-5, 7-8, and 10-12 degrees C) on consumption of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs by a native (Orconectes propinquus) and an exotic (Orconectes rusticus) crayfish found in the Great Lakes. Mean individual consumption ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 lake trout eggs per day and from 1.0 to 5.5 rainbow trout eggs per day, respectively. Temperature influenced consumption for O. rusticus feeding on rainbow trout eggs but not O. propinquus. The effect of conspecific predator competition con rainbow trout egg consumption was evaluated using three densities of crayfish (1, 5, 10 per tank). For O. rusticus, mean individual consumption rate was higher at the lowest crawfish density (1 crayfish/tank) than at medium (5 crayfish/tank) or high (10 crayfish/tank) densities. A similar conspecific effect was not evident in O. propinquus and total consumption per unit area increased with crayfish density. The effect of competition among crayfish species on consumption of rainbow trout eggs was examined by comparing feeding rates at high crayfish abundance levels in single and mixed species treatments. Mixed species interactions did not significantly alter crayfish feeding rates. Results from these experiments provide empirical data to aid in modeling how temperature and predator density affect lake trout egg predation rates in the field.","Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Charlevoix Fisheries Res Stn, Charlevoix, MI 49720 USA; Dept Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Ctr Inland Waters, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada; Univ Vermont, Sch Nat Resources, Rubenstein Ecosyst Sci Lab, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Jonas, JL (corresponding author), Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Charlevoix Fisheries Res Stn, 96 Grant St, Charlevoix, MI 49720 USA.",jonasj@michigan.gov,,,,,,25,19,19,0,23,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2205 COMMONWEALTH BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48105 USA",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Their mathematical formulation is important for the study of pattern formation in general and plays central roles in many fields of biology, such as ecology and morphogenesis. Here we show that Turing patterns may have a decisive role in shaping the abundance distribution of predators and prey living in patchy landscapes. We extend the original model proposed by Nakao and Mikhailov [Nat. Phys. 6, 544 (2010)] by considering food chains with several interacting pairs of prey and predators distributed on a scale-free network of patches. We identify patterns of species distribution displaying high degrees of apparent competition driven by Turing instabilities. Our results provide further indication that differences in abundance distribution among patches can be generated dynamically by self organized Turing patterns and not only by intrinsic environmental heterogeneity.","[Fernandes, L.

A decline in habitat may lead to crowding of live coral specialists into remnant habitat patches, intensifying intraspecific competition. Increased local densities of conspecifics are known to negatively affect key demographic processes, but the magnitude of density effects and the role of crowding in response to habitat loss are poorly understood. In this study we examined habitat use and relationships between habitat availability and population density in a coral-dwelling damselfish - Chrysiptera parasema. First, we conducted habitat use and availability surveys to establish the level of habitat selectivity. We then investigated the evidence for crowding due to habitat loss by comparing densities within juvenile aggregations on natural reefs with high and low cover of the preferred habitat. Finally, we used a manipulative patch-reef experiment to measure the potential effects of crowding on mortality of juvenile C. parasema. Surveys revealed that 97% of juvenile C. parasema were associated with Acropora corals. Furthermore, C. parasema densities were closely related to the cover of bottlebrush Acropora, the preferred growth form. Contrary to predictions, there was no evidence of crowding on natural reefs with low coral cover, but rather, reefs with abundant Acropora cover supported larger aggregations with double the density of juveniles. We hypothesized that low densities of C. parasema on natural reefs with low coral cover could be explained by intense intraspecific competition. Experimental manipulations showed that juvenile mortality was density-dependent, with mortality 20% higher on high-density experimental patch-reefs compared to low-density reefs. Behavioural observations on the patch-reefs revealed that the frequency of agonistic interactions and distance to shelter were both unrelated to conspecific densities, highlighting the need for further research into mechanisms underpinning density dependent mortality. These results suggest that intraspecific competition may play an important role in reducing reef fish abundance as a consequence of habitat loss. Given that coral reef systems are currently under threat, with a global decline in coral cover, this study adds to the growing body of knowledge of how disturbances to habitat may affect reef fish communities.

Pygmy rabbits Brachylagus idahoensis are sagebrush specialists that occupy the intermountain region of the USA. Little is known concerning how fragmentation of sagebrush and an increase in habitat edge may impact pygmy rabbits. From 2004 to 2009 in Utah, USA, we tested hypotheses concerning the influences of habitat edge on pygmy rabbits. We quantified the number of active pygmy rabbit burrows in relation to distance from habitat edge. At differing distances from habitat edge, we also deployed remote cameras at burrows and counted fecal pellets to document potential increases in the number of terrestrial predators and competitors. We classified activity of 528 burrows (284 active and 244 inactive). The proportion of active burrows was lower within 100 m of habitat edge (r2=0.502, P=0.02) compared with burrows located in control areas (> 100 m from habitat edge). Photographs of pygmy rabbits decreased at burrows closer to habitat edge (P < 0.01). Photographs of predators increased near habitat edge, but was marginally insignificant (P=0.07), and photographs of potential competitors [cottontail (Sylvilagus spp.), P < 0.01; jackrabbit Lepus californicus, P < 0.01] increased near habitat edge. Fecal pellet plots supported these patterns. Our results indicated that the proportion of active burrows and the relative abundance of pygmy rabbits were reduced near habitat edge. This reduction was associated with an increase in terrestrial predators and competitors near habitat edge. Consideration should be given to the influence of habitat edge on pygmy rabbits in order to conserve and manage this unique species.","[Pierce, J. E.; Larsen, R. T.; Flinders, J.

In addition, we predicted that perch impact lake usage by goldeneye. In the observational part of our study, we first explored the association between perch, invertebrates and goldeneye (pairs and broods per shore km) in 18 boreal, poorly vegetated lakes. Perch densities were associated negatively with invertebrate abundance and lake usage by goldeneye broods. In the experimental part in three fish-free lakes, we found that upon successful perch introductions, the number and biomass of invertebrates, the proportion of large dytiscids, and lake usage by goldeneye broods significantly decreased. We conclude that perch apparently plays a key role as a predator of invertebrates in boreal lakes with few aquatic macrophytes. It is evident that perch can strongly affect their prey populations and communities, and this predation may have an indirect effect on species, e.g. goldeneye, that consume the same prey.","[Nummi, Petri; Vaananen, Veli-Matti; Taskinen, Keijo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Rask, Martti] Evo Game & Fisheries Res, Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Evo 16970, Finland; [Nyberg, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Nummi, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petri.nummi@helsinki.fi,"Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021","Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633",,,,62,19,21,0,28,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1015-1621,,,AQUAT SCI,Aquat.

In this work, we have studied a three species predator-prey model with prey switching where top predator and intermediate predator are competed with each other for same prey. Earlier hypothetical studies predict the feeding behavior of any species that feeds on more than one trophic levels in any food chain consisting of three and more trophic levels is either stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the condition of the system. Moreover, the effect of this type of selective mechanism is yet not properly understood. In such case, it would be worthwhile to construct a new form of functional response depending upon the densities of a pair of prey and intermediate predator. In addition, we study the effect of intermediate predator through the consumption rate of top predator, which ultimately derives the new functional response and finds that the predation pressure on intermediate predator may be decreased as prey populations are abundant. During their food selection, intraspecific competition also plays a major role for the stability of the system. The theoretical illustrations have been provided by numerical simulations.

Populations of many extant forest bird species continue to be depredated by mammals, especially rats, possums, and mustelids. The management history of New Zealand's forests over the past 50 years presents a unique opportunity because a varied program of mammalian predator control has created a replicated management experiment. We conducted a meta-analysis of population-level responses of forest birds to different levels of mammal control recorded across New Zealand. We collected data from 32 uniquely treated sites and 20 extant bird species representing a total of 247 population responses to 3 intensities of invasive mammal control (zero, low, and high). The treatments varied from eradication of invasive mammals via ground-based techniques to periodic suppression of mammals via aerially sown toxin. We modeled population-level responses of birds according to key life history attributes to determine the biological processes that influence species' responses to management. Large endemic species, such as the Kaka (Nestor meridionalis) and New Zealand Pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae), responded positively at the population level to mammal control in 61 of 77 cases for species >= 20 g compared with 31 positive responses from 78 cases for species <20 g. The Fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa) and Grey Warbler (Gerygone igata), both shallow endemic species, and 4 nonendemic species (Blackbird [Turdus merula], Chaffinch [Fringilla coelebs], Dunnock [Prunella modularis], and Silvereye [Zosterops lateralis]) that arrived in New Zealand in the last 200 years tended to have slight negative or neutral responses to mammal control (59 of 77 cases). Our results suggest that large, deeply endemic forest birds, especially cavity nesters, are most at risk of further decline in the absence of mammal control and, conversely suggest that 6 species apparently tolerate the presence of invasive mammals and may be sensitive to competition from larger endemic birds.","[Fea, Nyree; Hartley, Stephen] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Linklater, Wayne] Calif State Univ Sacramento, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA","Fea, N (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",nyree.fea@gmail.com,"Hartley, Stephen/A-2794-2008","Hartley, Stephen/0000-0002-9049-5072; Linklater, Wayne/0000-0003-2627-693X; Fea, Nyree/0000-0001-5335-5209",Holdsworth Charitable Trust [80759-2268],"N.F. collected the data, contacted project managers, and led the analysis and writing of the manuscript.

However, experimental comparisons of these two food-web modules are rare. Mixotrophic plankton species combine photoautotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition by grazing upon other phytoplankton species. We found that the mixotrophic chrysophyte Ochromonas can grow autotrophically on ammonium, but not on nitrate. This offered a unique opportunity to compare predator-prey interactions in the presence and absence of intraguild predation, without changing the species composition of the community. With ammonium as nitrogen source, Ochromonas can compete with its autotrophic prey for nitrogen and therefore acts as intraguild predator. With nitrate, Ochromonas acts solely as predator, and is not in competition with its prey for nitrogen. We parameterized a simple intraguild predation model based on chemostat experiments with monocultures of Ochromonas and the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis. Subsequently, we tested the model predictions by inoculating Ochromonas into the Microcystis monocultures, and vice versa. The results showed that Microcystis was a better competitor for ammonium than Ochromonas. In agreement with theoretical predictions, Microcystis was much more strongly suppressed by intraguild predation on ammonium than by top-down predation on nitrate. Yet, Microcystis persisted at very low population densities, because the type III functional response of Ochromonas implied that the grazing pressure upon Microcystis became low when Microcystis was rare. Our results provide experimental support for intraguild predation theory, and indicate that intraguild predation may enable biological control of microbial pest species.","[Wilken, Susanne; Naus-Wiezer, Suzanne; Van Donk, Ellen] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wilken, Susanne; Verspagen, Jolanda M.

Interactions between apex predators can have cascading effects through the entire natural community, which supports broadening the scope of conservation from single species to a much wider ecosystem perspective. However, competition between wild large carnivores can hardly be measured experimentally. In this study, we analyzed the expansion of the Scandinavian wolf (Canis lupus) population during its recovery from the early 1990s. We took into account wolf-, habitat-, human-and brown bear (Ursus arctos)-related factors, because wolf expansion occurred within an area partially sympatric with bears. Wolf pair establishment was positively related to previous wolf presence and was negatively related to road density, distance to other wolf territories, and bear density. These findings suggest that both human-related habitat modification and interspecific competition have been influential factors modulating the expansion of the wolf population. Interactions between large carnivores have the potential to affect overall biodiversity. Therefore, conservation-oriented management of such species should consider interspecific interactions, rather than focusing only on target populations of single species. Long-term monitoring data across large areas should also help quantify and predict the influence of biotic interactions on species assemblages and distributions elsewhere. This is important because interactive processes can be essential in the regulation, stability, and resilience of ecological communities.","[Ordiz, Andres; Mansson, Johan; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Milleret, Cyril; Wabakken, Petter] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, NO-2480 Evenstad, Koppang, Norway; [Kindberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway","Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",andres.ordiz@gmail.com,"Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019; Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020","Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457; Mansson, Johan/0000-0002-5189-2091; Milleret, Cyril/0000-0002-8563-981X",Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission; Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk; Hedmark University College; Office of Environmental Affairs in Hedmark County; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; Worldwide Fund for Nature (Sweden); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse,"A.

On coral reefs, structural complexity is typically measured using a single and small-scale metric ('rugosity') that represents multiple spatial attributes differentially exploited by species, thus limiting a complete understanding of how fish associate with reef structure. We used a novel approach to compare relationships between fishes and previously unavailable components of reef complexity, and contrasted the results against the traditional rugosity index. This study focused on damselfish to explore relationships between fishes and reef structure. Three territorial species, with contrasting trophic habits and expected use of the reef structure, were examined to infer the potential species-specific mechanisms associated with how complexity influences habitat selection. Three-dimensional reef reconstructions from photogrammetry quantified the following metrics of habitat quality: 1) visual exposure to predators and competitors, 2) density of predation refuges and 3) substrate-related food availability. These metrics explained the species distribution better than the traditional measure of rugosity, and each species responded to different complexity components. Given that a critical effect of reef degradation is loss of structure, adopting three-dimensional technologies potentially offers a new tool to both understand species-habitat association and help forecast how fishes will be affected by the flattening of reefs.","[Gonzalez-Rivero, M.; Ganase, A.; Hoegh-Guldberg, O.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Gonzalez-Rivero, M.; Harborne, A.

I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size structure, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored over a 2-mo summer period. Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively during the whole experiment, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates. The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex interactions between the omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics of littoral than of pelagic communities.",,"DIEHL, S (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,102,357,369,1,224,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1992,73,5,,,,,1646,1661,,10.2307/1940017,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP740,WOS:A1992JP74000014,,,,,2021-09-27,

Less clear, however, is how isolation alters interactions within food webs. Here, we present the results from an experiment performed in artificial ponds (mesocosms) manipulating habitat isolation crossed with a predator reduction treatment to disentangle how isolation mediates the top-down effect of predators. The strength of the trophic cascade, from predators, through herbivores, to producers. was considerably stronger in connected than in isolated habitats. We further found that the overall richness of both predator and herbivore species declined strongly with isolation. Experimental predator reductions suggest that the mechanism underlying the herbivore response was likely mediated by a keystone predator effect; when predators were reduced, herbivore richness was lower, and there was no discernable effect of isolation on herbivore richness. Finally, we found that the composition of predators in more isolated habitats consisted of species that were smaller and likely less effective predators than species that persisted in less isolated habitats.

If both bacteria and phytoplankton are mineral nutrient limited, this should provide the mixotrophs with the double benefit of combining removal of their competitor with ingestion of the limiting nutrient in pelleted form. It is the objective of this study to expand the classical theories of competition and predation to explore the effect on the microbial food web of one trophic group possessing both strategies. In a chemostat scenario, we analyzed the two-species situation of a mixotroph preying on mineral-nutrient-limited bacteria, and also the situations when the mixotroph in addition has to compete with specialized photoautotrophic and phagotrophic protists, each superior to the mixotroph in their specialized nutritional modes. In the mixotroph-bacteria relationship, somewhat paradoxically, high predatory abilities will reduce the quantitative importance of predation in the mixotroph's nutrition. The reason is a strong reduction in prey abundance, allowing the mixotroph to survive as a photoautotroph despite its low competitive ability. In the three-species case with mixotrophs, bacteria, and specialized phagotrophs, it is shown that the mixotroph can compensate for a ''price'' paid in reduced affinity for bacterial prey by a sufficiently high affinity for mineral nutrients. In the other three-species case where the mixotroph has to compete with a specialized photoautotroph, the situation is more complex; there is an optimum value fur the mixotroph's predatory ability at which mixotroph biomass is maximized. In the general situation with all four species (bacteria, mixotrophs, and specialized auto- and phagotrophs) potentially present, different mixotrophic strategies will alter the equilibrium composition of the consortium, with the mixotroph being most successful with a high affinity for nutrients and an intermediate affinity for bacteria, In the simple form used here, the model predicts no equilibrium with all four species simultaneously present. The theory is in principle directly applicable to laboratory experimentation.","WATER QUAL RES INST,DK-2970 HORSHOLM,DENMARK","Thingstad, TF (corresponding author), UNIV BERGEN,DEPT MICROBIOL,JAHNEBAKKEN 5,N-5020 BERGEN,NORWAY.",,"Thingstad, Tron Frede/B-2254-2008","Thingstad, Tron Frede/0000-0002-5593-819X",,,,33,118,120,1,57,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1996,77,7,,,,,2108,2118,,10.2307/2265705,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VM421,WOS:A1996VM42100015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Which interaction predominates may depend on relative population densities and individual species' responses to the plants on which they co-occur. We examined interactions between populations of thrips and spider mites on several cultivars of two bedding plants: impatiens (Impatiens wallerana Hook.f) cultivars 'Impulse Orange' and 'Cajun Carmine', and ivy geranium [Pelargonium peltatum (L.) L'Her ex Aiton] cultivars 'Sybil Holmes' and 'Amethyst 96'. Four combinations of thrips and mite numbers were studied: thrips alone, mites alone, and two densities of thrips and mites together. We compared population numbers after 4 weeks. Overall, mite numbers increased more rapidly than thrips did, but both species increased more rapidly on impatiens than on ivy geraniums. Between impatiens cultivars, thrips and mites increased more slowly on 'Cajun Carmine' (i.e., it was more resistant) than on 'Impulse Orange'. On ivy geraniums, spider mites increased more slowly on 'Sybil Holmes' than on 'Amethyst 96' but the reverse was the case for thrips. Regardless of plant species or cultivar, thrips had a strong negative effect on spider mites whenever they co-occurred, suppressing mite population growth by around 50% compared to when mites were alone. However, the effect of spider mites on western flower thrips depended on the quality of the plant species. On impatiens, thrips co-occurring with spider mites increased slightly more than thrips alone did, while on ivy geranium mites had a small negative effect on thrips. Contrary to expectations, thrips had a larger negative impact on spider mites on plants that were more susceptible to thrips than they did on plants more resistant to thrips. We suggest that host plants mediate the interaction between an omnivore and its herbivorous prey not only by altering individual diet choice but by changing the relative population dynamics of each species.","Kansas State Univ, Dept Entomol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Guizhou Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Plant Protect, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; Kansas State Univ, Dept Stat, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Margolies, DC (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Entomol, 123 W Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",dmargoli@ksu.edu,,,,,,45,10,11,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

We demonstrated that interspecific competition with the exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) significantly increases the daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. The effect of intraspecific competition on the daytime activity of salmon was half that of interspecific competition. This indicates that the effect of rainbow trout was a combination of increasing density and the identity of the competitor. We also demonstrated that the effect of rainbow trout was probably the result of territorial interference between species. Moreover, we showed that water temperature simultaneously played an important role in explaining daytime activity of Atlantic salmon. During twilight, we observed no effect of competition on salmon activity, but environmental cues other than temperature (e.g., invertebrate drift, cloud cover) became significant predictors of activity. Feeding and growth rates of Atlantic salmon were not affected by the different levels of competition. Nevertheless, the exotic species may have a major impact by exposing the native species to increased risks of daytime predation.","[Blanchet, Simon; Bernatchez, Louis; Dodson, Julian J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, CIRSA, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Blanchet, Simon; Bernatchez, Louis; Dodson, Julian J.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, QC Ocean, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Loot, Geraldine] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France","Blanchet, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, CIRSA, Pavillon Vachon, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",blanchet@cict.fr; julian.dodson@bio.ulaval.ca,"Blanchet, Simon/AAA-5871-2019; Blanchet, Simon/D-4850-2013; Loot, Geraldine/A-6365-2011; Blanchet, Simon/A-2313-2010","Blanchet, Simon/0000-0002-3843-589X; Blanchet, Simon/0000-0002-3843-589X; Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We sincerely thank J.F.

The behavioral, non-numerical, effects of predator presence on the relative performances of juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis) and juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) were studied in a field enclosure experiment. Each enclosure consisted of a predator-safe part with complex physical structure (artificial vegetation) and an open water with predators present or absent. In half of the enclosures, the bottom of the prey refuge was sealed with a plastic sheet which prevented the juvenile fish from bottom feeding and also reduced the densities of invertebrates attached to the artificial vegetation. In the absence of predators (piscivorous perch), juvenile roach fed mainly on Bosmina whereas they fed mainly on detritus/algae in the presence of predators. Zooplankton biomasses in the open water were higher in the presence of predators than in their absence suggesting that the predators restricted the habitat use of the juvenile fish. The predator-induced shift in roach resource use resulted in a decreased growth rate of roach. The food resource use of juvenile perch was more affected by the availability of invertebrates attached to the artificial vegetation than by piscivore presence and growth of juvenile perch was affected by piscivore presence only in the enclosures with bottom sheets where they had no access to bottom-living prey. Previous laboratory studies have suggested that the physical structure per se is of major importance for the competitive interactions between juvenile perch and roach, but this enclosure experiment indicates that the prey resources associated with physical structure may also be important. In the absence of piscivores, I suggest that the open water is the preferred habitat for the juveniles of both species, but habitats with complex physical structure may serve as a competitive refuge for juvenile perch. Interactions between perch and roach are, however, also affected by the efficiency with which the juveniles use physical structure as a predator refuge, and roach have been shown to be more efficient than perch in evading predators in the vegetation.",,"PERSSON, L (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT ANIM ECOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,,,,61,95,97,0,27,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1993,68,1,,,,,12,22,,10.2307/3545304,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MB138,WOS:A1993MB13800002,,,,,2021-09-27,

To determine the effects of potential competitive and behavioral interactions between native predators and invasive lionfish, we experimentally altered the presence of lionfish and red grouper Epinephelus morio in karst solution holes in Florida Bay, USA, and then tracked subsequent changes in the juvenile reef fish and motile macroinvertebrate communities for 6 wk. Relative to solution holes where we excluded both predators, mean juvenile reef fish abundance declined 83.7% in solution holes with a lionfish but increased by 154% in solution holes with a red grouper. There was no difference in juvenile reef fish abundance in solution holes with both lionfish and red grouper compared to holes where we excluded both predators. The composition of lionfish stomach contents shifted from mostly teleost fishes when lionfish were present in solution holes alone, to mostly crustaceans when in the presence of a red grouper. Concurrently, the abundance of 2 species of cleaner shrimp (Ancylomenes pedersoni and Periclimenes yucatanicus) decreased by 14.7% when lionfish were present but increased by 56.2% at holes where lionfish were excluded. We suggest that these results are due to altered lionfish predatory behavior in the presence of red grouper and highlight the importance of maintaining intact native predator communities for ameliorating the negative effects of the lionfish invasion.","[Ellis, Robert D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Faletti, Meaghan E.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Div Marine Fisheries Management, 2950 Execut Ctr Circle East, Tallahassee, FL 32301 USA; [Ellis, Robert D.] Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",robert.ellis@myfwc.com,,"Ellis, Robert/0000-0001-7178-8980",PADI Foundation; Florida Sea Grant; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute (GCFI),"This project was conducted with permissions from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (permit #FKNMS-2012-078), the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (SAL #11-1330-SR), and the FSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocol #1106).

Among these is the presence of parasites which attack some or all members of a guild and potentially promote coexistence of competitor species. We assessed the prevalence of nematode (Allantonematidae) parasitism in Dutch woodland drosophilids (Diptera). Nematodes were found in 6 of the 18 drosophilid species sampled (percentage parasitism in parentheses): Drosophila phalerata (16%), D. kuntzei (5.1%), D. immigrans (0.5%), D. testacea (1.2%) and D. transversa (2.8%) were all parasitized by Howardula aoronymphium and D. subobscura (3%) was parasitized by Parazitylenchus diplogenus. This is the first report of nematode parasitism of D. immigrans and D. transversa. There were no important seasonal trends in percentage parasitism. We explored the consequences of nematode parasitism for individual drosophilids. Nematodes did not exert an important influence on the wing length (adult body size) of the drosophilids we sampled, but egg loads (fecundities) of female D. phalerata, D. subobscura and D. kuntzei were reduced by nematode parasitism. Parasitism rates were positively correlated with relative host abundance, in Dutch and other communities, suggesting that species diversity is promoted by a disproportionately high parasitism of more common host species.","AARHUS UNIV, INST BIOL SCI, DEPT ECOL & GENET, DK-8000 AARHUS C, DENMARK; LEIDEN UNIV, INST EVOLUT & ECOL SCI, NL-2300 RA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,43,13,13,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Early colonization remains the least studied and quantified phase of assembly. In order to fill this gap, an approach combining in situ experiments and modelling was proposed to study colonization by a benthic macrofauna community in open microcosms containing a single, non-limiting resource. The experiment was three months long. A total of 51 taxa were observed in the microcosms, but data analyses of the species composition and abundances revealed that five species, Capitella spp., Gammaropsis maculata, Erichtionus punctatus, Nereiphylla paretti and Harmothoe mariannae, explained most of the observed variation in the assembly process. The population dynamics of these species were simulated taking into account functional traits that govern individual interactions. The dynamic model simulated a demographic stochasticity due to low population densities that result from the small size of the experimental microcosms. Using this combined approach of experiments and modelling, we showed that predation interactions alone can account for the abundances and species composition of primary consumers during the transient phase of early colonization.","[Fanfard, S.; Charles, F.; Guarini, J. -M.] Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Coston-Guarini, J.; Guarini, J. -M.] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, IUEM, UMR 6539, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Nozais, C.] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Biol, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada","Guarini, JM (corresponding author), Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France.; Guarini, JM (corresponding author), Univ Bretagne Occidentale, IUEM, UMR 6539, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR, F-29280 Plouzane, France.",jean-marc.guarini@upmc.fr,,,,,,44,0,0,2,11,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",1585-8553,1588-2756,,COMMUNITY ECOL,Community Ecol.,JUN,2016,17,1,,,,,98,106,,10.1556/168.2016.17.1.12,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EC3CX,WOS:000388003500012,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-27,

Role of interference competition in structuring the insect community on fermented tree sap,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,dominance hierarchy; fighting behaviour; foraging; removal experiment; Vespa mandarinia,ANT COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; PREDATION,"1. In insect communities on fermented tree sap, agonistic interactions occur frequently among the component species. This study examined the effects of such interference competition on community structure and species co-occurrence on a spatio-temporally small scale. 2. Experimental removal of giant hornets (Vespa mandarinia), one of the most dominant species, showed no effect on either species richness or total abundance of the remaining insects. Significant increases in abundance were detected for five out of 19 taxa: V. ducalis, V. crabro, Lasius japonicus, Cryptarcha lewisi, and a group of micro sap beetles (Epuraea spp., Haptoncus spp., and Haptoncurina spp.). 3. Behavioural observations indicated that interference did not alter the staying time at a patch (an exuding spot on a tree) for V. mandarinia, Rhomborrhina japonica, and Neope goschkevitschii. Interference-mediated departure from a patch was less frequent than departure without interference for all nine species observed, except for R. japonica. These behavioural contexts varied yearly for several species. 4. These results suggest that interference competition is a minor determinant of overall community structure, despite its conspicuousness. This weak effect of interference may be attributed to the short stay of dominant species and to individual behavioural responses, such as competitor avoidance. The variable influence of interference might be related to differences in species attributes, such as dominance hierarchies.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; Kyoto Univ Museum, Kyoto, Japan","Yoshimoto, J (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Insect Ecol, Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",jiichiro@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Kakutani, Takehiko/0000-0001-8174-616X",,,,16,8,8,1,18,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

In contrast, nothing is known about plastic responses to the density of competitors, which could signal the potential for food limitation or predation risk. We studied effects on trophic morphology of culturing sand dollar pluteus larvae with limiting or saturating food and at low or high density using 1 of 3 potential competitors: feeding conspecifics, feeding heterospecifics, and non-feeding heterospecifics. We hypothesized that feeding competitors would induce a morphological response similar to limiting food, while the effect of non-feeders would depend on whether larvae respond directly to higher density or indirectly to food reduction. Plutei cultured with limited food grew longer feeding arms and shorter stomachs, though only in higher density treatments. Whereas the response to food involved a tradeoff between skeleton and stomach growth, larvae responded to high density by in creasing in vestment in both, reflecting a more complex set of energetic tradeoffs. Similar responses to the presence of feeding and non-feeding larvae implicate a sensory mechanism involving signals from potential competitors rather than a food decline. Patterns in 2 literature surveys of laboratory experiments and field studies suggest that culture density is a critical but neglected aspect of experimental design in the study of early life-history stages. Larvae are most likely exposed to densities sufficient to induce plasticity following synchronous spawning, highlighting the importance of natural history in understanding density-dependent effects on developmental plasticity.","[Kacenas, Suzanne E.; Podolsky, Robert D.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA","Podolsky, RD (corresponding author), Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.",podolskyr@cofc.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0621467],"We thank R.

The model is further based upon the underlying idea of mass action, which means that it is assumed that predator and prey numbers are infinitely large. This latter assumption casts doubt on the applicability of the model to experimental situations, which have been used to estimate the underlying behavioural parameters, because such experiments are usually performed with very few competitors. Therefore, a stochastic version of the Beddington-DeAngelis model is presented which overcomes these problems. A maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation is presented and applied to shore crabs foraging on blue mussels. In passing, a mistake in the derivation of the deterministic Beddington-DeAngelis model is corrected, resulting in a slightly different solution.","[van der Meer, Jaap; Smallegange, Isabel M.] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; [van der Meer, Jaap] Free Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1085 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","van der Meer, J (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands.",meer@nioz.nl,"Smallegange, Isabel M./A-8198-2010; van der Meer, Jaap/C-6687-2011","Smallegange, Isabel M./0000-0001-6218-7358; ",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),We thank Goran Englund and Graeme Ruxton for constructive comments.

We found that both predation and interspecific competition greatly reduced the survivorship of larvae and the number of larvae emerging into adulthood. Treatments with both predators and competitors had fewer larvae transitioning among instars and into adulthood but not in an additive way. In addition, mosquito larvae in the presence of predators and competitors took two days longer to emerge than where predators and competitions were absent. Our work provides evidence that biotic interactions, such as predation and competition: can strongly regulate the number or mosquito larvae by reducing the number of larvae that survive through instars and to emergence and by increasing the generation time.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Knight, TM (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,"Goss, Charles/R-7296-2019",,,,,42,50,51,2,32,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,SANTA ANA,"PO BOX 87, SANTA ANA, CA 92702 USA",1081-1710,,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

Contrary to Lubchenco's and my conclusions, Petraitis concluded that (1) barnacles and not mussels are the favored prey of dogwhelks and (2) barnacles and not dogwhelks control mussel abundances in the mid and low rocky intertidal region. I provide evidence that these criticisms are unwarranted. First, Lubchenco and I never claimed that diet composition reflected prey preference. Moreover, predators can influence prey abundance without preferring the prey. Hence, claims regarding preferences have no bearing on our conclusions. Second, Petraitis' experiments do not invalidate Lubchenco's and my experimental results. Reanalyses of our experimental data support the earlier conclusion that at wave-sheltered sites, whelks reduce the abundance of mussels independently of barnacle abundances. Further, at all but one of Lubchenco's and my study sites, predator densities were higher than at Petraitis' site. Thus, the absence of a predator effect in Petraitis's study was most likely due to low predator density rather than a lack of generality of our earlier results.

It remains unclear; however, if this variety of impacts is due to different invader strategies, features of recipient communities or both. To test this, we examined multiple plant invasions of a single ecosystem in southwestern Australia. We used extensive community data to calculate pairwise segregation between target alien species and many co-occurring species. We related segregation to species' positions along community trait hierarchies and identified at least two distinct invasion strategies: exploiters' which occupy high positions along key trait hierarchies and reduce local native species diversity (particularly in nutrient-enriched situations), and coexisters' who occupy intermediate trait positions and have no discernable impact on native diversity.

In Ireland, the bank vole was introduced 80 years ago and now occupies a third of the island. The greater white-toothed shrew arrived more recently within the invasive range of the bank vole. We surveyed the abundance of both invasive species and two indigenous species, the wood mouse and pygmy shrew, throughout their respective ranges. The negative effects of invasive on indigenous species were strong and cumulative bringing about species replacement. The greater white-toothed shrew, the second invader, had a positive and synergistic effect on the abundance of the bank vole, the first invader, but a negative and compounding effect on the abundance of the wood mouse and occurrence of the pygmy shrew. The gradual replacement of the wood mouse by the bank vole decreased with distance from the point of the bank vole's introduction whilst no pygmy shrews were captured where both invasive species were present. Such interactions may not be unique to invasions but characteristic of all multispecies communities. Small mammals are central in terrestrial food webs and compositional changes to this community in Ireland are likely to reverberate throughout the ecosystem. Vegetation composition and structure, invertebrate communities and the productivity of avian and mammalian predators are likely to be affected. Control of these invasive species may only be effected through landscape and habitat management.","[Montgomery, W.

North American grassland bird distributions predominantly reside on private lands, and populations have been consistently declining. Many of these lands are enrolled in U.S. federal conservation programmes, and properly guided management policies could alleviate declines. However, more evaluative research is needed on the effects of management policies juxtaposed with other multi-scale habitat features. Furthermore, research focused on nest survival is arguably more valuable because habitat associations with avian densities can sometimes be deceptive. We investigated nest survival of a grassland facultative (red-winged blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus) and obligate species (dickcissel Spiza americana), and two nesting communities (ground and above-ground nesters) relative to management and multi-scale habitat (nest-site characteristics, in-field microhabitat, patch metrics, and landscape context). Our study was conducted on private lands in Illinois (2011-2014) and directly linked to policy-based management (discing, herbicidal spraying, spray/interseeding) and landowner decisions. Multi-scale models explained more variation in nest survival compared to single scales or management in three of four analyses (blackbirds, dickcissels, and above-ground nesters). Finer-scale habitat variables, such as nest-site characteristics, were more often in top and among the competitive models relative to landscape factors. Compared with other management types, discing (i.e., tractor-pulled disc harrows removed approximately 50% of vegetation) displayed distinct effects and positively influenced nest survival in above-ground nesters. Also, greater proportions of a field managed cumulatively and yearly, regardless of type, generally improved nest survival for dickcissels and above-ground nesters. All groups except above-ground nesters had generally higher nest survival in native-grass dominated fields. Synthesis and applications. Habitat practitioners can improve nest survival for certain grassland birds by directly affecting in-field microhabitat vegetation and structure. However, characteristics associated with specific nest locations often drive nest survival. We suggest habitat managers and agency staff promote native grass practices and management, such as discing, to enhance nest survival of grassland bird populations. Management will likely be most effective in favourable unfragmented grassland landscapes with less surrounding forested areas, which also promote other important responses (e.g., colonization and persistence) of target species.

We used 2 years' data from a field experiment to relate the reproduction and survival of focal Silene latifolia plants to the numbers of conspecific plants and flowers within a range of distances (0.16-150 m) from the focal plants. Thus we consider spatial scale as a continuously-varying component of population density. Because the data come from a single continuous population, we fitted regression models in two stages in order to remove spatial autocorrelation induced by environmental factors before modelling density effects. As well as single-scale models, we fitted multiple-scale models to explore interaction kernels. We statistically standardized plant size in some analyses to isolate pollination effects. Reproductive output per plant generally decreased with greater densities of plants and flowers; for example there was a negative effect of female flowers within a 70-m radius in the second year. However, at low female densities there was a positive effect of male flowers at a scale of 13 m in the first year. Seed-set per flower decreased with greater densities of flowers in the second year (at radii < 10 m). Seed predation was greater when more female flowers were present within 5-7 m. Plants' survival probability increased with density within 0.28 m for all but the smallest plants. We also collected data on the pattern and reproductive success of S. latifolia plants in a natural population nearby and applied similar methodology. Here the negative effects of female flower densities occurred at finer scales and gave way to positive effects above 2 m, contrasting with some patterns from the experiment. Synthesis. In a sessile population interacting with mobile biota, the effects of density on individual fitness may vary with the way in which density is measured. This, together with the methodological challenges for analysing spatial data from continuous populations, should be considered when designing and interpreting studies of spatial density-dependence. Taking these issues into account, we may begin to explain the spatial patterns of natural populations.","[Gunton, Richard M.; Kunin, William E.] Univ Leeds, Inst Integrat & Comparat Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Gunton, RM (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Biol & Gest Adventices, 17 Rue Sully, F-21065 Dijon, France.",rmg@cantab.net,"Gunton, Richard/AAW-6382-2021","Gunton, Richard/0000-0002-7213-787X",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),"We thank Laura Harrison, James Rosindell and Doreen Gabriel for helpful discussion and methodological suggestions.

However, the evolutionary consequences of indirect interactions are rarely considered. Here I conduct selection experiments and examine the evolutionary response of Colpoda sp., a ciliated protozoan, to other members of the inquiline community of purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea). I measured the evolution of six traits in response to (1) predation by mosquito larvae, (2) competition from other ciliated protozoans, and (3) simultaneous predation and competition. The latter treatment incorporated both direct effects and indirect effects due to interactions between predators and competitors. Population growth rate and cell size evolved in response to direct effects of predators and competitors. However, trait values in the multispecies treatment were similar to those in the monoculture treatment, indicating that direct effects were offset by strong indirect effects on the evolution of traits. For most of the traits measured, indirect effects were opposed to, and often stronger than, direct effects. These indirect effects occurred as a result of behavioral changes of the predator in the presence of competitors and as a result of reduced densities of competitors in the presence of predators. Incorporating indirect effects provides a more realistic description of how species evolve in complex natural communities.","[Terhorst, Casey P.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Terhorst, CP (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",casey.terhorst@kbs.msu.edu,,,"Florida State University (FSU); FSU English Department; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0519170, DEB-0716891]","This work could not have been accomplished without valuable assistance in the laboratory from F.

In two species of carabid larvae (Poecilus chalcites and Anisodactylus ovularis), we studied how alternative foods (fly pupae and grass seeds) and predator density affect predation of black cutworm larvae and how alternative foods affect cannibalism among carabid larvae. 3. Adding alternative food to microcosms generally reduced total predation of cutworms. However, the strength of this effect was dependent on carabid species, larval density, and food type. 4. Increasing larval density from one to three per microcosm reduced per-capita predation by both species irrespective of alternative food treatment. 5. Alternative food reduced cannibalism in both carabid species and increased survival of carabid larvae in field plots, such that twice as many were captured in plots subsidised with pupae than plots with no alternative food. 6. These results provide new insight into the complex interactions that influence predator survival and herbivore suppression in resource diverse habitats by demonstrating the primacy of intraguild interactions among carabid larvae.","[Frank, Steven D.; Shrewsbury, Paula M.; Denno, Robert F.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Frank, SD (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol, Campus Box 7613, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",sdfrank@ncsu.edu,,,Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station,"S.

Five hypotheses were evaluated to explain why Z. mall had more impact on M. occidentalis in the field than on T. pyri. Given equal opportunity, Z. mall adult females did not consume more M. occidentalis eggs than T. pyri eggs nor did adult females of either phytoseiid inflict greater mortality on Z. mall eggs or larvae through attack or consumption. There was no difference in the within-tree association of Z. mall adult females with eggs of either phytoseiid species nor were there differences in the way prey mites (all life stages) were spatially partitioned between adult female Z. mall as compared with adults and deutonymphs (combined) of either phytoseiid. The foraging area of adult female Z. mali and the oviposition locations of the two phytoseiids from both field and laboratory data were compared using spatial statistics. Metaseiulus occidentalis laid significantly more eggs in the primary foraging area of adult female Z. mall than T. pyri. This was the only factor identified which may explain the greater impact of Z. mall on M. occidentalis.

This study aimed to investigate the trophic role of mesopelagic fish in the region of the southern Kerguelen Plateau, an area of known importance to an abundant and diverse community of marine predators. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to quantify the isotopic niches of key mesopelagic fish species (six from the family Myctophidae, and one from Bathylagidae), and assessed variation along the delta N-15 (resource use) and delta C-13 (carbon source) axes between species. The assemblage of key mesopelagic fish occupied similar isotopic niche space with overlap among species in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Baseline corrected delta N-15 values provided evidence of latitudinal trends in trophic position (TP). Trophic position estimates of taxa in the southern region of our study area spanned slightly less than 1 TP (mean TP 2.9-3.7); and 1 TP in the northern region (mean TP 3.2-4.2). We found evidence of trophic partitioning between species with differences in niche utilization (resource or habitat use). Factors reducing trophic competition include the relative importance of Euphausia superba as a prey item, vertical distribution of consumer and prey, and migratory behaviours. Size-based trophic structuring between species was evident with larger species displaying higher average delta N-15 values compared to smaller species. However, fish standard length explained little of the variation in delta N-15 values at the species level, suggesting within species changes in trophic position with body size is not a predominant driver of trophic structure in our study region. Overall, our analysis demonstrated the structural complexity and spatial variation of the food web in the region of the southern Kerguelen Plateau.","[Woods, Briannyn; Walters, Andrea; Hindell, Mark] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Trebilco, Rowan] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Private Bag 80, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Woods, B (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",bree.woods@utas.edu.au,"Trebilco, Rowan/I-5311-2012","Trebilco, Rowan/0000-0001-9712-8016; Woods, Briannyn/0000-0001-6735-3626; Walters, Andrea/0000-0002-7166-5689; Hindell, Mark/0000-0002-7823-7185","Australian Government under Cooperative Research Centre Program through the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC); Australian Government under Australian Antarctic Science ProgramAustralian Government [4343, 4344, 4347, 4366]; Australian Government under Australian Research Council's Special Research Initiative for Antarctic Gateway Partnership [SR140300001]","We thank the captain and crew of the R.

This is particularly important when trying to predict biological responses to rapid and extreme changes in environmental conditions. Our perception of community dynamics depends on the temporal and the spatial scales at which we make our observations and the taxonomic resolution we use. Thus, observations and empirical approaches that allow for variability in time and space of multiple, interacting drivers are essential to counteract the assumption that simple patterns of species' arrangement are driven by similarly simple processes. By altering the structure of resident communities, invasive species allow us to observe the development of new distributional equilibria and identify how variation in time and space of biotic and abiotic factors determines patterns of coexistence with native species. Here, we use the example of an invasive and an indigenous intertidal mussel to achieve this. We identify rather simple patterns of distribution of an exceptionally successful marine invasive species, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, in its distribution along the coast of South Africa, examining relevant processes at multiple scales. In particular, we draw together research on its coexistence with an indigenous mussel, Perna perna. Over the last 40 years, Mytilus galloprovincialis has spread along thousands of kilometres of the southern African coast. Mytilus galloprovincialis has now reached at least a temporary equilibrium in its eastern limit and in its pattern of coexistence with the native mussel Perna perna. We synthesize a comprehensive body of literature on these two species that addresses processes occurring from centimetres to thousands of kilometres and from minutes to evolutionary timescales to develop a more robust understanding of the relative contributions of the deterministic and stochastic processes that structure the dynamics of coexistence. The review shows that the development and maintenance of simple distributional patterns emerge from and are maintained by variations in multiple biotic and abiotic interactions that occur at different and sometimes-nested scales. These include species-specific effects of environmental factors, such as not only high temperatures, wave action, desiccation, and sand scour or sand burial but also biological effects such as predation, parasitism, larval supply, and recruitment. Importantly, abiotic conditions can modulate species interactions, including interference and exploitation competition, so that species-specific responses to environmental conditions are important. Viewed across the environmental gradient offered by the intertidal landscape, direct interactions include examples of initial facilitation followed by later competitive exclusion. Although in a state of flux at small scales, the present patterns of distribution and coexistence have been relatively stable at larger scales for decades and reflect place-specific balances among the interacting factors, with different factors assuming prominence in different places. Detailed observation and experimentation are necessary to avoid assuming that species' arrangements emerge from a single driver or a few simple drivers, and this has clear implications for attempts to predict species distributions under conditions of climate change. In addition, the same pattern can emerge for different reasons. For example, recruitment of both mussel species is weak in the high mussel zone, but for different reasons. For Perna perna, this is because of poor survival of few settlers, while for Mytilus galloprovincialis, it reflects good survival of few settlers. With so many interacting factors achieving fluctuating local balances, the surprise is not that the pattern is so clear, but that there is any pattern at all.","[McQuaid, Christopher D.; Porri, Francesca; Zardi, Gerardo I.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, Coastal Res Grp, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Porri, Francesca] SAIAB, Grahamstown, South Africa; [Nicastro, Katy R.] Univ Algarve, CCMAR, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal","McQuaid, CD (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, Coastal Res Grp, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",C.McQuaid@ru.ac.za,"McQuaid, Christopher/AAT-3725-2020; Nicastro, Katy R/ABI-1531-2020; Nicastro, Katy/AAY-3692-2021; Zardi, Gerardo/M-4026-2013; Porri, Francesca/M-4258-2017","McQuaid, Christopher/0000-0002-3473-8308; Nicastro, Katy R/0000-0002-7071-141X; Zardi, Gerardo/0000-0001-8798-5794; Porri, Francesca/0000-0001-8247-4506",,,,271,28,28,0,30,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,BOCA RATON,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",0078-3218,,978-1-4987-0545-5,OCEANOGR MAR BIOL,Oceanogr.

As a result, species interaction networks (e.g., interactions associated with predation or competition) may be altered in such a way as to bring about large changes in populations and/or communities that may further cascade to disrupt ecosystem function and services. Field studies and experimental outcomes as well as models indicate that indirect effects are most likely to occur in communities in which the strength of interactions and the sensitivity to contaminants differ markedly among species, and that indirect effects will vary over space and time as species composition, trophic structure, and environmental factors vary. However, knowledge of indirect effects is essential to improve understanding of the potential for chemical harm in natural systems. For example, indirect effects may confound laboratory-based ecological risk assessment by enhancing, masking, or spuriously indicating the direct effect of chemical contaminants. Progress to better anticipate and interpret the significance of indirect effects will be made as monitoring programs and long-term ecological research are conducted that facilitate critical experimental field and mesocosm investigations, and as chemical transport and fate models, individual-based direct effects models, and ecosystem/food web models continue to be improved and become better integrated.","[Fleeger, John W.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Fleeger, JW (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",zoflee@lsu.edu,,,,,,122,1,1,4,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,DEC,2020,8,12,,,,,,,1659,10.3390/pr8121659,,,18,"Engineering, Chemical",Engineering,PL4RH,WOS:000603110500001,,gold,,,2021-09-27,

Both direct and indirect effects can have strong fitness impacts on the native species and can result in cascading effects throughout the invaded community. Many exotic plant species escape from the herbivores with which they co-evolved, but in our study system, the exotic Egyptian alfalfa weevil (Hypera brunneipennis) has been introduced to California and is able to feed both on the exotic plant Medicago polymorpha and on the California native Lotus wrangelianus. Because these two plant species share this common herbivore, the possibility of strong herbivore-mediated indirect interactions between these introduced and native plant species is plausible. We used observational studies and manipulative field experiments to determine whether exotic Medicago affects herbivory on the native Lotus and whether Medicago reduces the fitness of Lotus through direct competitive effects and/or herbivore-mediated indirect effects. Both observational and experimental data indicate that Medicago increases weevil herbivory on the native Lotus. Additionally, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness through direct as well as indirect mechanisms. In 2002, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness even when herbivores were experimentally reduced, suggesting direct competitive effects of Medicago on the native Lotus. In contrast, in 2003, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness only in the presence of herbivores, indicating that the fitness effects in that year were largely indirect and mediated by herbivores. Our results demonstrate that the net fitness consequences of indirect and direct effects of exotic plant species on native plants can vary temporally, depending on the abundance of members of the herbivore community. Also, rather than limiting the success of exotics, introduced herbivores that feed on exotic plants may provide additional, indirect avenues through which exotic plants can reduce the fitness of native species.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Lau, JA (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, 1445 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",lauxx087@umn.edu,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085; Lau, Jennifer/0000-0002-8344-5421",,,,39,60,61,2,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2005,86,11,,,,,2990,2997,,10.1890/04-1779,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,986AB,WOS:000233419600015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Yet, the efficacy of this mechanism is inadequately tested. In this study, populations of different-sized guppies were exposed to individuals of two natural predatory species, the pike cichlid Crenicichla alta and the killifish Rivulus harti, under conditions of Varying prey (guppy) density and habitat complexity in the laboratory. Rivulus fed most frequently on newborn and juvenile guppies <14 mm SL. The mean guppy size consumed by Crenicichla increased with increasing predator length, although some large Crenicichla continued to feed on small guppies. Under test conditions that mimicked typical field conditions of habitat complexity and prey density, Crenicichla was a much more effective guppy predator than Rivulus. High habitat complexity and a shallow water refuge reduced Crenicichla predation rates from 10 to 3 guppies/day, but did not change prey-size selectivity. Rivulus predation rates never exceeded 1 guppy/day, regardless of habitat complexity. These data confirm results from a recent field investigation, but are inconsistent with the prevailing size-selective predation hypothesis regarding differences in life histories among Trinidadian guppy populations. An alternative hypothesis that incorporates differences in predation intensity among populations is supported.","OLD DOMINION UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI 4,NORFOLK,VA 23529","MATTINGLY, HT (corresponding author), UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE,112 STEPHENS HALL,COLUMBIA,MO 65211, USA.",,,,,,,45,71,73,2,43,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1994,69,1,,,,,54,64,,10.2307/3545283,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MR887,WOS:A1994MR88700006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Control with chemical insecticides often is ineffective because endophytic oviposition and the cryptic habits of the pest provide protection. In Uruguay, the biological control program of this pest in sweet pepper crops is at risk due to the low settlement rate and high dispersal of releases of predator Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae). Previous studies have ruled out an antibiosis effect as the cause of dispersal; therefore, we hypothesized antixenosis (non-preference) for the sweet pepper plants as the cause of poor biological control by O. insidiosus. The effect of olfactory stimuli from different structures of strawberry, corn, and sweet pepper plants (lamuyo and blocky type) on the behavior of O. insidiosus was evaluated in olfactometry and free-choice cage experiments. Since Orius tristicolor (White) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) occurs naturally in the area, it was included also in the study with the aim of assessing whether there are differences in behavior between the species. Orius tristicolor may act as a complementary biocontrol agent or competitor on sweet pepper. Y-tube experiments showed no preference for plant volatiles in any combination, and response to volatile stimuli generally was poor. However, in the free-choice cage experiment, females of both species of Orius preferred the flowering strawberry plants over the flowering sweet pepper plants, which could explain the low establishment of O. insidiosus when released on pepper with neighboring strawberry fields. Given that horticultural greenhouses in Uruguay and in many other countries are open, this information can be very useful in designing the spatial and temporal management of different crops on a production field, which enhances the effectiveness of these predatory species.","[Lorenzo, Maria E.; Mendez, Luciana] Univ Republ, Fac Agron, Dept Protecc Vegetal, Salto 50000, Uruguay; [Bao, Leticia; Grille, Gabriela; Basso, Cesar] Univ Republica, Fac Agron, Dept Protecc Vegetal, Unidad Entomol, Montevideo 12900, Uruguay; [Bonato, Olivier] Univ Montpellier, Interact Plantes Microorganismes Environm, IRD Cirad, Montpellier, France","Lorenzo, ME (corresponding author), Univ Republ, Fac Agron, Dept Protecc Vegetal, Salto 50000, Uruguay.",meugenialorenzo@gmail.com; baoleticia@gmail.com; lmendezds@gmail.com; ggrille@vera.com.uy; olivier.bonato@ird.fr; cbasso.bis@gmail.com,,,"National Research and Innovation Institute; Experimental Station of the School of Agronomy, University of the Republic in Salto, Uruguay","We wish to thank the National Research and Innovation Institute and the Experimental Station of the School of Agronomy, University of the Republic in Salto, Uruguay, which provided their facilities and economic support for the study.",,79,0,0,2,2,FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC,LUTZ,"16125 E LAKE BURRELL DR, LUTZ, FL 33548 USA",0015-4040,1938-5102,,FLA ENTOMOL,Fla.

However, severe declines in diadromous fish populations in the nearshore Gulf of Maine (GOM) have impacted trophic dynamics and increased pressure on other estuarine-dependent forage resources. The objective of this study was to compare the trophic positions and interspecific interactions of diadromous fishes as predators and prey in relation to current GOM forage fishes. Empirical biomass data along with diet compositions and vital rates were used to construct a static model of a representative GOM coastal food web: the Saco River estuary (SRE) in Maine. A series of sensitivity analyses based on model outputs was performed to determine the trophic role of diadromous fishes in this estuarine food web. Model results suggested that juvenile marine transients played a greater role as forage species for SRE predators than did the anadromous Blueback Herring Alosa aestivalis and Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. Due to the abundant forage fish base, Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus and Shortnose Sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum were estimated to have a greater trophic position than reported in past literature. Lower-trophic-level fishes functioned as keystone prey species for sturgeon. The use of holistic approaches to update the ecological data on predator-prey interactions among diadromous fishes and forage resources within coastal ecosystems is necessary for the future management of these ecologically significant and threatened species.","[Smith, Kayla M.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Sci, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Byron, Carrie J.; Sulikowski, James A.] Univ New England, Dept Marine Sci, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA","Smith, KM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Sci, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",kmsmi100@syr.edu,"Byron, Carrie J/B-6606-2014","Byron, Carrie J/0000-0003-3820-7392","NOAA Species of Concern Research Program; NOAA Section 6 Research Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS-0904155, DGE-0841361]","We thank the graduate and undergraduate students of the Sulikowski and Byron laboratories at the Marine Science Center (MSC), University of New England (UNE).

These larvae are exposed to severe abiotic conditions (e.g., food limitation, low dissolved oxygen levels, risk of desiccation), and multiple cohorts are frequently found in the same container. To test for cannibalism and interactions among cohorts in two phytotelm-dwelling arturan larvae (Mantidactylus bicalcaratus and M. punctatus) from Madagascar, I reared larvae in experimental microcosms. Larvae of both species had significantly faster growth rates in a high detritus treatment compared to the control (P < 0.0001). The experimental evidence also demonstrated that the larvae of these two species display no cannibalistic behavior, regardless of multiple cohorts, sibling relationships, density, or food and water levels. These data indicate that larvae of both species obtain most or all of their nutrition from eating detritus and the organisms associated with detritus. In M. punctatus, experiments with multiple cohorts indicate that competition for food is strongest within, not among, cohorts, and I found no evidence for a priority effect. Relatively low stage-specific mortality, along with a prolonged breeding season, philopatry, and a lack of predatory behavior, may explain why cannibalistic behavior has not evolved in these species.","Univ Michigan, Museum Zool, Div Reptiles & Amphibians, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lehtinen, RM (corresponding author), Coll Wooster, Dept Biol, 931 Coll Mall, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.",rlehtinen@wooster.edu,,,,,,59,24,25,0,21,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,LAWRENCE,"C/O ALLEN PRESS, PO BOX 7065, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0018-0831,1938-5099,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,MAR,2004,60,1,,,,,1,13,,10.1655/02-88,,,13,Zoology,Zoology,774HQ,WOS:000188974400001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Physical transport by advection can regulate the distance travelled and rate of propagule supply to a habitat but post-settlement processes such as predation can decouple supply from recruitment. The effect of flow-mediated recruitment and predation on the recruitment success of an intertidal species, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica was evaluated in two-replicated field experiments. Two key crab species were manipulated to test predator identity effects on oyster mortality. Findings: Recruitment was similar to 58% higher in high flow compared to low flow, but predation masked those differences. Predation mortality was primarily attributed to the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, whilst the mud crab Panopeus herbstii had no effect on recruit mortality. Recruit mortality from predation was high when recruit densities were high, but when recruit density was low, predation effects were not seen. Under high recruitment (supply), predation determined maximum population size and in low flow environments, recruitment success is likely determined by a combination of recruitment and resource limitation but not predation. Conclusions: Four processes are demonstrated: (1) Increases in flow rate positively affect recruitment success; (2) In high flow (recruitment) environments, resource availability is less important than predation; (3) predation is an important source of recruit mortality, but is dependent upon recruit density; and (4) recruitment and/or resource limitation is likely a major driver of population structure and functioning, modifying the interaction between predators and prey. Simultaneous testing of flow-mediated recruitment and predation was required to differentiate between the role of each process in determining population size.

We examined how these factors and their interactions affected mass at metamorphosis, length of larval period, growth rate, and survival. These experiments demonstrated the effect of body size on predator-prey interactions by manipulating time of introduction of size-structured prey in a system with a gape-limited predator. Microhabitat differences in primary productivity, sources of predation other than salamanders, and abiotic factors were important determinants of community structure. High levels of salamander predation negatively affected tadpole survival, but affected no other response variable. We detected no density-dependent effects in either taxon. Tadpoles in the early treatment had longer larval periods and lower survival rates than those in the late treatment. Interactions of factors, including time of introduction, were common. Biotic and abiotic factors differentially affecting growth of predator or prey appear to be responsible for these differences. Priority effects in arrival to breeding sites, or climatic events affecting the growth rate of predator, prey, or both, play a role in determining community structure. Interactions of factors complicate the predator-prey relationship. In our experiment, the effects of time of introduction are highly correlated with body size in the two temporal treatments. Our results indicate that more realistic models of predator-prey systems, or population dynamics, should incorporate size structure of predator and prey.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287; ARIZONA GAME & FISH DEPT,NONGAME BRANCH,2221 W GREENWAY RD,PHOENIX,AZ 85023",,,,,,,,45,22,24,0,15,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1991,72,6,,,,,2232,2239,,10.2307/1941573,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV769,WOS:A1991GV76900029,,,,,2021-09-27,

Previous studies revealed that A. macrophthalmus is able to host-shift to several mimosoid species. Here, we aim to test the host-shift potential to other mimosoid and non-mimosoid plants and possible roles of interspecific competition, genetic background, and plant chemistry in host-shift. First, we found that A. macrophthalmus predator completed development on two new hosts: pigeon pea Cajanus cajan and Cajanus scarabaeoides (Faboideae), by rearing from seeds collected in South/Southeast Asia and Hawaii. In contrast, in most regions, both Cajanus species were infested only by other beetle species. Second, we performed no-choice tests using 11 leguminous plants, covering all three subfamilies as potential hosts, including the two new hosts. A Taiwanese A. macrophthalmus population reared in the laboratory on Leucaena did not deposit eggs on any of the seeds of each tested species. To compare host-shift responses between populations, we also used a Hawaiian A. macrophthalmus population that had completed its development on freshly collected Leucaena seeds from the field. This population deposited eggs onto and hatching larvae burrowed into C. cajan seeds, although none developed beyond the larval stage. Third, the surface chemical composition of seed-pods of L. leucocephala and the two Cajanus species was dissimilar, although that of seeds was highly similar. Finally, all of the host-shifting A. macrophthalmus populations shared the same haplotypic group.","[Tuda, M.] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Inst Biol Control, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wu, L. -H.; Wu, W. -J.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Entomol, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Yamada, N.; Kagoshima, K.] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wang, C. -P.] Council Agr, Taiwan Forestry Res Inst, Silviculture Div, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Buranapanichpan, S.] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Chen, Z. -Q.] Yunnan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Teramoto, K.

However, effects of habitat loss and fragmentation are typically confounded during disturbance events, and previous attempts to determine their relative significance have proved ineffective. Here we experimentally manipulated live coral habitats to examine the potential independent and interactive effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on survival, abundance, and species richness of recruitment-stage, coral-associated reef fishes. Loss of 75% of live coral from experimental reefs resulted in low survival of a coral-associated damselfish and low abundance and richness of other recruits 16 weeks after habitat manipulations. In contrast, fragmentation had positive effects on damselfish survival and resulted in greater abundance and species richness of other recruits. We hypothesize that spacing of habitat through fragmentation weakens competition within and among species. Comparison of effect sizes over the course of the study period revealed that, in the first six weeks following habitat manipulations, the positive effects of fragmentation were at least four times stronger than the effects of habitat loss. This initial positive effect of fragmentation attenuated considerably after 16 weeks, whereas the negative effects of habitat loss increased in strength over time. There was little indication that the amount of habitat influenced the magnitude of the habitat fragmentation effect. Numerous studies have reported dramatic declines in coral reef fish abundance and diversity in response to disturbances that cause the loss and fragmentation of coral habitats. Our results suggest that these declines occur as a result of habitat loss, not habitat fragmentation. Positive fragmentation effects may actually buffer against the negative effects of habitat loss and contribute to the resistance of reef fish populations to declines in coral cover.","[Bonin, Mary C.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Bonin, MC (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mary.bonin@jcu.edu.au,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Bonin, Mary/H-3433-2012","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Bonin, Mary/0000-0001-7249-0887",James Cook University; School of Marine and Tropical Biology; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council,"We are grateful to M.

However, little attention has been devoted to exploring the factors regulating zebra mussel density and population size structure at the local scale. We tested effects of physicochemical factors and fish predation on the density of zebra mussels at several sites and between years in a natural lake. Water depth and roach (Rutilus rutilus) density were the most important variables affecting local zebra mussel density. Substrate was also an important factor but affected Dreissena density only at the shallowest depth examined (2 m), which also supported a large population of the mussels. Mean shell length of Dreissena increased with water depth. Our results indicate that predation pressure, intraspecific competition, and food limitation might be responsible for variation in zebra mussel density and population size structure in space and time and that fish predation might have strong top-down effects on zebra mussel populations.","[Naddafi, Rahmat; Pettersson, Kurt; Eklov, Peter] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut Limnol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Naddafi, R (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, 106 Rice Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",rn99@cornell.edu; kurt.pettersson@ebc.uu.se; peter.eklov@ebc.uu.se,,,"Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Malmens Foundation; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Science, and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas","We are grateful to Anna Gustafsson, Bjorn Mattsson, and Nazi la H.

Highly aggressive invaders can out-compete native species for resources, while social gregarious invaders can tolerate high conspecific density. In order to tease apart the effects of aggressive versus social tendencies on the success of invasive species, we studied round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a highly successful invasive fish species now common in the Laurentian Great Lakes. While round goby are well known for being aggressive, much less is known about their tendency to affiliate with conspecifics, in spite of the fact that they thrive in extremely high densities in many of their invaded habitats. We collected round goby from Hamilton Harbour, ON, Canada and conducted three separate experiments to explore group-forming behaviour by measuring preference for conspecifics. We found that round goby have a strong preference to associate with a single conspecific, and that both males and females showed this preference. No overall preference was detected for large versus small groups of conspecifics. Females chose the safety of a shelter over associating with a conspecific but males were equally attracted to conspecifics as shelter. Our results provide new insight into how interactions between aggressive and social behaviours play a role in the rapid spread of invasive round goby.","[Capelle, Pauline M.; McCallum, Erin S.; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada","McCallum, ES (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",mccalles@mcmaster.ca,"McCallum, Erin/AAJ-4052-2020","McCallum, Erin/0000-0001-5426-9652",Ontario Graduate ScholarshipOntario Graduate Scholarship; McMaster Work study program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"The first two authors contributed equally to this manuscript.

Among the crustacean plankton, calanoid and cyclopoid cope pods were abundant, but Daphnia 'longispina' reached the highest densities in this experiment. The colonial rotifer Conochilus unicornis was not affected by crustacean plankton. The two most abundant species, Synchaeta pectinata and Keratella cochlearis, increased exponentially when macrozooplankton had been excluded from the enclosures, but did not increase when crustaceans were present. Birth and death rates of K. cochlearis could be reliably determined in this field experiment, suggesting that this rotifer species was mainly controlled by exploitative competition rather than by mechanical interference or predation. Daphnia 'longispina' generally grazed selectively on the smaller ciliates and algae, thus depriving the rotifers of their phytoplankton resources. ?he dominant alga, the chrysophycean Dinobryon, increased, whether crustaceans were present or not, but appeared to be grazed upon to a certain extent despite its considerable cell size and colonial organization.",,"Fussmann, G (corresponding author), MAX PLANCK INST LIMNOL,POSTFACH 165,D-24302 PLON,GERMANY.",,,"Fussmann, Gregor/0000-0001-9576-0122",,,,53,49,54,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0142-7873,,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

A criticism of the dilution effect is that increasing host species richness might amplify disease risk, assuming that total host abundance, and therefore feeding opportunities for ticks, increase with species richness. In contrast, a dilution effect is expected when poor quality hosts for ticks and pathogens (dilution hosts) divert tick blood meals away from competent hosts. Even if host densities are additive, the relationship between host density and tick encounters can be nonlinear if the number of ticks that encounter a host is a saturating function of host density, which occurs if ticks aggregate on the remaining hosts rather than failing to find a host before death. Both dilution and amplification are theoretical possibilities, and assessing which is more prevalent required detailed analyses of empirical systems. We used field data to explore the degree of tick redistribution onto fewer individuals with variation in intraspecific host density and novel data-driven models for tick dynamics to determine how changes in vertebrate community composition influence the density of nymphs infected with the Lyme bacterium. To be conservative, we allowed total host density to increase additively with species richness. Our long-term field studies found that larval and nymphal ticks redistribute onto fewer individuals as host densities decline, that a large proportion of nymphs and adults find hosts, and that mice and chipmunks feed a large proportion of nymphs. White-footed mice, eastern chipmunks, short-tailed shrews, and masked shrews were important amplification hosts that greatly increased the density of infected nymphs. Gray squirrels and Virginia opossums were important dilution hosts. Removing these two species increased the maximum number of larvae attached to amplification hosts by 57%. Raccoons and birds were minor dilution hosts under some conditions. Even under the assumption of additive community assembly, some species are likely to reduce the density of infected nymphs as diversity increases. If the assumption of additivity is relaxed, then species that reduce the density of small mammals through predation or competition might substantially reduce disease risk.","[Levi, Taal] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Keesing, Felicia] Bard Coll, Dept Biol, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA; [Holt, Robert D.; Barfield, Michael] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ostfeld, Richard S.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Levi, T (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",taal.levi@oregonstate.edu,,"Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301","NSF PRFB; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0949702, EF 0813035]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; Dutchess County, NY; University of Florida FoundationUniversity of Florida","We thank the many field assistants for all their hard work in gathering data for this study over many years.

They also have the potential for reciprocal interactions when colocated, through a wide variety of potential mechanisms involving different directions in effect. Pathways mediated by biogenic structure could be facilitative through protection from predation or bioturbators, or by harboring beneficial interactors, or alternatively could result in competition for space or reduced food supply. Other pathways mediated by biological activity could positively link autotrophic roles of seagrass and heterotrophic roles of bivalves, but excessive organic matter production or nutrient release could be damaging. Published studies were compiled for a meta-analysis of field experiments testing bivalve response to seagrass (25 studies) and vice versa (11 studies), as well as for surveys of bivalves in and out of seagrass (39 studies). In experiments, seagrass improved bivalve survival, and bivalves at high cover reduced seagrass density, but seven other response metrics showed no consistent change. In surveys of particular bivalve species, densities were 1.6 times higher in seagrass than out of seagrass. This augmentation did not differ by body size but was especially pronounced in some functional groups, especially lucinid and solemyid bivalves harboring sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Weak overall directional effects of colocation of seagrass and bivalves reflect weak effects in some individual studies, for instance because of low densities in soft-sediment systems, as well as strong but inconsistent effects because different pathways of interaction dominate. Therefore, generalizations about the outcome of interactions between these two ecosystem engineers when they are colocated cannot be made, although coexistence is typically enabled by weak or positive interactions. Further work is needed, especially outside of some well-studied regions, to explore the specific mechanisms and spatiotemporal scales enabling seagrasses and bivalves to coexist because there are many pathways at work.","[Fales, Robin J.; Boardman, Fiona C.; Ruesink, Jennifer L.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, POB 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Fales, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, POB 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",rjfales@uw.edu,,,,,,64,1,1,3,4,NATL SHELLFISHERIES ASSOC,GROTON,"C/O DR.

Fluctuations in natural environmental conditions are ubiquitous and include for example variation in intensity and duration of temperature, droughts, parasite loads, and availability of nutrients, predators and competitors. The frequency and amplitude of many of these fluctuations are expected to increase with climate change. Tolerance curves are often used to describe fitness components across environmental gradients.

In this perspective we briefly list theoretical and experimental evidence why results obtained under constant environmental conditions might be misleading for processes in nature and therefore may not be suitable for predicting fitness and future species distribution and abundance.

Previous studies have shown that these spiders are essentially ecological equivalents with respect to activity, web-site characteristics and prey capture and that each species preys on the others. This type of predatory interaction between potential competitors is referred to as intraguild predation. We performed removal experiments to determine the significance of intraguild predation for each of the species as predators and as prey. Three types of treatment plots were established: from each plot two of the three study species were removed (weekly, July-October 1993) and the third remained. Control plots were established from which no spiders were removed. We predicted that if the treatments resulted in removal of an important source of prey then: 1) the number of individuals of the remaining species should decline over time as a result of web-relocation, and 2) body condition of spiders remaining should be lower in the treatments than in the controls. If treatments had the effect of removing predation then the number of individuals remaining in treatment plots should increase relative to the controls where intraguild predation could occur. There were no significant differences in the number of spiders of the remaining species on treatment versus control plots, indicating that the treatment did not result in spider relocation as a response to potential food removal. However, at the end of the experiment body condition of H. thorelli was significantly lower on plots from which the other two species were removed than on control plots. This suggests that removal of the other two species may have resulted in removal of a significant source of prey for H. thorelli. In addition, we present evidence that treatments may have removed a source of predation on dispersing A. tepidariorum spiderlings.",,"Hodge, MA (corresponding author), COLL WOOSTER,DEPT BIOL,WOOSTER,OH 44691, USA.",,,,,,,31,11,12,0,7,AMER ARACHNOLOGICAL SOC,NEW YORK,"C/O NORMAN I PLATNICK, AMER MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, CENTRAL PK WEST AT 79TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10024",0161-8202,,,J ARACHNOL,J.

This may be a single species or a few clones with large body size: a cladoceran such as Daphnia pulicaria, or a branchiopod such as Artemia franciscana, each building its population to a density far higher than those found in habitats with fish. The example of zooplankton from two different fish-free habitats demonstrates the overpowering force of fish predation by highlighting the consequences of its absence. Released from the mortality caused by predation, a population of a superior competitor remains at a density equal to the carrying capacity of its habitat, in a steady state with its food resources, consisting of small green flagellate algae, which are successful in compensating high loss rates due to grazing, by fast growth. In such a situation, the high filtering rate of Daphnia or Artemia reduces resources to levels that are sufficient for assimilation to cover the costs of respiration (threshold food concentration) in adults but not in juveniles. This implies long periods of persistence of adults refraining from producing live young, because production of instantly hatching eggs would be maladaptive. Severe competition for limiting resources imposes a strong selective pressure for postponing reproduction or for producing resting eggs until food levels have increased. Offspring can only survive when born in a short time window between such an increase in food levels and its subsequent decline resulting from population growth and intense grazing by juveniles. Such zooplanktons become not only a single-species community, but also form a single cohort with a long-lifespan population. The observations support the notion that diversity may be sustained only where predation keeps densities of coexisting species at levels much below the carrying capacity, as suggested by Hutchinson 50 years ago.","[Gliwicz, Z.

We examined the potential role of elevated yolk testosterone in eggs of the principal brood parasite in North America, the brown-headed cowbird, and three of its frequent host species. Elevated maternal androgens in eggs are a common maternal effect observed in many avian species when breeding conditions are unfavorable. These steroids accelerate embryo development, shorten incubation period, increase nestling growth rate, and enhance begging vigor, all traits that can increase the survival of offspring. We hypothesized that elevated maternal androgens in host eggs are a defense against brood parasitism. Our second hypothesis was that elevated maternal androgens in cowbird eggs are a defense against intra-specific competition. For host species, we found that elevated yolk testosterone was correlated with parasitized nests of small species, those whose nest success is most reduced by cowbird parasitism. For cowbirds, we found that elevated yolk testosterone was correlated with eggs in multiply-parasitized nests, which indicate intra-specific competition for nests due to high cowbird density. We propose experimental work to further examine the use of maternal effects by cowbirds and their hosts. Published by Elsevier Inc.","[Hahn, D.

This species is considered the main vector of the chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses and causes major public health issues. The aim of this study is to investigate the relative influence of biotic and abiotic parameters on immature populations of Ae. aegypti. During a one-year-long field experiment, we monitored 108 macroinvertebrate aquatic communities inhabiting four types of water containers across three different urbanized sites in a Neotropical city. A multimodel inference approach revealed that, in addition to abiotic parameters, biotic interactions with aquatic organisms had an important influence on the abundance of Ae. aegypti and that the urbanized site considered influences the outcomes of the interactions. Controphic species other than mosquitoes aided Ae. aegypti development, suggesting a mechanism of facilitation through a chain of processes. However, the abundance of Ae. aegypti was lowered by competition with native mosquito species in the slightly urbanized area and by predation in more urbanized areas. Competitive displacement and reduction, as well as predation by native aquatic organisms, can be considered a form of ecosystem service. The conservation and/or augmentation of natural enemies should improve the short- and long-term success of incompatible and/or sterile insect techniques, thus opening up perspectives for the future of mosquito management.","[Talaga, Stanislas] Inst Pasteur, Vectopole Amazonien Emile Abonnenc, Cayenne, French Guiana; [Dejean, Alain; Azemar, Frederic] Univ Toulouse, Ecolab, CNRS, INPT,UPS, Toulouse, France; [Dejean, Alain; Leroy, Celine] Univ Guyane, Univ Antilles, AgroParisTech, UMR EcoFoG,CIRAD,CNRS,INRAE, Kourou, French Guiana; [Dumont, Yves] CIRAD, UMR AMAP, St Pierre, La Reunion, France; [Dumont, Yves; Leroy, Celine] Univ Montpellier, UMR AMAP, CIRAD, CNRS,INRAE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Dumont, Yves] Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, Pretoria, South Africa","Talaga, S (corresponding author), Inst Pasteur, Vectopole Amazonien Emile Abonnenc, Cayenne, French Guiana.",stanislas.talaga@gmail.com; alain.dejean@wanadoo.fr; frederic.azemar1@univ-tlse3.fr; yves.dumont@cirad.fr; celine.leroy@ird.fr,"Dumont, Yves/O-3801-2017","Dumont, Yves/0000-0003-4817-685X; Azemar, Frederic/0000-0002-3098-8676; Dejean, Alain/0000-0002-3561-2248; Talaga, Stanislas/0000-0003-1591-4115",`Investissement d'Avenir' grant by the French National Research Agency (CEBA)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-25-01],"We are grateful to Andrea Yockey for proofreading the manuscript and to the municipality of Kourou (through the Service Departemental de Desinfection) for permitting us to work inside the city limits.

The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that specialist natural enemies, such as herbivores and pathogens, maintain diversity in plant communities by reducing survival rates of conspecific seeds and seedlings located close to reproductive adults or in areas of high conspecific density. Variation in the strength of distance- and density-dependent effects is hypothesized to explain variation in plant species richness along climatic gradients, with effects predicted to be stronger in the tropics than the temperate zone and in wetter habitats compared to drier habitats. 2. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify peer-reviewed experimental studies published in the 40+ years since the hypothesis was first proposed. Using data from these studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the current weight of evidence for the distance and density predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. 3. Overall, we found significant support for both the distance- and density-dependent predictions. For all studies combined, survival rates were significantly reduced near conspecifics compared to far from conspecifics, and in areas with high densities of conspecifics compared to areas with low conspecific densities. There was no indication that these results were due to publication bias. 4. The strength of distance and density effects varied widely among studies. Contrary to expectations, this variation was unrelated to latitude, and there was no significant effect of study region. However, we did find a trend for stronger distance and density dependence in wetter sites compared to sites with lower annual precipitation. In addition, effects were significantly stronger at the seedling stage compared to the seed stage. 5. Synthesis. Our study provides support for the idea that distance- and density-dependent mortality occurs in plant communities world-wide. Available evidence suggests that natural enemies are frequently the cause of such patterns, consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, but additional studies are needed to rule out other mechanisms (e.g. intraspecific competition). With the widespread existence of density and distance dependence clearly established, future research should focus on assessing the degree to which these effects permit species coexistence and contribute to the maintenance of diversity in plant communities.","[Comita, Liza S.; Queenborough, Simon A.; Murphy, Stephen J.; Eck, Jenalle L.; Xu, Kaiyang; Krishnadas, Meghna] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Comita, Liza S.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Beckman, Noelle] Ohio State Univ, Math Biosci Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Zhu, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Comita, LS (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",liza.comita@yale.edu,"Beckman, Noelle/E-5554-2011","Beckman, Noelle/0000-0001-5822-0610",,,,65,326,338,11,428,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

(Diptera: Culicidae) may affect the resulting adult densities and, hence, the risk of malaria. We investigated the impact of the presence of a fourth-instar larva (An. gambiae Giles s.s. or An. arabiensis Patton), the quantity of food, and the available space on the survival and development of freshly hatched larvae of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis. To analyse the results, two proportional hazard models were constructed. The first estimated the effects of all covariates on mortality rate and the second estimated the effects of the covariates on development rate into the third larval instar (L3). A time-dependent covariate for density, which changed during the experiment as a result of death or development to L3, was included in both models. In the presence of a fourth-instar larva (L4), survival of the experimental larvae was significantly reduced, but no difference was detected between the presence of L4 An. gambiae and L4 An. arabiensis. The observation that the majority of dead larvae were not recovered in trays with an L4 present suggested that cannibalism and predation occurred readily. Limitation in space significantly increased mortality of larvae, whereas a limitation of food reduced larval development rate, but did not cause mortality per se. From this, we concluded that both cannibalism and predation were enhanced as a result of more frequent interactions within smaller environments, but did not occur for reasons of food shortage. This study shows that inter- and intraspecific interactions among larvae of the An. gambiae complex strongly affect survival and development, and that the quantity of food and the available space are important determinants of the outcome of these interactions. Implications of the results are discussed with respect to the population dynamics of both malaria vectors in the field.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands","Koenraadt, CJM (corresponding author), AFRIMS Entomol Lab, 2 Soi 15,Rachdamnoen Rd 1, Kamphaeng Phet 62000, Thailand.",cjmkoenraadt@ucdavis.edu,,"Koenraadt, Constantianus/0000-0001-7861-8781; Hemerik, Lia/0000-0002-6892-2840",,,,47,39,40,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

How will such losses affect the ecosystem and the coupled biogeochemical cycles? Here, we couch this question in terms of ecological redundancy (will other species be able to fill the ecological roles of the extinct species) and biogeochemical redundancy (can other species replace their biogeochemical roles). Prior laboratory and field studies point to a spectrum in the degree of redundancy. We use a global three-dimensional computer model with diverse planktonic communities to explore these questions further. The model includes 35 phytoplankton types that differ in size, biogeochemical function and trophic strategy. We run two series of experiments in which single phytoplankton types are either partially or fully eliminated. The niches of the targeted types were not completely reoccupied, often with a reduction in the transfer of matter from autotrophs to heterotrophs. Primary production was often decreased, but sometimes increased due to reduction in grazing pressure. Complex trophic interactions (such as a decrease in the stocks of a predator's grazer) led to unexpected reshuffling of the community structure. Alterations in resource utilization may cause impacts beyond the regions where the type went extinct. Our results suggest a lack of redundancy, especially in the 'knock on' effects on higher trophic levels. Redundancy appeared lowest for types on the edges of trait space (e.g. smallest) or with unique competitive strategies. Though highly idealized, our modelling findings suggest that the results from laboratory or field studies often do not adequately capture the ramifications of functional redundancy. The modelled, often counterintuitive, responses-via complex food web interactions and bottom-up versus top-down controls-indicate that changes in planktonic community will be key determinants of future ocean global change ecology and biogeochemistry.","[Dutkiewicz, Stephanie] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 54-1514 MIT,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dutkiewicz, Stephanie] MIT, Ctr Global Change Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Boyd, Philip W.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Riebesell, Ulf] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany","Dutkiewicz, S (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 54-1514 MIT,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",stephd@mit.edu,"Boyd, Philip/J-7624-2014","Boyd, Philip/0000-0001-7850-1911",NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC17K0561] Funding Source: Medline; Simons Foundation [549931] Funding Source: Medline; Intramural NASA [80NSSC17K0561] Funding Source: Medline; Laureate [FL160100131] Funding Source: Medline,,,89,2,2,6,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

I studied the contribution of predation to mortality in populations of a potentially dominant, habitat-modifying mussel (Musculista senhousia) which has been introduced from Asia to California. In short-term (2 to 4 wk) experiments performed in San Diego Bay, a muricid snail (Pteropurpura festiva) decimated transplanted mussel populations by up to 65% within 2 wk. Crustacean predators were responsible for mortality rates of <4 %. The experimental removal of byssal cocoons in M, senhousia did not increase the susceptibility of the mussel to predation compared to unmanipulated individuals. In all experiments, predation was more intense inside an eelgrass (Zostera marina) bed compared to either unvegetated clearings or to sand flats adjacent to the eelgrass bed. In a 4 mo predator exclusion experiment, mussel numbers were reduced by 95 % in the eelgrass compared to a decimation of only 36 and 50 % on the unvegetated sand flat above and below the Z, marina bed, respectively. An aquarium experiment revealed that P, festiva favored M. senhousia over an abundant native clam in San Diego Bay, Chione undatella.

In particular, we examined the effectiveness of protection for aphids as related to ant activities on a plant. The number of attacks on a ladybeetle larva by ants until the ladybeetle larva dropped from the plant did not differ between the two ant species, suggesting similar aggressiveness of the two ant species. However, the number of attacks per min by L. niger was five times greater than that by T caespitum. Consequently, the residence time of the ladybeetle larva was shorter and the proportion of aphids eaten was lower in the presence of L. niger than in the presence of T. caespitum. Thus, the encounter rate between ants and predators is one of the most important factors for bodyguard effects on aphids, resulting from the markedly different foraging behaviors of the two ant species.","Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biol Sci, Saga 8408502, Japan","Katayama, N (corresponding author), Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biol Sci, Saga 8408502, Japan.",kd13052@edu.cc.saga-u.ac.jp,,,,,,34,35,38,2,23,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0003-6862,1347-605X,,APPL ENTOMOL ZOOL,Appl.

Giving-up densities (GUD) of seeds were used to measure the foraging activity of the three most common small mammals at the site: degu (Octodon degus), Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), and the olivaceous field mouse (Akodon olivaceus), under shrubs (cover) and in the open on predator-excluded and competitor-excluded (Octodon) plots. Experiments were conducted during both new and full moons. Monthly small-mammal censuses using standard mark-recapture techniques provided data on movement, reproduction, and long-term fluctuations in density between 1989 and 1994. Diurnal Octodon foraged more (had lower GUD-) in the absence of predators (although this was confounded by a numerical, increase resulting from predator exclusion), and foraged more under shrubs than, in the open. However, the lack of a significant cover x predator exclusion interaction and thermoregulation studies suggest that physiological constraints play,a greater role than predation risk in determining micro-habitat selection by Octodon. Predation risk, as influenced by lunar light levels and predator exclusion, had only weak effects on micro-habitat selection by Phyllotis. The strong tendency of Octodon to forage under cover could depress food availability, forcing Phyllotis to feed more in the open. Concomitantly, Phyllotis exhibits several morphological characters that would favor detection and avoidance of predators. There is extensive evidence that interspecific competition is the primary constraint on Akodon foraging; predation risk appears to be relatively unimportant. Akodon is also a less efficient forager than the two other species, having significantly higher GUD, on average. This is partially offset by differences in reproductive biology; Akodon exhibits extremely rapid. demographic responses to favorable changes in the environment. A fourth species, Abrothrix longipilis, may coexist in the system because of its opportunistic nature, but no data are available on its foraging efficiency. These behavioral and biotic interactions occur within a background of periodic El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO), which may ultimately contribute to species coexistence.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Sci Biol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile","Yunger, JA (corresponding author), Governors State Univ, Environm Biol Program, University Pk, IL 60466 USA.",J-Yunger@govst.edu,,,,,,73,49,49,1,80,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Many empirical tests assume that the interference among animals is independent of density and do not quantify the effects of density on fitness traits. Using two species of predatory mites, we measured oviposition as a function of conspecific density. Subsequently, we used these functions to calculate expected distributions on two connected patches. We performed an experimental test of the distributions of mites on two such connected patches, among which one had a food accessibility rate that was twice as high as on the other. For one of the two species, Iphiseius degenerans, the distribution matched the expected distribution. The distribution also coincided with the ratio of food accessibility. The other species, Neoseiulus cucumeris, distributed itself differently than expected. However, the oviposition rates of both species did not differ significantly from the expected oviposition rates based on experiments on single patches. This suggests that the oviposition rate of N. cucumeris was not negatively affected by the observed distribution, despite the fact that N. cucumeris did not match the predicted distributions. Thus, the distribution of one mite species, I. degenerans, was in agreement with IFD theory, whereas for the other mite species, N. cucumeris, unknown factors may have influenced the distribution of the mites. We conclude that density-dependent fitness traits provide essential information for explaining animal distributions.","[van der Hammen, Tessa; Montserrat, Marta; Sabelis, Maurice W.; de Roos, Andre M.; Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, IBED, Amsterdam, Netherlands","van der Hammen, T (corresponding author), IMARES Wageningen UR, Inst Marine Resources & Ecosyst Studies, POB 68, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands.",tessa.vanderhammen@wur.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; De Roos, Andre M./A-1590-2008; Montserrat, Marta/A-7625-2012","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; De Roos, Andre M./0000-0002-6944-2048; Montserrat, Marta/0000-0002-6859-4955","ALW from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [813.04.011, 814.01.006]","Martijn Egas, Nicola Tien, Roos van Maanen, and Paulien de Bruijn are thanked for valuable discussions.

This study uses descriptive data to examine the shift in dominance in the rotifer community in summer from Keratella cochlearis to Anuraeopsis fissa in a shallow eutrophic lake. Population density and egg ratio were estimated from May to September for these small loricate rotifers, as well as the soft-bodied Filinia longiseta and Polyarthra spp., to compare rates of population increase, birth and death. 2. Keratella cochlearis was succeeded by A. fissa in late May, perhaps as a result of the shorter egg development times of the latter at temperatures > 15 degrees C, and species-specific responses to food and predation. Population variables suggest that the decline of K. cochlearis was the result of a food shortage which caused a decrease in reproduction and increased mortality. 3. High population densities of A. fissa and Polyarthra spp. were associated with low egg ratios, birth rates and rates of increase within a species, suggesting intraspecific competition. The egg ratios of the two soft-bodied rotifers were strongly intercorrelated in the study period, although their diets supposedly differ. The egg ratios of A. fissa showed positively correlated fluctuations with the abundance of diatoms. 4. Short periods of higher rates of increase of A. fissa conferred advantage to this rotifer and manifested in its dominance. The mean birth rates of A. fissa and F. longiseta were twice as high as for K. cochlearis. Furthermore, death rates of loricate and soft-bodied rotifers were similar and high, which suggests that food shortage similarly increased death rates, or that predation may be sometimes substantial for soft-bodied and loricate species, or both. 5. Predation was probably not an important factor in steering the seasonal succession in the lake. A difference in abilities of the studied rotifers to exploit resources seems more important. Perhaps temperature is also a factor, but the specifics remain unclear and await more experimental work.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Limnol, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands","Gulati, RD (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Limnol, Rijksstr Weg 6, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands.",,"Gulati, Ramesh D/F-4943-2013; Gulati, Ramesh D./A-3155-2011",,,,,68,29,31,1,9,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

When eggs of two or more species are deposited at the same time and patch, one can expect a high density of early-instar larvae. Thus, interspecific interactions should be evident. We studied the interaction of two species, Sympetrum fonscolombii and Orthetrum cancellatum, which typically co-occur in French rice fields. We experimentally simulated the laying of egg clutches of both species at the same time and site. Survival of O. cancellatum was reduced compared with that of controls without S. fonscolombii and also with that of S. fonscolombii in the two-species treatment. At the end of the experiment, mean head width of S. fonscolombii was greater than that of O. cancellatum, which may be one reason for the differential survival. In a second experiment we observed the behaviour of pairs of early-instar larvae of both species in different size combinations. Small larvae of S. fonscolombii reduced locomotory activity in the presence of larger O. cancellatum. In contrast, small O. cancellatum did not do so in the presence of larger S. fonscolombii. This behavioural difference may also cause asymmetric interspecific predation.","Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, D-38092 Braunschweig, Germany","Suhling, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Fasanenstr 3, D-38092 Braunschweig, Germany.",f.suhling@tu-bs.de,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",,,,56,16,18,1,11,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Predictable changes in the composition of macroinvertebrate communities in response to non-point source pollution are the basis of macroinvertebrate community indices. However, other factors, such as biotic interactions, also affect the composition of macroinvertebrate communities and may complicate the interpretation of such indices by interacting with abiotic stressors. 2. The effect of agricultural pollutants on competition between two filter-feeding caddisflies, Brachycentrus appalachia and Hydropsyche spp. was studied in the laboratory using recirculating flow tanks. 3. Experiments were conducted at two densities of Hydropsyche: high (300 per tank) and low (80 per tank). Brachycentrus density was kept constant at 40 per tank in all experiments. Experiments assessed the effect of an agricultural pollutant mix (sand, cow-manure compost mix) and the presence of the competitor on both taxa. 4. The only negative response to pollutants was a larger number of Hydropsyche drifting in high-density tanks. In fact, at high densities, mortality of Hydropsyche was higher in controls than in tanks receiving pollutants. 5. Hydropsyche and B. appalachia competed for resources and the presence of pollution did not affect the outcome of this competition. The presence of high densities of Hydropsyche resulted in higher drift and lower condition of B. appalachia. At low densities of Hydropsyche, B. appalachia larvae suffered greater mortality and tended to be in poorer condition. Brachycentrus appalachia may be less successful at even moderate densities of Hydropsyche due to competition between these taxa, most likely for prime feeding positions. 6. Streams receiving non-point source pollution from agriculture may be able to support higher densities of Hydropsyche, which may further reduce the suitability of these habitats for B. appalachia. 7. This experimental study suggests that competition may complicate interpretation of biotic indices, as changes in benthic invertebrate community structure normally ascribed to pollution may arise from intra-specific competition.","[Olsen, Dean A.; Watzin, Mary C.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Ecosyst Sci Lab, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT USA","Olsen, DA (corresponding author), Cawthron Inst, Private Bag 2, Nelson, New Zealand.",nzcaddis@yahoo.co.uk,,,USDA's National Research Initiative Competitive [2002-35102-12491],This work was supported by a grant from the USDA's National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program (No. 2002-35102-12491) awarded to Mary C.

The most-cited mechanism by which disturbance threatens boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is the exacerbation of apparent competition via increases in early successional forage, and subsequent changes in the densities and distributions of other prey species and gray wolves (Canis lupus). An alternative mechanism is the direct alteration of wolf distribution via positive responses by wolves to anthropogenic features. We conducted a mechanistic evaluation of hypotheses explaining human-mediated increases in boreal caribou mortality across northeast British Columbia. We evaluated support for (i) numeric apparent competition (increased prey densities) by evaluating relationships between disturbances, moose (Alces aloes) density, and caribou survival. To evaluate (ii) spatial apparent competition (altered prey distribution) and (iii) wolf spatial responses (altered wolf distribution independent of prey), we modeled the relationships between disturbances and indices of caribou-moose and caribou-wolf co-occurrence and then examined predation risk for caribou as a function of co-occurrence. We did not detect any relationships between anthropogenic disturbances, moose density, and caribou survival. Although caribou-moose co-occurrence increased predation risk, we observed both positive and negative relationships between disturbances and caribou-moose co-occurrence. In contrast, caribou-wolf co-occurrence increased predation risk and was positively correlated with anthropogenic linear features. Contrary to other boreal caribou populations, our analyses demonstrate stronger support for the direct effects of anthropogenic linear features on caribou-wolf spatial overlap, leading to greater risk for caribou. Our research highlights the need for region-specific management actions to conserve and recover widely distributed species.","[Mumma, Matthew A.; Gillingham, Michael P.; Parker, Katherine L.; Johnson, Chris J.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Watters, Megan] Alberta Environm & Pk, Operat Div Resource Management, Room 1601,Prov Bldg Box 23,10320-99 St, Grande Prairie, AB T8V 6J4, Canada; [Watters, Megan] Minist Forests Lands Nat Resource Operat & Rural, Northeast Operat, Room 400,10003-110th Ave, Ft St John, BC V1J 6M7, Canada","Mumma, MA (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",matt.mumma@unbc.ca; mike.gillingham@unbc.ca; kathy.parker@unbc.ca; chris.johnson@unbc.ca; Megan.Watters@gov.ab.ca,,"Mumma, Matthew/0000-0003-1954-6524",BC Oil and Gas Research and Innovation Society; Research and Effectiveness Monitoring Board,"Funding for this work was provided by the BC Oil and Gas Research and Innovation Society and the Research and Effectiveness Monitoring Board.

Exploitative competition is an indirect effect that occurs through use of a shared resource and depends on resource availability. Interference competition occurs by obstructing access to a resource and may not depend on resource availability. Our study tested whether the strength of interference competition changes with protozoa population density. We grew experimental microcosms of protozoa and bacteria under different combinations of protozoan density and basal resource availability. We then solved a dynamic predator-prey model for parameters of the functional response using population growth rates measured in our experiment. As population density increased, competition shifted from exploitation to interference, and competition was less dependent on resource levels. Surprisingly, the effect of resources was weakest when competition was the most intense. We found that at low population densities, competition was largely exploitative and resource availability had a large effect on population growth rates, but the effect of resources was much weaker at high densities. This shift in competitive mechanism could have implications for interspecific competition, trophic interactions, community diversity, and natural selection. We also tested whether this shift in the mechanism of competition with protozoa density affected the structure of the bacterial prey community. We found that both resources and protozoa density affected the structure of the bacterial prey community, suggesting that competitive mechanism may also affect trophic interactions.","[Holdridge, Erica M.; terHorst, Casey P.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Holdridge, Erica M.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Cuellar-Gempeler, Catalina] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Nat Sci, 120 Inner Campus Dr, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Holdridge, EM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",erica.holdridge@yale.edu,,"Holdridge, Erica/0000-0002-7508-9981",Division of Mathematical SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1312490]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1312490] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Mathematical Sciences (Grant/Award Number: 1312490).,,57,15,15,0,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Less is known, however, about how climate change affects multitrophic interactions, and its consequences for food-web dynamics. Here, we investigate the effect of future changes in rainfall patterns on detritivore-plant-herbivore interactions in a semiarid region in southern Spain by experimentally manipulating rainfall intensity and frequency during late spring-early summer. Our results show that rain intensity changes the effect of below-ground detritivores on both plant traits and above-ground herbivore abundance. Enhanced rain altered the interaction between detritivores and plants affecting flower and fruit production, and also had a direct effect on fruit and seed set. Despite this finding, there was no net effect on plant reproductive output. This finding supports the idea that plants will be less affected by climatic changes than by other trophic levels. Enhanced rain also affected the interaction between detritivores and free-living herbivores. The effect, however, was apparent only for generalist and not for specialist herbivores, demonstrating a differential response to climate change within the same trophic level. The complex responses found in this study suggest that future climate change will affect trophic levels and their interactions differentially, making extrapolation from individual species' responses and from one ecosystem to another very difficult.","[Gonzalez-Megias, Adela] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Zool, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Menendez, Rosa] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","Gonzalez-Megias, A (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Zool, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",adelagm@ugr.es,"Menendez, Rosa/D-8851-2014; Megias, Adela Gonzalez/P-8974-2016","Megias, Adela Gonzalez/0000-0002-2292-9334; Menendez, Rosa/0000-0001-9997-5809","Andalusian Government, Spain [P08-RNM-0381]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish","We thank Ignacio Villegas, Viola Belohrad and Mara Lindtner for their help in the lab and in the field, and Mark Lineham for kindly revising the English in the manuscript.

We use data from two urban centers (Phoenix and Baltimore) and two taxa (birds and spiders) to link diversity loss with reduced community evenness among species in urban communities.

However, ecological and demographic differences between conspecific populations may also generate variation in the importance of SC that can drive the evolution of male gonadal investment. In this study, we examined whether variation in population density, which is predicted to influence the level of SC in many animals, is correlated with male gonadal investment among populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa, a species with internal fertilization in which multiple mating is common. We complemented this field study by testing whether males respond plastically to experimentally increased levels of SC by increasing investment in testis. This experiment involved two treatments. In the first, we eliminated the potential for sperm competition (NSC) by housing a single male with a single female. In the second, we created a high risk of SC by housing five males with two females. In the field survey, we found significant differences among populations in density and relative testis mass. However, there was no evidence for a correlation between population density and relative testis mass. In our lab experiment, males did not adjust their gonadal investment in response to experiencing different levels of SC for 4 weeks. Our combined results indicate that gonadal investment in male H. formosa is not related to variation in population density.","[Schrader, Matthew] Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Champaign, IL USA; [Schrader, Matthew; Apodaca, Joseph J.; Macrae, Pamela S.

Many species of aphids exploit a single host-plant species and have to cope with changing environmental conditions. They often vary greatly in abundance even when feeding on the same host. In a field experiment, the bottom-up (plant quality/patch type frequency) and top-down (ant attendance/predation) effects on the abundance of four species of aphids feeding on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) were tested using a full factorial design. In addition, a model was used to examine these patch characteristics for their relative effects on the population dynamics and abundance of different aphid species. 2. Aphid numbers changed significantly depending on the quality of the host plant and the presence/absence of attending ants. The obligate myrmecophile, Metopeurum fuscoviride, was abundant on high-quality plants, while on poor quality plants or on plants without attending ants these aphids did not survive until the end of the experiment. The facultative myrmecophiles, Aphis fabae and Brachycaudus cardui, and the unattended aphid species, Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria, all reached similar peak population densities, but M. tanacetaria did best in poor quality patches. 3. Natural enemies reduced aphid numbers, but those species feeding on high-quality plants survived longer than those on poor-quality plants, which existed only for a short period of time, especially when associated with ants. Losses due to migration of winged morphs and mortality caused by parasitoids were insignificant. 4. Varying the frequency of different patch types in a model indicates that different degrees of associations with ants are favoured in different environments. If the proportion of high-quality patches in a habitat is large, obligate myrmecophiles do best. On increasing the number of poor-quality patches, unattended species become more abundant. 5. The results suggest that, in spite of large species specific differences in growth rates, degree of myrmecophily or life cycle features, the temporal and spatial variability in top-down and bottom-up forces differentially affects aphid species and allows the simultaneous exploitation of a shared host-plant species.","Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Inst Terr Ecosyst Res, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Stadler, B (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Inst Terr Ecosyst Res, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",bernhard.stadler@bitoek.uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,52,29,30,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Habitat partitioning is often considered the primary mechanism for coexistence between similar species, but how this process evolves with changes in population density remains to be empirically tested for free-ranging ungulates. We used resource-selection functions to quantify density effects on landscape-scale habitat selection of two sympatric species of ungulates [moose (Alces alces) and elk (Cervus canadensis manitobensis)] in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada (2000-2011). The density of elk was actively reduced from 1.2 to 0.4 elk km(-2) through increased hunting effort during the period of study, while moose density decreased without additional human influence from 1.6-0.7 moose km(-2). Patterns of habitat selection during winter by both species changed in accordance to expectations from density-dependent habitat-selection theory. At low intraspecific density, moose and elk did not partition habitat, as both species selected strongly for mixed forest (primary habitat providing both food and cover), but did so in different areas segregated across an elevational gradient. As intraspecific density increased, selection for primary habitat by both species decreased, while selection for secondary, lower quality habitat such as agricultural fields (for elk) and built-up areas (for moose) increased. We show that habitat-selection strategies during winter for moose and elk, and subsequent effects on habitat partitioning, depend heavily on the position in state space (density) of both species.","[van Beest, Floris M.; Brook, Ryan K.] Univ Saskatchewan, Coll Agr & Bioresources, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [van Beest, Floris M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [McLoughlin, Philip D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Vander Wal, Eric] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada","van Beest, FM (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",flbe@dmu.dk,"van Beest, Floris M./C-6745-2019","van Beest, Floris M./0000-0002-5701-4927",Parks Canada Agency; Riding Mountain National Park; University of Saskatchewan; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); PrioNet Canada,"We thank the Parks Canada Agency, Riding Mountain National Park, the University of Saskatchewan, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and PrioNet Canada for in-kind and financial support.

Our aim was to test an implication of an evolving body of theory, that such boundaries are manifestations of complex regulatory dynamics. On rocky shores of British Columbia, large-scale field experiments altered the densities of predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus), causing shifts in the location of the lower vertical boundaries of their prey, sea mussels (Mytilus californianus). While control mussel beds remained unchanged, experimental reductions of sea star densities caused the downward extension of the lower boundaries, and experimental increases in sea stars densities caused the upward recession of the lower boundary well into the zone presumed to be a spatial refuge from predation. Cleared plots prepared within the initial boundaries were recolonized to varying degrees, depending on predator densities. After 30 months, plots on sea star removal sites showed high densities of adult mussels, control plots showed intermediate densities, and sea star addition plots showed only a sparse cover of alternative prey. Observations by divers at high tide showed that as small prey were depleted progressively from removal, to control, to addition sites, correspondingly larger mussels were attacked, including very large individuals comprising the lower boundary of addition sites. The findings contradict classic theory of zonation based on static prey refuges and support an alternative theory in which boundaries are maintained by complex, spatially structured equilibria.","[Robles, Carlos D.; Desharnais, Robert A.; Garza, Corey; Donahue, Megan J.; Martinez, Carlos A.] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Ctr Environm Anal, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA","Robles, CD (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Ctr Environm Anal, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",crobles@calstatela.edu,"Donahue, Megan/Q-3528-2017","Donahue, Megan/0000-0002-7529-001X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF OCE-0089842, NSF HRD-0317772]","We thank the staff of the Bamfield Marine Sciences Center for their assistance.

Individual- and population-level variation in body size and growth often correlates with many fitness traits. Predation and food availability are expected to affect body size and growth as important agents of both natural selection and phenotypic plasticity. How differences in predation and food availability affect body size/growth during ontogeny in populations adapted to different predation and competition regimes is rarely studied. 2. Nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations originating from habitats with varying levels of predation and competition are known to be locally adapted to their respective habitats in terms of body size and growth. Here, we studied how different levels of perceived predation risk and competition during ontogeny affect the reaction norms of body size and growth in (i) marine and pond populations adapted to different levels of predation and competition and (ii) different sexes. We reared nine-spined stickleback in a factorial experiment under two levels of perceived predation risk (present/absent) and competition (high/low food supply). 3. We found divergence in the reaction norms at two levels: (i) predation-adapted marine stickleback had stronger reactions to predatory cues than intraspecific competition-adapted pond stickleback, the latter being more sensitive to available food than the marine fish and (ii) females reacting more strongly to the treatments than males. 4. The repeated, habitat-dependent nature of the differences suggests that natural selection is the agent behind the observed patterns. Our results suggest that genetic adaptation to certain environmental factors also involves an increase in the range of expressible phenotypic plasticity. We found support for this phenomenon at two levels: (i) across populations driven by habitat type and (ii) within populations driven by sex.","[Valimaki, Kaisa; Herczeg, Gabor] Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biosci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Valimaki, K (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biosci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",kaisa.valimaki@helsinki.fi,"Herczeg, Gabor/AAZ-1661-2021; Herczeg, Gabor/AAF-9978-2020","Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X; ","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [128716, 134728, 129662]; Finnish Graduate School in Population Genetics","Goran Englund, Jacquelin DeFaveri, Jenni Hamalainen, Lotta Kvarnemo, Tuomas Leinonen, Pia Rannanen and Pirkko Siikamaki helped to obtain the samples.

When community founders present distinct functional traits and a colonization-competition trade-off is not operating, initial colonization can result in late-stage assemblages of variable diversity and composed by different species sets, depending if early colonizers facilitate or inhibit subsequent colonization and survival. By experimentally manipulating the functional identity of founders and predators access during the development of fouling communities, we tested how founder traits constrain colonization history, species interactions and thereby regulate community diversity. We used as founders functionally different fouling organisms (colonial and solitary ascidians, and arborescent and flat-encrusting bryozoans) to build experimental communities that were exposed or protected against predation using a caging approach. Ascidians and bryozoans are pioneer colonizers in benthic communities and also good competitors, but the soft-body of ascidians makes them more susceptible to predators than mineralized bryozoans. When ascidians were founders, their dominance (but not richness) was reduced by predation, resulting in no effects of predators on overall diversity. Conversely, when bryozoans were founders, both space limitation and predator effects resulted in species-poor communities, with reduced number and cover of ascidian species and high overall dominance at the end of the experiment. We, thus, highlight that current species interactions and colonization contingencies related to founder identity should not be viewed as isolated drivers of community organization, but rather as strongly interacting processes underlying species distribution patterns and diversity.","[Vieira, Edson A.; Flores, Augusto A., V] Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Flores, Augusto A., V] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Biol Marinha, BR-11600000 Sao Sebastiao, SP, Brazil; [Dias, Gustavo M.] Univ Fed ABC UFABC, Ctr Ciencias Nat & Humanas, BR-09606070 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil; [Vieira, Edson A.] Univ Fed Rio Grande Norte UFRN, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Oceanog & Limnol, BR-59014002 Natal, RN, Brazil","Vieira, EA (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.; Vieira, EA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande Norte UFRN, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Oceanog & Limnol, BR-59014002 Natal, RN, Brazil.",edsonvfmar@gmail.com,"Flores, Augusto A.

Competition for food and predation between greenback cutthroat trout O. c. stomias and brook trout were investigated in montane streams of Colorado. A replicated field study was used to describe the population density, diet, stomach fullness, and body condition of the two species in allopatry and sympatry. Population data confirmed that brook trout displaced greenback cutthroat trout at sites where the species occur together. The diets of the two species were different; cutthroat trout consumed more prey items and a wider variety of prey than brook trout. Sympatry did not influence gut fullness or body condition for either species. Predation occurred at low rates that did not account for declines in populations of greenback cutthroat trout. Instead, population data suggest that the displacement of greenback cutthroat trout by brook trout occurs through a bottleneck on recruitment due to the mortality of eggs or juvenile cutthroat trout.","Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Ctr Limnol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","McGrath, CC (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, 322 E Front St,Suite 401, Boise, ID 83702 USA.",ccmcgrath@fs.fed.us,,,,,,47,26,28,0,20,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

The search for broad generality can be hampered when species interactions vary geographically, a common phenomenon attributed to a wide range of underlying ecological factors. Less attention has been directed toward understanding the additional role that evolutionary processes may play in modifying the way that pairs of species interact over large spatial scales. Here we examine whether marked geographic variation in the interaction between a predatory snail (Nucella canaliculata) and an intertidal mussel (Mytilus californianus) arises from phenotypic plasticity or fixed genetic differences among snail populations. Over a three-year period, we reared snails from eight populations in California and Oregon, USA, through two laboratory generations and tested whether family lines differed in their ability to drill M. californianus. Remarkably, F2 generation snails from Oregon sources were generally unable to drill mid-sized Mytilus californianus (5-7 cm long), whereas snails from California readily drilled this prey. Because snails were raised through two generations on a common diet (Mytilus trossulus), these differences among populations likely have a genetic basis. Snails from California and Oregon readily interbred and produced viable offspring in the laboratory, suggesting that populations belong to a single biological species. Field surveys of mussel beds revealed striking geographic variation in predation that closely matched the observed differences in the drilling capacity of N. canaliculata. Drilled M. californianus were common at all sites in California and included many large mussels (>10 cm long). In contrast, drilled M. californianus were rare on the central Oregon coast and consisted mostly of small mussels (< 3 cm). We hypothesize that persistent variation in prey recruitment along the coast has selected for interpopulation differences in the drilling capacity of this direct-developing snail, with potential consequences for the size structure of mussel beds. Combined with growing evidence of restricted gene flow and low connectivity among many marine populations, this study highlights the importance of considering the contribution of evolutionary processes to geographic variation in species interactions.","[Sanford, Eric] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Bodega Bay Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA","Sanford, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",edsanford@ucdavis.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-06-22924],"We thank J.

We examined whether one potential reason for its ecological success might be its predatory efficiency. We compared the density of termite nests in an area of Mexico invaded by P. megacephala with an adjacent area where P. megacephala is not present. We also compared the success of P. megacephala in preying on termites with that of 13 native ant species. We found that termite nest density was significantly lower in areas invaded by P. megacephala (0.33 vs. 1.05 nests per 30 m transect). In field trials, we established that P. megacephala workers were significantly more successful at capturing termite workers from termite nest fragments than even the most successful native ant species, Dorymyrmex pyramicus. For both P. megacephala and D. pyramicus, single scouts could trigger the mass recruitment of nestmates, but P. megacephala was able to recruit greater numbers of nestmates. Combined with their aggressiveness towards other ant species, their highly efficient predatory capacities help explain the ecological success of P. megacephala and demonstrate how it can be a major threat to invertebrate biodiversity in the areas it invades.","CNRS Guyane, UPS 2561, F-97300 Cayenne, France; CNRS, UMR 5174, Cayenne, France; Univ Douala, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Organismes Anim, Douala, Cameroon; Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Dejean, A (corresponding author), CNRS Guyane, UPS 2561, 16 Ave Andre Aron, F-97300 Cayenne, France.",alain.dejean@wanadoo.fr,"Moreau, Corrie S/B-2889-2011","Moreau, Corrie/0000-0003-1139-5792; Dejean, Alain/0000-0002-3561-2248",,,,22,29,30,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-2048,1439-0418,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

This study used predator-exclusion cages and neighbour removals in a field experiment to test how indirect interactions between populations of three coral taxa, Acropora, Pocillopora, and Porites, influenced their survival during an outbreak of the crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci, in Moorea, French Polynesia. High densities of corals enhanced survival by generating associational refuges: physical structures that impeded Acanthaster and protected corals, and by simple density-dependent prey dilution that reduced predation rates. Acanthaster showed feeding preferences, resulting in varying intensities of predation on corals, which (1) influenced the type and strength of the associational refuge among corals and (2) resulted in significant loss of the competitive dominants to the benefit of the competitive inferiors. The result was a set of indirect positive interactions (IPIs) that prevented Acanthaster from eradicating Acropora and may have enhanced Porites, a relatively weak competitor among corals. IPIs probably play a key role in many ecosystems, especially in coral reefs in which corals act as engineer species, to reduce impacts of perturbations and enhance community resilience. This study illustrates the importance of IPIs in community regulation with a new conceptual model.","[Kayal, Mohsen; Pau, Cedric; Penin, Lucie; Adjeroud, Mehdi] Univ Perpignan, CNRS EPHE UPVD, UMR 5244, Via Domitia, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Kayal, Mohsen; Pau, Cedric; Penin, Lucie] Ctr Rech Insulaires, CNRS EPHE, USR 3278, F-98729 Papetoai, Moorea, France; [Kayal, Mohsen; Pau, Cedric; Penin, Lucie] Observ Environm, F-98729 Papetoai, Moorea, France; [Lenihan, Hunter S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Penin, Lucie] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Adjeroud, Mehdi] Inst Rech Dev, Unite CoReUs2 227, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia","Kayal, M (corresponding author), Univ Perpignan, CNRS EPHE UPVD, UMR 5244, Via Domitia, F-66860 Perpignan, France.",mohsen.kayal@univ-perp.fr,"Adjeroud, Mehdi/J-6411-2016; Penin, Lucie/B-3163-2009","Adjeroud, Mehdi/0000-0002-6825-8759; Kayal, Mohsen/0000-0003-3675-9855",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE0417412]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Societe Polynesienne des Eaux et de l'Assainissement; Planete Urgence,"The authors are grateful to Pauline Bosserelle, as well as to many volunteers from CRIOBE and Planete Urgence for assistance in the field, and to three anonymous reviewers for their critical comments on this manuscript.

Ecologists have argued about the commonness and strength of interspecific competition between insect herbivores, but facilitation between herbivores has received much less consideration. We previously found that when two species of folivorous caterpillars co-occurred on a shared host plant, feeding by early season tiger moth caterpillars reduced the growth and reproduction of later season tussock caterpillars. However, densities of tussock caterpillars in summer were positively correlated with densities of tiger moth caterpillars the following spring. 2. In this study, we experimentally manipulated numbers of feeding tussock caterpillars and found that they facilitated tiger moth caterpillars. 3. The depth of the litter layer beneath host lupine bushes was positively correlated with the number of tussock caterpillars feeding on each bush. Experimental additions of litter beneath lupine canopies during summer resulted in increased numbers of tiger moth caterpillars in the following spring, indicating a causal role of litter. Litter potentially provides food, habitat and protection from desiccation and predation. We failed to find evidence that tussock caterpillars facilitated tiger moth caterpillars by mechanisms independent of litter. 4. Our study demonstrates that facilitation may operate between insect herbivores, across life-stages through indirect interactions that are non-trophic. Facilitation operated by a novel mechanism, the accumulation of litter which was a by-product of feeding by one species was valuable to a second species. Facilitation persisted in time and space far beyond the creation of litter by tussock caterpillars which should be considered important ecosystem engineers from the point of view of tiger moths. Facilitations that involve habitat modification may generally connect species that do not interact directly or trophically, and have not previously been considered to affect one another.","[Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Grof-Tisza, Patrick] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Karban, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rkarban@ucdavis.edu,"Grof-Tisza, Patrick/AAY-7318-2020; Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009","Grof-Tisza, Patrick/0000-0002-0217-4253; Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [LTREB-0639885]; Division Of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [0841297] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank Claire Karban and Tawny Mata for help with field work and Susan Harrison, Bitty Roy and two anonymous reviewers for improving the manuscript.

We isolated 43 fungal strains that naturally colonize seeds of an invasive winter annual (Brassica tournefortii) in the Sonoran Desert, and evaluated the impact of 18 of them on seed germination and mortality of B. tournefortii and a co-occurring native annual (Plantago ovata) under simulated summer and winter temperatures. Fungi isolated from B. tournefortii seeds impacted germination and mortality of seeds of both plant species in vitro. Seed responses reflected host-specific effects by fungi, the degree of which differed significantly between the strains, and depended on the temperature. In the winter temperature, ten fungal strains increased or reduced seed germination, but substantial seed mortality due to fungi was not observed. Two strains increased germination of P. ovata more strongly than B. tournefortii. In the summer temperature, fungi induced both substantial seed germination and mortality, with ten strains demonstrating host-specificity. Under natural conditions, host-specific effects of fungi on seed germination may further differentiate plant species niche in germination response, with a potential of promoting coexistence. Both host-specific and non-host-specific effects of fungi on seed loss may induce polarizing effects on plant coexistence depending on the ecological context. The coexistence theory provides a clear framework to interpret these polarizing effects. Moreover, fungi pathogenic to both plant species could induce host-specific germination, which challenges the theoretical assumption of density-independent germination response. These implications from an in vitro study underscore the need to weave theoretical modeling, reductive empirical experiments, and natural observations to illuminate effects of soil-borne fungi on coexistence of annual plant species in variable desert environments.","[Li, Yue M.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Li, Yue M.] Arizona Sonora Desert Museum, Tucson, AZ 85743 USA; [Shaffer, Justin P.] Univ Arizona, Sch Plant Sci, Tucson, AZ USA; [Hall, Brenna] Univ Arizona, Coll Publ Hlth, Tucson, AZ USA; [Ko, Hongseok] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Shaffer, Justin P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Li, YM (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Li, YM (corresponding author), Arizona Sonora Desert Museum, Tucson, AZ 85743 USA.",liyue@email.arizona.edu,,"Li, Yue/0000-0002-2564-6129",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353715]; U.S. Marine Corps [W9126G-14-2-0045]; U.S. Navy [N62473-18-2-0015],"Funding comes from National Science Foundation https://www.nsf.gov/(grant number DEB-1353715), U.S. Marine Corps http://www.marines.mil/(grant number W9126G-14-2-0045), and U.S. Navy https://www.navy.mil (grant number N62473-18-2-0015).

Locally, generalist predators dominate the community of natural enemies in potato fields. The presence of multiple prey species might distract generalists from feeding on any single target pest. In the laboratory, we examined whether consumption rates of several predator species on focal (GPA) prey was reduced in the presence of alternative (CPB egg) prey. In initial measurements of predation rates we found that two predator species, Nabis spp. and Geocoris spp. bugs, had the highest consumption rates on aphids, potato beetle eggs and small potato beetle larvae. So, we focused on Nabis spp. and Geocoris spp. in later experiments. In Petri dish arenas Nabis ate significantly more GPA per capita than did Geocoris; both predators exhibited weakly suppressed aphid consumption rates when CPB eggs were also present. However, in experiments in larger greenhouse microcosms including potato plants, this weak disruptive effect of CPB eggs disappeared. Geocoris ate nearly identical numbers of aphids across a 4-fold range of CPB egg density. Nabis, in contrast, ate significantly more aphids when 40 CPB eggs were included in microcosms, compared to microcosms with no alternative prey present. Thus, we would not expect any strong disruption of M. persicae control by Nabis spp. or Geocoris spp. when L. decemlineata eggs are also present in the field. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This study examined the relative effect of predation and macroalgal competition on the growth of Cliona tenuis at Glover's Reef Atoll, Belize. A field experiment was designed to isolate the importance of each factor and its interactions, by means of exclusion cages to assess the effects of fish predators, and algal transplantation to assess the effects of macroalgal competition (Lobophora variegata), over 286 d. To obtain complementary data on the net outcome of predation and competition in situ, predation intensity and the competitive effects on C. tenuis of 5 different competitors were monitored in the field. Competition with macroalgae significantly reduced the size of the sponge by 38 +/- 11% (SE). Despite a high predation rate (1 bite 100 cm(-2) h(-1)), no effect of the interaction of predation with macroalgal competition was detected.

Differences in horizontal distribution of the species mainly as adults led to their partial habitat segregation. Most adult A. bimaculatus were littoral dwellers, whereas A. fasciatus adults were distributed from inshore to offshore waters, but with most in the latter region. Both are faculative zooplanktivores in the reservoir, feeding mostly on planktonic crustaceans, insects (chiefly chironomids), some higher plant material, detritus and even fish scales (A. bimaculatus). Food overlap coefficients, considering adult and juvenile stages of both species are large in dry as well as wet seasons, although in the dry season the overlaps are significantly reduced for juveniles of both species and for juveniles of A. bimaculatus versus adults of A. fasciatus. Both species prey more on cladocerans than on cyclopoid copepods, and the adults selectively take larger forms (Daphnia gessneri and Moina micrura) in the reservoir (as in previously reported enclosure experiments). Juveniles prey heavily on Bosmina longirostris.

Genista monspessulana (French broom) is native to Europe, but highly invasive and abundant along the Pacific Coast of the USA. In this study, the population density and age structure, plant growth and reproductive traits, and seed bank characteristics of 13 native (Mediterranean Basin) and 15 introduced (California, USA) field populations of G. monspessulana were compared. Mean population density, plant height and stem diameter were greater in introduced populations, with the latter two traits explained by a greater mean plant age. Age structure also showed a greater percentage of seedling plants in introduced populations. Fecundity was higher in introduced populations when measured in terms of mature seeds per pod, but lower when comparing seed production per plant (number of pods and mature seeds). Thus, seed rain and seed bank size was considerably higher in introduced populations. Results from this study indicate that G. monspessulana performs better in its introduced region. We hypothesize that release from natural enemies and competitors together with more favorable environmental conditions in the introduced region may explain the invasion success of G. monspessulana. As a result, an integrated management approach using introduced seed predators to suppress seed production and selected management practices to reduce seed banks may be needed for effective long-term control in California.","[Herrera, Angelica M.; Carruthers, Raymond I.] ARS, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, USDA, WRRC, Albany, CA 94710 USA; [Herrera, Angelica M.; Mills, Nicholas J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Herrera, AM (corresponding author), ARS, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, USDA, WRRC, 800 Buchanan St, Albany, CA 94710 USA.",angelica.herrera@ars.usda.gov,,"Mills, Nicholas/0000-0001-8885-8674","Unites States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, CRISUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service [5325-22000-020-00D]; Bureau of Land Management [5325-22000-020-17R]; Georges Lurcy Fellowship","We thank Dr. Andy Sheppard from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization for assistance in locating European field sites.

However, little is known about how ecosystem functions may be modified by trait-mediated indirect effects of non-native species. Oysters and other reef-associated filter feeders enhance water quality by controlling nutrients and contaminants in many estuarine environments. However, this ecosystem service may be mitigated by predation, competition, or other species interactions, especially when such interactions involve non-native species that share little evolutionary history. We assessed trophic and other interference effects on the critical ecosystem service of water filtration in mesocosm experiments. In single-species trials, typical field densities of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) reduced water-column chlorophyll a more strongly than clams (Mercenaria mercenaria). The non-native filter-feeding reef crab Petrolisthes armatus did not draw down chlorophyll a. In multi-species treatments, oysters and clams combined additively to influence chlorophyll a drawdown. Petrolisthes did not affect net filtration when added to the bivalve-only treatments. Addition of the predatory mud crab Panopeus herbstii did not influence oyster feeding rates, but it did stop chlorophyll a drawdown by clams. However, when Petrolisthes was also added in with the clams, the clams filtered at their previously unadulterated rates, possibly because Petrolisthes drew the focus of predators or habituated the clams to crab stimuli. In sum, oysters were the most influential filter feeder, and neither predators nor competitors interfered with their net effect on water-column chlorophyll. In contrast, clams filtered less, but were more sensitive to predators as well as a facilitative buffering effect of Petrolisthes, illustrating that non-native species can indirectly affect an ecosystem service by aiding the performance of a native species.","[Byers, James E.; Smith, Rachel S.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Weiskel, Heidi W.; Robertson, Charles Y.] Skidaway Inst Oceanog, Savannah, GA USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jebyers@uga.edu,,"Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",Georgia Sea Grant; NSF (OCE)National Science Foundation (NSF) [0961853]; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [0961853] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"Georgia Sea Grant and NSF (OCE-#0961853) are acknowledged for funding.

Some forest bird species have continued to decline since 1986, while others have increased, usually after intensive species-specific research and management programmes. In this paper, we review what is known about major causes of current declines or population limitation, including predation, competition for food or another resource, disease, forest loss, and genetic problems such as inbreeding depression and reduced genetic variation. Much experimental and circumstantial evidence suggests or demonstrates that predation by introduced mammals remains the primary cause of declines and limitation in remaining large native forest tracts. Predation alone is generally sufficient to explain the observed declines, but complex interactions between factors that vary between species and sites are likely to be the norm and are difficult to study. Currently, the rather limited evidence for food shortage is mostly circumstantial and may be obscured by interactions with predation. Climate and food supply determine the number of breeding attempts made by herbivorous species, but predation by introduced mammals ultimately determines the outcome of those attempts. After removal of pest mammals, populations are apparently limited by other factors, including habitat area, food supply, disease or avian predators. Management of these, and of inbreeding depression in bottlenecked populations, is likely to assist the effectiveness and resilience of management programmes. At the local or regional scale, however, forest area itself may be limiting in deforested parts of New Zealand. Without predator management, the number of native forest birds on the New Zealand mainland is predicted to continue to decline.","[Innes, John; Overton, Jacob McC.] Landcare Res, Hamilton 3216, New Zealand; [Kelly, Dave] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Gillies, Craig] Dept Conservat, Res & Dev Grp, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand","Innes, J (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton 3216, New Zealand.",innesj@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Kelly, Dave/A-6129-2013","Kelly, Dave/0000-0002-9469-2161","Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [C09X0503]","We thank Ian Jamieson who conceived an initial draft ofFigure 3, and Jane Andrews, Rosemary Barraclough, Chris Berry, Bruce Bums, Jim Briskie, Pim de Monchy, Astrid Dijkgraaf, Tim Lovegrove, Colin O'Donnell, Ralph Powlesland, Heidi Stevens, and Daniel Tompkins for permission to use unpublished data.

We used two mayfly species (Baetis bicaudatus and Drunella grandis) and one caddisfly species (Glossosoma verdona), which differ from one another in body morphology and mobility. Periphyton was grown for 30 days on ceramic tiles in constant velocity to create similar initial forage conditions for grazers. Tiles were transferred to three velocity regimes characteristic of the natural streambed: slow (3-5 cm s(-1)), medium (15-20 cm s(-1)) and fast (3241 cm s(-1)). Four grazer treatments (Baetis, Drunella, and Glossosoma alone, and all species combined) were repeated for each velocity treatment to isolate the effect of local current on grazer ability to crop periphyton. Grazers differed in their abilities to remove periphyton across current treatments. Glossosoma removed significantly (P<0.05) more periphyton at fast versus either slow or medium velocities; Baetis showed a similar (but nonsignificant) trend; and, Drunella always removed about 75% of periphyton, irrespective of current. At fast current, periphyton removal was equivalent among the species. At medium current, Drunella removed significantly more than both Baetis and Glossosoma, whereas at slow current, Drunella removed more than Baetis, which removed more than Glossosoma. Periphyton removal under the combined three-grazer treatment was similar qualitatively to the combined effects of individual grazers. More periphyton tended to be removed as current increased, with the fast versus slow contrast showing marginal significance (P=0.10). Under all current regimes, the quantity of periphyton removed did not differ from the null model expectation of simple additive effects among individual grazers (i.e., no facilitation or inhibition). These experiments show that for some species, herbivory varies with current, which suggests that the herbivore function of cropping periphyton may vary with the environmental context of local current. Under some local velocities, however, different herbivore species function similarly and are potentially redundant with respect to periphytic removal. In naturally heterogeneous streams characterized by sharp gradients in local current velocity, we expect current-dependent species interactions to be common and at least partially contribute to intra-guild co-existence of species.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Poff, NL (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",poff@lamar.colostate.edu,"Poff, Nathan L/C-1239-2009","Poff, N LeRoy/0000-0002-1390-8742",,,,61,48,54,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2003,134,2,,,,,262,269,,10.1007/s00442-002-1086-2,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,642UH,WOS:000180822900012,12647167,,,,2021-09-27,

Erigonid spiders increased the mortality rates of lacewing larvae to different degrees, depending on the species and sex of spider concerned. The effect of spiders on lacewing larvae was highest (up to nearly 100% mortality) in the absence of alternative prey. In the presence of three or 20 aphids (Sitobion avenae Fab.) female erigonids increased the mortality rates of lacewing larvae compared to controls, but predation on lacewing larvae decreased in the presence of increasing numbers of aphids. Males of O. apicatus caused no significant increase in mortality rate of lacewing larvae in the presence of aphids. Lacewing larvae (L2-larvae and L3-larvae) did not kill erigonid spiders. IGP between the female erigonids E. ari a and O. apicatus was not found. P. melanarius fed on lacewing larvae and on erigonid spiders, and E. atra was preferred over O. apicatus. The sex-specific and species-specific IGP rates of spiders on lacewing larvae and the great influence of alternative prey on IGP rate reveal a general problem when data resulting from one sexual stage or one species or one feeding regime are generalized to a whole arthropod group. Moreover, the results suggest that an increase of top predators, such as carabid beetles, which prey only to a limited extent on the pest species itself, may affect natural insect pest control by IGP.","Univ Hannover, Inst Plant Dis & Plant Protect, Hannover, Germany","Dinter, A (corresponding author), European Res & Dev Ctr, DuPont Nemours France SA, 24 Rue Moulin, F-68740 Nambsheim, France.",,,,,,,44,34,36,2,17,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0931-2048,,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

The present study provides direct evidence indicating that the oviposition behaviour of the two main mango fruit fly species, Ceratitis cosyra (Walker) and Bactrocera invadens Drew-Tsurata & White, is affected by secretions of the dominant arboreal ant Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille). When offered ant-exposed and unexposed mangoes in the absence of the ants, both fly species are reluctant to land on ant-exposed fruits and, when having landed, often take off quickly and fail to oviposit. The number of puparia collected from unexposed mangoes is approximately eight-fold higher than from ant-exposed ones. The results obtained from laboratory experiments and field observations confirm that adult fruit flies are more affected through repellence by ant cues than by direct predation. The use of cues by fruit flies in predator avoidance has implications for evolutionary ecology, behavioural ecology and chemical ecology.","[Van Mele, Paul] Africa Rice Ctr WARDA, Cotonou, Benin; [Vayssieres, Jean-Francois] UR HortSys, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Vayssieres, Jean-Francois; Adandonon, Appolinaire; Sinzogan, Antonio] Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou, Benin","Van Mele, P (corresponding author), Africa Rice Ctr WARDA, 01 BP 2031, Cotonou, Benin.",p.vanmele@cgiar.org,,,"Conservation, Food and Health Foundation","We thank Mr Delou for his technical assistance and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

Densities of the leaf miner (Phyllonorycter salicifoliella (Chambers)) and two leaf galling sawflies (Phyllocolpa nigrita (Marlatt) and Phyllocolpa eleanorae Smith and Fritz) varied significantly among willow clones, indicating genetic variation in resistance. 3. Survival and natural enemy impact caused by egg and larval parasitoids and/or unknown predators differed significantly among willow clones for each of the three herbivore species, indicating genetic variation in survival and enemy impact. 4. Survival of Phyllonorycter was negatively density-dependent among clones. 5. Survival of Phyllonorycter and Phyllocolpa eleanorae were positively correlated with densities of heterospecific herbivores among clones and parasitism of these species were negatively correlated with densities of the same heterospecific herbivores among clones. 6. At least for Phyllonorycter this positive correlation may suggest either facilitation of survival between herbivore species, which do not share natural enemies, or an apparent interaction caused by host plant genetic variation. 7. Among clones, egg parasitism of Phyllocolpa eleanorne was weakly positively correlated with density of Phyllocolpa nigrita.

Of particular concern is how increased warming in tidally fluctuating estuaries may impact the native and endangered delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus, Osmeridae). To help address this issue, we tested the effects of increased water temperature (fluctuating [17-21 degrees C] and warm [21 degrees C] acclimated treatments) on juvenile delta smelt individual and group behaviour, response to chemical alarm and predator cues, as well as capacity to evade predation. In addition, predation of delta smelt was tested in the presence of a dominant invasive competitor, Mississippi silversides (Menidia beryllina, Atherinopsidae), as well as comparative predation mortality on Mississippi silversides when isolated. After 7 days of increased temperature treatments, delta smelt in the warm treatment increased swimming velocity, decreased turning angle, and altered group structure with larger inter-individual distances compared to fish in the control (17 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature treatments. Following conspecific and predator chemical alarm cues, delta smelt showed anti-predator responses. Control and fluctuating treatment fish responded to conspecific cues with increased swimming speeds, decreased inter-individual distances and near-neighbour distances, and, after 15 min, fish recovered back to baseline behaviours. In contrast, fish in the warm treatment had not recovered after 15 min, and swimming speeds were maintained at roughly 25 cm/s, close to maximum capabilities. Fish in control and fluctuating treatments showed minimal responses to predator cues, whereas delta smelt exposed to warm conditions significantly increased swimming speeds and decreased turning angle. Predation of delta smelt by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, Centrarchidae) was greatest under the warm treatment, correlating with altered behaviours of delta smelt; however, predation of Mississippi silversides was greater than delta smelt, independent of temperature. This study provides novel insight into the group behaviour of delta smelt, their response to predation, and how prolonged exposure to elevated temperature may induce negative individual and group behaviours causing alterations in predator-prey dynamics. This work highlights the importance of testing ecologically realistic temperature fluctuations in experiments as delta smelt had significantly altered responses to elevated temperature, dependent on variability of warming.","[Davis, Brittany E.; Todgham, Anne E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Davis, Brittany E.; Hansen, Matthew J.; Cocherell, Dennis E.; Nguyen, Trinh X.; Fangue, Nann A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Davis, Brittany E.; Sommer, Ted] Calif Dept Water Resources, Div Environm Serv, Sacramento, CA USA; [Hansen, Matthew J.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany; [Baxter, Randall D.] Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Stockton, CA USA","Todgham, AE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",todgham@ucdavis.edu,,"Fangue, Nann/0000-0001-5419-0282; Davis, Brittany/0000-0003-3752-1830; Hansen, Matthew/0000-0001-7579-9927; Todgham, Anne/0000-0003-1439-6985","Delta Stewardship Council [2271]; Delta Science Program [2271]; California Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of California Davis [CA-D-ASC-2252-H, CA-D-ASC-2253-RR, CA-D-ASC-2091-H]","\This work was supported by the Delta Stewardship Council and Delta Science Program under grant number 2271 awarded to BED.

To evaluate specific drivers for one species, we studied the spacing behavior of wintering Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at Bahia Santa Maria, northwestern Mexico, using behavioral observations. The density, population structure, and territorial behavior of Western Sandpipers differed among three habitat types. Cattail marshes supported 110 birds per ha, 49% males, and no territorial birds. Mangrove flats supported 288 birds per ha, 58% males, and 5% territorial birds. Brackish flats supported 365 birds per ha, 76% males, and 7% territorial birds. Territories consisted of rectangular strips (59 m long, N= 77). Territory length was not related to either bird density or number of territorial birds by plot, but was positively related to nearest bird distance. Aggression rate was inversely related to territory length, suggesting that territory length is set by the costs of defense. Foraging rate was independent of territory length, and prey densities in territories did not differ from those in areas used by nonterritorial birds. Males were more likely to be territorial and had a higher aggression rate than females, suggesting that males, which forage more on surface prey, were more affected by foraging interference. Our results suggest that the territorial behavior of Western Sandpipers in our study was an opportunistic strategy to reduce foraging interference. The variation in spacing behavior we documented provides evidence that interference competition affects the social structure of Western Sandpipers during the nonbreeding season.","[Fernandez, Guillermo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Mazatlan, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mazatlan 82040, Sinaloa, Mexico; [Lank, David B.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Fernandez, G (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Mazatlan, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Apartado Postal 811, Mazatlan 82040, Sinaloa, Mexico.",gfernandez@ola.icmyl.unam.mx,"Fernandez, Guillermo/B-7534-2008","Fernandez, Guillermo/0000-0002-8478-5575",Centre for Wildlife Ecology at Simon Fraser University; Canadian Wildlife Service-Latin America Program; Patolandia Hunting Club; National Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [90768]; Government of Canada Award;  [DGVS: 3876];  [3278];  [3592];  [20383-D];  [552-B],"A.

Previous experiments with dominant understory Piper shrubs in a Costa Rican rain forest revealed that increases in herbivore densities on these shrubs caused widespread seedling mortality as a result of herbivores moving from Piper to seedlings of many different plant genera. We tested components of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis by conducting focused studies on the effects of specialist and generalist Piper herbivores on local seedling diversity. Whereas specialist herbivores are predicted to increase mortality to neighboring seedlings that are closely related to the source plant, true generalists moving from source plants may cause density-dependent mortality of many species, and possibly increase richness if new species replace abundant species that have been thinned by herbivores. Therefore, we hypothesized that seedling richness would be greater in understory control plots created in patches of Piper that had normal densities of generalist herbivores compared to plots from which we removed generalist herbivores manually from all Piper shrubs. After 15 months, generalist-herbivore-removal plots had >40% fewer seedlings,>40% fewer species, and 40% greater seedling evenness, on average, than control plots with generalist herbivores intact. Using a complementary approach in unmanipulated plots in four forests, we used path analysis to test for a positive association between seedling diversity and herbivore damage on Piper species. In unmanipulated plots, for both generalist and specialist herbivores, our data were significant fits to the causal model that Piper herbivores decrease evenness and increase plant species richness, corroborating the experimental results. Because herbivores changed how individuals were apportioned among the species and families present (lower evenness), one interpretation of these associations between herbivores on Piper shrubs and local seedling richness is that high seedling mortality in dominant families allowed the colonization or survival of less common species. If interspecific or apparent competition allowed for a relative increase in species richness, then the Janzen-Connell hypothesis may extend its predictions to generalist seedling predators. We speculate that apparent competition may explain some of the deviations from neutral model predictions, especially at small scales.","[Dyer, Lee A.; Chavarria, Gerardo Vega] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Letourneau, Deborah K.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Amoretti, Diego Salazar] Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA","Dyer, LA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",nolaclimber@gmail.com,"Letourneau, Deborah/G-3694-2011","Salazar, Diego/0000-0001-9810-5828","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0344250, CHE-0718732]; Earthwatch Institute; National GeographicNational Geographic Society; Tulane University","This study was funded by NSF grant DEB-0344250 and CHE-0718732, as well as grants from Earthwatch Institute, National Geographic, and Tulane University.

A new top predator, the dragonfly Cordulegaster boltonii Donovan,'invaded' a stream with a well-described food web. 2. The pre-invasion web was species-poor but complex, with prevalent intraguild predation, cannibalism and omnivory. Such characteristics differ from expectations based upon the early food web literature, but are consistent with more recent empirical webs and theoretical developments. 3, Exhaustive sampling was necessary to describe web structure, with the gut contents of several hundred individuals being required to reach the asymptote of the total number of links for individual species. There was no single 'standard' sample size that was applicable for estimating the number of links: sampling 'x' guts gave a different fraction of the asymptotic value for different species. Smaller predators were more prone to underestimation of links than larger species higher in the web. 4, The number of feeding links, trophic status and the degree of omnivory increased progressively with predator body size, both within and among species. The diet of each predator species (or instar) was effectively a subset of the diet of the next largest predator. 5. The invader was extremely polyphagous and fed at all trophic levels. Mean chain length increased by half a link following the invasion. Web complexity, and omnivory in particular, also increased. Pre- and post-invasion webs displayed intervality and rigid circuitry. The resident predators were frequently eaten by the invader, but the only significant predators of C. boltonii were larger conspecifics. Although no species have yet been deleted, there has been a 21% increase in links for a 6% increase in species since the invasion, suggesting that the members of the web had become more tightly packed within niche space. Most prey species were eaten by every predator species (including C. boltonii), indicating the potential for strong apparent competition within the web.","Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England","Woodward, G (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, IERM, Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland.",,"Woodward, Guy/G-7103-2011",,,,,80,104,113,5,50,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Studies of closed populations, in which offspring remain close to their natal site, emphasise the role of density-dependence, particularly through competition and predation. The usefulness of this dichotomy was tested on spiny chromis Acanthochromis polyacanthus, which is one of the few marine fish that lack a pelagic larval phase and is thought to be the archetypal species for closed population status among reef-fishes. Experimental manipulations showed that juvenile A. polyacanthus suffered lower rates of mortality in locations where large predatory fish were excluded. The magnitude of differences in mortality between treatments (cages and open plots) matched natural differences in mortality between locations representing low and high numbers of predators, suggesting that large predatory fish were a primary source of juvenile mortality. Growth did not increase when prey and predator abundances were reduced. This finding rejected 2 models: that growth was reduced in large schools and these slower growing individuals suffered greater rates of predation; and that intraspecific competition occurred. Growth of prey increased when released from predation pressure, a process not previously considered in studies of growth in reef-fish. The repression of growth in response to predation pressure indicates that predators may have a more far-reaching effect on demography of reef-fish than previously thought. Predation was density-dependent in that juveniles in larger schools suffered greater rates of mortality in the presence of predators but not in their absence. Predation appeared to limit the upper size of schools, but this did not eliminate a linear relationship between input and subsequent abundance. Hence, density-dependent predation was weak and large fluctuations in recruitment (births) persisted and contributed importantly to fluctuation in prey density. These results support the model that when density-dependent mortality is weak, both input and subsequent mortality will be important limiting factors. Consequently, this study questions the assumption that variation in predation and competition has greater consequences for closed populations.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Connell, SD (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",sconnell@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Connell, Sean D/A-8874-2008","Connell, Sean D/0000-0002-5350-6852",,,,61,52,53,0,24,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Such conditions may qualify as ecological traps, but their existence is often hard to prove. Here, we provide a practical framework to evaluate a potential ecological trap resulting from mismatch between habitat preferences and predation risk, focusing on ground-nesting farmland birds of conservation concern. The framework is based on species-specific associations with safe or unsafe habitat types (i.e. field and landscape types with high or low nest survival), and the occurrence of risk avoidance (i.e. negative responses to predator abundances or to nest failure rates after controlling for habitat effects). Bird densities were far more influenced by field characteristics than landscape context. Corn bunting and fan-tailed warbler were associated with tall swards (safe habitats), and did not show risk avoidance. Tawny pipit and and Galerida larks were associated with short swards (unsafe habitats), with the former avoiding fields with high nest predation rates, and the later avoiding high mongoose abundances. Short-toed lark was associated with fields with short swards and low nest trampling rates. Results suggest that short-toed lark may be the most vulnerable to ecological trapping, because it nests on unsafe habitats and did not show predation risk avoidance. Our approach provides a practical first step to infer vulnerability to a potential ecological trap, though further research is needed to confirm this effect. Management actions increasing nest survival in short sward fields will likely favour grassland bird conservation in intensive Mediterranean farmland.","[Reino, Luis; Schindler, Stefan; Santana, Joana; Porto, Miguel; Moreira, Francisco; Beja, Pedro] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485601 Vairao, Portugal; [Reino, Luis; Santana, Joana; Porto, Miguel; Morgado, Rui; Moreira, Francisco; Beja, Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, InBIO, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Schindler, Stefan] Univ Vienna, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat Ecol & Landscape Ecol, Rennweg 14, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Morgado, Rui] ERENA, Rua Conde Redondo 8,5 Dt, P-1150105 Lisbon, Portugal; [Pita, Ricardo; Mira, Antonio] Univ Evora, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet Polo E, CIBIO InBIO, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Rotenberry, John T.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Reino, L (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485601 Vairao, Portugal.; Reino, L (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, InBIO, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal.",luis.reino@cibio.up.pt,"Mira, Antonio/E-5715-2010; Beja, Pedro/A-7851-2008; Moreira, Francisco/B-2873-2008; Pita, Ricardo/D-3111-2011; Reino, Luis/A-9261-2008; Santana, Joana Figueiredo/C-5941-2009; Morgado, Rui/A-3047-2012; Porto, Miguel/L-7365-2013","Mira, Antonio/0000-0001-6152-0454; Beja, Pedro/0000-0001-8164-0760; Moreira, Francisco/0000-0003-4393-8018; Pita, Ricardo/0000-0001-8562-7301; Reino, Luis/0000-0002-9768-1097; Santana, Joana Figueiredo/0000-0002-4100-8012; Morgado, Rui/0000-0002-6687-0741; Porto, Miguel/0000-0001-7640-0623","FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE; National Funds through FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/BIA/50027/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006821, POCTI/BSE/38601/2001]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [IF/01053/2015];  [PTDC/AGR-AAM/102300/2008];  [SFRH/BPD/93079/2013];  [SFRH/BD/63566/2009];  [SFRH/BPD/97025/2013];  [SFRH/BD/99746/2014];  [SFRH/BPD/109235/2015];  [PTDC/BIA-BIC/2203/2012]","This work is funded by FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE and by National Funds through FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology under the UID/BIA/50027/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006821 and POCTI/BSE/38601/2001.

Despite the recognition that salamanders have the potential to strongly affect ecosystem function through both direct and indirect pathways, little is known regarding the nature of interactions between small vertebrates and the large, predatory arthropods with which they share both microhabitat and prey. Our study was designed to explore interactions between Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, and spiders in the genus Wadotes in an eastern North American temperate forest ecosystem. We were particularly interested in teasing apart behaviors such as territoriality and intraguild predation in an attempt to determine specifically which interaction is most likely responsible for the observed negative relationship between salamander and spider abundance at our field site. Field data indicate that P. cinereus and large syntopic spiders exhibit negative spatial associations in the microhabitat beneath cover objects, a possible indication of interspecific territoriality. In our laboratory experiments, resident salamanders displayed agonistic postures similarly toward both intruding conspecifics and spiders, suggesting that salamanders may perceive large intruding spiders as competitors. Finally, we observed no injuries to individual P. cinereus or adult spiders even though occasional chases and bites by both were recorded during the behavioral trials. We found no evidence that adults or juveniles of P. cinereus were envenomated by adult Wadotes spp., and there were no instances of intraguild predation in this study. Multiple lines of evidence from this study, and others, suggest that the primary interaction between individuals of P. cinereus and large spiders is competitive in nature rather than predatory. We suggest that the cost associated with intraguild predation on salamanders with noxious skin secretions may preclude them from being preyed upon by spiders.","[Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.; Figura, Anna M.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, University Hts, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0608239]; John Carroll University,This work was supported by The National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant [grant number DEB-0608239] to Cari-Ann M.

Taxa that were rare in the field were less abundant at low nutrient concentrations than common taxa, independent of predation. However, some taxa that were rare in the field became highly abundant in the assembled communities, especially under ample nutrient availability. This high abundance points at a possible competitive advantage of some rare bacterial taxa under nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the abundance of most rare bacterial taxa decreased at low resource availability. Since low resource availability will be the prevailing situation in most soils, our data suggests that under those conditions poor competitiveness for limiting resources may contribute to bacterial rarity. Interestingly, taxa that were rare in the field and most successful under predator-free conditions in the lab also tended to be more reduced by predation than common taxa. This suggests that predation contributes to rarity of bacterial taxa in the field. We further discuss whether there may be a trade-off between competitiveness and predation resistance. The substantial variability among taxa in their responses to competition and predation suggests that other factors, for example abiotic conditions and dispersal ability, also influence the local abundance of soil bacteria.","[Kurm, Viola; van der Putten, Wim H.; Geisen, Stefan; Snoek, Basten L.; Bakx, Tanja; Hol, Wilhelmina H.

The marbled crayfish, Procambarus virginalis Lyko, 2017, is an invasive parthenogenetically reproducing crayfish with rapid reproduction, maturation and tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions, which was introduced to many sites across Europe during the last decade. Due to its recent speciation and limited number of field studies, the knowledge of trophic interactions of the marbled crayfish in freshwater food webs is scarce. An invaded area located in Central Europe was studied to identify the marbled crayfish food web interactions using analysis of carbon C-13 and nitrogen N-15 isotopes. This study brings the first insight into the trophic ecology of marbled crayfish in lentic freshwater ecosystems. Algae and detritus were identified as the most important food sources for the marbled crayfish, while zoobenthos and macrophytes were less important. Moreover, the marbled crayfish was found to be an important food source for top fish predators, but marginal for omnivorous fish. Being able to utilize energy from the bottom of the trophic food web, the marbled crayfish may have important roles in the ecosystem, transferring energy to higher trophic levels. It processes allochthonous and autochthonous matter in the ecosystem, thus being a competitor to other organisms with similar food preferences and impacting zoobenthos, algae and macrophytes through predation or direct consumption. To sum up, the marbled crayfish has a strong ability to utilize food sources from different trophic levels, and, thanks to its life history, can be a highly adaptable invader.","[Liptak, Boris; Vesely, Lukas; Blaha, Martin; Buric, Milos; Kouba, Antonin] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-II, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic; [Ercoli, Fabio; Ruokonen, Timo J.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Ercoli, Fabio] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Chair Hydrobiol & Fishery, Kreutswaldi 5, EE-51006 Tartu, Estonia","Kouba, A (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-II, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic.",liptaq.b@gmail.com; veselyl@frov.jcu.cz; fabio.ercoli@emu.ee; blaha@frov.jcu.cz; buric@frov.jcu.cz; timo.j.ruokonen@jyu.fi; akouba@frov.jcu.cz,"Blaha, Martin/AAB-3971-2020; Vesely, Lukas/AAR-4875-2020; Ercoli, Fabio/AAU-8812-2020; Kouba, Antonin/C-9338-2015","Blaha, Martin/0000-0003-3597-6604; Vesely, Lukas/0000-0002-0886-4298; Ercoli, Fabio/0000-0003-2433-6222; Kouba, Antonin/0000-0001-8118-8612","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/01.0024, LO1205]; Grant Agency of the University of South Bohemia [012/2016/Z]; Estonian Research Council, Mobilitas Pluss research project [MOBJD29]","This study was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic - projects CENAKVA (No. CZ.1.05/2.1.00/01.0024), CENAKVA II (No. LO1205 under the NPU I program), the Grant Agency of the University of South Bohemia (012/2016/Z) and the Estonian Research Council, Mobilitas Pluss research project (MOBJD29).

These negative competitive interactions could also affect the coexistence of predatory species. The co-occurrence of aphidophagous ladybird species in crops creates opportunities for CANN and IGP, especially when aphids become scarce. The Lotka-Volterra model predicts the coexistence of two species if intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific interference interactions. Cycloneda sanguinea L. and Eriopis connexa (Germar) (both Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) coexist in sweet pepper crops in La Plata (Argentina) consuming mainly Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The present study used laboratory experiments to estimate levels of CANN and IGP by adults and larvae on eggs, and by adults on larvae, in both the presence and absence of prey (i.e., M.persicae), to explain the effect of prey on coexistence of these two predators. Levels of CANN by C.sanguinea and E.connexa were high in the absence of aphids, and decreased when prey was present. Intraguild predation was bidirectional and asymmetric. Adults and larvae of E.connexa were more voracious IG predators of C.sanguinea than vice versa, the former being the stronger IG predator and interference competitor. Eriopis connexa always won when larvae of the same instar were compared, whereas the larger larva always won when larvae were of different instars, regardless of species. In the presence of prey, CANN by both species decreased, but IGP by E.connexa on C.sanguinea remained high, suggesting that E.connexa could displace C.sanguinea via interspecific interference competition. Other factors potentially affecting the coexistence of C.sanguinea and E.connexa in sweet pepper crops are discussed.","[Rocca, Margarita; Rizzo, Estefania; Greco, Nancy; Sanchez, Norma] Univ Nacl La Plata, Ctr Estudios Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, CONICET, Blvd 120 S No 60 & 64, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Greco, N (corresponding author), Univ Nacl La Plata, Ctr Estudios Parasitol & Vectores CEPAVE, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, CONICET, Blvd 120 S No 60 & 64, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",ngreco@cepave.edu.ar,,,Programa de Incentivos [UNLP N712];  [BID PICT 2012-1624];  [BID PICT 2013-0108],"We thank the three anonymous reviewers whose suggestions helped us improve the manuscript.

We censused the fish community at 86 sites, measuring each fish collected and recording physical variables for each site (pool size, substrate composition, cover, etc.). One member of the fauna, a killifish, Rivulus hartii, was widely distributed in the drainage, occurring alone in each headwater but also encountering other fish species below barrier waterfalls. This pattern allowed us to use Rivulus to test four predictions derived from the species interaction hypothesis: (1) Rivulus density (in grams per square metre) would be depressed at sites with other fish species present, when compared to the density expected from physical characteristics of each site as if Rivulus were alone; (2) Rivulus density would decline at points of contact with the piscivorous fish Hoplias malabaricus; (3) local populations of Rivulus found in pools occupied by the predator would show a smaller maximal size than in pools without the predator; and (4) the growth rate of Rivulus would be lowered in the event of a local invasion by the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, another abundant and sometimes co-occurring species in the watershed. The first three predictions were tested with data from the survey, while the fourth prediction was tested by experiments in a nearby stream. We used a factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the physical variables to four factors. A regression analysis of Rivulus density on the four factors, using 43 Rivulus-only pools, was used to predict Rivulus density in nine pools, each in a different tributary, in which Rivulus first encountered a second species after being the only species present upstream of this pool. The expected density was based solely on the physical characteristics of the pool and represented the expected Rivulus density purely from physical attributes, as if Rivulus were the only species present. Comparison of these expected densities with the actual Rivulus densities revealed a consistent negative impact of the presence of other species on Rivulus density, in support of Prediction 1. Overall, actual Rivulus densities at points of contact with other species were about one-third of the density expected if the other species were absent. The distribution of Rivulus was essentially complementary to that of the piscivorous fish, although only one site provided an unambiguous test of Prediction 2, since Hoplias did not ascend the tributaries in this watershed. The size distribution of Rivulus in populations occurring in pools with predators was dominated by small individuals, with none larger than the median size of Rivulus in predator-free populations, supporting Prediction 3. Finally, the competition experiments revealed that adult Poecilia depressed the growth rate of young Rivulus. We conclude that interspecific interactions are important in structuring the geographical distribution and abundance of Rivulus throughout this tropical watershed, and suggest that interspecific interactions can fragment Rivulus into local populations.","SIENA COLL, DEPT BIOL, LOUDONVILLE, NY 12211 USA; UNIV W INDIES, DEPT ZOOL, ST AUGUSTINE, TRINIDAD TOBAGO","GILLIAM, JF (corresponding author), N CAROLINA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, RALEIGH, NC 27695 USA.",,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Gilliam, James F/D-5605-2013",,,,,47,152,161,3,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1993,74,6,,,,,1856,1870,,10.2307/1939943,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LV242,WOS:A1993LV24200025,,,,,2021-09-27,

These consisted of five groups during the summer: a control, a resident H. sanguineus male or female group, and a resident C. maenas male or female group. We quantified utilization of the shelters at 24 h by counting crabs and fish present. We found significant avoidance of H. sanguineus in the field by benthic hermit crabs (Pagurus spp.) and significant avoidance of C. maenas by the seaboard goby (Gobiosoma ginsburgi). The grubby (Myoxocephalus aenaeus) avoided neither treatment, probably since it tends to be a predator of invertebrates. H. sanguineus avoided C. maenas treatments, whereas C. maenas did not avoid any treatment. Seasonal deployments in the subtidal indicated cohabitation of a number of benthic species in the LIS, with peak shelter use corresponding with increased predation and likely reproductive activity in spring and summer for green crabs (C. maenas), hermit crabs (Pagurus spp.), seaboard gobies (G. ginsburgi), and grubbies (Myoxocephalus aenaeus).","[Hudson, David M.; Reagan, Dugan; Crivello, Joseph F.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Physiol & Neurobiol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Hudson, David M.] Atlanta Metropolitan State Coll, Div Sci Math & Hlth Profess, Atlanta, GA USA","Hudson, DM (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Physiol & Neurobiol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.; Hudson, DM (corresponding author), Atlanta Metropolitan State Coll, Div Sci Math & Hlth Profess, Atlanta, GA USA.",dhudson@atlm.edu,,"Hudson, David/0000-0002-6253-7255",Connecticut Sea Grant College Program; Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut's Outstanding Scholar Program,"Funding of this work was provided by the Connecticut Sea Grant College Program (development funding); the Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of Connecticut (semester of partial assistantship support); and the University of Connecticut's Outstanding Scholar Program (multi-year fellowship).

Plant diversity reduces among-plant competition, and as a result, may have cascading bottom-up effects through altered resource quantity and quality. Less understood are parallel effects of resource heterogeneity on consumer foraging behaviors, and the consequences of such effects for trophic interactions and feedbacks on plant performance. Here, we asked whether genotypic diversity in the herb Ruellia nudiflora influences seed predator (SP) and parasitoid functional responses, and if such effects in turn influence selection on the plant. We established plots with plants of one or five genetic families (pool = 14) and measured fruit, seed predator, and parasitoid abundance. By eliminating direct plant-plant interactions, this experiment explicitly tested for plant diversity effects occurring through altered consumer behaviors (vs. effects through changes in plant quantity or quality). We compared observed plant fitness (under three trophic levels) to projected fitness in the absence of parasitoids (two trophic levels) and in the absence of seed predation (one trophic level) by computing the number of seeds consumed by the SP and the number of seeds rescued from consumption by parasitoids. We then compared the strength and mode of selection on fruit number between levels of diversity, separately under each trophic scenario. Plant diversity did not influence fruit, seed predator, or parasitoid abundance, but did alter plant-SP interactions. SP recruitment resembled a Type II functional response but saturated weakly in polycultures, with fewer SPs at intermediate fruit abundance and more SPs at high fruit abundance relative to monoculture. Parasitoid recruitment was weakly positively density dependent and unaffected by diversity. Importantly, we found that under the bi-trophic scenario, the effect of diversity on SP recruitment altered the mode of selection on fruit number, from directional selection at low diversity to nonlinear (stabilizing) selection at high diversity. In contrast, diversity did not alter selection under mono- or tri-trophic scenarios. Therefore, diversity effects on SP functional responses fed back to alter selection on fruit number, but parasitoids eliminated this linkage by weakening herbivore selection. Collectively, these findings provide novel evidence for the mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks between plant diversity and consumers.","[Abdala-Roberts, Luis; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Abdala-Roberts, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",labdala@uci.edu,,,GAANN fellowshipUS Department of Education; UCMEXUS-CONACYT scholarship,"We thank N.

Artificial night lighting threatens to disrupt strongly conserved light-dependent processes in animals and may have cascading effects on ecosystems as species interactions become altered. Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co-evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti-bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale. 2. We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free-living bat-insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats Neoromicia capensis in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey-selection factors to explain differences in observed diet. 3. Moth consumption by N. capensis was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume +/- SD: 5.91 +/- 6.25%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume +/- SD: 35.42 +/- 17.90%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey-selection models that included high-efficacy estimates for eared-moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared-moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light-induced, decreased eared-moth defensive behaviour. 4. Policy implications. In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth-eating bats and eared moths will face ever-increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad-spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth-friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth-eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.","[Minnaar, Corneile; Minnaar, Ingrid A.; Sole, Catherine L.; McKechnie, Andrew E.] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Boyles, Justin G.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA","Minnaar, C (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",cminnaar@zoology.up.ac.za,"Sole, Catherine/AAB-3095-2020; Boyles, Justin G/A-5152-2010; Sole, Catherine L/A-9200-2012","Sole, Catherine/0000-0002-1578-0973; Sole, Catherine L/0000-0002-1578-0973",Bat Conservation International; South African National Research FoundationNational Research Foundation - South Africa [74604],"We thank Bat Conservation International and the South African National Research Foundation (Grant Number 74604) for financial support; Rietvlei Nature Reserve and Riaan Marais, and Drs Dale Sparks and Eric Britzke for bat detector loans.

However, accessing high trees and their fauna remains difficult; thus, how ants and spiders interact in the canopy remains unclear. To better understand the interspecific interactions between these two dominant arthropod groups, we investigated their spatial distributions at the canopy surface in a tropical rain forest in Borneo. We sampled ants and spiders six times between 2009 and 2011 by sweeping with an insect net at the tree crown surfaces of 190 emergent or tall (20m in height) trees. We collected 438 ant individuals belonging to 94 species and 1850 spider individuals (1630 juveniles and 220 adults) belonging to 142 morphospecies (adults only) from a total of 976 samples. The fact that we collected four times more spider individuals than ant individuals suggests that fewer ants forage at the tree crown surface than previously thought. The number of spider individuals negatively correlated with the number of ant individuals and the number of ant species, indicating significant exclusivity between ant and spider spatial distributions at the tree crown surface. Niche-overlap between the two taxa confirmed this observation. Although our data do not address the causes of these spatial distributions, antagonistic interspecific interactions such as interference behaviors and intra-guild predation are ecological mechanisms that give rise to exclusive spatial distributions.","[Katayama, Motoki; Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko; Tanaka, Hiroshi O.; Itioka, Takao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan; [Kishimoto-Yamada, Keiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Endo, Tomoji] Kobe Coll, Sch Human Sci, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan; [Hashimoto, Yoshiaki] Univ Hyogo, Div Phylogenet, Inst Nat & Environm Sci, Museum Nat & Human Act, Sanda, Hyogo, Japan; [Yamane, Seiki] Kagoshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Kagoshima 890, Japan","Itioka, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan.",ichioka.takao.5m@kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Research Institute for Humanity and Nature [D-04]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [24570109]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24570109] Funding Source: KAKEN","Our study was conducted in accordance with the Memorandums of Understanding signed between the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC, Kuching, Malaysia) and the Japan Research Consortium for Tropical Forests in Sarawak (JRCTS, Sendai, Japan) in November 2005, and between the Sarawak Forest Department (SFD, Kuching, Malaysia) and JRCTS in December 2012.

The Great Lakes contain numerous potential predators of lake trout eggs and fry, some of which are recent invaders, and most of which were probably absent when lake trout most recently re-invaded the Great Lakes after the last ice age. Simple quantitative models of predation suggest that plausible assumptions about prey densities, predator feeding rates, and duration of exposure of predator to prey can lead to very high estimates of predation mortality, in some instances approaching 100%. Indirect evidence from inter-Great Lake comparisons and inland lake examples also suggest that biotic factors may impede successful lake trout colonization. Our synthesis of the evidence leads to recommendations for research to better define field feeding rates of lake trout egg and fry predators and comparative studies of densities of potential egg and fry predators on lake trout spawning reefs. Management options should be designed to provide useful information as well as achieve short-term goals. From a management standpoint we recommend that: newly constructed lake trout reefs should be placed well away from concentrations of potential predators; offshore spawning reefs should be stocked; salmonine stocking, nutrient abatement, and commercial harvest of alewives should all be considered as options to enhance survival of young lake trout; hatchery lake trout should nor be stocked at sites where wild lake trout are showing signs of recovery; and exotic species expansions or introductions must be curtailed to maintain or improve on our recent successes in lake trout rehabilitation.","NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES SCI CTR,ANN ARBOR,MI 48105; ONTARIO MINIST NAT RESOURCES,MAPLE,ON L6A 1S9,CANADA; NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES SCI CTR,LAKE SUPERIOR BIOL STN,ASHLAND,WI 54806; LOYOLA UNIV,DEPT BIOL,CHICAGO,IL 60626; UNIV MICHIGAN,CTR GREAT LAKES & AQUAT SCI,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109; NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES CTR,LAKE ONTARIO BIOL STN,OSWEGO,NY 13126","Jones, ML (corresponding author), ONTARIO MINIST NAT RESOURCES,AQUAT ECOSYST RES,RURAL ROUTE 4,PICTON,ON K0K 2T0,CANADA.",,,"Hudson, Patrick/0000-0002-7646-443X",,,,80,45,46,1,27,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2200 BONISTEEL BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109-2099",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Restoration programs involving this forest type are scarce, and there is a lack of scientific information on how ecological processes such as competition, facilitation, and seed dispersal influence natural forest restoration. This work aims to investigate how use of perches to attract seed dispersers and the influence of pioneer vegetation and soil fertilization could affect the colonization of woody species in a degraded area. An experiment was conducted in an abandoned field where the natural establishment of seeds and seedlings of woody species was monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control); and (3) perches (presence and absence). Seed and seedling abundance, seed and seedling species richness, and seedling mortality were recorded monthly during 12 months. Seed abundance and species richness were significantly greater in places with perches than in control plots. These results were consistent over the year and more pronounced when the surrounding forest produced a higher amount of fruit. Species richness and abundance of seedlings were significantly greater in places with perches than in control plots, and in places with vegetation than without. Soil fertility did not influence seedling establishment. Facilitation and seed dispersal are important factors affecting the colonization of woody species in this subtropical area. Nutrient availability neither regulates the facilitation process nor influences species replacement during the early stages of Araucaria forest succession.","Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Lab Ecol Restauracao, BR-93022000 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil","Ganade, G (corresponding author), Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Lab Ecol Restauracao, CP 275, BR-93022000 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil.",gganade@unisinos.br,"Ganade, Gislene/F-4863-2016","Ganade, Gislene/0000-0002-9291-1025",,,,43,56,60,0,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whole costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a trait-mediated interaction (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.","Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 96516 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Plant Soil & Insect Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Bolnick, DI (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",danbolnick@mail.utexas.edu,"Preisser, Evan/C-3469-2013; Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015","Preisser, Evan/0000-0002-8737-5619; Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296",,,,37,91,92,1,73,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2005,86,10,,,,,2771,2779,,10.1890/04-1249,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971DP,WOS:000232361800022,,,,,2021-09-27,

For populations with multiple age or size cohorts, interactions between cohorts may be an important source of density dependence. Between-cohort interactions may be especially intense for many marine fish populations because of the potential disparity in competitive ability between small new recruits and relatively large resident conspecifics. Indeed, for marine fishes, density dependence in local populations appears to be widespread, particularly during a crucial time period following settlement of larvae into juvenile and adult habitats. I tested whether the demography of newly settled juveniles of the planktivorous fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) was affected by the density of adult conspecifics. Using spatially isolated local populations on coral reefs in the Bahamas, I experimentally transplanted a cohort of juveniles to local populations with three treatments of adult density: adults absent, average adult density, and high adult density (twice average). By following the fate of the transplanted juveniles, I determined that juvenile mortality increased as a function of adult density. Juveniles did not experience significantly higher rates of aggression or lower growth at higher densities of adults. However, in the presence of adults, juveniles generally fed at the back of aggregations, where feeding rates tend to be lower. Automated time-lapse video revealed that predators were found most frequently toward the back of aggregations. Thus competition with adults for prime feeding positions may increase predation risk for juveniles by forcing them to overlap spatially with predators. Consequently, interactions between juveniles and adults could influence the demography of subsequent generations in ways that promote local population regulation.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Webster, MS (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",websterm@bcc.orst.edu,,,,,,50,53,53,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2004,85,4,,,,,986,994,,10.1890/02-0576,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,811IW,WOS:000220766600010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Growth and mortality of postlarval Instar I crabs (3 mm carapace width, forming the junior cohort) at different densities (7, 14, 28 or 56 by tray), or at constant density (56 by tray) but in the presence of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 postlarval Instar V crabs (14 mm. carapace width, forming the senior cohort), was recorded over 104 d. With the junior cohort alone, mean proportional survival of crabs was high (64 to 81 %), independent of density, and similar to that of individually reared crabs (68 %). However, the first and second molts occurred increasingly late as density increased, possibly reflecting growing levels of agonism and competition. Molting crabs were not particularly vulnerable to cannibalism. In treatments mixing the junior and senior cohorts, mean proportional survival of junior crabs decreased from 31 % in the presence of 1 Instar V to 0 % in the presence of 9 or more lnstar V and the prevalence and intensity of limb loss for survivors increased with density of the senior cohort. Cannibalism was the additional or sole source of mortality for junior crabs in treatments with Instar V crabs and it occurred swiftly in the first 5 d of the experiment. Moreover, the presence of any number of larger conspecifics resulted in a severe delay in molting of junior crabs compared to control (no Instar V crabs). Therefore, intercohort predation is more important than intracohort predation or competition as a process effecting year class strength and condition during the early benthic stages of snow crab.","Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Maurice Lamontagne, Direct Invertebres & Biol Expt, Mont Joli, PQ G5H 3Z4, Canada","Sainte-Marie, B (corresponding author), Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Maurice Lamontagne, Direct Invertebres & Biol Expt, 850 Route Mer,CP 1000, Mont Joli, PQ G5H 3Z4, Canada.",sainte-marieb@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,"Sainte-Marie, Bernard/AAG-8413-2020",,,,,58,43,47,0,8,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

However, not all introductions result in high density populations. There are several possible underlying mechanisms behind this variation in population density (e.g. water quality, availability of nesting substratum and biotic interactions), but their relative importance remains poorly known. With this in mind, we studied vital rates (i.e. growth, maturation and reproduction) of pumpkinseed in 19 isolated standing waters of different pumpkinseed density. The fish were collected in early summer to determine their density, sex, age, growth and reproductive effort as well as environmental variables (i.e. availability of nesting substratum, acidity, nutrient concentrations, fish assemblage structure). To construct a population projection model with which to assess the relative importance of each vital rate for the growth of the populations, a stable population structure was assumed. Most environmental variables that affected vital rates (e. g. pH effect on individual growth) had little effect on population growth, or the associations were spurious (e.g. the negative effect of nesting substratum availability on gonad production). The environmental effects were dictated by a strong density dependent feedback of pumpkinseed density on the growth of age 2 fish, and gonad size and maturation state. This finding has important repercussions for management of pumpkinseed invasions: if only part of the population is removed or if complete eradication is followed by a re-introduction, then the population will rapidly recover to its former size. It was not possible to identify environmental drivers of pumpkinseed survival because the data had to be pooled across populations in order to estimate survival rates. However, a negative correlation was found between pumpkinseed and predator density, indicating that predator-induced mortality may be key in determining pumpkinseed invasiveness. Although the measure still needs thorough evaluation, introduction of native piscivores, especially northern pike (Esox lucius), may be a suitable way to prevent pumpkinseed from becoming the dominant species and reduce damage to local biodiversity.","[van Kleef, Hein H.] Bargerveen Fdn, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Jongejans, Eelke] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands","van Kleef, HH (corresponding author), Bargerveen Fdn, POB 9010, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands.",h.vankleef@science.ru.nl; e.jongejans@science.ru.nl,"Jongejans, Eelke/B-4832-2008","Jongejans, Eelke/0000-0003-1148-7419",national research programme 'Development and management of nature quality (O+BN)' of the Dutch ministry of economic affairs; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [840.11.001],"The field study on pumpkinseed was financed by the national research programme 'Development and management of nature quality (O+BN)' of the Dutch ministry of economic affairs.

Each species relies primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Adelie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources.

This spider mite and another less damaging spider mite, Eotetranychus pruni Oudemans, are attacked by a common and often effective phytoseiid predator, Euseius finlandicus (Oudemans). Functional relationships were studied in the field to evaluate the impact of E. pruni and E. finlandicus on T. urticae. The results from this study showed that the predator-mediated apparent competition strongly affected the population dynamics of T. urticae. The addition of the apparent competitor E. pruni alone had little impact on T. urticae densities. Although the release of the predator E. finlandicus alone could result in reduction in T. urticae densities, the greatest reduction in T. urticae densities occurred in plots where both the predator E. finlandicus and apparent competitor E. pruni were released. In apple orchards, the early introduction of both the apparent competitor E. pruni and predator E. finlandicus would evidently increase the population size of the predator E. finlandicus and consequently significantly enhance the control of T. urticae populations.

The results indicate that a niche differentiation in foraging behaviour may be one of several ways to reduce food competition between these coexisting species. However a literature study on prey selectivity did not reveal any support for this suggestion. Interference from Aeshna altered the foraging behaviour of Coenagrion whereas that of Leucorrhinia remained unchanged. Further, Aeshna preyed heavily on Leucorrhinia and to a lesser extent on Coenagrion during interference trials.

Ponds without fish had a high density and biomass of snails and a low biomass of periphyton, whereas snails with molluscivorous fish. In the presence of piscivores, molluscivore populations consisted of low numbers of large individuals. Snail assemblages in piscivore ponds were characterised by relatively high densities of small-bodied detritivorous species and periphyton biomass was not significantly different from ponds with three trophic levels. Thus, predictions from classic food chain theory were upheld in ponds with up to three trophic levels. In ponds with four trophic levels, however, there was a decoupling of the trophic cascade at the piscivore-molluscivore level. Gape-limited piscivory, predation on snails by molluscivores that have reached an absolute size refuge from predation, and changes in food preferences of the dominant snails are suggested to explain the observed patterns.",,"Bronmark, C (corresponding author), LUND UNIV,DEPT ECOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN.",,"Weisner, Stefan/AAP-1457-2020","Weisner, Stefan/0000-0002-5181-0391",,,,48,44,44,1,26,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,1996,108,3,,,,,534,541,,10.1007/BF00333731,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VW512,WOS:A1996VW51200018,28307871,,,,2021-09-27,

Theory suggests a counterintuitive consequence of such intraguild predation: enrichment of the shared resource, for which the intraguild prey must be the superior competitor, reduces the population size of the intraguild prey and may even cause its extinction. Experiments with bacteria (shared resource) and the ciliates Tetrahymena (intraguild prey) and Blepharisma (intraguild predator) confirmed these expectations. Tetrahymena was the better resource competitor. Grown separately, it persisted at lower levels of enrichment and drove bacterial densities to lower levels than did Blepharisma. When grown together with Blepharisma, Tetrahymena declined in density with increasing enrichment, whereas bacteria and Blepharisma increased. The data thus support the theoretically suggested mechanism as the cause of this pattern: with enrichment, increasing densities of bacteria sustained an increasing predation pressure from Blepharisma on Tetrahymena, which overrode the direct positive effect of bacteria as a food source of Tetrahymena. Generalizing from these results, we speculate that staggered invasions of omnivores followed by extinctions of intermediate prey should contribute to the frequently observed unimodal or neutral responses of species richness and food chain length to increasing productivity.","Univ Munich, Inst Zool, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Diehl, S (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Inst Zool, Karlstr 25, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",diehl@zi.biologie.uni-muenchen.de,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,26,101,102,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2001,82,11,,,,,2977,2983,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[2977:IPSFEO]2.0.CO;2,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,491ZB,WOS:000172139500001,,,,,2021-09-27,

This scale was large enough to allow line-transect estimates of lizard abundance, which were related to quantitative (and when possible multivariate) measurements of the structure and floristic composition of vegetation, the abundance of arthropod prey, the relative density of other lizard species, and the climatic data obtained from nearby meteorological stations. Neither the climate not the abundance of other lizards seemed to condition the quantitative distribution of the species. The positive influence of broad-leaved forests on the abundance of P. algirus appeared to be a consequence of structure attributes more directly related to the ecology of lizards than floristic composition per se. Thus, population levels were most highly correlated with the cover of shrubs over 20 cm in height, and once this structural requirement was met, they increased with the abundance of potential prey (itself conditioned by vegetation cover at the ground level and litter cover). We suggest that our results should be interpreted in the context of thermoregulatory, predator avoidance and movement minimization strategies whose influence on survival, and hence abundance, could probably be applied to other insectivorous lizards from temperate zones.","CSIC,MUSEO NACL CIENCIAS NAT,UEI VERTEBRADOS,E-28006 MADRID,SPAIN","DIAZ, JA (corresponding author), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,FAC BIOL,DEPT BIOL ANIM VERTEBRADOS,E-28040 MADRID,SPAIN.",,"Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Diaz, Jose A./H-5559-2015; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016","Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Diaz, Jose A./0000-0001-6047-5065; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531",,,,53,77,81,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Beech is predicted to expand northwards with increased temperature, implying increased competition between the two tree species. Seed survival is a key process in this competition and here we estimate detection times and predation rates of beech and spruce seeds in adjacent beech and spruce forests by combining quantitative and qualitative approaches based on reciprocal seed predation experiments and video surveillance. These experiments were repeated over two growing seasons, and by using a video-surveillance technique, we were able to precisely reveal seed detection times and high seed predation rates, up to 15 seedsmin(-1), with bank vole and chaffinch as main predators. Moreover, the two main predators were different in their seed preferences, that is, beech seeds were exclusively removed or predated by the vole, while the finch consumed spruce seeds only. As we show high predation rates, even small variations in seed predator population densities would impact the regeneration success of beech and spruce. Because the highest predation rates were recorded for spruce seeds, it is likely that this will alter the competitive balance between the two tree species in favour of beech.","[Ellingsen, Vanessa Marie; Asplund, Johan; Ohlson, Mikael] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway","Ohlson, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",mikael.ohlson@nmbu.no,,"Asplund, Johan/0000-0001-5610-4480; Ohlson, Mikael/0000-0003-0237-149X",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [225018],We thank the Research Council of Norway for financial support [project 225018].,,62,4,4,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,1651-1891,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

The food-web modifications are determined by the length of the chains; however, the estimation is biased because traditional sampling strategies damage the chains and, therefore, change the phytoplankton size structure. Sedimentological studies around oceanic fronts have shown high concentrations of giant diatom mats (>1 cm in length), suggesting that the size of diatom chains is underestimated in the pelagic realm. Here, we investigate the variability in size and abundance of phytoplankton chains at the Ushant tidal front (NW France) using the Video Fluorescence Analyzer (VFA), a novel and non-invasive system. CTD and Scanfish profiling characterized a strong temperature and chlorophyll front, separating mixed coastal waters from the oceanic-stratified domain. In order to elucidate spring-neap variations in the front, vertical microstructure profiler was used to estimate the turbulence and vertical nitrate flux. Key findings were: (1) the VFA system recorded large diatom chains up to 10.7 mm in length; (2) chains were mainly distributed in the frontal region, with maximum values above the pycnocline in coincidence with the maximum chlorophyll; (3) the diapycnal fluxes of nitrate enabled the maintenance of the bloom in the frontal area throughout the spring-neap tidal cycle; (4) from spring to neap tide the chains length was significantly reduced; (5) during neap tide, the less intense vertical diffusion of nutrients, as well as the lower turbulence around the chains, intensified nutrient-depleted conditions and, thus, very large chains became disadvantageous. To explain this pattern, we suggest that size plasticity is an important ecological trait driving phytoplankton species competition. Although this plasticity behavior is well known from experiments in the laboratory, it has never been reported from observations in the field.","[Landeira, Jose M.; Lunven, Michel; Sourisseau, Marc] IFREMER, Ctr Brest, Dept Dynam Environm Cotier Pelagos, Plouzane, France; [Ferron, Bruno; Marie, Louis] IFREMER, Ctr Brest, Lab Phys Oceans, CNRS,UMR,IRD,UBO 6523, Plouzane, France; [Morin, Pascal] UPMC, CNRS, UMR 7144, Stn Biol Roscoff, Roscoff, France","Landeira, JM (corresponding author), IFREMER, Ctr Brest, Dept Dynam Environm Cotier Pelagos, Plouzane, France.",jm_landeira@yahoo.es,"Landeira, Jose Maria/AAB-2183-2019; Marie, Louis/A-1815-2016; Morin, Pascal/A-1112-2016; FERRON, Bruno/L-5649-2015","Landeira, Jose Maria/0000-0001-6419-2046; Marie, Louis/0000-0003-2583-0994; Morin, Pascal/0000-0003-2766-1821; FERRON, Bruno/0000-0002-2107-0900","GIS EUROPOLE MER; Axis 2 Global change, Ocean and Marine Ecosystems; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-05-JCJC-0153]; IFREMER","GIS EUROPOLE MER (http://www.europolemer.eu/en/home.php) and in particular the Axis 2 Global change, Ocean and Marine Ecosystems funded the postdoctoral fellowship to JM Landeira.

The study was conducted at three sites in the Chacopata Lagoon complex in northeastern Venezuela between January 1985 and September 1986, using shorebird census data, monthly sampling of intertidal invertebrates, and exclosure experiments. The invertebrates collected were divided into three groups: (i) polychaetes (less than or equal to 50 mm in length), (ii) small bivalves (2-3 mm in length), and (iii) other species. The overall density of shorebirds foraging in the Chacopata Lagoon complex was very high, exceeding the densities reported for most other staging and overwintering areas by a wide margin. The abundance of shorebirds in the study area was related primarily to the density of polychaetes, their main prey. At two of the study sites, the arrival of fall migrants followed a significant increase in polychaete numbers. The increase in shorebird numbers in autumn was negligible at the third site, where poly chaete density was lower than at the other sites. The impact of shorebird predation on their invertebrate prey varied seasonally, as did the extent of the foraging area available to them. The exclosure experiment revealed significant differences in the density of polychaetes inside and outside the exclosures only during, or shortly after, the fall migration period. The variability in the conclusions drawn from other studies examining prey depletion by shorebirds in tropical environments may be explained by differences in the length of sampling periods and seasonal variations in the numbers of foraging shorebirds, the energy demands of moult, fat deposition, and the intertidal surface area available for feeding. The impact of seasonal variables such as these should be taken into consideration when designing studies to measure prey depletion by shorebirds; such objectives may necessitate long-term studies.","UNIV MONTREAL,DEPT SCI BIOL,MONTREAL,PQ H3C 3J7,CANADA",,,,,,,,59,37,38,0,15,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

To test the hypothesis that habitat modification by seaweed canopies can have direct positive effects on rocky intertidal communities, we quantified habitat amelioration by Ascophyllum nodosum canopies and its consequences on understory organisms in the Gulf of Maine, USA. At the upper and lower elevational borders of the algal canopy, we examined the recruitment, growth, and survivorship of common benthic organisms in canopy removal, canopy control, and shaded canopy removal plots intended to mimic canopy habitat modification. The algal canopy greatly reduced potential physical stresses, particularly at high tidal heights. Maximum daily rock temperatures were 5 degrees-10 degrees C lower and evaporative water loss was an order of magnitude less under the canopy than in canopy removal plots. The response of understory organisms to canopy removal, however, was species specific and somewhat idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, in general, at the high intertidal border of the canopy the recruitment, growth, and survival of understory organisms were enhanced by the canopy, whereas at the low intertidal border canopy effects were negative or neutral. Nearly half of the interactions we studied were positive in the high zone. In contrast to positive canopy effects on understory organism recruitment and growth at high tidal heights, consumer pressure was severe under the canopy, particularly at low tidal heights. Green crab predation is likely responsible for limiting understory mussel densities, while grazing by the snail, Littorina littorea, keeps understory substrate clear of algal recruits. The amelioration of harsh physical conditions by algal canopies can have strong direct positive effects in high rocky intertidal communities by enhancing organism recruitment, growth, and survival. These canopy effects, however, may often be offset by increased consumer pressure at low tidal heights. These types of habitat modification effects are likely to be pervasive in many other terrestrial and marine communities exposed to harsh physical conditions.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Bertness, MD (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,"Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",,,,51,287,292,3,169,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1999,80,8,,,,,2711,2726,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2711:TTRCOP]2.0.CO;2,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,264VR,WOS:000084204100021,,,,,2021-09-27,

Tadpoles of three species (Wood-house's toad /Bufo woodhousii/, gray treefrog [Hyla versicolor], and green frog [Rana clamitans]), representing a commonly encountered assemblage in Missouri, were reared in outdoor polyethylene pond mesocosms. We determined the effects of initial tadpole density (low or high), Predation (newts [Notophthalmus viridescens] absent or present), chemical exposure (0, 3.5, or 7.0 mg/L carbaryl) and their interactions on body mass, larval period, and survival to metamorphosis. Green frogs in high-density ponds did not reach metamorphosis, but metamorphs in but-density ponds and tadpoles in high-density ponds were not significantly affected by treatments or their interaction. Carbaryl reduced survival to metamorphosis in toads and treefrogs and increased mass at metamorphosis in treefrogs. Effects of carbaryl varied with predator environment and initial larval density. Interactions of carbaryl with predator and with density may result in an indirect effect of carbaryl causing increased food resources through the elimination of zooplankton populations that may compete for similar resources. Our results indicate that differences in biotic conditions influenced the potency of carbaryl and that even but concentrations induce changes that may alter community dynamics in ways not predicted from single-factor, laboratory-based studies.","Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Boone, MD (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 105 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",mdb7ef@mizzou.edu,,"Semlitsch, Raymond/0000-0002-7999-5762",,,,45,136,142,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

In order to understand the role of competition between IGprey, the experiments included treatments with one IGpredator, with one or four IGprey and EGprey (Aphis fabae Scopoli) ranging from zero to sufficient aphids to satiate the predators for 12, 24 or 48 h. Increases in EGprey and IGprey densities did not alter the direction, but decreased the magnitude and symmetry of IGP. Predation on one individual of IGprey decreased from more than 80%, in the absence of EGprey, to from 6% to 53%, at higher EGprey densities. Decrease in IGP was less when H. axyridis was the IGpredator. Even at high EGprey densities, eggs and 2nd larval stages of C undecimpunctata were vulnerable to IGP and the level of predation was 40% and 53%. The presence of more than one IGprey increased the magnitude of IGP mainly at EGprey densities sufficient to satiate the predators for 12 and 24 h, suggesting that competition between the IGpredator and IGprey may be one of the processes promoting IGP. These results and those of other authors suggest that H. axyridis has the potential to be an IGpredator, mainly of the most vulnerable stages of IGprey. Thus, H. axyridis may negatively affect the survival of C undecimpunctata, when these two species exploit the same resources. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In the case of rare and imperiled species, such indirect interactions may affect the persistence and recovery of local populations. This study examined the effects of coral neighborhood composition on the foraging behavior and impact of the corallivorous gastropod, Coralliophila abbreviata. We conducted a manipulative field experiment in which focal colonies of the threatened scleractinian coral Acropora cervicornis had no neighbors, conspecific neighbors, alternative prey (Orbicella faveolata) neighbors, or non-prey (Porites asteroides) neighbors. Individually tagged C. abbreviata were then seeded into the study area and allowed to colonize the experimental plots. Initial colonization was significantly affected by the species of neighboring corals and snail abundance after colonization was negatively correlated with focal colony growth. Snails exhibited a strong prey preference for A. cervicornis over O. faveolata and responded numerically to neighborhood quality (i.e., relative preference for neighboring corals). Thus, conspecific neighbors had the greatest predator-mediated negative effect on focal colony performance followed by O. faveolata neighbors. The results suggest that C. abbreviata mediate apparent competition between O. faveolata and A. cervicornis as both species contributed to the local abundance of their shared predator. Additionally, home range estimates for tagged C. abbreviata were calculated, compared among sexes, and found to be significantly greater for males than for females.

However, a problem arises for understanding coexistence of multiple species if they share critical resources too generally. Here, we employ an experimental framework grounded in nutritional physiology to show that closely related, cooccurring and generalist-feeding herbivores (seven grasshopper species in the genus Melanoplus; Orthoptera: Acrididae) eat protein and carbohydrate in different absolute amounts and ratios even if they eat the same plant taxa. The existence of species-specific nutritional niches provides a cryptic mechanism that helps explain how generalist herbivores with broadly overlapping diets might coexist. We also show that performance by grasshoppers allowed to mix their diets and thus regulate their protein-carbohydrate intake matched optimal performance peaks generated from nochoice treatments. These results indicate the active nature of diet selection to achieve balanced diets and provide buffering capacity in the face of variable food quality. Our empirical findings and experimental approach can be extended to generate and test predictions concerning the intensity of biotic interactions between species, the relative abundance of species, yearly fluctuations in population size, and the nature of interactions with natural enemies in tritrophic niche space.","[Behmer, Spencer T.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Joern, Anthony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Behmer, ST (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Heep Bldg,Room 509, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",s-behmer@tamu.edu,,"Behmer, Spencer/0000-0002-5038-1046",,,,52,162,170,1,104,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Many meiofauna can be reared in relatively easy-to-maintain cultures, and over 50 species have been used in laboratory-based bioassay experiments. Meiofauna species may be exceedingly sensitive to pollutants; reproduction and development are typically much more sensitive than adult survival. Sublethal effects of pollutants are becoming commonly studied with meiofauna because meiofauna lend themselves well to experiments that measure ingestion rate, and pollutant effects on fecundity and population density can be predicted from whole-life-cycle experiments with demographic techniques. Toxic responses of sediment-associated meiofauna generally reflect sediment and porewater chemistry. However, some meiofauna may form cryptic species complexes, and differences in tolerance within species and among cryptic species are possible, increasing uncertainty in toxicity tests. A model nematode species (i.e., Caenorhabditis elegans) and various model harpacticoid copepods (e.g., Tigriopus, Tisbe, Amphiascus) have been identified, and are increasingly being used in association with a growing baseline of biological, genetic and ecological data to elucidate the mechanisms of toxicity. Meiofauna have also been used in studies that determine acclimatory and genetic responses to contaminant exposure, and that examine gene expression profiles from contaminated environments. Field and microcosm experiments with hazardous substances suggest that meiofauna have many poorly understood species interactions with primary producers, predators and competitors that are manifested as indirect, ecological effects in the presence of contaminants. The continued use of meiofauna in assessment studies for newly discovered environmental concerns is justified.","[Fleeger, J. W.; Carman, K.

Galler larvae of three species exit their galls in late summer and are exposed to predatory ants, while larvae of one species (stem-gallers) remain within their galls to overwinter. Many ant species (Formicidae) are patchily abundant in willows in northern Arizona. The abundances of four galler species and the activity levels of ant assemblages were assessed in census studies performed on variable numbers of willow clones between 1986 and 1989. Two distinct types of sawfly gall communities were found on willow clones in the study area, communities composed of four galler species (stem, leaf, and petiole galls, and leaf folds), and communities composed primarily of stem galls. Clones with low ant activity levels support the former, whereas those with high activity levels support the latter. Experimental introductions of larvae of two exiting species (leaf- and petiole-gallers) into and beneath natural willow clones with high and low ant activity levels showed that larvae are quickly captured by ants in and under high activity willows. Ants were not selective to larval species in these introductions, and were clearly shown to be generalist predators when experimentally offered two species of larvae. Experimental introductions of leaf- and petiole-galler larvae into four clones with high ant activity in 1987 and 1988 did not result in higher gall populations in the following year, indicating that larvae did not survive to recruit into those clones as adults. Experimental caging of leaf- and petiole-galler adults onto branches of high activity clones resulted in the establishment of modest populations of both species, followed by seemingly normal gall development patterns and larval survival rates inside galls. We conclude that the absence of leaf and petiole galls from willows with high ant activity is due to intensive larval predation by generalist ants, and not to plant resistance factors. This means that generalist and opportunistic predatory ants can significantly structure insect gall communities through differential predation that is dependent upon specific life history traits of some gallers.","NO ARIZONA UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,FLAGSTAFF,AZ 86011; MUSEUM NO ARIZONA,FLAGSTAFF,AZ 86001",,,,,,,,44,28,29,0,7,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1992,73,3,,,,,1028,1037,,10.2307/1940177,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU767,WOS:A1992HU76700027,,,,,2021-09-27,

There have, however, been no studies on the cost of sharing an intermediate host with other parasites in terms of reduced adult parasite fecundity. Even if larval parasites suffer a reduction in size, caused by crowding, virtually nothing is known about longer-lasting effects after transmission to the definitive host. This study is the first to use in vitro cultivation with feeding of adult trematodes to investigate how numbers of parasites in the intermediate host affect the size and fecundity of adult parasites. For this purpose, we examined two different infracommunities of parasites in crustacean hosts. Firstly, we used experimental infections of Maritrema novaezealandensis in the amphipod, Paracalliope novizealandiae, to investigate potential density-dependent effects in single-species infections. Secondly, we used the crab, Macrophthalmus hirtipes (Ocypodidae), naturally infected by the trematodes, M. novaezealandensis and Levinseniella sp., the acanthocephalan, Profilicollis spp., and an acuariid nematode. These four helminths all develop and grow in their crustacean host before transmission to their bird definitive host by predation. In experimental infections, we found an intensity-dependent establishment success, with a decrease in the success rate of cercariae developing into infective metacercariae with an increasing dose of cercariae applied to each amphipod. In natural infections, we found that M. novaezealandensis-metacercariae achieved a smaller volume, on average, when infrapopulations of this parasite were large. Small metacercariae produced small in vitro-adult worms, which in turn produced fewer eggs. Crowding effects in the intermediate host thus were expressed at the adult stage in spite of the worms being cultured in a nutrient-rich medium. Furthermore, excystment success and egg-production in M. novaezealandensis in naturally infected crabs were influenced by the number of co-occurring Profilicollis cystacanths, indicating interspecific interactions between the two species. Our results thus indicate that the infracommunity of larval helminths in their intermediate host is interactive and that any density-dependent effect in the intermediate host may have lasting effects on individual parasite fitness.

Although several studies reported a positive diversity - productivity relationship, the role of soil animals has been largely neglected. Nematodes are among the most widespread and important herbivores causing substantial yield losses in agriculture; however, impacts of nematodes on the diversity - productivity relationship in semi-natural plant communities have not been investigated until today. In the framework of the Jena Experiment (Thuringia, Germany) we established control and nematicide treated subplots to manipulate nematode densities on plots varying in plant species (1-16) and functional group richness (1-4). We explored the interacting effects of nematicide application and plant diversity on the main trophic groups of nematodes and on aboveground plant productivity. Nematicide application reduced the number of nematodes significantly, particularly that of plant feeders and predators. The negative impact of nematicide application on plant and bacterial feeders depended however on the diversity of the plant community. Total plant shoot biomass tended to decrease in the presence of ambient nematode densities. In detail, nematode effects varied however with plant functional group identity by reducing only the shoot biomass of herbs significantly but not that of legumes. Furthermore, the shoot biomass of grasses tended to decrease in the presence of ambient nematode densities. In contrast to total shoot biomass, nematodes decreased grass shoot biomass only in high diverse but not in low diverse plant communities. Thus, the present study for the first time highlights that nematodes likely modify the community structure und functions of semi-natural plant communities by altering the competition between plant functional groups and by attenuating the diversity - productivity relationship.

We experimentally tested whether pit design can be modified by intraspecific competition for space in larvae ofMyrmeleon crudelis, a common sit-and-wait predator that digs conical pit traps in the soil to capture walking arthropods. In a tropical forest in Costa Rica, we measured pit dimensions, larval body size, and the level of competition (i.e., density of neighboring traps) in 40 antlion larvae. These larvae were then taken to the laboratory and allowed to build new traps in individual containers. We measured within-individual changes in the size of traps in the field and in the laboratory, and related these to the level of competition experienced in the field. Larvae with relatively high levels of competition in the field showed a greater increase in the size of their pits in the laboratory. This change was independent of larval size. Larvae with none or few neighbors in the field showed little change in their pit sizes, whereas those with higher competition levels increased their diameter and depth up to 1,400% and 1,000%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that, at least in high-density aggregations, pit design is restricted by competition in addition to the constraints imposed by body size. This work suggests that biotic interactions can play a role in the design of extended phenotypes in sit-and-wait predators that live in dense aggregations.","[Farji-Brener, Alejandro G.] Univ Nacl Comahue, LIHO Lab Invest Hormigas, INIBIOMA, CONICET, Pasaje Gutierrez 1125, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Farji-Brener, Alejandro G.] Univ Nacl Comahue, CRUB, Pasaje Gutierrez 1125, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Juncosa-Polzella, Agostina S.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina; [Tejada, Daniela Madrigal] Univ Nacl Costa Rica, Heredia, Costa Rica; [Centeno-Alvarado, Diego] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Lab Biol Floral & Reprod, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Hernandez-Soto, Mariana] Inst Ecol INECOL, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Soto-Huaira, Mayori] Univ Nacl San Agustin de Arequipa, Museo Hist Nat, Arequipa, Peru; [Gutierrez-Cruz, Sebastian] Museo Hist Nat Noel Kempff Mercado, Santa Cruz, Bolivia","Farji-Brener, AG (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, LIHO Lab Invest Hormigas, INIBIOMA, CONICET, Pasaje Gutierrez 1125, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.; Farji-Brener, AG (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, CRUB, Pasaje Gutierrez 1125, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",alefarji@yahoo.com,"Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/I-8372-2019","Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/0000-0001-7251-3866; Centeno-Alvarado, Diego/0000-0003-0273-8538; Madrigal-Tejada, Daniela/0000-0002-3943-4557; Juncosa Polzella, Agostina Silvia/0000-0002-6686-2012; Soto-Huaira, Mayori/0000-0002-9760-9132; Gutierrez-Cruz, Sebastian/0000-0001-8660-2640; Hernandez-Soto, Mariana/0000-0002-2136-6269",,,,47,2,2,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,NOV,2020,126,11,,,,,1031,1037,,10.1111/eth.13079,,JUL 2020,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,NW5HD,WOS:000550929400001,,,,,2021-09-27,

The provisioning of floral resources in crop fields can ameliorate this problem by providing nectar and pollen to natural enemies. To select an appropriate floral resource, plants must be screened for their flowering times and attractiveness to natural enemies and pests. We tested the attractiveness of nine species of annual flowering plants to hoverflies, which are important predators of aphids in California lettuce fields. We also sampled arthropods in the foliage of tested plants, to assess the abundances of other natural enemy and pest species that were present. Tested plants included three commonly-used insectary plants and six flowering plant species that showed potential as either harvestable herbs or cut flowers. Harvestable insectary plants may provide additional economic incentive for growers to set aside land for floral resources. The commonly-used insectary plant sweet alyssum consistently attracted the most hoverflies and the least bees, while potentially harvestable plants attracted few hoverflies. Competition with bees may have reduced hoverfly visits to several of the tested plant species. Sweet alyssum also stayed in bloom the longest, and contained the highest numbers of predatory hemipterans. Results suggest that plants should be screened for their attractiveness to not only the target biological control agent, but also to other potential competitors for floral resources. While this initial study focused on a limited selection of harvestable annual plants, a wide variety of other marketable plant species, particularly perennials, remain to be tested for their attractiveness to hoverflies or other beneficial arthropods.

Thus, quantitative assessments of predator-prey relationships are key to understanding these effects. Here, we documented the patterns and processes underlying the effects of 2 predatory muricid gastropods, Mancinella armigera and Menathais tuberosa, on the sessile vermetid gastropod Ceraesignum maximum. We used a combination of field surveys and manipulative lab and field experiments to quantify muricid abundances, predator feeding rates, and effects of predator density on vermetid mortality. The 2 predators exhibited spatial segregation, with M. armigera being more common close to the reef crest and M. tuberosa increasing in density away from and shoreward of the reef crest. We demonstrated that recently killed vermetids were more common in the vicinity of M. armigera. Laboratory assays revealed that M. armigera killed 0.55 C. maximum predator(-1) d(-1), a rate that was similar to 60% greater than for M. tuberosa. Although the 2 predators were spatially segregated in the field, they did not demonstrate interference competition or intraguild predation in the lab. Consumption rates of C. maximum by M. armigera in the field were approximately equal to those quantified in the lab, and although consumption rates decreased over time, predator density had no effect on predator consumption rate. In addition, we observed no evidence of size selectivity by predators. This study is the first to quantitatively examine predator-prey interactions involving C. maximum, and our findings suggests that muricids can limit vermetid populations where both are present.","[Brown, A.

Two studies were conducted to investigate the ability of wildflowers to influence populations of natural enemies. In the wildflower study, 24 early, mid and late season flowering species native to the USA Mid-Atlantic region were evaluated for their attractiveness to natural enemies and competitiveness with a perennial grass over two years. Insectary values were assigned to each wildflower based on length of flowering and relative attractiveness adjusted for background natural enemy activity. Wildflower species differed significantly in their ability to attract natural enemies, provide floral resources during the growing season, and maintain continued growth and flowering when contiguous with a perennial grass. Over two years, 45.9 to 82.4% of beneficials captured on sticky cards were hymenopteran parasitoids and their abundance was the major driver accounting for differences among wildflower species. At the farm level, we evaluated effects of wildflower addition to grass buffers on natural enemies in adjacent cornfields. Significant increases in taxa richness, abundance, and diversity of beneficial arthropod communities were measured in cornfields adjacent to grass buffers with wildflowers. Taken together, both studies provide evidence that insectary wildflowers can augment natural enemies in crop fields. However, differential attraction, flowering period and competitive abilities of wildflowers should be considered when selecting insectary species to mix with permanent grass buffers.","[Dively, Galen P.; Leslie, Alan W.; Hooks, Cerruti R.

These hypotheses have been built up with oceanic islands in mind or islands where isolation is high and colonization rate relatively limited. This set of hypotheses, however, may not be applicable to other inland-island systems or recently fragmented landscapes. We investigated how island life leads to phenotypic changes in two rodent metapopulations: deer mice and red-backed voles in a fragmented system on a river in Canada. From 2013 to 2016, we sampled 454 deer mice and 665 red-backed voles spread across 10 islands and six mainland sites on river shores. We compared body mass, tail and hindfoot length, exploration and reaction towards predators, between individuals from island and mainland sites, and assessed the role of connectivity, isolation and area of islands. Insular individuals from both species were less aggressive towards potential predators and insular mice were more thorough explorers compared to mainland ones. Male mice were heavier and juvenile mice had longer tails on islands. However, contrary to expectations, we found negative relationships between aggressiveness and juvenile exploration score with patch connectivity for mice. Island connectivity significantly affected tail length of mice through a concave relationship. Finally, vole aggressiveness and exploration of male mice were positively correlated to island isolation. Our study supports only partially the predictions of the island syndrome hypothesis. It provides empirical evidence that inland-island life can modify traits in deer mice, but less so in red-backed voles in a non-oceanic system. It also raises questions about the direct causal factors of these changes in a naturally fragmented landscape, and urges for more predictive models about phenotypic/genetic divergence among populations in natural and artificial fragmented landscapes.","[Juette, Tristan; Jameson, Joel W.; Reale, Denis] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Garant, Dany] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada","Juette, T (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",tristanjuette@hotmail.com,,"REALE, Denis/0000-0002-0419-7125; Juette, Tristan/0000-0002-0795-948X",Fonds de Recherche du Quebec -Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Societe Francaise d'Ecologie et d'Evolution (SFE2),"This research was funded by a Fonds de Recherche du Quebec -Nature et Technologies (FRQNT) team grant to DR, DG and L.

Birds and ants removed herbivores but simultaneously benefited them by removing predatory arthropods. Birds and ants had net negative and positive effects, respectively,on the abundance of herbivore prey, supporting the notion that vertebrate predators have stronger negative effects on herbivores than do arthropod predators. Aphids (ant-tended and untended species) constituted three-quarters of herbivore biomass. The effect of birds on ant-tended aphids was twice that on untended aphid species or tended aphid species without ants. This was not due to there being more ant-tended aphids for birds to prey on; tended and untended aphid species were in similar abundances in the absence of birds. Instead, the effects of birds were strengthened by attributes of the mutualism that rendered tended aphids susceptible to predation. These dynamics led to nonadditive effects of birds and ants: birds only reduced tended aphid species and total herbivore abundances on trees with ants, while ants only increased tended aphid species and total herbivore abundances in the absence of birds. Consequently, top predators in this system only influenced total herbivore abundance when they disrupted an ant-aphid mutualism.","Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Mooney, KA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",kailen.mooney@tritrophic.org,,,,,,53,34,38,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2006,87,7,,,,,1805,1815,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1805:TDOAAM]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,069OK,WOS:000239457900018,16922329,,,,2021-09-27,

Such multispecies interactions can give rise to trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed. Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils. Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established populations.","[Swope, Sarah M.; Parker, Ingrid M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Swope, Sarah M.] ARS, USDA, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, Albany, CA 94710 USA","Swope, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",swope@biology.ucsc.edu,"Parker, Ingrid M./ABH-2014-2020","Parker, Ingrid M./0000-0002-4847-1827",USDA's Exotic and Invasive Weeds Research Unit; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0808337],"We thank Marci Beitch and Laurel Warddrip for their diligent work in the field.

Here, we investigated whether two defence devices, a ploy and a muzzle, can protect bee colonies. Our results showed that neither device was able to reduce the number of hornets present in front of the hive or their predation efficiency (i.e. the number of captured bees). However, we found more flying bees and a smaller bee carpet in the presence of a muzzle, evidence that this very cheap method of protection can reduce the hornets' impact on the activity of the bee colony and thus probably enabling its survival. We also showed that the number of agonistic interactions amongV. velutinaindividuals increased with the number of hornets but without influencing the predation rate in our experimental conditions. The threat to honey bees is now well described, but the Asian yellow-legged hornet very likely has an impact on another insect species that has been the subject of far fewer studies: The native European hornet (Vespa cabro). Monitoring of several apiaries suggests that high densities of bothV. velutinaandV. crabroare exclusive and that the two species are engaged in an exploitative competition interaction. We are thus already in a position to underline the need for combined protection, as well as for further studies to better understand the ecology ofV. velutina, to reduce the damage they cause.","[Bonnefond, Laura; Paute, Sandrine; Andalo, Christophe] Univ Paul Sabatier, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, CNRS, UMR 5174,IRD, Bat 4R1,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France","Andalo, C (corresponding author), Univ Paul Sabatier, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, CNRS, UMR 5174,IRD, Bat 4R1,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France.",christophe.andalo@univ-tlse3.fr,,,LABEX [ANR-10-LABX-41]; IDEX [ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02],"LABEX, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-41; IDEX, Grant/Award Number: ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02",,43,0,0,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-2048,1439-0418,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

The aphid, Chaitophorus populicola, is found only in association with ants, which provide tending services and protection from predators. As a consequence, aphid abundance declined by 88% on host plants located greater than or equal to6 m from an ant mound. Differences in host plant quality resulted in aphid fecundity being greatest on narrowleaf cottonwoods, 7-22% less on backcross hybrids, 37-46% less on F-1 hybrids, and 57-61% less on Fremont cottonwoods. Due to the combined effects of these factors, we found that the realized aphid habitat was only 21% of their potential habitat. On trees where aphids and tending ants are present, aphids and ants greatly outnumber any other arthropod species; therefore, we examined the hypothesis that the factors affecting aphid density and distribution are also determinants of arthropod community structure. On a per-tree basis, observational data showed that arthropod species richness was 51% greater and abundance was 67% greater on trees where aphid-ant mutualists were absent relative to trees where they were present. When aphids were experimentally removed and ants abandoned the tree, we found the same pattern. On a per-tree basis, arthropod species richness increased by 57%, and abundance increased by 80% where aphid-ant mutualists were removed, relative to control trees. Overall, a total of 90 arthropod species were examined in this study: 56% were found only on trees without aphid-ant mutualists, 12% were found only on trees with aphid-ant mutualists, and 32% were common to both. Specific guilds were also affected; the aphid-ant mutualism had a negative effect on herbivores, generalist predators, and other species of tending ants, and a positive effect on specialist enemies of aphids. These results suggest that, by examining the factors responsible for the population dynamics of a common herbivore, we may also uncover mechanisms that determine arthropod community structure. Furthermore, studies that address the role of mutualism in shaping communities are underrepresented in the literature; these results emphasize the importance of mutualism in ecological communities.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Wimp, GM (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",,"Wimp, Gina/AAT-3776-2020",,,,,66,138,150,2,60,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2001,82,2,,,,,440,452,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[0440:BCOPAH]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,403VX,WOS:000167064100012,,,,,2021-09-27,

There are large differences in these assemblages and in the physical structure of coralline turf between low- and mid-shore areas. Using reciprocal experimental transplantations of coralline turf on a rocky shore near Sydney, Australia, hypotheses were tested to differentiate among three models: (i) algal-specific properties, (ii) height-specific factors and (iii) their interaction, which may explain variation in macrofaunal assemblages at different heights on the shore. Similar hypotheses were also tested for eight common species, with patterns of abundance correlated with tidal height. Results showed that algal-specific properties had little influence on differences between macrofauna in low- and mid-shore areas. Height-specific factors must be responsible for these differences. The amount of sediment among the fronds also influenced spatial patterns of abundance of some animals. Most work on macrofaunal assemblages associated with algal turf has focussed on effects of physical and biological characteristics of the habitats. Shifting attention to focus on the effects of biological processes mediated by local environmental conditions (e.g. competition or predation) will therefore be a major step forward in understanding the ecology of these diverse faunal assemblages.

I evaluate these assertions and amend information about this South American case study. Categorizing deer along narrow characteristics may be too restrictive to allow accurate predictions about interactions. More effective is considering the magnitude of plasticity (behavioral, phenotypic, genetic). The dichotomy of native versus exotic deer masks situations where prevailing ecological conditions are far from 'native', such as absence of predators, and such results from artificial settings have limitations. Studies used to contrast effects on vegetation from exotic red deer (Cervus elaphus) versus native huemul did not analyze native deer and provided no data to support conclusions in the review. Huemul were concluded to have high trophic overlap with red deer whose diet, however, was determined in another habitat where the food item of supposed major overlap was absent, and suggesting that red deer might cause exploitation competition was not supported by cited data. There was no mention that huemul are foremost exposed to livestock rather than exotic deer. Concluding that exotic prey including red deer increase predator density resulting in increased predation of huemul (apparent competition), was not supported by cited studies. To the contrary, high-density puma (Puma concolor) could not prevent guanaco (Lama guanicoe) from increasing > 13-fold, nor that huemul expanded into these sites. Not only were those studies opposite to conclusions in the review, but none had studied huemul nor predator population trends. Data from little known species like huemul should be used with reservations when aiming at generalizations.","[Flueck, Werner T.] Univ Atlantida Argentina, Inst Nat Resources Anal, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Flueck, Werner T.] Natl Council Sci Res, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Flueck, Werner T.] Univ Basel, Swiss Trop Inst, Basel, Switzerland","Flueck, WT (corresponding author), Univ Atlantida Argentina, Inst Nat Resources Anal, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",wtf@deerlab.org,"Snoeck, Robert/V-3867-2017; Andrei, Graciela/V-7721-2017","Snoeck, Robert/0000-0002-7586-5434; Andrei, Graciela/0000-0003-2609-4896","El Retorno; Bariloche; Cyon GmbH, Switzerland","I thank Andrea Taylor, Associate Editor for Wildlife Research, for constructive criticism during four revisions involving five additional anonymous reviewers, which substantially improved the paper, although in the end it was declined.

Both polyphagous predatory mite species have been previously shown to interact directly through predation on each other. The present study demonstrated that the adult females of T. pyri and K. aberrans are able to discriminate between con- and heterospecific larvae and protonymphs and that they prefer to prey upon heterospecifics when given the choice. Hunger did not reduce the propensity of the females to prefer heterospecifics over conspecifics. For proto-and deutonymphs the trends followed the results obtained with the adult females, but the preference for heterospecifics was not distinct enough to be significant. In competitive situations reciprocal predation may be a crucial mechanism in the interaction of polyphagous phytoseiid species and may contribute significantly to population persistence.

The tradeoff between competitive ability and predation resistance is also a widely-described phenomenon; however, this tradeoff is not usually postulated as a cause of ecological succession. Early successional species that arrive before predator colonization could be either (1) less vulnerable to predation than their successors, by virtue of being poor competitors (direct competition-predation tradeoff); or (2) equally or more vulnerable to predation, because they normally colonize ahead of predators in succession and therefore are not evolutionarily adapted to avoid predators that they rarely encounter (no competition-predation tradeoff). To test these alternative hypotheses, we established water-filled containers in an oak-hickory forest. We allowed half of the containers to be naturally colonized by early-successional Culex mosquitoes, mid-successional Aedes mosquitoes, and the mosquito predator Toxorhynchites rutilus. In the other half of the containers, we prevented Aedes colonization via systematic removal of Aedes eggs, but allowed Culex and T. rutilus to colonize. The numbers of mature Culex larvae and pupae, and later the total number of Culex, were significantly greater in containers where Aedes had been removed, which suggests that Culex are competitively suppressed by Aedes. Toxorhynchites rutilus abundance and colonization rate were unaffected by the removal of Aedes, and densities of both Culex and Aedes decreased significantly with T. rutilus abundance in both treatments. In-laboratory bioassays showed that Culex were significantly more vulnerable to predation by T. rutilus than were Aedes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Culex and Aedes demonstrate a direct colonization-competition tradeoff, and are inconsistent with the hypothesis of a direct competition-predation tradeoff.","[Murrell, Ebony G.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Murrell, EG (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Campus Box 4120, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",egmurrell@gmail.com; sajulian@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",Beta Lambda chapter of Phi Sigma Society; NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15 AI075306-01]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI075306] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We would like to thank J.A.

Using field enclosures with three densities of A. tigrinum and two of H. eximia and two degrees of habitat complexity, we measured the effects of predation, competition, and habitat complexity on four components of fitness in larval amphibians: mass at metamorphosis, growth rate, length of larval period, and survival. Hyla eximia had low survival where salamanders were present. Tadpoles in treatments with two or four salamanders had one-fifth the survival of tadpoles in treatments with no salamanders. We found some evidence of density-dependent effects in Ambystoma. Mean salamander mass was negatively affected by salamander density. Density-dependent effects in H. eximia were weak. Habitat complexity alone did not affect any response variable but interacted with salamander density and tadpole density in a complex, nonadditive fashion. Many studies that have examined the relative importance of predation and competition in structuring amphibian communities have ignored habitat complexity. Our experiment, which examined different degrees of habitat complexity, suggests that the relationship between predation and competition may be nonadditive depending on the degree of habitat complexity.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA",,,,,,,,51,50,54,0,21,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,AUG 18,1992,,3,,,,,607,614,,,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,JK201,WOS:A1992JK20100001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Few ideas in aquatic ecology have evoked more research than this 'paradox of the plankton'. This review is an effort to put the main solutions to the paradox that have been proposed over the years into perspective. Hutchinson himself already suggested that the explanation could be that plankton communities are not in equilibrium at all due to weather-driven fluctuations. Subsequent research confirmed that such externally imposed variability can allow many species to coexist. Another important point is that in practice the homogeneous well-mixed conditions assumed in the competitive exclusion principle hardly exist. Even the open ocean, for instance, has a spatial complexity resulting from meso-scale vortices and fronts that can facilitate coexistence of species. Perhaps most excitingly, theoretical work on species interactions has given a counter-intuitive new dimension to the understanding of diversity. Various competition and predation models suggest that even in homogeneous and constant environments plankton will never settle to equilibrium. Instead, interactions between multiple species may give rise to oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community. Long-term laboratory experiments support this view. This chaotic behavior implies among other things that plankton dynamics are intrinsically unpredictable in the long run when viewed in detail. Nonetheless, on a higher aggregation level, indicators such as total algal biomass may show quite regular patterns.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Environm Sci, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands; Politecn Milan, CIRITA, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Dept Genet, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Scheffer, M (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Environm Sci, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, POB 8080, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands.",Marten.Scheffer@Aqec.wkao.wau.nl; Jef.Huisman@science.uva.nl,"Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013","Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211; Weissing, Franz J./0000-0003-3281-663X",,,,74,147,155,1,116,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN,2003,491,1-3,,,,,9,18,,10.1023/A:1024404804748,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,694JN,WOS:000183771600002,,,,,2021-09-27,

The highly prolific D. suzukii will likely interact with these species as a competitor, host or prey. To investigate potential interactions of D. suzukii with parasitoids, a field survey was conducted across several fruit-growing regions in Switzerland in two consecutive years. Eight species of hymenopteran parasitoids were collected using D. melanogaster as sentinel hosts in field-traps. Parasitoid capture was much higher in 2015 than in 2014 and varied among regions, time of the growing season, and habitat type. Laboratory no-choice assays with the field-collected species demonstrated that the larval parasitoids Asobara tabida, Leptopilina boulardi, and L. heterotoma could not use D. suzukii for reproduction, although the latter two reduced the number of emerging D. suzukii. In contrast, the pupal parasitoids Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae, Trichopria drosophilae, Vrestovia fidenas and Spalangia erythromera all developed with D. suzukii as hosts. Regional differences between strains were generally not evident, with the exception of two T. drosophilae strains that differed in parasitization rate. Thus, native parasitoids may interact with D. suzukii and should be regarded when implementing pest control measures.","[Knoll, Valery; Ellenbroek, Thomas; Romeis, Joerg; Collatz, Jana] Agroscope, Biosafety Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland","Collatz, J (corresponding author), Agroscope, Biosafety Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jana.collatz@agroscope.admin.ch,,,Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN); Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG),"This work was funded by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) and by the Drosophila suzukii R & D Task Force funded by the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG).

This paper gives a critical overview of advances in assessing the relative importance of pre- and post-settlement processes to the recruitment of 14 commercially and/or ecologically important lobsters and crabs. Three case studies (western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus, blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the American lobster, Homarus americanus) are used to illustrate where standard fishery survey methods, combined with field experiments, have provided insights into the form of stock-recruit relationships and the ecological processes that influence them. It is notable that larval supply-dominated cases, such as that of P. cygnus, may be less common than those dominated by post-settlement processes, such as C sapidus, in which strong compensatory processes lead to non-linear spawner-to-recruit or juvenile-to-recruit relationships. In other cases, such as H. americanus, the influence of post-settlement controls remains controversial. Significant settler or juvenile-to-recruit linkages have been reported more often than spawner-to-recruit relationships, most likely because pre-settlement processes often mask the latter. Innovative field experiments, early life stage monitoring and spatial modeling have improved our understanding of the influence of competition, predation, cannibalism, sociality and movements to the demography of some of these species. Field experiments have been more widely used by American and Australian than European investigators. Ecological experiments are not a panacea, though, and can lead to misinterpretation. especially of the relative importance of mortality and emigration. Uncertainties about age and the relevant spatial scale at which to evaluate stock-recruitment relationships have posed further challenges. This review underscores the need to design ecological studies at a geographic scale that will better reveal the stock-recruitment relationship. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This study considered the effects of experimental harvesting on recruitment of Mytilus galloprovincialis along the west coast of South Africa, where harvesting of this alien species is being contemplated. In particular, the role of settlement habitat availability in the form of adult mussels was analysed. To track the effects of a spectrum of harvesting intensities, five treatments were implemented: F = 0 (i.e. a control), F = 0.3, F = 0.6, F = 0.9 and F = 1. At these harvesting intensities 0%, 30%, 60%, 90% or 100% of mussel biomass was removed respectively at the outset of the experiment. A significant negative exponential relationship (p < 0.01) was found between M galloprovincialis recruit density and harvesting intensity, with intensities greater than F = 0.3 dramatically reducing recruitment. This pattern was recorded throughout the intertidal zone and remained temporally constant over 2 years. Significant positive linear relationships (p < 0.01) between recruit density and adult mussel biomass or density indicate a strong correlation between availability of settlement habitat and recruitment. It is likely that the high recruit density recorded at low harvesting intensities (2000-20000 per 0.01 m(2)) exceeds the level required for population maintenance. However, if settlement habitat is eliminated or significantly reduced, as was achieved by F = 0.3 or above, recruitment may become limiting. Thus, to protect stock replenishment, harvesting of M galloprovincialis in this region should take place at intensities less than F = 0.3.

Organisms: Two heteromyid rodents (Merriam's kangaroo rat, Dipodomys merriami, and desert pocket mouse, Chaetodipus penicillatus) from the Mojave Desert, and two gerbils (greater Egyptian gerbil, Gerbillus pyramidum, and Allenby's gerbil, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) from the Negev Desert, Israel. Site: An outdoor vivarium on the Sede Boqer campus of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel. Methods: We measured foraging time in seed trays for heteromyids and gerbils. We also measured the number of trips to food patches, and giving-up densities (GUDs, the amount of seed left behind when an individual left a seed tray). Predictions: We expected cheek pouches to confer improved heteromyid foraging efficiency by reducing the number of trips between food patches and caching sites. We further expected that, compared with the other species, kangaroo rats would be less inhibited by barn owls, by moonlight, and by risky microhabitats. Results: The two heteromyid species harvested more food per trip than the two gerbil species. Kangaroo rats had lower GUDs than any other species, particularly in risky microhabitats and at the full moon. Harvest rate curves for greater Egyptian gerbils and kangaroo rats indicated that these two larger bodied species were more vigilant than the two smaller bodied species. Conclusion: Adaptations such as body size and the external cheek pouch appear to allow kangaroo rats to manage risk and harvest food more effectively than smaller and non-heteromyid rodents.","[Emerson, Sara E.] CSU Stanislaus, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Circle, Turlock, CA 95382 USA; [Kotler, Burt P.; Sargunaraj, Franklin] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer, Israel","Emerson, SE (corresponding author), CSU Stanislaus, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Circle, Turlock, CA 95382 USA.",semerson1@csustan.edu,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",Fulbright Scholar Program; United States-Israel Education Foundation; Kreitman Foundation; Jacob Blaustein Center for Scientific Cooperation; Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [976/14],"We thank the Fulbright Scholar Program and the United States-Israel Education Foundation, the Kreitman Foundation, the Jacob Blaustein Center for Scientific Cooperation, and the Israel Science Foundation (grant number 976/14 to B.P.K.) for their financial support of this work.

Testing how deterministic and stochastic processes combine to regulate diversity, however, has been limited by the spatial complexity of these interactions. Here, we demonstrate how spatial variability in small-mammal predation on plants, mostly by granivory, results in fine-scale switching between deterministically and stochastically regulated plant community assembly in an otherwise environmentally homogeneous tallgrass prairie. We initiated assembly with the uniform application of a 24-species mixture of prairie grasses and forbs, thereby setting the maximum level of diversity (gamma-diversity). In field edges with higher densities of small mammals, traits reducing seed palatability deterministically produced homogeneous subsets of less palatable plant species within the first few months after planting (low alpha and beta diversity). As small-mammal densities decreased in more open areas, assembly unfolded stochastically on the basis of which planted species happened to land at a given location (high alpha and beta diversity). We used randomization models to validate that this higher b diversity was explained by true differences in community structure among plots rather than by the hidden effects of increasing a diversity. The net effect at the site level was a spatially structured array of prairie species, including a positive relationship between diversity and environmental suitability relating to reduced predator intensity.","[Germain, Rachel M.; Johnson, Laura; Schneider, Stefan; Cottenie, Karl; MacDougall, Andrew S.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Gillis, Elizabeth A.] Vancouver Isl Univ, Dept Resource Management Officer Technol, Nanaimo, BC V9R 5S5, Canada","MacDougall, AS (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",amacdo02@uoguelph.ca,"MacDougall, Andrew S/F-2037-2011","Cottenie, Karl/0000-0001-9498-8483",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Undergraduate Student Research AwardNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); rare Charitable Research Reserve conservation preserve; Ontario Early Research Fellowship; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for Innovation Major Research Instrumentation infrastructure grant; Mountain Equipment Co-op Environment Fund,"We thank C.

For freshwater arthropods that occur in ephemeral rock pools, the most drastic habitat instabilities are droughts and the intermittent availability of water. However, although the desiccation of a rock pool is detrimental for planktonic populations, it may also bring certain benefits: the exclusion of predators or parasites, for example, or the coexistence of otherwise competitively exclusive species. The commonness of drought resistant resting stages in many aquatic organisms shows the ecological significance of droughts. We measured daily evaporation in 50 rock pools inhabited by three Daphnia species D. magna, D. longispina and D. pulex over one summer. Daily evaporation and ultimately desiccation showed significantly seasonally influenced correlation with pool surface area, presence of vegetation, ambient temperature, wind and standardized evaporation measures. We used the estimates from this analysis to develop a simulation model to predict changes in the water level in 530 individual pools on a daily basis over a 25-year period. Eventually, hydroperiod lengths and desiccation events could be predicted for all of these rock pools. We independently confirmed the validity of this simulation by surveying desiccation events in the 530 rock pools over a whole season in 2006. In the same 530 rock pools, Daphnia communities had been recorded over the 25 years the simulation model considered. We correlated pool-specific occupation lengths of the three species with pool-specific measures of desiccation risk. Occupation lengths of all three Daphnia species were positively correlated with maximum hydroperiod length and negatively correlated with the number of desiccation events.

The effects that symbionts exert on their hosts are often context-dependent, and existing theoretical frameworks of symbiont community assembly do not consider the implications of variable outcomes to assembly processes. We hypothesized that symbiont-symbiont interactions become increasingly important along a parasitism/mutualism continuum because; (i) negative outcomes favour host resistance which in turn reduces symbiont colonization and subsequently reduce symbiont-symbiont interactions, whereas (ii) positive host outcomes favour tolerance and consequently higher symbiont colonization rates, leading to stronger interactions among symbionts. We found support for this hypothesis in the cleaning symbiosis between crayfish and ectosymbiotic branchiobdellidan worms. The symbiosis between crayfish and their worms can shift from parasitism/commensalism to mutualism as crayfish age. Here, field surveys identified changes in worm density, diversity and composition that were concomitant to changing symbiosis outcomes. We conducted several laboratory experiments and behavioural assays to relate patterns from the field to their likely causal processes. Young crayfish typically hosted only two relatively small worm species. Older crayfish hosted two additional larger species. In laboratory experiments, young crayfish exhibited a directed grooming response to all worm species, but were unable to remove small species. Conversely, adult crayfish did not exhibit grooming responses to any worm species. Relaxed grooming allowed the colonization of large worm species and initiated symbiont-symbiont intraguild predation that reduced the abundance and altered the behaviour of small worm species. Thus, the dominant processes of symbiont community assembly shifted from host resistance to symbiont-symbiont interactions through host ontogeny and a concomitant transition towards mutualism. This work shows that host resistance can have a prevailing influence over symbiont community assembly when symbiosis is disadvantageous to the host. However, when symbiosis is advantageous and resistance is relaxed, symbiont colonization rate and consequently abundance and diversity increases and interactions among symbionts become increasingly important to symbiont community assembly.","[Skelton, James] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32603 USA; [Doak, Sam; Leonard, Meredith; Brown, Bryan L.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 2125 Derring Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Creed, Robert P.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, 575 Rivers St, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Skelton, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32603 USA.",skelto3@gmail.com,,"Brown, Bryan/0000-0003-4837-7117","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0949780, DEB-0949823]; Society for Freshwater Science Boesel-Sanderson Fund for the study of natural history","We thank Kerry Jeffries and Alicia Peters for their brilliance and hard work in the field.

Experiments of multiple predator effects on prey populations are extremely demanding, as the number of treatments and the amount of labour associated with these experiments increases exponentially with the number of species in question. Therefore, researchers tend to vary only presence/absence of the species and use only one (supposedly realistic) combination of their numbers in experiments. However, nonlinearities in density dependence, functional responses, interactions between natural enemies etc. are typical for such systems, and nonlinear models of population dynamics generally predict qualitatively different results, if initial absolute densities of the species studied differ, even if their relative densities are maintained. Therefore, testing combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities may not be sufficient. Here we test this prediction experimentally. We show that the population dynamics of a system consisting of 2 natural enemies (aphid predator Adalia bipunctata (L.), and aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani Viereck) and their shared prey (peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer) are strongly affected by the absolute initial densities of the species in question. Even if their relative densities are kept constant, the natural enemy species or combination thereof that most effectively suppresses the prey may depend on the absolute initial densities used in the experiment. Future empirical studies of multiple predator - one prey interactions should therefore use a two-dimensional array of initial densities of the studied species. Varying only combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities is not sufficient and can lead to misleading results.","[Ameixa, Olga M. C.

First, a field survey was carried out where different habitat variables and the densities of both species were quantified and subjected to principal components analysis. Then the abundance of stone loach was related to the scores of the retained axes (eigenvalues >1). The abundance of stone loach was positively correlated to substrate particle size, amount of shade, temperature, discharge and current velocity, but negatively correlated to brown trout abundance. Secondly, a month-long field enclosure experiment in a stream was performed to test for any negative effects of brown trout on stone loach growth. Four treatments were used: intraspecific competition (stone loach at double density), interspecific competition (stone loach + small trout), predation (stone loach + large trout) and a control (stone loach alone). The results showed that large trout tended to have negative effects on final stone loach biomass. The absence of a negative effect of large trout on resource density suggests that nonlethal effects rather than resource competition caused this trend.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limnol.lu.se,,,,,,37,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Understanding when and why the loss of a predator causes large changes in community structure and ecosystem processes is critical for understanding the functional consequences of biodiversity loss. We used experimental microbial communities to investigate how the removal of a large generalist predator affected the extinction frequency, population abundance and total biomass of its prey. We removed this predator in the presence or absence of an alternative, more specialist, predator in order to determine whether the specialist predator affected the outcome of the initial species removal. Removal of the large generalist predator altered some species' populations but many were unaffected and no secondary extinctions were observed. The specialist predator, though rare, altered the response of the prey community to the removal of the large generalist predator. In the absence of the specialist predator, the effects of the removal were only measurable at the level of individual species. However, when the specialist predator was present, the removal of the large generalist predator affected the total biomass of prey species. The results demonstrate that the effect of species loss from high trophic levels may be very context-dependent, as rare species can have disproportionately large effects in food webs.","[Worsfold, Nicholas T.; Warren, Philip H.; Petchey, Owen L.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Worsfold, NT (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ntw500@york.ac.uk,"Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633",NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Royal Society Univ.

Its principal predator in the region is the whelk Nucella lima. We examined predator-prey interactions between M. trossulus and N. lima following a severe freeze which greatly reduced mussel abundance in the upper portion of their vertical range. N. lima in Kachemak Bay was locally abundant, but its spatial distribution was patchy, resulting in site-to-site variation in predation intensity. Following the freeze, mussel populations recovered to occupy 72% of primary space at a site where N. Lima was rare. Al sites where N. Lima occurred in high densities (>100 m(-2)), mussel cover remained significantly lower. At the latter sites, up to 81% of mussel mortality was due to snail predation. In field trials, average densities of N. Lima significantly reduced mussel cover within 2 wk. From published literature on Nucella sp. feeding rates and our data on in situ reductions in mussel beds, we estimate that N. lima can eliminate 60 to 90% of mussels at a given site in 1 season. In contrast to the general view that mussel recovery from disturbance is inevitable, our results indicate that local populations of young mussels were unable to increase space utilization because of intense N. lima predation. A stochastic, catastrophic disturbance event thus altered control of community structure by removing dense stands of large prey individuals that had grown to near-refuge size. This facilitated long-term N. lima control of what had been a mussel-dominated community by shifting the interaction toward smaller sized mussels that are susceptible to intense predation.","UNIV ALASKA, INST MARINE SCI, FAIRBANKS, AK 99775 USA",,,,,,,,51,35,37,0,14,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Seed dispersal is a primary driver, via propagule pressure, of biological invasions. In animal-dispersed plants, theory predicts that indirect ecological interactions at the neighbourhood scale may determine landscape-scale patterns of seed dispersal and predation, and thus invasion. 2. Indirect interactions in seed dispersal may arise between two plant species if shared seed dispersal agents adjust their foraging decisions to the relative frequencies of co-occurring seeds. We used seed-tracking experiments and empirically parameterized simulations to test the hypothesis that an indirect interaction between two plant species, mediated by scatterhoarding rodents that both consume and disperse seeds, affects recruitment of an invasive tree. We predicted that acorns of Quercus rubra (invasive in Central Europe) would experience higher caching (and therefore survival) rates when they co-occurred with native Quercus petraea than when they occurred in isolation, that Q. petraea acorns would survive at lower rates with Q. rubra relative to isolation, and that this interaction would facilitate Q. rubra seedling recruitment in Q. petraea forests. 3. Contrary to expectations, the presence of Q. petraea reduced caching of Q. rubra acorns, and co-occurrence with Q. rubra increased caching of Q. petraea. Thus, a rodent-mediated indirect interaction may be slowing rather than facilitating the Q. rubra invasion. However, our simulations indicate that the magnitude of this indirect interaction will change nonlinearly as Q. rubra becomes more dominant on the landscape, and that the pace of invasion will accelerate as the alien species is released from the rodent-mediated effect of Q. petraea. 4. Synthesis. The presence of native Quercus petraea decreases recruitment rates of Quercus rubra, and consequently, slows down the invasion process. The strong dependence of pairwise interactions on the presence of a third-party species emphasizes the role of indirect interactions in the invasion processes.","[Bogdziewicz, Michal; Zwolak, Rafal] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Systemat Zool, Poznan, Poland; [Lichti, Nathanael I.] Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Bogdziewicz, M (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Systemat Zool, Poznan, Poland.",michalbogdziewicz@gmail.com,"Bogdziewicz, Michal/J-2868-2012; Zwolak, Rafal/AAA-2174-2019","Bogdziewicz, Michal/0000-0002-6777-9034; Zwolak, Rafal/0000-0002-7665-5033","Narodowe Centrum NaukiNational Science Centre, Poland [2015/17/N/NZ8/01565]","Narodowe Centrum Nauki, Grant/Award Number: 2015/17/N/NZ8/01565",,61,14,14,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

One species commonly used in the U.S. Midwest is gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum; gizzard shad have been used to increase growth and condition of walleye Sander vitreus in many Midwestern systems. Additionally, with warming climates and stocking, gizzard shad are experiencing a natural range expansion. While this expansion may be beneficial for top predators like walleye, mixed results exist on the effects of gizzard shad on other recreationally important fishes in these systems. Our objectives were to determine if annual growth, relative abundance, and condition of yellow perch, Perca flavescens and walleye populations changed following the introduction of gizzard shad. Adult, pre-spawn gizzard shad were introduced in 2008 and 2009 at densities higher than those which resulted in self-sustaining populations in other South Dakota reservoirs. Yellow perch and walleye population dynamics were estimated during 2007 (pre-shad), 2008-2009 (shad present) and 2010 (post-shad) in two glacial lakes stocked with adult gizzard shad and a reference lake (not stocked with shad). Our results suggest that at the densities documented in this study and in the time frame assessed, gizzard shad did not negatively impact yellow perch as total length at age was similar, condition remained high and zooplankton resources were likely not limiting. Walleye did consume gizzard shad when available and shad appeared to have a neutral or positive effect on walleye growth, relative abundance and condition in these systems during this study. The addition of shad may be a viable option to improve walleye populations without negatively impacting sympatric yellow perch populations under the conditions tested in this study. However, the introduction of a non-indigenous species should be done with caution, especially a potential competitor like gizzard shad. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

With its introduction to North America, Silene latifolia successfully escaped a number of generalist and specialist enemies, including the seed predator/specialist pollinator Hadena bicruris, but information regarding the acquisition of new mutualists in a community context has not been examined. We used field observations of mixed species arrays and laboratory feeding trials and compared floral scent and plant/pollinator morphological match to explore the interaction in North America of the invasive S. latifolia with the native pollinating seed predator, Hadena ectypa, in order to understand mechanisms of enemy release and mutualist facilitation underlying the successful invasion of S. latifolia. In mixed arrays, H. ectypa visited S. latifolia at a low frequency similar to the combined visitation of other non-Hadena nocturnal moth species. Differences in the floral scent profiles of S. latifolia and Silene stellata, a native coflowering congener and natural host of H. ectypa, combined with the lack of morphological match between H. ectypa and S. latifolia, likely contribute to these results. In the field study, only one H. ectypa egg was oviposited on S. latifolia, and this did not result in a successful fruit attack. Larvae feeding trials in the lab showed no initial feeding preference for pistils of either Silene species. Therefore, our study suggests that S. latifolia has escaped the cost of seed predation typically associated with visitation and oviposition by Hadena pollinators, a potential natural enemy, while taking advantage of pollination services provided by both H. ectypa and other native North American nocturnal moth pollinators.","[Castillo, Dean M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Castillo, Dean M.; Kula, Abigail A.

Tn most of the experimental years (1989-1992), selective pesticides were used in order to allow a successful release of phytoseiids, in particular A. aberrans. The use of non-selective insecticides was re-established during 1993 in order to test its effect on the new mite communities originating from 1989 onwards. In the first years of the experiments an apparent relationship between grape variety and phytoseiid species was observed: in the control plots, A. andersoni occurred on Merlot where T. pyri was rare, while the latter species was largely dominant over A. andersoni on Trebbiano and Garganega. Panonychus ulmi populations reached moderate levels only on Merlot and in the first part of experiments. The variety-phytoseiid species relationship was temporary as, at the end of experiments, T. pyri was completely dominant on all varieties. This new situation started when prey occurrence and interspecific competition decreased in importance. The moderate success of the T. pyri release on Merlot contrasts with the results of previous experiments. Two factors could be involved in this phenomenon: low interspecific competition by phytoseiids and predation by macropredators. Amblyseius aberrans was able to displace A. andersoni and T. pyri on grape varieties where the two species were more abundant and reached higher population densities on varieties with pubescent leaf undersurfaces. In the first experimental year, spider mite densities were reduced more effectively in A. aberrans release plots than in the control or in T. pyri release plots. One year later, P. ulmi reached lower levels in the release treatments than in the control. Typhlodromus pyri and A. aberrans persisted in conditions of prey scarcity. The high competitivity of A. aberrans over the remaining two phytoseiid species constitutes a major factor in selecting predatory species for inoculative releases in vineyards.",,"Camporese, P (corresponding author), UNIV PADUA,INST AGR ENTOMOL,VIA GRADENIGO 6,I-35100 PADUA,ITALY.",,"duso, carlo/AAG-8435-2020","Duso, Carlo/0000-0002-2600-2536",,,,33,45,47,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Such movement is often influenced by biotic interactions, but the abiotic environment can also be important, affecting the strength of species' interactions and even changing their outcome. Here, we focused on two biotic interactions and examined their effect on movement of the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator: intraspecific interactions (specifically, the effect of conspecific density) and interspecific interactions with a competitor-predator, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta (=Nassarius obsoletus). We assessed the magnitude of the temporal variation and examined the influence of pertinent abiotic variables (lunar cycle, presence of tide pools). Despite substantial temporal variation in movement levels, density of conspecifics did not influence emigration or immigration rates of C. volutator. Mud snails negatively affected immigration of C. volutator, and this was consistent across all lunar phases. However, mud snails influenced mortality and emigration of C. volutator in a contrasting way relative to lunar phases; sometimes amphipods evaded snails and survived, but at other times did not emigrate and were killed. The presence of tide pools did not change the nature or strength of the snail-amphipod interaction. Our results further clarify the complex interactions between C. volutator and I. obsoleta and suggest that resources on the mudflat are sufficient to sustain high densities of amphipods in a density-independent manner. Further, they highlight the importance of considering multiple environmental variables when examining interspecific interactions.","[Drolet, David; Hamilton, Diana J.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada; [Drolet, David; Coffin, Michael R.

Models of functional and aggregative responses generally assume that rates of prey encounter and handling times limit a predator's intake rate (Holling's disc equation). Two different lines of approach build upon this fundamental foraging concept. In the first, mutual interference further constrains intake rate, while in the second, intake rate may be constrained by rate of digestion. By combining both approaches, we come up with four competing models that differ in whether predators interfere and whether they face a digestive constraint. 2. The functional responses expected by these four models are tested experimentally in a medium-sized shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus), fed a shelled prey, the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). The experimental results suggest that intake rate is constrained by rate of digestion at low bird densities and by interference at high bird densities. 3. Using the experimentally obtained parameters, we predicted aggregative responses for each of the four models, which we verified by using field observations. We found evidence that the combination of interference and digestive constraints similarly governed the aggregative responses of red knots. Compared to the expectations of the models that do not include digestive constraints, red knots fed in lower and more variable prey densities and were generally aggregated in denser flocks. In addition, they were packed twice as densely when feeding on hard-shelled prey than when feeding on soft-bodied prey. 4. We suggest that digestive constraints allow red knots to live in dense flocks: if digestion proceeds during interference interactions, the time-cost of interference may be negligible.","Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol & Evolut, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, CEES, Anim Ecol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","van Gils, JA (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol & Evolut, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands.",janvg@nioz.nl,"Piersma, Theunis/D-1871-2012; van Gils, Jan/B-5544-2008","van Gils, Jan/0000-0002-4132-8243; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",,,,70,53,54,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies. Our survey revealed 20 fragmentation experiments worldwide. Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) of particular species. Other important themes were the effect of fragmentation in interspecific interactions, the role of corridors and landscape connectivity in individual movements and species richness, and the influences of edge effects on ecosystem services. Our comparisons showed a remarkable lack of consistency in results across studies, especially with regard to species richness and abundance relative to fragment size. Experiments with arthropods showed the best fit with theoretical expectations of greater species richness on larger fragments. Highly mobile taxa such as birds and mammals, early-successional plant species, long-lived species, and generalist predators did not respond in the expected manner. Reasons for these discrepancies included edge effects, competitive release in the habitat fragments, and the spatial scale of the experiments. One of the more consistently supported hypotheses was that movement and species richness are positively affected by corridors and connectivity, respectively. Transient effects dominated many systems; for example, crowding of individuals on fragments commonly was observed after fragmentation, followed by a relaxation toward lower abundance in subsequent years. The three long-term studies (greater than or equal to 14 years) revealed strong patterns that would have been missed in short-term investigations. Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for elucidation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potential for changing responses to fragmentation over time.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ctr Biodivers Res, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Debinski, DM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, 124 Sci 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",debinski@iastate.edu; predator@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu,,"Rodiles-Hernandez, Rocio/0000-0003-0355-5477; Debinski, Diane/0000-0002-7144-4640",,,,82,898,949,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

However, pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are numerous and have an alternating-year pattern of abundance that provides a natural experimental control to test for interspecific competition in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Since a number of studies have recently examined pink salmon interactions with other salmon, we reviewed them in an effort to describe patterns of interaction over broad regions of the ocean. Research consistently indicated that pink salmon significantly altered prey abundance of other salmon species (e.g., zooplankton, squid), leading to altered diet, reduced total prey consumption and growth, delayed maturation, and reduced survival, depending on species and locale. Reduced survival was observed in chum salmon (O. keta) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) originating from Puget Sound and in Bristol Bay sockeye salmon (O. nerka). Growth of pink salmon was not measurably affected by other salmon species, but their growth was sometimes inversely related to their own abundance. In all marine studies, pink salmon affected other species through exploitation of prey resources rather than interference. Interspecific competition was observed in nearshore and offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, and one study documented competition between species originating from different continents. Climate change had variable effects on competition. In the North Pacific Ocean, competition was observed before and after the ocean regime shift in 1977 that significantly altered abundances of many marine species, whereas a study in the Pacific Northwest reported a shift from predation- to competition-based mortality in response to the 1982/1983 El Nino. Key traits of pink salmon that influenced competition with other salmonids included great abundance, high consumption rates and rapid growth, degree of diet overlap or consumption of lower trophic level prey, and early migration timing into the ocean. The consistent pattern of findings from multiple regions of the ocean provides evidence that interspecific competition can significantly influence salmon population dynamics and that pink salmon may be the dominant competitor among salmon in marine waters.","Nat Resources Consultants Inc, Seattle, WA 98119 USA; US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Biol Sci Off, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA","Ruggerone, GT (corresponding author), Nat Resources Consultants Inc, Seattle, WA 98119 USA.",GRuggerone@nrccorp.com; jennifer_niel-sen@usgs.gov,,,,,,83,77,83,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,1573-5184,,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

Hypotheses on the causes of diet specialization generally assume prey preferences differ among predator individuals. They then predict how the magnitude of diet variation should change when ecological factors (e.g., intraspecific competition) alter prey abundances. However, the magnitude of diet variation is expected to change with prey abundances due to stochasticity in the foraging process even if all predators share the same prey preferences. Here I show that the relative prey abundance where diet variation is maximized and the magnitudes of diet variation in prey switching experiments are predicted well by a simple stochastic foraging model based only on relative prey abundances and a shared relative prey preference among predators. These results suggest that the effects of stochasticity during foraging may confound studies of individual diet specialization if these effects are not accounted for in experimental design or interpretation. Furthermore, the stochastic foraging model provides simple baseline expectations for theoretical studies on the ecological consequences of diet variation and offers a way forward on quantitative predictions of how ecological factors influence the magnitude of diet variation when stochasticity during foraging and diet specialization occur simultaneously. Last, this study highlights the continued importance of integrating stochasticity into mechanistic ecological hypotheses.","[Coblentz, Kyle E.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Coblentz, KE (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",kyle.coblentz@unl.edu,"Coblentz, Kyle/AAU-5549-2021","Coblentz, Kyle/0000-0002-0069-8491","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1314109, DEB-1702051]","I thank Mark Novak and Emily Khazan for their comments on previous versions of the manuscript and Mark Novak and John DeLong for discussion of the ideas herein.

Competition for limiting resources is a fundamental and well-established driver of niche partitioning, which in turn promotes species coexistence and biodiversity. Although contests are a well-known behavioural mechanism by which organisms compete over limiting resources, there has been surprisingly little application of contest theory to understanding interspecific interactions, niche partitioning, species coexistence and biodiversity. 2. We investigated the link between contest dynamics and community structure using two intertidal rockpool fishes, Bathygobius cocosensis (Gobiidae) and Lepidoblennius haplodactylus (Tripterygiidae), as model species. We assessed the abundance and distribution of the two species on intertidal rocky shores of South-East Australia, and whether distribution patterns were related to abiotic variables. We then conducted interspecific contest experiments between pairs of B. cocosensis and L. haplodactylus of varying size and sex under high and low dissolved oxygen levels to assess the competitive dominance of the species. To relate these results to community structure, we quantified temporal patterns of rockpool fidelity of each species in situ. 3. Field surveys revealed that B. cocosensis was most prevalent in rockpools with higher dissolved oxygen, and L. haplodactylus was most prevalent in rockpools that contained no B. cocosensis. Contest experiments revealed that B. cocosensis displayed higher resource holding power than L. haplodactylus regardless of size asymmetry, sex or dissolved oxygen concentration, although contest intensity was influenced by relative body size of competing individuals. Furthermore, the microhabitat preference of L. haplodactylus was modulated in the presence of B. cocosensis. In the field, B. cocosensis displayed higher rockpool fidelity than L. haplodactylus. 4. In light of these findings, we propose that B. cocosensis is the superior competitor but persistence of both species is likely facilitated by low-cost contest resolution strategies, plasticity in microhabitat preference, negative spatial co-variation and interspecific variation in dispersal and corresponding home range sizes. 5. By using contest theory to understand the dynamics of interspecific contests, insight has been gained into how habitat is partitioned, species coexist and ultimately how biodiversity is maintained.","[Paijmans, Kai C.; Wong, Marian Y.

In a comparative field study of juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that compared natural- and reduced-flow sites, we used mark-recapture modelling and information theory to quantify spatially and temporally explicit patterns of density, specific growth rate, survival and outmigration; and test predictions for biotic and abiotic drivers. Densities were lower in water withdrawal treatments, resulting in lower intraspecific competition and, higher specific growth rate and survival. We observed yearly differences in density and intraspecific competition, with a negative relationship between density and specific growth rate over a wide range of densities, but reductions in survival only at the highest densities. Moreover, individual variability within sites was important. At high density (sites and years), survival related negatively to body size. In contrast, when overall density was lower, specific growth rate was negatively related to body size. Lastly, individuals were more likely to outmigrate when they had larger body size, lower survival or reared in habitats with reduced flows, and these patterns appeared mediated by the intensity of intraspecific competition. Our results underscore the harsh bioenergetic conditions induced by higher temperatures and densities during summer baseflow (relative to other seasons), particularly for larger fish demanding more resources, and suggest a density-dependent mechanism for why this period is important for regulating salmonid populations. We found that a complex combination of natural (e.g., density) and anthropogenic (e.g., withdrawal) factors affected juvenile salmon populations and life history expression in the face of altered flows.","[Hartson, Richard B.; Kennedy, Brian P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Water Resources Grad Program, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Kennedy, Brian P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Kennedy, Brian P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Geol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Hartson, RB (corresponding author), 25944 Community Plaza Way, Sedro Woolley, WA 98284 USA.",rbhartson@gmail.com,,,United States Bureau of Reclamation; NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program [EPS-0814387]; University of Idaho's Water of the West Initiative; NSF - REU programNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [DEB-0755160],"We thank Gary White for assistance with the development of mark-recapture models for survival and outmigration, and we thank Jon Horne for help in defining models in an information-theoretic framework and in interpreting the results of the AICC analyses.

Following European settlement, however, major changes in resource availability for these predators potentially resulted in increased competition, especially for food. This study examined ecological attributes of both species, including intersexual differences in the sooty owl, potential resource partitioning and whether competition may be occurring. Dietary overlap was high between female sooty owls and powerful owls (0.90), compared to overlap between male sooty owls and powerful owls (0.67), with three mammalian species contributing over 74% of their diets. Sooty and powerful owls coexisted throughout the study region, regularly roosting within the same vegetation types, and in similar locations, although microhabitat differences were apparent. Sooty owls displayed aseasonal breeding, although a peak in fledging in spring coincided with powerful owl breeding. Both species exclusively nested in similar size mountain grey gums (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa), however, hollow characteristics differed slightly. Significant divergence along a single niche dimension was not detected between powerful and sooty owls, as they had similar diets, habitat usage and activity times, potentially resulting in competition. Reproductive output was low for both species, however, the degree to which competitive interactions influenced this remains unknown. To minimise potential competition, long-term feral predator control and improved habitat management is recommended to increase the density and diversity of small terrestrial mammals, as this should result in diversification of the sooty owl diet, reducing dietary overlap with powerful owls.

In this study, we used stable isotope analyses (SIA) to explore trophic status of an introduced population of northern crayfish (Faxonius virilis) in Buffalo Lake, Washington. Northern crayfish are an important prey item for introduced warmwater and coldwater fish species in this lentic system and may buffer competitive interactions between largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka). In 2017, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of liver samples from 208 crayfish informed proportional diet estimates. Crayfish diets were comprised of 8 littoral sources and were examined for cannibalism, temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic trophic shifts. There was no significant spatial or temporal trophic shift detected in this crayfish population. Seasonal delta N-15 values among all crayfish size classes mirrored seasonal abundance shifts of littoral macroinvertebrates. A multiple-source stable isotope mixing model and relative trophic positions provided evidence for an ontogenetic trophic shift between juvenile and adult crayfish, from a generalist detritivore to a predatory diet dominated by Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera. The trophic status of Buffalo Lake crayfish may affect salmonid management goals if interspecific competition for food between crayfish and sport fish is biologically significant. Our research is an important first step to understanding crayfish trophic status in a lentic food web, and should inform fish stocking regimes and fishery regulations in management efforts to achieve long-term sustainability of this diverse fishery.","[Loffredo, John R.; Moore, Barry C.; Lanouette, Brian; Katz, Stephen L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Lee, Raymond W.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Cross, Benjamin K.] Colville Confederated Tribes, Nespelem, WA USA","Loffredo, JR (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",john.loffredo@wsu.edu,"Moore, Barry/AAB-6459-2020; Loffredo, John/AAC-3411-2020","Loffredo, John/0000-0003-2038-1229",Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,"The primary author would like to thank the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation for providing funding and generously donating the biological specimens for this research.

P. perna predominates in the lower mussel zone and M. galloprovincialis in the upper zone, with mixed beds where the two overlap. We examined competitive interactions between these species by translocating mussels into small plots at high densities. Treatments involved different combinations of species and densities placed in each zone. Mortality was monitored regularly and at the end of each experiment, growth and condition index were measured. The experiment was attempted three times. The first two attempts were disrupted by wave action, especially winter storms, but provided information on species-specific effects of wave action. In experiment one, wave induced mortality decreased from a mean for both species of approximately 90% on the low shore to ca. 50% on the high shore, and was 15-30% lower for P. perna than M. galloprovincialis in each zone. In experiment two, M. galloprovincialis mortality was not affected by zone (Kruskal-Wallis test, P > 0.05), but was higher than P. perna mortality in the low zone (P < 0.05). P. perna survival was significantly (P < 0.05) lower on the high than mid and low zones, apparently due to the effects of greater emersion. Condition index showed a similar pattern, being lowest in the low zone for M. galloprovincialis and in the high zone for P. perna (3-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Growth rates were fastest for both species in the low zone (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05 in both cases). The third experiment was run for 12 months in the low zone only and provided evidence of intraspecific competition for P. perna and of interspecific competition. Condition was significantly greater for P. perna in all treatments (2-way ANOVA), as was growth (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.05). Significant treatment effects indicated that P. perna had a negative effect on M. galloprovincialis survival (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05). Again wave action was important; by the end of the experiment all mussels had been removed from plots stocked only with M. galloprovincialis. Thus P. perna improves survival of M. galloprovincialis on the low shore in the short term, by providing protection against wave action, but excludes it competitively in the longer term. The results show that partial habitat segregation is likely to be a permanent feature on the south coast, with M. galloprovincialis unable to dominate the low shore due to the effects of waves and competitive exclusion by P. perna. This study is the first attempt to examine the mechanisms of interaction between invasive and indigenous marine mussel species and provides evidence of the importance of environmental conditions in the mediation of this interaction.","Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","McQuaid, CD (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",c.mcquaid@ru.ac.za,"McQuaid, Christopher/AAT-3725-2020; Rius, Marc/C-5088-2011","McQuaid, Christopher/0000-0002-3473-8308; Rius, Marc/0000-0002-2195-6605",,,,51,60,62,0,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

While their impacts on native plants have been widely reported, there is little information on how these impacts propagate through food webs and affect species at higher trophic levels. Using a quantitative food web approach we evaluated the impacts of an invasive plant on plant-herbivore-parasitoid communities, asking specifically how diet breadth influences the propagation of such impacts. Measuring the impact of the alien plant at the plant level seriously underestimated the community-level effect of this weed as it also caused changes in the abundance of native herbivores and parasitoids, along with a decrease in parasitoid species richness. The invading plant affected specialist and generalist subsets of communities differently, having significant and strong negative impacts on the abundance of all specialists with no negative effect on generalist consumers. Specialist consumer decline led to further disruptions of top-down regulatory mechanisms, releasing generalist species from competition via shared natural enemies. Plant invasion also significantly increased the evenness of species abundance of all trophic levels in the food webs, as well as the evenness of species interaction frequency. Extending impact evaluation to higher trophic levels and considering changes in trophic diversity within levels is hence essential for a full evaluation of the consequences of invasion by alien plants. Moreover, information on diet breadth of species in the invaded community should be taken into account when evaluating/predicting the impacts on any introduced species.","[Carvalheiro, Luisa G.; Memmott, Jane] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England; [Buckley, Yvonne M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne M.] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia","Memmott, J (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England.",Jane.Memmott@bristol.ac.uk,"Buckley, Yvonne/B-1281-2008; Carvalheiro, Luisa/D-9414-2012","Buckley, Yvonne/0000-0001-7599-3201; Carvalheiro, Luisa/0000-0001-7655-979X",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (Portugal)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0771387],"We thank T.

In central Kenya's Laikipia County, olive baboons (Papio anubis) frequently consume O. stricta fruits and subsequently disperse the seeds via defecation. Animal-mediated seed dispersal can increase germination and subsequent survival of plants. However, consumption of seeds (seed predation) by rodents may offset the potential benefits of seed dispersal for cactus establishment by reducing the number of viable seeds. We investigated foraging preferences of a common and widely distributed small mammal-the fringe-tailed gerbil (Gerbilliscus robustus), between O. stricta seeds deposited in baboon faeces versus control O. stricta seeds. In addition to providing evidence of seed predation on O. stricta by G. robustus, our data show that seed removal was higher (shorter time to use) for seeds within faeces than for control seeds. G. robustus clearly prefers seeds within faeces compared to control seeds. These results suggest that high abundances of rodents may limit successful establishment of O. stricta seeds, possibly disrupting seed dispersal via endozoochory by baboons.","[Dudenhoeffer, Megan; Hodge, Anne-Marie C.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Hodge, Anne-Marie C.] Univ Wyoming, Berry Biodivers Ctr, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Dudenhoeffer, M (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",megan.om.dudenhoeffer@gmail.com,,,Center for Global Studies Research Excellence Award Committee; University of Wyoming Arts and Sciences Department; Haub School's Research and Creative Activities Grant; Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research Fellowship,Center for Global Studies Research Excellence Award Committee; University of Wyoming Arts and Sciences Department; Haub School's Research and Creative Activities Grant; Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research Fellowship,,44,2,2,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6707,1365-2028,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

Larval fish are gape-limited predators that forage on prey of specific sizes, and thus may be expected to differentially affect members of a zooplankton community, possibly altering the size-structure or species composition. 2. I used an enclosure experiment to look at the effect of predation by larval bluegill on the dynamics of two zooplankton communities, one dominated by large-bodied individuals and the other by small-bodied individuals. Enclosures containing these zooplankton received a zero, low, medium, or high density of larval bluegill predators. 3. Increasing larval density had a negative effect on zooplankton abundance and abundance declined similarly in the large-bodied and small-bodied communities. 4. Zooplankton size-structure, as estimated by the length of the average zooplankton, increased and then decreased during the experiment, decreasing faster at higher larval fish densities. When zooplankton size-structure was estimated as the length of the average cladoceran, size-structure declined in the large-bodied but not in the small-bodied community and the greatest decline in size-structure was seen in the medium and high larval density treatments. 5. Ordination of each community using multidimensional scaling (MDS) indicated that the trajectory of change in species composition differed between the presence and absence of larval fish. In both communities, the degree of response by individual taxa depended on the density of bluegill larvae. This effect on zooplankton abundance, size-structure and community composition suggests that larval fish may make an important contribution to zooplankton dynamics in many lakes and ponds.","Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Rettig, JE (corresponding author), Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",rettig@denison.edu,,,,,,42,14,16,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Using camera trapping in four Brazilian biomes, we compare the daily activity patterns of the jaguar and puma, and their relationships with their main prey species. We used a kernel density method to quantify daily activity patterns and to investigate overlap between these predators and their main prey. Both cats showed intensive nocturnal and crepuscular activity (0.69 and 0.14 kernel density, respectively, for jaguars; 0.68 and 0.19 kernel density, respectively, for pumas). Only in the Pantanal did we observe a pattern of concentrated diurnal activity for both species. We found little temporal segregation between jaguars and pumas, as they showed similar activity patterns with high coefficients of overlapping (average 1=0.86; SE=0.15). We also observed a significant overlap between the activity patterns of the predators and their main prey species, suggesting that both predators adjust their activity to reduce their foraging energy expenditure. Our findings suggest that temporal partitioning is probably not a generalized mechanism of coexistence between jaguars and pumas; instead, the partitioning of habitat/space use and food resources may play a larger role in mediating top predator coexistence. Knowledge about these behavior aspects is crucial to elucidating the factors that enable coexistence of jaguars and pumas. Furthermore, an understanding of their respective activity periods is relevant to management and associated research efforts.","[Foster, Vania C.; Sarmento, Pedro; Negroes, Nuno; Fonseca, Carlos] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Foster, Vania C.; Sarmento, Pedro; Negroes, Nuno; Fonseca, Carlos] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Foster, Vania C.; Sollmann, Rahel; Torres, Natalia; Jacomo, Anah T.

The aim of this work was to infer the role that such interactions play in the population dynamics of psyllids and aphids in pear orchards. Interactions were inferred from field data and periodical sampling along a 4-year study, and from interaction assays performed under controlled conditions. RESULTS A decline in the abundance of the pear psyllid (Cacopsylla pyri L.), parallel to an increase in the abundance of aphids, was registered over 4 years. Ants were the dominant species, representing about 90% of the predators, followed by spiders and predatory hemipterans (namely Pilophorus gallicus Remane). Ant abundance increased over the 4 years, matching the population dynamics of aphids. Evidence of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions were found for ant-aphid and ant-psyllid, respectively: (i) ant-aphid abundances on pear trees were positively correlated, and ants reduced predation on aphids by generalist predators, and (ii) ant-psyllid abundances were negatively correlated, ants have a negative effect on the psyllid population growth rates, and ants were found to prey on the psyllid. CONCLUSIONS Because of their high abundance in comparison with other predators and the mutualistic-antagonistic relationships with aphids-psyllids, ants are considered to be the principal force behind the decline of pear psyllid populations and the increase in aphid numbers. In summary, ants contribute positively to biological control by the suppresion of pests (i.e. the psyllid) which are more damaging than those they protect (i.e. aphids).

The ecology of the jaguarundi is poorly known, so I reviewed the literature for all original data and remarks on jaguarundi observations, ecology, and behaviour, to synthesize what is known about the species. 2. Jaguarundis occupy and use a range of habitats with dense undergrowth from northern Mexico to central Argentina, but may be most abundant in seasonal dry, Atlantic, gallery, and mixed grassland/agricultural forest landscapes. 3. Jaguarundis are principally predators of small (sigmodontine) rodents, although other mammals, birds, and squamate reptiles are taken regularly. 4. The vast majority of jaguarundi camera-trap records occurred during daylight hours (0600 h-1800 h); jaguaurndis are also predominantly terrestrial, although they appear to be capable tree climbers. 5. Home range sizes for jaguarundis vary greatly, but most are <= 25 km(2); females' territories may be much smaller than or similar in size to those of males. Males may concentrate movements in one area before shifting to another and, as with other felids, intersexual overlap in habitat use appears to be common. 6. Interference competition may be important in influencing the distribution and ecology of jaguarundis, although their diurnal habits may somewhat mitigate its effect. 7. Conflict between humans and jaguarundis over small livestock may be widespread among rural human communities and is likely to be underreported. Despite this conflict, jaguarundis can persist in agriculturally modified landscapes and small forest fragments. 8. Additional research on local jaguarundi populations from more areas should be a priority to determine the true status of the species.","[Giordano, Anthony J.] SPECIES, Field Projects & Conservat Sci, Ventura, CA 93003 USA; [Giordano, Anthony J.] Tiger Creek Wildlife Refuge, Conservat Sci Program, Tyler, TX 75706 USA","Giordano, AJ (corresponding author), SPECIES, Field Projects & Conservat Sci, Ventura, CA 93003 USA.; Giordano, AJ (corresponding author), Tiger Creek Wildlife Refuge, Conservat Sci Program, Tyler, TX 75706 USA.",species1@hotmail.com,,,,,,86,17,20,2,98,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,JAN,2016,46,1,,,,,30,43,,10.1111/mam.12051,,,14,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,DB4UX,WOS:000368510200003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Therefore the potential for contamination of their habitat is considerable. Our study examined the effects of an insecticide (carbaryl, a neurotoxin), on larval amphibian communities experiencing natural stresses of competition for resources, predation, and pond drying. In a set of experimental ponds, tadpoles of three anuran species (southern leopard frog [Rana sphenocephala], plains leopard frog [R. blairi], and the Woodhouse's toad [Bufo woodhousii]) were added to 1000-L ponds containing leaf litter, plankton, two newts (Notophthalmus viridescens), and four overwintered green frog (R. clamitans) tadpoles. We manipulated the overall tadpole density (low or high), pond hydroperiod (constant or drying), and chemical exposure (0, 3.5, 5.0, or 7.0 mg/L carbaryl) of the ponds. We measured mass, time, and survival to metamorphosis to determine treatment effects. Carbaryl positively affected Woodhouse's toad survival, although it had a negligible effect on both leopard frog species. Tadpole density interacted with the chemical treatment: proportionately more Woodhouse's toads survived to metamorphosis in high-density environments than in low-density or control environments. Greater survival may be an indirect effect of increased algal food resources from carbaryl exposure. Most newts lost mass over the course of the experiment, although ponds with drying hydroperiods and high anuran density were the least favorable environments. Overwintered green frogs exposed to carbaryl had longer larval periods on average than did green frogs in control ponds. Our study demonstrated that even sublethal, short-lived contaminants can alter natural communities in ways that cannot be predicted from simple, one-factor studies.","Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Boone, MD (corresponding author), USGS, 4200 New Haven Rd, Columbia, MO 65201 USA.",michelle_boone@usgs.gov,,"Semlitsch, Raymond/0000-0002-7999-5762",,,,58,107,113,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Two hundred and thirty-four samples were collected monthly, between July 2000 and June 2001, in the main channel. Seventy-nine species of 29 families were captured with a total estimated mean density and biomass of 1513 individuals ha(-1) and 34 kg ha(-1), respectively. The number of species and total mean density differed significantly among areas and seasons, but the total mean biomass differed only significantly throughout the ecocline (areas) of the Paranagua Estuary. For the most abundant species, the mean densities of Stellifer rastrifer, Aspistor luniscutis, Menticirrhus americanus, Sphoeroides testudineus, Cynoscion leiarchus and Symphurus tesselatus (with the exception of Cathorops spixii and Genidens genidens) differed significantly among seasons. The mean biomass of these species, with the exception of G. genidens, S. rastrifer, A. luniscutis and S. testudineus, also differed significantly for the factor seasons. Area was a significant factor for the eight most abundant species (density and biomass), except S. testudineus (density), G. genidens, C. leiarchus and S. tesselatus (biomass). The season v. area interaction term was significant for C. leiarchus (density). Most of these differences occurred during the rainy season when fishes concentrated principally in the middle of the estuary, where the salinity remained stable. It is suggested that the salinity stability in the middle of the estuary is the main reason why the most estuarine resident fish species move downstream and remain there, regardless of the increased freshwater runoff. Moreover, canonical correspondent analysis output detected that during the late rainy season, the variable dissolved oxygen (P < 0.01) was the most important environmental variable, responsible for structuring patterns of fishes assemblages in the west-east axis of Paranagua Estuary. During the end of the dry season, both salinity (P < 0.01) and dissolved oxygen (P < 0.05) were responsible for this ecological feature in the estuary. Finally, it was possible to detect that juveniles and adults of some important species respond differently to seasonal fluctuations of the ecocline-determining environmental factors. This behaviour is suggested as a strategy to avoid competition and predation during the rainy season in the middle estuary. The Paranagua Estuary did not fit with the pre-existing models described in the tropical and subtropical estuarine fish literature since its main channel fish assemblages remained within its bounds even during the rainy season.

These movements were analyzed in the larvae of different sex, age, and social status. Only quantitative differences in frequences of the use of motoric reactions are shown to exist between various groups, as well as between experiments conducted in various time intervals. It is suggested that the above differences determine characteristic behaviour of the individuals related to their sex and maturity. In particular, females prefer avoiding conflicts just displaying significantly fewer quick movements provocing a counterpart agression. Instead, mom developed males pretending to be local residents display the highest frequency of the use of agressive movements. A system of spatial competition among C. splendens larvae seems to be built up on the basis of the motoric reactions described herein. Even a sophisticated behaviour of a resident larva identifying its counterparts by sex, age, and readiness to fight could be determine by movement responses of the counterparts. Such a mechanism is of universal kind, could be employed in relations between other animal groups (preys and predators), and does not request development of specific sensor-behaviourial complexes for within-species contacts. Nevertheless, ability of dragonfly imagos to identify visually sex, species belonging and age of other dragonfly individuals implies the above interactions mechanism is just one of the rest possible. One of the latters could be action of hydrodynamic stimuli produced by the individuals movements during their interactions.",,"RYAZANOVA, GI (corresponding author), MV LOMONOSOV STATE UNIV,FAC BIOL,DEPT ENTOMOL,LENINSKIE GORY,MOSCOW 119899,USSR.",,,,,,,19,4,4,0,4,MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA,MOSCOW,"39 DIMITROVA UL., 113095 MOSCOW, RUSSIA",0044-4596,,,ZH OBSHCH BIOL,Zhurnal Obshchei Biol.,SEP-OCT,1992,53,5,,,,,736,743,,,,,8,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,JV333,WOS:A1992JV33300008,,,,,2021-09-27,

Many studies have focused on competition for shared resources as a major factor promoting differentiation, with considerably less attention focused on interacting effects of abiotic factors and predator-prey relationships. To further investigate the effects of interacting selective factors on the outcomes of mortality and survival in aquatic prey, we conducted interrelated laboratory studies examining the effects of water colour and plant density on predator-induced mortality in four dytiscid species (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) that varied in body size (total body length), and body colouration pattern. Body size was more strongly phylogenetically conserved than colouration pattern, and larger body size generally resulted in decreased predator-induced mortality rates. In contrast, the effectiveness of body colouration patterns in decreasing prey mortality risk depended on water colour and prey body size. In clear water, small and patterned dytiscids had mortality rates equal to medium-sized plain beetles, thereby compensating for differences in mortality risk due to body size differences. Under dark water conditions, small dytiscids experienced higher mortality rates compared to medium-sized dytiscids; however, the effectiveness of colouration patterns in medium-sized beetles decreased to the point that it became detrimental to survival, revealing antagonistic selection. We suggest that colouration patterns are not ubiquitous in prey species and cospecialization in larger size and presence of colouration patterns does not generally result in higher prey survival, because the effectiveness of the two antipredator defences may be restricted to certain phenotype x environment combinations. Our results illustrate how interactions between prey phenotype and variable environmental conditions among habitats dominated by the same predator can lead to adaptive trade-offs, which can increase the number of possible outcomes of predator mediated selection.","[Wohlfahrt, Bianca; Vamosi, Steven M.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Wohlfahrt, B (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",bwohlfah@ucalgary.ca,"Vamosi, Steven/C-8126-2009","Vamosi, Steven/0000-0003-3903-5000",Alberta Ingenuity and NSERC (Canada),"We thank Sierra Love and Catherine Gieysztor for technical support and help with sampling and the Reinhardt family for allowing us to access their property.

Frequency distribution of sampling units (G test) in the substrate was used to evaluate variation in larval dispersal. An experimental acrylic channel (1 x 0.1 x 0.2 m) covered with wood shavings was used to observe larval dispersal prior to pupation. The acrylic channel was graduated at 0.05 m intervals, each representing a sampling unit; hence, 20 sampling units were set up. A Petri dish containing third instar larvae of single and double species was deposited at one edge of the acrylic channel allowing larvae to disperse. The number of buried pupae (0, 1, 2,...n) present in each sampling unit was recorded. For double species, the number of recovered larvae of C. albiceps was similar to the number initially released on the dish Petri. On the other hand, the number of recovered larvae of C. macellaria was significantly smaller than the initially released number The results show that C. albiceps attacks C. macellaria larvae during the larval dispersal process. The larval distribution of C. albiceps did not differ significantly from C. macellaria in double species, but it differed significantly in single species. The larval aggregation level of C. macellaria decreased when C. albiceps was present and the larval aggregation level of C. albiceps increased when C. macellaria was present. The implications of such findings for the population dynamics of these species are discussed.","Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Parasitol, Inst Biociencias, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; Univ Estadual Paulista, Fac med Vet & Zootecn, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil","Godoy, WAC (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Parasitol, Inst Biociencias, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",,"Rossi, Marcelo N/D-8876-2013; de Andrade, Jailson B./V-2437-2019; Del Bianco Faria, Lucas/I-1832-2013; Godoy, Wesley AC/B-9787-2012; Von Zuben, Claudio Jose/B-1566-2013","de Andrade, Jailson B./0000-0001-5269-4866; Del Bianco Faria, Lucas/0000-0002-7230-800X; Von Zuben, Claudio Jose/0000-0002-9622-3254",,,,33,23,24,0,5,FUNDACO OSWALDO CRUZ,"RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ","AV BRASIL 4365, 21045-900 RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ, BRAZIL",0074-0276,,,MEM I OSWALDO CRUZ,Mem.

Gradients in competition and predation that regulate communities should guide biogenic habitat restoration, while restoration ecology provides opportunities to address fundamental questions regarding food web dynamics via large-scale field manipulations. 2. We restored oyster reefs across an aerial exposure gradient (shallow-subtidal-to-mid-intertidal) to explore how vertical gradients in natural settlement, growth and interspecific interactions affected the trajectory of man-made shellfish reefs. 3. We recorded nearly an order-of-magnitude higher oyster settlement on the deepest (subtidal) reefs, but within a year abundance patterns reversed, and oyster densities were ultimately highest on the shallowest (intertidal) reefs by over an order-of-magnitude. 4. This reversal was due to (i) significantly elevated survivorship on intertidal reefs and (ii) larger surviving oysters on intertidal reefs. These patterns are likely to have developed from greater levels of biofouling and predator abundance (e.g. stone crabs, gastropods) on deeper reefs where aerial exposure was <5% of the monthly tidal cycle. 5. Synthesis and applications. The success of restoration initiatives involving habitat-forming species can be enhanced by accounting for the biotic interactions that regulate population fitness. In littoral systems, vertical gradients in predation, competition and disturbance can be exploited to guide restoration of vegetated (e.g. mangrove, seagrass) or biogenic reef habitats. In particular, our results demonstrate that paradigms of vertical zonation learned from the rocky intertidal and saltmarshes also describe the fate of restored shellfish reefs. As with rocky shores, the lower vertical limit of adult oyster distribution in our study system was most likely driven by predatory and competitive (i.e. smothering) interactions, with a threshold depth at c. 5% daily aerial exposure. Below this depth, experimentally restored reefs failed completely. As with Spartina saltmarsh, accumulation of oyster biomass was greatest at an intermediate vertical position relative to mean sea level (i.e. mid-to-low intertidal). Our developing model proscribes a vertical 'hot spot' for restoration efforts to maximize biogenic reef fitness and production.","[Fodrie, F.

Within carnivore guilds, complex hierarchies of dominance facilitate coexistence, whereby subordinate species avoid dominant counterparts by partitioning space, time, or both. We investigated whether a major life history trait (hibernation) in an apex carnivore (black bears Ursus americanus) mediated its top-down effects on the spatio-temporal dynamics of three sympatric mesocarnivore species (coyotes Canis latrans, bobcats Lynx rufus, and gray foxes Urocyon cinereoargenteus) across a 15,000 km(2) landscape in the western USA. We compared top-down, bottom-up, and environmental effects on these mesocarnivores using an integrated modeling approach. Black bears exerted top-down effects that varied as a function of hibernation and were stronger than bottom-up or environmental impacts. High black bear activity in summer and fall appeared to buffer the most subordinate mesocarnivore (gray foxes) from competition with dominant mesocarnivores (coyotes and bobcats), which were in turn released by black bear hibernation in winter and early spring. The mesocarnivore responses occurred in space (i.e., altered occupancy and site visitation intensity) rather than time (i.e., diel activity patterns unaffected). These results suggest that the spatio-temporal dynamics of mesocarnivores in this system were principally shaped by a spatial predator cascade of interference competition mediated by black bear hibernation. Thus, certain life history traits of apex predators might facilitate coexistence among competing species over broad time scales, with complex implications for lower trophic levels.","[Moll, Remington J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Moll, Remington J.; Montgomery, Robert A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 480 Wilson Rd,Room 13 Nat Resources Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jackson, Patrick J.; Lackey, Carl W.] Nevada Dept Wildlife, 6980 Sierra Ctr Pkwy,Suite 120, Reno, NV 89511 USA; [Wakeling, Brian F.] Montana Fish Wildlife & Pk, Wildlife Div, POB 200701, Helena, MT 59620 USA; [Beckmann, Jon P.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Rockies Program, 1050 E Main,Suite 2, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA; [Millspaugh, Joshua J.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Moll, RJ (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.; Moll, RJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 480 Wilson Rd,Room 13 Nat Resources Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",remington.moll@unh.edu,,,Nevada Department of Wildlife $3 Predator Fee Program; statewide game [F17AF00482],"This research was supported by the Nevada Department of Wildlife $3 Predator Fee Program and the statewide game management support (F17AF00482).

To determine the mechanisms driving distribution of a dominant infaunal clam, Macoma balthica, along a salinity (i.e., stress) gradient in the York River, Chesapeake Bay, I experimentally examined the effects of predation, recruitment, and food availability in shallow, subtidal, soft-bottom habitats. Specifically, in upriver and downriver zones I quantified: (1) the abundance of M. balthica; (2) the effect of predation on survival of M. balthica; (3) the abundance and foraging efficiency of major epibenthic predators; (4) the recruitment of M. balthica; and (5) the food availability for clams (sedimentary carbon). Consumer stress models predict that predators are more stressed in zones where salinity is lower and more variable (i.e., upriver); thus, predator-induced mortality should be lower upriver, potentially elevating the density of infaunal prey. In contrast to these models, in the York River, (1) natural abundance of M. balthica was higher upriver, (2) both predation-induced mortality in manipulative field experiments as well as field measurements of natural mortality of clams over time were higher upriver, though per capita foraging efficiency was lower, (3) predator abundance but not size was greater upriver where predation intensity was higher, (4) recruitment was lower upriver, and (5) food availability (sedimentary carbon) was greater upriver. Clam density, environmental stress, and per capita foraging efficiency were in accord with a consumer stress model of community regulation, whereas higher predator abundance and predation intensity in zones of higher environmental stress were contrary to the model's predictions. Recruitment did not dictate overall patterns of clam abundance, but habitat quality and nutrients appeared to drive prey and predator abundances. The patterns in this soft-bottom community are explained best by a productivity model, as reflected in a community governed principally by resource availability (i.e., bottom-up control), at a broad scale. This research suggests that structuring forces are similar for rocky intertidal, salt marsh, and soft-bottom communities at broad spatial scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Results showed that spatial overlap (Lloyd's index and spatial distribution) was higher among adults of both species at the lower tidal elevation of l'Anse-a-l'Orignal (north-east oriented). Results also suggest weaker interspecific interactions among juveniles of both species because of limited spatial overlap, In Baie-du-Ha!Ha! (south-west oriented), spatial overlap was greater than that observed in 1'Anse-8-l'Orignal and appeal-ed important in adults as well as in juveniles. Levins' directional measure of competition indicated an asymmetric spatial overlap between N. virens and N. caeca in Baie-du-Ha!Ha! and a symmetric overlap in l'Anse-a-l'Orignal. The intraspecific encounter values, estimated from Lloyd's mathematical expression, were significantly higher than values of interspecific interactions only in l'Anse-a-l'Orignal. Moreover, no vertical stratification was found inside the sediment, with no effect of the densities and individual body weights of the polychaetes. Juveniles of both species mainly inhabited the organic-rich upper portion of the sediments (O to 12 cm), while adults colonised greater depths( > 25 cm) where organic matter content was lower. A complementary field experiment was conducted in 1993 to investigate interspecific interactions (predation and competition) existing between N. virens and N. caeca. Results from this experiment depend on which species was first-introduced and showed an important variation in mortality rates between allopatric and sympatric conditions. The influence of competition and predation on the structure of these populations is also discussed in relation to their spatial overlap.","UNIV LAVAL,GIROQ,DEPT BIOL,ST FOY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA; MUSEUM NATL HIST NAT,LAB MARITIME,F-35801 DINARD,FRANCE","Caron, A (corresponding author), UNIV QUEBEC,DEPT OCEANOG,CTR OCEANOG RIMOUSKI,310 ALLEE URSULINES,RIMOUSKI,PQ G5L 3A1,CANADA.",,,,,,,83,13,17,1,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Substratum selection by the burrowing larvae of the dragonfly Onychogomphus uncatus was examined in an artificial laboratory stream at different larval densities and in the presence of one of three other dragonfly species. 2. The larvae of O. uncatus, as well as those of the other species, clearly preferred gravelly sand substratum rather than gravel or stone. 3. At low larval density (71.4 m(-2)) in the stream, 83% of the O. uncatus were found in gravelly sand. An increase of larval abundance in the stream to 202.4, specimens m(-2) resulted in greater density in all substrata, but this increase was proportionally lowest in gravelly sand. 4. The presence of a second species had various effects on the microdistribution of O. uncatus. In the presence of Gomphus simillimus or Cordulegaster boltonii immaculifrons the distribution of O. uncatus changed significantly; their density increased in the normally less preferred substrata.

We identify 7 long-term studies of population changes in Myodes in North America. Using autoregressive and spectral analysis, we found that only 2 of the 7 show 3- to 5-year cycles like those found in some Eurasian populations. There was no relationship between latitude and cycling. The general lack of cyclicity is associated with two key aspects of their demography that act in tandem: first, poor overwinter survival in most years; second, chronically low densities, with irregular outbreak years. Eight factors might explain why some Myodes populations fluctuate in cycles and others fluctuate irregularly, and we review the evidence for each factor: food supplies, nutrients, predation, interspecific competition, disease, weather, spacing behavior and interactive effects. Of these eight, only food supplies appear to be sufficient to explain the differences between cyclic and non-cyclic populations. Irregular fluctuations are the result of pulsed food supplies in the form of berry crops (M. rutilus) or tree seeds (M. gapperi) linked to weather patterns. We argue that, to understand the cause for the patterns in the respective hemispheres, we must know the mechanism(s) driving population change and this must be linked to rigorous field tests. We suggest that a large-scale, year-round feeding experiment should improve overwintering survival, increase standing densities, and flip non-cyclic Myodes populations into cyclic dynamics that would mimic the patterns seen in the cyclic populations found in parts of Eurasia.","[Boonstra, Rudy] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Krebs, Charles J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Boonstra, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",boonstra@utsc.utoronto.ca; krebs@zoology.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We dedicate this paper to the memory of William (Bill) A.

This relationship is often attributed to the positive correlation between the density of vegetation and its protective value against predators. However, two counteracting basic elements underlying this paradigm limit its generality. That is, increasing vegetation density should result in decreased predatorprey encounters, whilst at the same time predatorprey encounters should increase as animal densities increase. These two mechanisms should thus counteract each other when the densities of vegetation and associated animals, including both prey and predators, co-vary. Experimental designs that expose fixed densities of prey and predators to varying densities of vegetation assess only the former mechanism and may thus not properly evaluate the protective value of vegetation in such conditions. By contrast, designs that mimic the naturally co-varying organism densities test both mechanisms and thus their counteractive impacts on predatorprey encounters. We compared the outcomes of the two alternative designs and carried out additional experiments to explain the putative discrepancy. Increasing vegetation density (mimics of Potamogeton pectinatus) enhanced prey (Daphnia magna) survival only when fixed densities of prey and predators (Perca fluviatilis or Rutilus rutilus) were used. When the animal densities were allowed to co-vary with vegetation density, vegetation had no impact on prey survival. Instead, prey survival was determined by the aggregate density of prey and predators, shaped by the species-specific traits of the latter. Thus, the impact of the increased animal densities overrode the impact of the increased vegetation density on predatorprey encounters. It may be insufficient to attribute the co-variation of vegetation, prey and predator densities simply to the association between vegetation density and its protective value. Increased food resources and reduced competition within vegetation may promote prey and thereby also predator abundance to a greater extent than previously thought.","[Scheinin, Matias; Kauppi, Laura; Mattila, Johanna] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biosci, Huso Biol Stn Environm & Marine Biol, FI-22220 Emkarby, Aland, Finland; [Scyphers, Steven B.; Heck, Ken L., Jr.] Univ S Alabama, Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 35628 USA","Scheinin, M (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biosci, Huso Biol Stn Environm & Marine Biol, FI-22220 Emkarby, Aland, Finland.",matias.scheinin@abo.fi,,"Mattila, Johanna/0000-0003-3265-5514",,,,66,24,24,0,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2012,121,7,,,,,1093,1102,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19941.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,963IR,WOS:000305614300011,,,,,2021-09-27,

This reduces the per capita ability of abundant species to reproduce, relative to less common species, and gives rare or competitively inferior species a greater chance to persist. We tested this hypothesis in a 50-ha mapped plot of tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, by investigating the spatial patterns of sapling recruitment in 80 species of trees and shrubs. Two censuses of adults and saplings were carried out, in 1982 and in 1985. Recruits were defined as saplings of 1-8 cm dbh (diameter breast height) appearing in the 1985 census that were not present in 1982. The distance from each recruit to its nearest conspecific adult neighbor was measured. At various distances from adults, the number of conspecific recruits and the number of recruits of all species were tallied. The ratio of recruits of species i to all recruits was taken as an estimate of the probability that species i would occupy that site as an adult. A few species showed a significant reduction in recruitment probability close to adults, but more species showed a significant increase, and many other species showed no significant spatial pattern. Among canopy trees, about a third of the species showed some sign of local reduction in recruitment, but the distance over which the effect extended was usually less than 5 m; however, the most abundant canopy tree, Trichilia tuberculata, showed a sharp reduction in recruitment probability up to 10 m from adults. In treelets and shrubs, most species showed strong peaks in recruitment probability close to adults. Thus, most recruitment patterns did not fit the prediction of Janzen and Connell; however, two to three of the most common species may have reached densities at which a depression in local recruitment is regulating abundance.","PRINCETON UNIV, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, PRINCETON, NJ 08544 USA; FIELD MUSEUM NAT HIST, DEPT BOT, CHICAGO, IL 60605 USA",,,,,,,,38,190,208,0,49,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Four arable weed species were investigated that were of high biodiversity value, yet of low to moderate competitive ability with the crop. These were Chenopodium album, Sinapis arvensis, Stellaria media and Polygonum aviculare. Exclusion treatments were used to allow selective access to dishes of seeds by different predator groups. Seed predation was highest early in the season, followed by a gradual decline in predation over the summer for all species. All species were taken by invertebrates. The activity of two phytophagous carabid genera showed significant correlations with seed predation levels. However, in general carabid activity was not related to seed predation and this is discussed in terms of the mainly polyphagous nature of many Carabid species that utilized the seed resource early in the season, but then switched to carnivory as prey populations increased. The potential relevance of post-dispersal seed predation to the development of weed management systems that maximize biological control through conservation and optimize herbicide use, is discussed.","Univ Reading, Ctr Agrienvironm Res, Dept Agr, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; Univ Reading, Sch Plant Sci, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England","Mauchline, AL (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Ctr Agrienvironm Res, Dept Agr, Earley Gate,POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",a.l.mauchline@reading.ac.uk,,"Mauchline, Alice/0000-0003-1168-8552",,,,43,49,50,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0043-1737,1365-3180,,WEED RES,Weed Res.,APR,2005,45,2,,,,,157,164,,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2004.00443.x,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,902JO,WOS:000227351300010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Animals with complex life cycles, such as dragonflies, usually go through different stages that include a variation in body size and may involve shifts in their trophic position in the food web. This investigation analyzes the position of the dragonfly Rhionaeschna variegata, in the food web according to its body size, in Andean wetland communities of Northwestern Patagonia (Argentina). The phenology of R. variegata larvae and their potential intraguild predators were studied in wetlands with different hydroperiods. Under controlled experimental conditions, feeding trials were performed to assess the effect of R. variegata on the survivorship of different types of prey. The effects of cannibalism and intraguild predation (IGP) on the survivorship of the small larvae of R. variegata were investigated with and without alternative prey as well as different sympatric predators. The phenology of R. variegata and intraguild predators differed among wetlands. The feeding trials showed that R. variegata has a significant effect on the survivorship of invertebrate and vertebrate prey. Cannibalism increased with body size in odonate larvae. The survivorship of small- and medium-sized larvae was mainly affected by the presence of larger predators such as belosmatids. The field and experimental data show that the effect of IGP and cannibalism is affected by the cohort dynamics of R. variegata. Body size in R. variegata determines the strength of its interaction with other components of the community.","INIBIOM CONICET, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente INIBIOM, Lab Fotobiol, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Jara, FG (corresponding author), INIBIOM CONICET, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente INIBIOM, Lab Fotobiol, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",fjara77@hotmail.com,"Jara, Fabian/T-6200-2019","Jara, Fabian/0000-0002-7542-2246","PICT (Agencia, FONCyT)","This investigation was performed under the institutional animal care guidelines established by the Bureau of National Parks of Argentina (APN).

The concept of metacommunity is based on the hypothesis that species occurrence depends on species dynamics and interactions on local and regional scales via the movements of individuals between localities. Metacommunity approaches are currently being applied to pond breeding taxa such as amphibians. 2. Given that animal movement is also influenced by the physical quality of the matrix to be crossed to reach a breeding habitat and by the affinity of the species for specific terrestrial habitats, matrix characteristics may enhance or hinder dispersal success. These characteristics would, in turn, affect the composition of larval assemblages at local level and, consequently, determine metacommunity structure and dynamics. 3. Here we compared the structures and dynamics of two metacommunities with the same pool of anurans along similar freshwater gradients in two regions that are well differentiated in terms of their respective terrestrial matrix. 4. Abundance of tadpole species and species assemblage in the two regions were determined principally by local processes (at pond level); however, the structure and dynamics of the communities differed. In one region species abundance was explained in part by landscape factors and consequently showed lower co-occurrence and lower colonization rates (species sorting models) indicating that terrestrial habitat could restrict animal movements, whereas in the other region higher co-occurrence and higher colonization rates (mass effect models) indicated low dispersal limitations.","Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Anim Biol, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Richter-Boix, A (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Anim Biol, Ave Diagonal 645, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",arichterboix@ub.edu,"Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012; Llorente, Gustavo A./I-3097-2015","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Llorente, Gustavo A./0000-0002-0310-8290",,,,71,45,47,0,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The invasive biology of this reptile has not been studied in Puerto Rico, where its negative effects may threaten local biodiversity. The purposes of this study were to: (1) estimate population densities of I. iguana; (2) describe some aspects of its reproductive biology; and (3) assess its potential impacts. Visual-encounter surveys were performed at Parque Lineal in San Juan and Canal Blasina in Carolina, while nesting activity data were collected at Las Cabezas de San Juan in Fajardo. Densities of I. iguana in Puerto Rico reached a maximum of 223 individuals ha(-1), higher than in any known locality in its native range, and showed fluctuations related to seasonality. Our 2008-2009 observations at the nesting sites document that this population of I. iguana is a reproductively successful species, producing more than 100 egg clutches and 2,558 eggs with a 91.4% egg viability. The ability to proliferate in a low predation environment and the absence of good competitors are the major drivers of the population densities observed in Puerto Rico. We found evidence that I. iguana is threatening native biodiversity and impacting infrastructure, agriculture and human safety. Thus, a management program to control the species must soon be developed to prevent this invasive reptile from becoming more widespread and dominant in other localities around the island.","[Lopez-Torres, Alberto L.; Claudio-Hernandez, Hector J.; Rodriguez-Gomez, Carlos A.; Longo, Ana V.; Joglar, Rafael L.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00931 USA; [Longo, Ana V.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Lopez-Torres, AL (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, POB 23360, San Juan, PR 00931 USA.",al.lopeztorres@gmail.com,"Longo, Ana/L-2129-2015; Longo, Ana V./AAH-1522-2020","Longo, Ana/0000-0002-5112-1246; Longo, Ana V./0000-0002-5112-1246; Lopez Torres, Alberto/0000-0001-7089-6234",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [HRD-0114586]; Proyecto Coqui; Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico,"We thank N.

We investigated the size and density structure of genetically continuous periwinkle populations (Littorina littorea) on an exposed rocky and a sheltered sedimentary environment on two nearby islands in the south-eastern North Sea (German Bight). On the sedimentary shore, periwinkle density (917 +/- A 722 individuals m(-2)) was about three times higher than on the rocky shore (296 +/- A 168 individuals m(-2)). Mean (9.8 +/- A 3.9 mm) and maximum (22 mm) shell size of L. littorea on the sedimentary shore were smaller than on the rocky shore (21.5 +/- A 4.2 and 32 mm, respectively), where only few small snails were found. Additionally, periwinkle shells were thicker and stronger on the rocky than on the sedimentary shore. To ascertain mechanisms responsible for differences in population structures, we examined periwinkles in both environments for growth rate, predation pressure, infection with a shell boring polychaete (Polydora ciliata) and parasitic infestation by trematodes. A crosswise transplantation experiment revealed better growth conditions on the sedimentary than on the rocky shore. However, crab abundance and prevalence of parasites and P. ciliata in adult snails were higher on the sedimentary shore. Previous investigations showed that crabs prefer large periwinkles infested with P. ciliata. Thus, we suggest that parasites and shell boring P. ciliata in conjunction with an increased crab predation pressure are responsible for low abundances of large periwinkles on the sedimentary shore while high wave exposure may explain low densities of juvenile L. littorea on the rocky shore. We conclude that biotic factors may strongly contribute to observed differences in size structure of the L. littorea populations studied on rocky and sedimentary shores.","[Eschweiler, Nina; Buschbaum, Christian] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany; [Molis, Markus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Sect Seaweed Biol, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany","Buschbaum, C (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, Hafenstr 43, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, Germany.",Christian.Buschbaum@awi.de,,"Buschbaum, Christian/0000-0002-0223-1916",Sustainable DevelopmentEuropean Commission; Global Change and Ecosystems Programme of the European Community's Sixth Framework ProgrammeEuropean Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505446],"We are grateful to Caroline Eschweiler and Kathrin Voigt for assistance.

In a laboratory experiment, we measured Daphnia life history plasticity under different predation risk and temperature treatments that simulate changing environmental conditions. Daphnia pulicaria abundance and size at first reproduction (SFR) declined, while ephippia (resting egg) formation increased at high temperatures. Daphnia mendotae abundance and clutch size increased with predation risk at high temperatures, but produced few ephippia. Thus, each species exhibited phenotypic plasticity, but responded in sharply different ways to the same environmental cues. In Glen Elder reservoir, Kansas USA, D. pulicaria dominance shifted to D. mendotae dominance as temperature and predation risk increased from March to June in both 1999 and 2000. Field estimates of life history shifts mirrored the laboratory experiment results, suggesting that similar phenotypic responses to seasonal cues contribute to seasonal Daphnia population trends.

This filter may also influence the relative abundance of nonnative plants within habitats and the communities' susceptibility to invasion via differences in granivore identity, abundance, and food preference. We evaluated the effect of postdispersal seed predators on the establishment of invasive, naturalized, and native species within and between adjacent forest and steppe communities of eastern Washington, USA that differ in severity of plant invasion. Seed removal from trays placed within guild-specific exclosures revealed that small mammals were the dominant seed predators in both forest and steppe. Seeds of invasive species (Bromus tectorum, Cirsium arvense) were removed significantly less than the seeds of native (Pseudoroegneria spicata, Balsamorhiza sagittata) and naturalized (Secale cereale, Centaurea cyanus) species. Seed predation limited seedling emergence and establishment in both communities in the absence of competition in a pattern reflecting natural plant abundance: S. cereale was most suppressed, B. tectorum was least suppressed, and P. spicata was suppressed at an intermediate level. Furthermore, seed predation reduced the residual seed bank for all species. Seed mass correlated with seed removal rates in the forest and their subsequent effects on plant recruitment; larger seeds were removed at higher rates than smaller seeds. Our vegetation surveys indicate higher densities and canopy cover of nonnative species occur in the steppe compared with the forest understory, suggesting the steppe may be more susceptible to invasion. Seed predation alone, however, did not result in significant differences in establishment for any species between these communities, presumably due to similar total small-mammal abundance between communities. Consequently, preferential seed predation by small mammals predicts plant establishment for our test species within these communities but not between them. Accumulating evidence suggests that seed predation can be an important biotic filter affecting plant establishment via differences in consumer preferences and abundance with important ramifications for plant invasions and in situ community assembly.","[Connolly, B.

Tadpoles were exposed to the presence or absence of one another, two density levels and to the presence or absence of predacious odonate larvae (Aeshna palmata) isolated in enclosures. In the artificial pond study, R. aurora were significantly larger at metamorphosis (12%) and exhibited only slightly longer larval periods when exposed to Aeshna. In the presence of R. pretiosa, they significantly decreased time to metamorphosis, and were significantly larger at metamorphosis (12%) than those reared alone. Rana pretiosa in treatments with R. aurora were somewhat larger at metamorphosis when a non-lethal predator was present, and in treatments where R. pretiosa were alone with a predator tadpole mass at metamorphosis was smaller than those in the absence of Aeshna, but these results were not statistically significant. Both species reduced activity and moved away from the predator in the presence of an enclosed dragonfly larva in the laboratory. Most tadpole mesocosm experiments have found that the trade-off between size and timing of metamorphosis is extremely important to amphibians, but we suggest that the trade-off discussed in traditional amphibian models may not apply to species like R. pretiosa that are exposed to the same gape-limited predators upon reaching metamorphosis.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Barnett, HK (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, 3041-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",,"Richardson, John/G-1513-2012","Richardson, John/0000-0001-8135-7447",,,,29,26,29,0,24,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2002,132,3,,,,,436,444,,10.1007/s00442-002-0981-x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,589HJ,WOS:000177752500014,28547422,,,,2021-09-27,

Key to this understanding is identifying the mechanisms regulating vital rates. Determining the influence of density on survival is necessary to understand the extent to which human-caused mortality is compensatory or additive. In wolves (Canis lupus), empirical evidence for density-dependent survival is lacking. Dispersal is considered the principal way in which wolves adjust their numbers to prey supply or compensate for human exploitation. However, studies to date have primarily focused on exploited wolf populations, in which density-dependent mechanisms are likely weak due to artificially low wolf densities. Using 13years of data on 280 collared wolves in Yellowstone National Park, we assessed the effect of wolf density, prey abundance and population structure, as well as winter severity, on age-specific survival in two areas (prey-rich vs. prey-poor) of the national park. We further analysed cause-specific mortality and explored the factors driving intraspecific aggression in the prey-rich northern area of the park. Overall, survival rates decreased during the study. In northern Yellowstone, density dependence regulated adult survival through an increase in intraspecific aggression, independent of prey availability. In the interior of the park, adult survival was less variable and density-independent, despite reduced prey availability. There was no effect of prey population structure in northern Yellowstone, or of winter severity in either area. Survival was similar among yearlings and adults, but lower for adults older than 6years. Our results indicate that density-dependent intraspecific aggression is a major driver of adult wolf survival in northern Yellowstone, suggesting intrinsic density-dependent mechanisms have the potential to regulate wolf populations at high ungulate densities. When low prey availability or high removal rates maintain wolves at lower densities, limited inter-pack interactions may prevent density-dependent survival, consistent with our findings in the interior of the park.","[Cubaynes, Sarah; Coulson, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [MacNulty, Daniel R.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Stahler, Daniel R.; Quimby, Kira A.; Smith, Douglas W.] Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Yellowstone Wolf Project, Mammoth, WY 82190 USA","Cubaynes, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",sarah.cubaynes@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"MacNulty, Dan/L-3965-2016; Coulson, Tim/AAL-8148-2021","Coulson, Tim/0000-0001-9371-9003","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0613730, DEB-1245373]; Yellowstone National Park; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission; Wellcome grant support; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I023783/2, NE/E015921/1, NE/H007148/1, NE/H007148/2, 1221700, NE/I023783/1, NE/I023791/1, 1136795, NE/G004390/1, NE/G004390/2, NE/I023791/2, NE/K014218/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1245373] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank Erin Stahler, Matt Metz, Rick McIntyre and numerous field technicians with data collection and management assistance, Roger Stradley from Gallatin Flying Service and Bob Hawkins from Hawkins and Powers, Inc. and Sky Aviation, Inc. for safe piloting.

Predators affect short-term trade-off decisions in prey species through behavioural alterations, yet the role of parasites in the context of trait-mediated interactions is rarely discussed, despite our extensive knowledge of parasite-induced behavioural alterations. Adding parasites to the picture, the foraging-predation trade-off presents an interesting case where the effects of predator- and parasite-induced behavioural responses occur in conjunction. Empirical studies on the effect of parasites on trait-mediated anti-predator responses are still scarce, especially in marine systems. Our experiments used marine mud snails, Zeacumantus subcarinatus (Batillariidae), infected with the trematode parasites Maritrema novaezealandensis and Philophthalmus sp. to investigate the effects of trematode-induced behavioural alterations on the trade-off between food acquisition and predator avoidance in the presence of a range of predation cues. We found that the time taken to initiate anti-predator responses was overall significantly shorter in M. novaezealandensis-infected snails than in uninfected snails, while it was significantly longer for Philophthalmus-infected snails. In the simultaneous presence of odours from an injured conspecific and a crab predator, however, the reaction time between uninfected and M. novaezealandensis-infected snails did not differ while Philophthalmus-infected snails were still markedly slower than the former groups. Our results demonstrate species-specific parasite-induced behavioural changes in the presence of imminent predation risk. However, effects of the trematodes on overall feeding and fleeing times were not detected in our experiments; thus, the net effect of parasitism on the foraging-predation trade-off remains unknown.

Podarcis levendis is a lacertid lizard, endemic to two rocky islets in the Cretan Sea, Greece, that was raised to specific level in 2008 and since then no data on its biology are available. Here we present the first ecological information on the species, focusing on population density, tail autotomy and feeding preferences. We recorded regenerated and damaged tails in the field and estimated population density with the transect method. We also dissected museum specimens and analyzed their stomach content. Regenerated tails were common and reached a considerable 71%. The latter finding could be attributed to the intense intraspecific competition due to high population density but also to the seasonal predation pressure by migratory birds.

Four different microcosm treatments were set up: two treatments containing defaunated plants inoculated with caprellid amphipods, and two control treatments with natural faunas. The estimated secondary production of faunas enclosed in all microcosm treatments rapidly settled on a constant value (5 mg/day) which was similar to that determined in experiments conducted in Western Australia using the same microcosms but for faunas associated with a seagrass rather than a macroalga. These results support the hypothesis that the secondary production of epifaunal communities associated with macrophytes is constrained by quantifiable food resource ceilings. Predation by the most common fish species in the area, the wrasse Halichoeres tenuispinis, did not appear to alter macrofaunal production in the S. patens bed; however, it did greatly affect the faunal size-structure by eliminating most of the larger animals. The majority of epifaunal animals greater-than-or-equal-to 2.0 mm sieve-size were consumed by H. tenuispinis, while negligible numbers of 0.5-mm sieve-size animals were captured. We postulate that food resource ceilings and predatory size-selectivity are widespread phenomena, affecting epifaunal populations at a variety of locations. Predation is predicted to generally increase rather than decrease faunal abundance because the consumption of each large invertebrate by a predator frees sufficient resources to feed several smaller individuals.","KYUSHU UNIV,AMAKUSA MARINE BIOL LAB,REIHOKU,KUMAMOTO 86325,JAPAN",,,"Aoki, Masakazu/D-8463-2011; Edgar, Graham/AAY-3797-2020; Edgar, Graham/C-8341-2013","Edgar, Graham/0000-0003-0833-9001; Edgar, Graham/0000-0003-0833-9001",,,,70,95,101,0,26,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1993,95,1,,,,,122,133,,10.1007/BF00649515,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LR541,WOS:A1993LR54100017,28313320,,,,2021-09-27,

We estimated survival of Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli) in the central Alaska Range, USA, during years of differing snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) abundance to test whether indirect interactions with a cyclic hare population affect Dall's sheep either negatively, by subsidizing predators (apparent competition), or positively, by diverting predation (apparent commensalism). Annual survival of adult female sheep was consistently high (0.85 for all yr and age classes combined). In contrast, annual estimates of lamb survival ranged from 0.15 to 0.63. The main predators of lambs were coyotes (Canis latrans) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), which rely on hares as their primary food and prey on lambs secondarily. Coyotes and eagles killed 78% of 65 radiocollared lambs for which cause of death was known. Lamb survival was negatively related to hare abundance during the previous year, and lamb survival rates more than doubled when hare abundance declined, supporting the hypothesis of predator-mediated apparent competition between hares and sheep. However, stage-specific predation and delays in predator responses to changes in hare numbers led to a positive relationship between abundance of adult Dall's sheep and hares. Lacking reliable estimates of survival, a manager might erroneously conclude that hares benefit sheep. Thus, support for different indirect effects can be obtained from different types of data, which demonstrates the need to determine the mechanisms that create indirect interactions. Long-term survey data suggest that predation by coyotes is limiting this sheep population below levels typical when coyotes were rare or absent. Understanding the nature of indirect interactions is necessary to effectively manage complex predator-prey communities.","[Arthur, Stephen M.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [Prugh, Laura R.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Arthur, SM (corresponding author), Alaska Dept Fish & Game, 1300 Coll Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA.",steve.arthur@alaska.gov,"Arthur, Stephen/AAP-1708-2021; Brainerd, Scott M./A-1172-2010",,Alaska Department of Fish and Game; Alaska Chapter of the Foundation for North American Wild Sheep; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Welder Wildlife Foundation [691],"Funding for this work was provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in cooperation with the Alaska Chapter of the Foundation for North American Wild Sheep, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada).

We tested this assumption by measuring the mortality rates of Eupemphix nattereri (cryptic behavior) and Rhinella schneideri (unpalatable) tadpoles in association with the predatory fish Oreochromis niloticus (vertebrate) and the dragonfly larvae of Aeshna sp. (invertebrate). We designed a second experiment to evaluate whether fish predators are capable of learning to avoid unpalatable prey once they have encountered it. Our results showed that fish preyed selectively on palatable tadpoles, avoiding unpalatable tadpoles and that the odonate larvae were more efficient in preying on the more active unpalatable tadpoles and less efficient in capturing those tadpoles that presented cryptic behaviors. Additionally, our data suggest that the antipredator traits of tadpoles can interact with each other, with cryptic tadpoles showing lesser mortality when co-occurring with unpalatable tadpoles and odonate predators. Unpalatable tadpoles also increase the mortality of cryptic tadpoles in the presence of experienced fish predators. These prey traits interact in modifying the prey preference of the predator, which constitutes a prey-induced trait-mediated interaction (TMI). This type of TMI is dependent on the system complexity (number of predator and prey species interactions) and could define food web properties, such as the role of predators and the number of competitor species in the system.","[Nomura, F.] Univ Fed Goias, UFG, Dept Ecol, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [do Prado, V.

Limited availability of surface seeds fords some birds to scratch for seeds buried beneath soil, snow, or litter. Artificial seed trays were used to test the ability of five different sparrow species to extract seeds buried at different depths in soil. The results suggest three functional groups based on relative scratching ability. Strong scratchers, which included eastern towhee and song and white-throated sparrows. mel or exceeded their energetic requirements when foraging on seeds buried at ail depths (down to a maximum depth of 1.50-2.25 cm). A weak scratching species, Savannah sparrow, scratched with the same frequency as the strong scratchers, but experienced negative energy budgets when forced to forage on sub-surface seeds. Finally, a non-scratching species, field sparrow, failed to extract any buried seeds. Level of scratching ability may influence foraging efficiency at low resource densities. As a result, interspecific differences in scratching ability may contribute to habitat selection. Strong scratchers may be adapted to foraging near woody vegetation where intense resource competition and abundant litter limit the availability of surface seeds. Weak scratchers, on the other hand, may be forced to feed away from areas where surface seeds are limited. Since woody vegetation serves as a primary source of protective cover in early successional habitats, a tradeoff between foraging efficiency and the risk of predation may promote the local coexistence of species that differ in relative scratching ability and adaptations to evading predators.","Coll William & Mary, Ctr Conservat Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA","Whalen, DM (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",dwhalen@sevilleta.unm.edu,,,,,,63,6,7,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2000,88,3,,,,,574,584,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880314.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,292UK,WOS:000085813300014,,,,,2021-09-27,

We show that in the MF model there are parameter regimes for which prey cannot persist in the absence of predators, but can in their presence. In addition, there are parameter regimes for which prey may persist in isolation, but the presence of predators will increase prey patch density. Predators may thus enhance prey persistence and overall abundance. The key mechanism responsible for this effect is the occurrence of prey dispersal from patches that are occupied by both prey and predators. In addition, these patches should be either long-lived, such as that occurs when predators keep prey from overexploiting its local resource, or the presence of a predator on a patch should significantly enhance the prey dispersal out of that patch. In the SE approach these positive effects of predators on prey persistence and abundance occur for even larger parameter ranges than in the MF model. Prey dispersal from predator-prey patches may thus be important for persistence of both species as a community, independent of the modeling framework studied. Comparison of the MF and SE approaches shows that local dispersal constraints can have the edge over global dispersal for the persistence of the metapopulation in regimes where the two species have a beneficial effect on each other. In general, our model provides an example of feedback in multiple-species metapopulations that can make the implementation of conservation schemes based on single-species arguments very risky.

The resistance of an ecosystem to species invasion is considered to be related to the abundance and diversity of native species (i. e. biotic resistance hypothesis). Theory predicts that the high native diversity in pristine systems can hinder the establishment and/or the spread of non-native species through direct and indirect mechanisms (e. g. through competitive and/or predatory interactions). 2. Here we tested whether predation provides higher resistance to invasion by the Percnidae crab Percnon gibbesi (H. Milne Edwards, 1853) in protected native communities, compared with exploited ones. Specifically, this study aimed to compare: (i) the abundance and diversity of potential predator assemblages of P. gibbesi; (ii) the predation pressure on P. gibbesi; and (iii) the density of this species in two protected and two unprotected sites along the northern Sicilian coast (Italy). 3. The relative predation rate was assessed by manipulative tethering experiments conducted on two size classes of P. gibbesi using long and short tethers, both at protected and unprotected sites. 4. The abundance and diversity of the predators of P. gibbesi and the relative predation rate on tethered crabs were higher at protected than at unprotected sites, independent of crab size and tether length. The density of P. gibbesi was significantly lower in protected compared with unprotected sites. 5. These results suggest that the diversity and abundance of native predator assemblages directly affect the invasion success of P. gibbesi in the Mediterranean Sea. We provided experimental evidence that the restoration of predator assemblages confers ` biotic resistance' to no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) against P. gibbesi invasion. Our study confirms that no-take MPAs are effective in combating non-indigenous species (NIS) invasion, and that it is crucial to establish a long-term monitoring programme to limit the introduction of NIS and to control the spread of existing ones.","[Noe, Simona; Gianguzza, Paola; Di Trapani, Francesco; Vizzini, Salvatrice; Bonaviri, Chiara] Univ Palermo, Dept Earth & Marine Sci, CoNISMa, Via Archirafi 18, Palermo, Italy; [Badalamenti, Fabio] CNR, Inst Coastal Marine Environm IAMC, Castellammare Del Golfo, Italy; [Badalamenti, Fabio; Fernandez, Tomas Vega] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Integrated Marine Ecol Dept, Naples, Italy; [Fernandez, Tomas Vega] CNR, Inst Coastal Marine Environm IAMC, Naples, Italy","Gianguzza, P (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Earth & Marine Sci, CoNISMa, Via Archirafi 18, Palermo, Italy.",paola.gianguzza@unipa.it,"Noe', Simona/AAT-6000-2020; Fernandez, Tomas Vega/AAT-5972-2020; BADALAMENTI, FABIO/B-8508-2015","Noe', Simona/0000-0002-5697-8134; Fernandez, Tomas Vega/0000-0002-8788-4253; , Chiara/0000-0002-3897-2361; BADALAMENTI, FABIO/0000-0002-2395-454X","Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) [RBFR12RXW]","Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), Grant/Award Number: FIRB contract no.

Each group consisted of a medium sized test fish (approximately 250 mg) and three fish larger or smaller than the test fish. In the first experiment food competition was addressed directly by contrasting its presence with its absence. Neither food competition nor relative size of school members had a significant effect on growth. However, there was a highly significant interaction between these two main effects. Under conditions of food competition the medium sized test fish had a three times higher specific growth rate when surrounded by small vs large fish. Under conditions of no food competition when the test fish were separated during feeding a similar but reverse pattern occurred due to differences in food conversion efficiency. In the second experiment, the effects of food quantity and relative size of group members were tested. Both main effects and their interaction were highly significant. Under conditions of low food competition (i.e., surplus food supply) fish grew again better when surrounded by larger fish as compared to their growth rate when surrounded by smaller ones. Size matching via a differential growth rate in a schooling species such as sea bream was suggested to increase the confusion effect by reducing the ability of a predator to focus on an odd sized fish. The implications of direct competition for food for the efficient culture of this species are discussed.","Agr Res Org, Dept Aquaculture, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel; Natl Ctr Mariculture, IL-88112 Elat, Israel","Karplus, I (corresponding author), Agr Res Org, Dept Aquaculture, POB 6, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel.",vlaqua@agri.gov.il,,,,,,20,18,18,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-1742,1573-5168,,FISH PHYSIOL BIOCHEM,Fish Physiol.

To understand these influences, we analyzed trends in populations of seven ungulate species counted during 15 years (1989-2003) of monthly monitoring using vehicle ground counts in the Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Abundance of six species declined markedly and persistently throughout the reserve during this period. The declines were contemporaneous with progressive habitat deterioration due to changing land use in pastoral ranches bordering the reserve, habitat desiccation due to rising temperatures, recurrent severe droughts and an exceptional ENSO flood in 1997-1998. The effect of progressive habitat deterioration was accentuated by illicit harvest, competition with livestock and elevated predation. After factoring out the influence of rainfall, ungulate populations declined more markedly in sections of the reserve experiencing greater livestock incursions and poaching. The declines were significantly correlated with increasing number of settlements and people in the pastoral ranches for five species. Heightened predation following a crash in the buffalo Syncerus caffer population during a severe drought in 1993 had little support as the primary cause of the declines.","[Ogutu, J. O.; Reid, R.

For example, predator complementarity and redundancy can determine prey consumption rates and their stability, yet few studies take into account the multiple predator species Attacking multiple prey at different rates in natural communities. Thus, it remains unclear whether these biodiversity mechanisms are important determinants of consumption in entire predator prey assemblages, such that food-web interaction structure determines community-wide consumption and stability. Here, we use empirical quantitative food webs to study the community-wide effects of functional complementarity and redundancy of consumers (parasitoids) on herbivore control in temperate forests. We find that complementarity in host resource use by parasitoids was a strong predictor of absolute parasitism rates at the community level and that redundancy in host-use patterns stabilized community-wide parasitism rates in space, but not through time. These effects can potentially explain previous contradictory results from predator diversity research. Phylogenetic diversity (measured using taxonomic distance) did not explain functional complementarity or parasitism rates, so could not serve as a surrogate measure for functional complementarity. Our study shows that known mechanisms underpinning predator diversity effects on both functioning and stability can easily be extended to link food webs to ecosystem functioning.","[Peralta, Guadalupe; Frost, Carol M.; Tylianakis, Jason M.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Rand, Tatyana A.] ARS, USDA, Northern Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA; [Didham, Raphael K.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Didham, Raphael K.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Ctr Environm & Life Sci, Floreat, WA 6014, Australia; [Tylianakis, Jason M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Peralta, G (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",gdlp.peralta@gmail.com,"Peralta, Guadalupe/AAF-2319-2019; Didham, Raphael K/B-5953-2011; Tylianakis, Jason/B-6634-2011","Tylianakis, Jason/0000-0001-7402-5620",Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ) [UOC-0802]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Education New Zealand; University of Canterbury; Australian Research Council Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council; Rutherford Discovery Fellowship,"We thank J.

We investigated habitat use patterns using landscape and microhabitat variables. In addition, we explored a previously postulated competition hypothesis involving the Black-breasted Puffleg and the Gorgeted Sunangel Heliangelus strophianus. Our results suggest that landscape variables may play a role in the habitat selection process; specifically the distance to nearest forest border seems to have a significant effect on our habitat model. We speculate that, as the species is known to perform seasonal movements, the avoidance of forest border might reduce the physiological stress caused by altitudinal migration. At microhabitat level, Black-breasted Puffleg seems not sensitive to forest structure variables. Our findings suggest that ensuring forest tract connectivity, between the altitudinal extremes of the species' range at the north-western flanks of the Pichincha volcano, might be crucial for survival of the species during its annual cycle. However, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) indicates that Black-breasted Puffleg and the Gorgeted Sunangel do not overlap spatially, but this finding is not conclusive considering our field observations.","[Guevara, Esteban A.] Area Invest Monitoreo Avifauna Aves & Conservac B, Quito, Ecuador; [Guevara, Esteban A.; Duivenvoorden, Joost F.] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 HX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bonaccorso, Elisa] Univ Tecnol Indoamer Machala & Sabanilla, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Cambio Climat, Quito, Ecuador","Guevara, EA (corresponding author), Area Invest Monitoreo Avifauna Aves & Conservac B, Pasaje Joaquin Tinajero E3-05 & Jorge Drom Casill, Quito, Ecuador.",eguevara@avesconservacion.org,,"Bonaccorso, Elisa/0000-0002-7262-9356; Guevara, Esteban/0000-0002-2220-1298","EcoFondo (Fondo Ambiental Nacional); BirdLife's Preventing Extinction Programme; Ecuadorian National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation SENESCYT","We deeply thank Aves y Conservacion staff for logistical support.

Ecosystems, however, are also commonly connected by flows of resources. We experimentally tested how neighbouring communities indirectly influence each other in absence of dispersal, via resource exchanges. Using two-patch microcosm meta-ecosystems, we manipulated community composition and dynamics, by varying separately species key functional traits (autotroph versus heterotroph species and size of consumer species) and trophic structure of aquatic communities (species growing alone or in presence of competitors or predators). We then analysed the effects of species functional traits and trophic structure on communities connected through spatial subsidies in the absence of actual dispersal. Both functional traits and trophic structure strongly affected dynamics across neighbouring communities. Heterotroph communities connected to autotroph neighbours developed better than with heterotroph neighbours, such that coexistence of competitors was determined by the functional traits of the neighbouring community. Densities in autotroph communities were also strikingly higher when receiving subsidies from heterotroph communities compared to their own subsidies when grown in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, communities connected to predator-dominated ecosystems collapsed, without any direct contact with the predators. Our results demonstrate that because community composition and structure modify the distribution of biomass within a community, they may also affect communities connected through subsidies through quantitative and qualitative changes of detritus flows. This stresses that ecosystem management should account for such interdependencies mediated by spatial subsidies, given that local community alterations cascade across space onto other ecosystems even if species dispersal is completely absent.","[Gounand, Isabelle; Harvey, Eric; Altermatt, Florian] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gounand, Isabelle; Harvey, Eric; Ganesanandamoorthy, Pravin; Altermatt, Florian] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Dubendorf, Switzerland","Gounand, I (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.; Gounand, I (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Dubendorf, Switzerland.",isabelle.gounand@eawag.ch,"Harvey, Eric/L-7029-2019","Harvey, Eric/0000-0002-8601-7326; Gounand, Isabelle/0000-0002-0675-3973; Altermatt, Florian/0000-0002-4831-6958",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PP00P3_150698]; University of Zurich; Eawag,"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation Grant PP00P3_150698, University of Zurich and Eawag.",,58,14,15,0,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2017,126,7,,,,,972,979,,10.1111/oik.03922,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EZ3RS,WOS:000404628700006,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-27,

Using a substitutive design in a field setting, I measured the effects of two size classes of IG predators (large and small larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius) on the mortality of IG prey (larvae of the dragonfly Pachydiplax longipennis). I also examined whether combinations of large A. junius and P. longipennis and small A. junius and P. longipennis had substitutable effects on shared prey (larvae of the damselfly Ischnura verticalis). The presence of both size classes of A. junius, when alone and in combination with P. longipennis, significantly increased mortality of I. verticalis. In the presence of P. longipennis, large and small A. junius had similar effects on the mortality of I. verticalis, and effects of size-structured assemblages of A. junius were similar to the effects of each size class alone at the same density. The effects of the two size classes of A. junius on P. longipennis differed, and P. longipennis mortality was lower when exposed to size structured assemblages of A. junius than when exposed to only large A. junius at the same density. Results were similar to those in a laboratory study, although the effect of P. longipennis on L verticalis was much lower in the field setting. These results demonstrate that interactions between different size classes of IG predators promote the survival of IG prey and highlight the importance of within-species size structure as a characteristic that may promote the coexistence of predators in IGP systems.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Crumrine, PW (corresponding author), Longwood Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",crumrinepw@longwood.edu,"Crumrine, Patrick W/I-7975-2016","Crumrine, Patrick W/0000-0002-5752-8231",,,,72,35,39,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2005,145,1,,,,,132,139,,10.1007/s00442-005-0084-6,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,963CC,WOS:000231779500013,15968538,,,,2021-09-27,

This is the task that confronts efforts to understand dietary resource partitioning among co-occurring juvenile shark species within nursery areas. Here, stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) is used to overcome these challenges in describing species dietary resource partitioning strategies within the communal shark nursery area of Cleveland Bay, Queensland, Australia. We analyzed the isotopic composition of 3 distinct tissues, (muscle, blood plasma, and red blood cells), for 7 species of shark and 3 species of large predatory teleost to investigate whether these communal areas support their diverse array of predators without the need for resource partitioning strategies. Clustered delta N-15 values for all examined species indicated feeding within the same trophic level; however, wide ranging delta C-13 values denoted exploitation of several primary carbon sources. Our results demonstrate inter-species resource partitioning strategies at work within the examined communal shark nursery, altering the previous interpretation of these areas as resource-rich and/or competitionlimited environments.","[Kinney, Michael J.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Fishing & Fisheries Res Ctr, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hussey, Nigel E.; Fisk, Aaron T.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada","Kinney, MJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Fishing & Fisheries Res Ctr, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",michael.kinney@my.jcu.edu.au,"Kinney, Mike/Q-3787-2019; Simpfendorfer, Colin A/G-9681-2011; Hussey, Nigel E/F-9699-2015","Kinney, Mike/0000-0001-7846-8349; Simpfendorfer, Colin A/0000-0002-0295-2238; ",Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility (MTSRF); James Cook University (JCU); School for Earth and Environmental Sciences (SEES),"This research was supported by funding from the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility (MTSRF), James Cook University (JCU), and the School for Earth and Environmental Sciences (SEES).

On coral reefs, the consequences of varied space use by herbivores on benthic community structure are not well understood, nor are the relative influences of bottom-up (resource abundance and quality), horizontal (competition), and top-down (predation risk) factors in affecting spatial foraging behaviors of mobile herbivorous fishes. In the current study we quantified space use and feeding rates of the parrotfish, Chlorurus spilurus, across a strong gradient of food resources and predator and competitor abundance across two islands with drastically different fisheries management schemes. We found evidence that while feeding rates of this species are affected by direct interference competition and chronic predation risk, space use appears to be primarily related to exploitative competition with the surrounding herbivore community. We found no evidence that predation risk influences diurnal foraging space use in this small bodied parrotfish species. Additionally, we found the influence of chronic predation risk on feeding rates of this species to be less dramatic than the results of recent studies that used model predators to measure acute behavioral responses of other species of herbivorous fishes. Our results indicate that the non-consumptive effects of predators on the foraging behaviors of coral reef herbivores may be less dramatic than previously thought.","[Davis, Kathryn; Carlson, P.

To examine the overall effect of adult bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) on larval bluegill. we conducted a field experiment in which we manipulated adult densities and quantified larval growth and survival, prey abundance, invertebrate predator abundance, and cannibalism. The presence of adult bluegill had a negative effect on final larval mass. This response was consistent with competition for zooplankton prey. Adult bluegill reduced the abundance of large zooplankton (e.g., Chaoborus and Daphnia), which were the dominant prey of bluegill larvae in the absence of adults. Larvae in the no-adult treatment also had significantly more prey in their stomachs compared to larvae in the presence of adults. Larval survival was maximized at intermediate adult densities and the overall production of larvae peaked at intermediate adult densities. The higher larval survival at intermediate adult densities is attributed to a reduction in invertebrate predators in treatments with adult bluegill: invertebrate predators experienced an 80% reduction in the presence of adult fish. Decreased larval survival at the highest adult density was not due to resource limitation and may be due to cannibalism. which was not directly observed in our study. but has been observed in other studies.","Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA; Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Rettig, JE (corresponding author), Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",rettig@denison.edu,"Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013","Mittelbach, Gary/0000-0001-6971-9273",,,,68,16,18,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2002,130,2,,,,,222,230,,10.1007/s004420100790,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,522TB,WOS:000173912100008,28547145,,,,2021-09-27,

Bird plumage can be odorous and consequently nest predators could use odor to identify and locate avian prey, and nest competitors could use odor to assess occupancy of nest cavities by birds. However, despite extensive research on avian nest predation and competition, the costs of olfactory eavesdropping on plumage odor by nest predators or competitors remain largely unknown. We used two experiments to investigate whether feather odor is detected by marsupial species which are competitors for nest hollows and predators of eggs and nestlings of crimson rosellas, Platycercus elegans. In the first experiment, odor presentation at nest boxes utilized by ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and rosellas showed that the latency of possums to enter the nest was shorter when crimson rosella odor was present compared to the controls. In the second experiment, carried out away from nest hollows, brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) discriminated odors of two predators (dingo, Canis lupus dingo, and cat, Felis catus) from crimson rosella and control odors; however, they did not discriminate between crimson rosella odor and a control. We show that marsupials may use feather odor cues to assess nest hollow status, information which could aid their detection of avian prey or their vigilance at nest hollows (for which they compete with parrots). To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that wild mammalian predators and competitors of birds respond to plumage odor at nests and suggest that odor signaling may have hitherto unrecognized costs for birds.","[Mihailova, Milla; Berg, Mathew L.; Buchanan, Katherine L.; Bennett, Andrew T.

Here we examined the effects of multiple consumers on bacteria. Specifically, we investigated the separate and combined effects of two common bacterivorous ciliates, Colpidium striatum and Paramecium caudatum, on a simple bacterial assemblage. Non-additive multiple predator effects emerged for all bacterial species significantly affected by grazing, where bacterial responses in the two-consumer treatment cannot be predicted by summing the separate effects of the two consumers. Some species showed risk reduction (observed responses less than expected), whereas others showed risk enhancement (observed responses larger than expected). We attributed risk alteration to the interference between the two consumers. Contradictory to theoretical predictions, total bacterial abundance in the two-consumer treatment did not differ from single-consumer treatments and consumer-free controls, due largely to risk reduction and compensatory responses within the bacterial assemblage. Decomposition of particulate organic matter was greater in the two-consumer treatment than the Paramecium single-consumer treatment, but did not differ among other treatments. These results suggest that the presence of multiple consumers may have unexpected impacts on the structure and functioning of bacterial communities.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Jiang, L (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",lin.jiang@biology.gatech.edu,"Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019","Krumins, Jennifer/0000-0002-1231-2453",,,,64,9,9,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids as well as immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as aphids, whiteflies and soft scales. Field experiments assessing the importance of interspecific competition between autoparasitoids and primary parasitoids, as well as its impact on herbivore suppression, are scarcely found in the ecological literature. 2. Using field data from 40 olive orchards, this study examined the mechanisms that regulate: (i) the interspecific competition between primary parasitoids of the genus Metaphycus and the autoparasitoid Coccophagus lycimnia; and (ii) the density of their shared herbivore host, the soft scale Saissetia oleae. 3. Metaphycus parasitoids used smaller hosts than C. lycimnia, yet did not outcompete C. lycimnia. On the other hand, C. lycimnia preferred to use Metaphycus females as secondary hosts for producing males rather than their own females. This preference might explain why the autoparasitoid negatively affected the density of the primary parasitoids. 4. Parasitism by the autoparasitoid C. lycimnia at the beginning of the season was the sole variable positively related to host mortality throughout the season, showing its greater effect on herbivore suppression. 5. In this study, an autoparasitoid, inferior at resource exploitation, was shown to outcompete a primary parasitoid without disrupting herbivore suppression.","[Marrao, Rosalina; Pereira, Jose A.] Inst Politecn Braganca, Escola Super Agr, CIMO, Braganca, Portugal; [Frago, Enric] CIRAD, Ctr Biol Gest Populat, UMR CBGP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Tena, Alejandro] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Ctra CV 315,Km 10-7, E-46113 Moncada, Spain","Tena, A (corresponding author), Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Ctra CV 315,Km 10-7, E-46113 Moncada, Spain.",atena@ivia.es,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Pereira, Jose A./L-6798-2014","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Pereira, Jose A./0000-0002-2260-0600",,,,44,0,0,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Different zooplankton species showed different responses to the introduction of the fish. In the presence of the fish, the populations of the large cladoceran Ceriodaphnia and the predatory copepod Mesocyclops were reduced, but the population of the herbivorous copepod Eodiaptomus and the small cladocerans Bosmina fatalis and Bosminopsis deitersi increased relative to the controls. The increase of Mesocyclops seen in the control tanks might have suppressed the populations of the small cladocerans, which are vulnerable to invertebrate predation. The results suggest that the population densities of the large prey items preferred by the fish, Ceriodaphnia and Mesocyclops, were controlled directly by fish predation, but the population densities of the smaller and less preferred zooplankton were controlled indirectly through the foodweb cascade.","Shinshu Univ, Res & Educ Ctr Inlandwater Environm, Suwa 3920027, Japan","Chang, KH (corresponding author), Shinshu Univ, Res & Educ Ctr Inlandwater Environm, 5-2-4 Kogandori, Suwa 3920027, Japan.",changkwang38@hotmail.com,,"Nagata, Takamaru/0000-0002-7764-2541; chang, Kwang-Hyeon/0000-0002-7952-4047",,,,29,13,13,0,12,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",1439-8621,,,LIMNOLOGY,Limnology,AUG,2004,5,2,,,,,121,124,,10.1007/s10201-004-0116-7,,,4,Limnology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,845VT,WOS:000223274100008,,,,,2021-09-27,

Within these agroecosystems, generalist predators form an important component of the assemblage of natural enemies, and can exert significant pressure on prey populations. These food webs are complex and molecular gut-content analyses offer nondisruptive approaches for examining trophic linkages in the field. We describe the development of a molecular detection system to examine the feeding behaviour of Orius insidiosus (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) upon soybean aphids, an alternative prey item, Neohydatothrips variabilis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and an intraguild prey species, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Specific primer pairs were designed to target prey and were used to examine key trophic connections within this soybean food web. In total, 32% of O. insidiosus were found to have preyed upon A. glycines, but disproportionately high consumption occurred early in the season, when aphid densities were low. The intensity of early season predation indicates that O. insidiosus are important biological control agents of A. glycines, although data suggest that N. variabilis constitute a significant proportion of the diet of these generalist predators. No Orius were found to contain DNA of H. axyridis, suggesting intraguild predation upon these important late-season predators during 2005 was low. In their entirety, these results implicate O. insidiosus as a valuable natural enemy of A. glycines in this soybean agroecosystem.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; USDA ARS, Invas Insect Biocontrol & Behav Lab, BARC, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Harwood, JD (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, S 225 Agr Sci Ctr N, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",james.harwood@uky.edu,"Yoo, Ho Jung/AAE-3974-2019; Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013; Yoo, Ho Jung S/N-7069-2013","Yoo, Ho Jung/0000-0001-9677-0947; Yoo, Ho Jung S/0000-0001-9677-0947; Harwood, James/0000-0002-0018-7288",,,,60,138,142,0,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We examine how the physicochemical environment contributes to the invasion success of Orconectes palmeri, a non-native crayfish, in the lower Flint River basin, Georgia, USA. We examined the distribution of Procambarus spiculifer, a native crayfish, and O. palmeri within the lower Flint River basin, and examined associations between species relative abundance and physicochemical variables. Within the lower Flint River, O. palmeri was found almost exclusively at upstream sites, while P. spiculifer was more abundant downstream. We did not detect small O. palmeri downstream, suggesting little recruitment in this area. Within tributaries, only native crayfish were observed. O. palmeri was more abundant at sites with warmer water temperatures, and P. spiculifer was more abundant at sites with cooler water temperatures, which were maintained by ground water seepage. P. spiculifer abundance was also positively associated with abundance of coarse wood. Laboratory studies demonstrated that O. palmeri selected warmer temperatures than P. spiculifer, suggesting that warmer temperatures in the upstream area favor O. palmeri. Water temperatures may have increased in recent years due to human withdrawals from the aquifer and the installation of upstream dams, creating a thermal regime that P. spiculifer has not historically encountered. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of groundwater inputs and a forested riparian buffer is crucial to protect populations of P. spiculifer and to prevent further spread by O. palmeri, especially if climatic changes result in warmer waters.","[Sargent, Lindsey W.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Golladay, Stephen W.; Opsahl, Stephen P.] Joseph W Jones Ecol Res Ctr, Newton, GA 39870 USA; [Covich, Alan P.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Sargent, LW (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",lsargen1@nd.edu,"Reisinger, Lindsey S/F-8030-2016","Reisinger, Lindsey S/0000-0001-6685-5958",Robert W.

Field surveys and one experiment manipulating the presence of ants and the aphid species were conducted to test the hypothesis that ants play a role in structuring the community of these aphids on apple. 3. Ants tended D. plantaginea and Aphis spp. but not E. lanigerum colonies. In the field, D. plantaginea performed better in the presence of ants while no effect was observed in Aphis spp. Contrarily, populations of Aphis spp. in the manipulative experiment performed better in the presence of ants while no differences were observed for D. plantaginea. Such differences between field and manipulative conditions could be related to thermal tolerance, phenology, and life cycles. In contrast, populations of E. lanigerum were reduced in the presence of ants. 4. Ants also had a significant negative effect on the abundance of natural enemies, which could partially explain the benefits to the tended aphids. However, while ants did not provide a benefit to Aphis spp. when it was reared alone, in the presence of other species ant attendance increased Aphis abundance by 256% and simultaneously reduced E. lanigerum abundance by 63%. Therefore, ants benefited Aphis by reducing competition with other aphid species, which involves a different mechanism, explaining the benefit of ant attendance. Considering all the aphid species together, ants had a net positive effect on aphid abundance, which was consequently considered harmful for the plant. 5. Our results highlighted the role that ants play in structuring apple aphid communities and give support to the observed pattern that ants can benefit tended aphids while simultaneously reducing the abundance of untended herbivores.","[Minarro, Marcos; Fernandez-mata, Gabriela] SERIDA, E-33300 Villaviciosa De Odon, Asturias, Spain; [Fernandez-mata, Gabriela; Medina, Pilar] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Agronomos, Unidad Protecc Cultivos, Madrid, Spain","Minarro, M (corresponding author), SERIDA, Apdo 13, E-33300 Villaviciosa De Odon, Asturias, Spain.",mminarro@serida.org,"Medina, Pilar/K-5295-2017","Medina, Pilar/0000-0003-4642-3554",Fundacion Premio Arce to G.

It has been proposed that rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), which decimated populations of European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Spain, led to prey switching by raptors towards red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) causing declines in their populations as a peculiar case of hyperpredation. We have reviewed field studies that disagree with estimates (based on bag records) of recent increases of rabbit and partridge numbers in Spain. Because of an increase in releases of farm-reared animals, there is doubt about the use of bag records to accurately estimate population trends in recent decades. We also provide new data and discuss some analytical considerations related to the temporal and spatial scales that might affect the interpretation of data. Finally, we discuss why studies associated with raptor food habits, predator population dynamics and predator distribution suggest that diet data are not sufficient to link patterns and processes. Although we agree that the RHD outbreak has markedly affected rabbit populations, which has indirectly affected many other species in the Iberian Peninsula, we consider that hyperpredation mediated by raptors has not been clearly demonstrated. In contrast, endorsing the hypothesis of raptor-mediated hyperpredation without sufficient proof may have conflictive consequences if we consider the increased persecution of raptors in recent decades in Spain.","[Blanco-Aguiar, Jose A.] Univ Porto, CIBIO, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Blanco-Aguiar, Jose A.; Delibes-Mateos, Miguel; Arroyo, Beatriz; Ferreras, Pablo; Casas, Fabian; Real, Raimundo; Vinuela, Javier] CSIC UCLM JCCM, IREC, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Real, Raimundo; Mario Vargas, J.] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Casas, Fabian] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland","Blanco-Aguiar, JA (corresponding author), Univ Porto, CIBIO, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.",jota.blanco@gmail.com,"Blanco-Aguiar, Jose A/L-8052-2013; Villafuerte, Rafael/P-9155-2019; Ferreras, Pablo/A-6017-2009; Villafuerte, Rafael/L-8715-2013; Casas, Fabian/AAE-9846-2020; Arroyo, Beatriz/A-3504-2013; Casas, Fabian/Y-3021-2018; Delibes-Mateos, Miguel/F-8733-2014; Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010","Blanco-Aguiar, Jose A/0000-0003-0041-1996; Villafuerte, Rafael/0000-0001-7582-4299; Ferreras, Pablo/0000-0002-1116-6706; Villafuerte, Rafael/0000-0001-7582-4299; Casas, Fabian/0000-0003-3662-6585; Arroyo, Beatriz/0000-0002-4657-6609; Casas, Fabian/0000-0003-3662-6585; Delibes-Mateos, Miguel/0000-0002-3823-5935; Real, Raimundo/0000-0002-6642-1284; Vargas Yanez, Juan Mario/0000-0002-2841-5481; Vinuela, Javier/0000-0002-8916-0398",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BPD/65464/2009]; Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla la Mancha (JCCM)Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha,"J.A.

I hypothesized that rotifers persist in these isolated ponds due to the absence of either competition with or predation by potentially sympatric crustaceans, especially anostracans. I tested the latter idea with laboratory and field experiments, in each case exposing rotifers to adult fairy shrimp (Branchinecta mackini, the dominant anostracan in this region in winter ponds) in 200 ml microcosms. In most cases individual female fairy shrimp had distinct negative effects on rotifer suspensions due to direct predatory consumption of the smaller animals. Estimated effective water processing rates ranged from ca. 50 to over 300 ml ind(-1) h(-1) and rotifer consumption rates by female B. mackini were between 280 and > 600 Hexarthra consumed per individual predator per hour. Male B. mackini never significantly reduced rotifer numbers in either laboratory or field microcosms. The results indicate that, while perhaps not the sole determinant of rotifer distribution in these ephemeral pools, fairy shrimp predation can have a strong negative influence on natural Hexarthra populations.","Univ Nevada, Dept Biol Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA","Starkweather, PL (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",strkwthr@ccmail.nevada.edu,,,,,,16,10,11,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP 1,2005,546,,,,,,503,508,,10.1007/s10750-005-4292-1,,,6,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,981WE,WOS:000233117900052,,,,,2021-09-27,

Land clearing and associated early-successional forests have resulted in a greater density and distribution of moose (Alces alces), deer (Odocoileus spp.), and their associated predators. This process of apparent competition has resulted in increased predation on woodland caribou. We employed a combination of field and statistical methods to better understand the distribution and interactions of wolves (Canis lupus) and caribou across a region with high levels of industrial development. We used count models to investigate the frequency of wolf occurrence relative to landcover types, disturbance features, and caribou habitat. As predicted, the co-occurrence between caribou and wolves was rare. Similarly, the remains of caribou were identified at a small proportion of the sites where wolves killed large prey. Caribou occurred at low densities across the study area, and thus, wolves likely pursued other more abundant deer species. Encounters between wolves and caribou habitat was most likely to occur in the low-elevation boreal forest and areas closer to and with higher densities of forestry cutblocks. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the spatial dynamics of multi-species interactions when developing recovery strategies for threatened and endangered species.","[Ehlers, Libby P.

We studied the spatial distribution of avian microtine predators using data from 19 study areas on the tundra of northern Siberia. 2. Numbers of snowy owls, and long-tailed skuas and pomarine skuas depended strongly on Iemming density. However, a significant relationship between lemming density and number of rough-legged buzzards appeared first after removal of the effect of snowy owl abundance on the distribution of rough-legged buzzards. 3. We applied a recently developed method (Manly 1995) to examine co-occurrences of species and found that rough-legged buzzards and snowy owls did not co-occur while snowy owls, long-tailed skuas and pomarine skuas did. 4. There are large differences in nest construction and chick behaviour between rough-legged buzzards and the three other species. Moreover, the snow owl is a polyphagous predator preying also on large birds including raptor chicks. Therefore, we propose that reduced risk of nest predation favours rough-legged buzzards nesting away from snowy owls. 5. Variations in abundance of the two lemming species did not seem to influence the distributions of snowy owls and rough-legged buzzards. Neither was it likely that latitudinally related factors such as breeding season length affected the distribution of rough-legged buzzards.","Gothenburg Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Anim Ecol, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Lund, Dept Anim Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Wiklund, CG (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Anim Ecol, Med Aregatan 18, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,"Wiklund, Christer G/0000-0003-3898-0289",,,,58,26,26,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Despite strong negative density-dependent effects on habitat selection, more recent studies indicate that animals settle near members of their own (conspecific) and other species (heterospecific) when selecting habitat with social cues. Social cue use for habitat selection is particularly common among songbirds, but few studies have investigated if songbirds use social cues to assess conspecific or heterospecific density (as opposed to just presence/absence) when making settlement decisions. We conducted a playback experiment to evaluate if yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia) and willow flycatchers (Empidonax traillii), two potential competitors for breeding habitat, use social cues to assess density (conspecific for warblers and heterospecific for flycatchers) when selecting breeding locations at two spatial scales. We simulated yellow warbler density to be high or low at multiple treatment plots (3.14ha) with song playback and then evaluated settlement decisions by comparing yellow warbler and willow flycatcher abundances across plots (broad-scale habitat selection) and individual space use within plots (fine-scale territory establishment). Yellow warbler density treatments did not affect habitat selection by yellow warblers at the broad scale, but caused individuals to cluster territories at high-density treatments. Willow flycatchers were most abundant at high-density treatment plots, but yellow warbler density treatments did not affect territory locations. The results indicate that perceived density affects the habitat selection process for both conspecifics and heterospecifics.","[Kelly, Janice K.; Ward, Michael P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chiavacci, Scott J.] US Geol Survey, Sci & Decis Ctr, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Benson, Thomas J.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Kelly, JK (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jkkelly2@illinois.edu,,,"Army Corps of Engineers, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory","Army Corps of Engineers, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory",,98,7,7,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,APR,2018,124,4,,,,,269,278,,10.1111/eth.12730,,,10,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FZ0GV,WOS:000427247000008,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, few studies have rigorously tested predictions of IFD models in situations involving multiple species and trophic levels. We fully parameterized and tested predictions of a general interference IFD model for both predators and prey in a tritrophic system: seven-spotted lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Hemiptera: Aphididae), and tic bean plants (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae). We used habitat selection treatments having both predators and prey in the presence and absence of one another. We also performed experiments to quantify the strength of interspecific competition, the functional response of predators and several measures of fitness for the prey. Our results show that whether prey were present or not, predators followed IFD predictions and aggregated most strongly in the patch with the highest-quality resource. Prey in the presence of predators followed the predicted IFD, which was similar to a uniform distribution. However, prey in the absence of predators moved infrequently and were far from ideal free, suggesting that predators instigated habitat selection behaviour. Our results underscore the importance of considering trophic interactions and multiple measures of patch quality in studies of habitat selection. The observed departures from theoretical predictions also usefully suggest promising extensions for future theory and experiments. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Predation was highest in no-till and moldboard-plowed environments (averaging 32% in both) and lowest in chisel-plowed environments (averaging 24%). This indicates chat the relationship between the level of disturbance and predation is nonlinear and chat other factors, such as the mobility of invertebrates and food availability may also play important roles in determining the quantity of seed predation. In no-till, the type of crop residue also influenced the quantity of predation, with highest seed predation found in plots with corn residue (averaging 31%) and lowest in those with soybean and wheat residue (24 and 21%, respectively). It is apparent that there is an optimum combination of residue quantity and quality that maximizes the quantity of seed predation. Based on the experimental design used in this study, no feeding preference by seed predators was detected between common lambsquarters and barnyardgrass. Density-dependent feeding, however, was evident for both species. Most biological control efforts have centered around predators with specific feeding habits. We contend that invertebrates with opportunistic feeding strategies that Feed on weed seeds may be the most significant broad spectrum and natural Form of biological weed control affecting weed population dynamics. Populations of beneficial arthropods should be conserved, and management strategies that augment the size of their natural populations should be encouraged.","Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Univ Waterloo, Dept Environm & Resource Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Swanton, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",cswanton@plant.uoguelph.ca,,,,,,59,118,126,0,37,WEED SCI SOC AMER,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0043-1745,,,WEED SCI,Weed Sci.,MAR-APR,1999,47,2,,,,,184,194,,10.1017/S0043174500091608,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,209AN,WOS:000081025000010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Yet, the presence of additional host species can alter competitive interactions, even if the host is unsuitable for parasitoid development. In alfalfa of the mid-western USA, a native parasitoid species, Praon pequodorum, was once a dominant natural enemy, but it has become rare since the introduction of another parasitoid, Aphidius ervi. Despite A. ervi's competitive superiority for their most common host, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphum pisum, P. pequodorum still persists at low densities. We performed a suite of laboratory and field studies to determine if the presence of an alternative host, the spotted alfalfa aphid Therioaphis maculata, may mitigate A. ervi's competitive superiority and facilitate P. pequodorum's persistence. We show that spotted alfalfa aphids reduce the foraging efficiency of both parasitoid species for pea aphids, despite spotted alfalfa aphids being an unsuitable host. This decrease in efficiency, however, was not symmetrical; the presence of spotted alfalfa aphids had a greater detrimental effect on A. ervi foraging for pea aphids. This might facilitate the persistence of the competitively inferior P. pequodorum. Our study suggests that indirect effects generated by the presence of alternative hosts are important for understanding parasitoid-host dynamics and overall insect community structure.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Madison W High Sch, Madison, WI USA","Harmon, JP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jharmon@wisc.edu,"Harmon, Jason/AAW-3036-2021; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Harmon, Jason/0000-0002-2533-5005; Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523",,,,40,19,20,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

Forty-seven putative fish species were observed. Distinct fish faunal groups were identified based on maximum numbers and percentage of observations. Both analyses broadly agreed on the community structure: A bathyal group at < 3000 m in the New Hebrides and Kermadec trenches, an abyssal group (3039 4692 m) in the Kermadec Trench, an abyssal-hadal transition zone (AHTZ) group (Kermadec: 4707-6068 m, Mariana: 4506-6198 m, New Hebrides: 2578-6898 m, South Fiji Basin: 4074-4101 m), and a hadal group of endemic snailfish in the Kermadec and Mariana trenches (6750-7669 m and 6831-8143 m respectively). The abyssal and hadal groups were absent from the New Hebrides Trench. Depth was the single factor that best explained the biological variation between samples (16%), the addition of temperature and average surface primary production for the previous year increased this to 36% of variation. The absence of the abyssal group from the New Hebrides Trench and South Fiji Basin was due to the absence of macrourids (Coryphaenoides spp.), which defined the group. The macrourids may be energetically limited in these areas. In their absence the species of the AHTZ group appear released of competition with the macrourids and are found far shallower at these sites. The fish groups had distinct feeding strategies while attending the bait: The bathyal and abyssal groups were almost exclusively necrophagous, the AHTZ group comprised predatory and generalist feeders, while the hadal snailfishes were exclusively predators. With increasing depth, predation was found to increase while scavenging decreased. The data suggest scavenging fish fauna do not extend deeper than the hadal boundary.","[Linley, T.

We tested whether differences in flower number, pollen production, and leaf trichome density among 17 pepper (Capsicum annuum Linnaeus) varieties influenced the abundance and predation intensity by the omnivorous mite Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot. A greenhouse experiment was conducted where pepper plants were infested with thrips (Frankliniella cephalica Crawford DL) and subsequently exposed to A. swirskii. We estimated thrips and mite density based on arthropod counts conducted over a 4-week period, and also performed flower and trichome counts, and estimated pollen production per anther. Significant differences were found among varieties for all three traits, as well as mite and thrips density. After accounting for all traits in a multiple regression model, we found that flower and trichome number had significant positive effects on mite density (by providing food and shelter, respectively). Increased mite density was in turn associated with a decrease in thrips density, presumably as a result of mite predation. Moreover, we found that flower number (but not trichome density) increased the strength of thrips suppression and that such an effect was mediated by mite density. These findings suggest that genetic variation for plant traits may indirectly influence herbivore suppression in peppers (although traits may vary in the strength or direction of their effects), and underscore the evolutionary potential and importance of selection not only for direct but also indirect resistance in crops.","[Abdala-Roberts, Luis; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Berny-Mier y Teran, Jorge C.; Moguel-Ordonez, Yolanda B.; Tut-Pech, Felipe] Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias, Campo Expt Mococha, Mococha, Yucatan, Mexico","Abdala-Roberts, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",labdala@uci.edu,,"Berny Mier y Teran, Jorge C./0000-0003-3709-9131",INIFAP,"The authors would like to thank Chenko Chale Macias for assistance during the establishment and set up of the experiment, as well E.

We tested whether low concentrations of malathion (0.11 ppm) that are often detected in aquatic systems, affect competition between two invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes japonicus Theobald. There were no survivors of Ae. japonicus larvae in malathion.

There was also a moderate negative effect of Ae. japonicus density on Ae. albopictus female size, but this effect was absent in the presence of malathion.

Adult shrimp (Atya lanipes) are present only above waterfalls that pose barriers to predatory fishes. Because we have not found Atya in fish stomachs, we think that these amphidromous shrimp avoid predation by migrating to locations above waterfalls as post-larvae. We designed experiments in an artificial y-maze and in natural streams to test whether Atya avoid predatory fishes. In artificial streams, adult Atya avoided the scent of 2 fishes (Gobiomorus dormitor and Agonostomus monticola) regardless of whether the fish had recently been fed Atya, but they avoided the scent of Anguilla rostrata only when they had recently been fed Atya. Post larval Atya avoided the scent of G. dormitor fed Atya and of crushed conspecifics. We then tested whether adult Atya in 4 natural headwater streams would redistribute themselves if exposed to the chemical scent or physical presence (visual, mechanical, and chemical cues) of G. dormitor. We expected Atya to move upstream from the manipulated pools, resulting in increased emigration from and lower Atya abundance in the pool. Atya relative abundance did not decline significantly in the pools when fish scent was added, indicating that chemical cues alone were not threatening enough to alter adult behavior in natural streams. The relative abundance of adults declined significantly in the pools when fish were added to in-stream cages, a result suggesting that addition of mechanical or visual cues to chemical cues signaled imminent danger and caused Atya to alter their behavior. Emigration increased, but lower activity levels also could have reduced abundances in pools. Our study provides mechanistic evidence that predatory fishes alter the behavior of postlarval and adult A. lanipes, and might explain why adult Atya are absent in reaches downstream of waterfalls.","Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Hein, CL (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",clhein@gmail.com; facrowl@gmail.com,"Crowl, Todd/C-9576-2011; Hein, Catherine L/C-7202-2012","Hein, Catherine L/0000-0003-0160-655X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0308414],"We thank Chris Blair for his help conducting all of the experiments and Tony Rivera Vargas for help building the fluvariums.

Gizzard shad often become overabundant, competitively reducing growth and recruitment of sport fishes. Using field data and bioenergetics simulations, we evaluated the potential for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides to control the abundance of gizzard shad in small impoundments. We sampled 1.313 largemouth bass stomachs, of which 66% contained prey, from four ponds during 1998 and 1999. Large (greater than or equal to350-mm) largemouth bass consumed the greatest biomass of gizzard shad, eating gizzard shad throughout most of the year. Gizzard shad were more abundant in the stomach contents of largemouth bass less than 350 nun long during late summer and early fall than during winter and early spring. Variation in the mortality of predatory largemouth bass (21% versus 31%), as estimated from weighted catch-curves, resulted in only slight variation (6-7%) in estimates for total annual consumption of gizzard shad. Using Population estimates from the ponds, we considered three predator densities (low - 49/ha: intermediate = 172/ha; and high = 351/ha) in our simulations. Bioenergetics simulations suggested that largemouth bass Populations in these ponds at intermediate and high densities could annually consume between 50 and 186 kg/ha of gizzard shad. Comparison of all estimated range of age-0 gizzard shad abundances and bioenergetics estimates of predator consumption indicated that largemouth bass predation could regulate the abundance of age-0 gizzard shad in small ponds.","Auburn Univ, Dept Fisheries & Allied Aquacultures, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Irwin, BJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Biol Field Stn, 900 Shackelton Point Rd, Bridgeport, NY 13030 USA.",,,,,,,50,23,23,2,15,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

However, in sessile or sedentary systems, immobility might preclude individuals from directly choosing their group or patch. thus making it difficult for them to respond to the costs and benefits of group living or variation in density in general In this study. I test the effect of density on delayed emergence of an effectively sessile species. Study system: Tupelo leafminer, Antispila nysaefoliella Clemens (Lepidoptera Hehozelidae), a specialist of black gum. Nyssa sylvatica Marsh (Cornaceae) The study population is located in the northern Shenandoah Valley in Clarke Co, Virginia. Methods: In 2004 and 2008. I conducted field experiments where I reduced the initial density of larvae on leaves and compared the frequency of occurrence of new larvae after the experimental treatment. In 2008, I also enclosed half of the leaves with fine-mesh bags to exclude compensatory oviposition as a possible cause of subsequent larval emergence Prediction and result: The prediction that the removal of active larvae would lead to more occurrences of secondary larval emergence on experimental leaves compared with control leaves was supported in both years of the experiment. The mesh enclosure treatment (2008) had no effect, which suggests that the higher rate of secondary emergence was not due to eggs that were deposited after larvae were removed Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrate that the presence of active larvae may suppress the development of conspecific larvae (or unhatched eggs) Therefore, the potential number of A nysaefoliella larvae on leaves might not be realized immediately at the beginning of the season Rather, as individuals in the initial cohort die, typically due to parasitism, others may emerge subsequently Although the mechanism is currently unknown, delayed emergence appears to be associated with larval density","[Low, Candace] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Low, C (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Corson Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-0904395],"I especially want to thank Al Uy for his support and field help throughout this project Thanks also to J.

Previous studies showed that adults of P. cinereus are territorial intraspecifically and toward same-size juveniles of P. glutinosus. In our experiment, territorial residents of P: cinereus did not act aggressively toward intruding adults of P. glutinosus and the latter species was neither aggressive nor predatory toward P. cinereus. The two species were equally benign in a second experiment when the roles of resident and intruder were reversed.

We explore recent attempts to assess whether apparent competition may structure herbivorous insect communities. Communities can be described by quantitative food webs from which the potential for apparent competition can be inferred. We illustrate both the construction of a diverse quantitative food web and a field experimental test of apparent competition using our work on leaf-miner communities in Belize.

Spider predation did not reduce grasshopper populations. Avian predation reduced the abundance of large- and small-bodied grasshopper species, but total grasshopper abundance increased in the presence of birds, because medium-sized grasshopper species (250-500 mg adult size) became more abundant. The decrease in abundance of-large-bodied grasshoppers was due to birds preferentially killing them; however, predation did not explain declines in small-bodied grasshoppers or increases in medium-sized grasshoppers. These changes in abundance may be due to avian predation modifying competitive interactions. Medium-sized species increase in abundance, when the competitively superior large-species are reduced; this in turn increases competition by the superior medium-sized species on the small species. Therefore, avian predation produced indirect effects on competitive interactions and acted in a ''keystone'' fashion.",,"BELOVSKY, GE (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, COLL NAT RESOURCES, DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,"Belovsky, Gary/C-1255-2014",,,,,40,82,91,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1993,68,2,,,,,193,201,,10.2307/3544830,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MJ666,WOS:A1993MJ66600001,,,,,2021-09-27,

The rationale behind this approach is twofold. First, interspecific competition among herbivorous arthropods is thought to be weak; populations are kept at low levels through the action of natural enemies. Second, the potential benefits of an herbivorous biological control agent must be weighed against the damage it causes to the host plant through its feeding. In the field we have been successful at using less economically important Willamette mites to control economically important Pacific mites. In greenhouse and field experiments reported here, we examined both direct and indirect mechanisms (via the host plant or a shared predator) to explain this negative interaction. In our first greenhouse experiment we injured leaves on single canes of young Zinfandel grapevines with Willamette mites at four density levels, removed these mites and then measured consequences of this past injury on Pacific mites placed on newly produced leaves. Pacific mite populations were reduced significantly by previous Willamette mite injury, suggesting a systemic induced response. In our second greenhouse experiment we measured the relative importance of interspecific interactions between concurrent populations of Willamette and Pacific mites, direct predation by a phytoseiid predator, and interactions between predation and competition (apparent competition). Predators and prey were confined to single canes and, at this small scale, direct predation was of overriding importance while interspecific competition and apparent competition were not significant in determining Pacific mite populations. We examined the relative importance of an early season release of Willamette mites, predaceous mites, or both in a large field experiment conducted in a commercial Zinfandel vineyard. Pacific mite populations were most strongly reduced by the early release of Willamette mites and by midseason abundance of predaceous mites. Our ANOVA results did not detect a significant interaction between the early season release of Willamette mites and predaceous mites. The presence of Willamette mites did not make releases of predators more effective at controlling Pacific mites. Grape yield and berry sugar concentration were unaffected by either Willamette mite or predaceous mite treatments in the year of the mite releases nor in the following season. Path analysis showed that Willamette mite density was never strongly negatively correlated with Pacific mite density in the subsequent time period (2-wk intervals between sampling dates), despite the strong negative effect that the early-season release of Willamette mites had on Pacific mite densities later in the season. This suggests that Willamette mites affected Pacific mites indirectly.",,"ENGLISHLOEB, GM (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,34,33,33,0,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Most plants interact with a diverse suite of herbivores, allowing the opportunity for the existence of positive and negative interactions between highly dissimilar organisms. However, most studies on herbivorous interactions have been performed under the assumption that they occur mainly between similar species. Consequently, ecologists are still far from a full understanding of the ecological factors that determine insect population dynamics. 2. In this study, a 7-year field experiment was conducted that manipulated the presence of ungulates to evaluate their effects on the abundance, attack rate, and survival of four guilds of co-occurring herbivorous insects living on the same host plant: seed predators, stem borers, gall makers and sap suckers. These four guilds differed in habits and behaviour, the first three being sessile and endophytic and the last being free-living. 3. This study shows that the abundance of all four guilds was negatively affected by ungulates. However, the effect on attack rate differed among guilds, as mammals do not affect the seed predator attack rate. Ungulates also differentially affected insect survival, ingesting only seed predators and gall makers. 4. In summary, this study suggests that diverse mechanisms may affect different insect guilds in different ways. Therefore, competition between disparate herbivores appears to be complex and can be provoked by multiple mechanisms.","Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain; Univ Granada, Dept Anim Biol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Gomez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",jmgreyes@ugr.es,"Megias, Adela Gonzalez/P-8974-2016; Gomez, Jose M/K-8061-2017","Megias, Adela Gonzalez/0000-0002-2292-9334; Gomez, Jose M/0000-0002-2487-4664",,,,35,32,33,3,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Using a community-based conservation approach, we investigated temporal niche partitioning of mammalian predators and prey across 12 long-term camera trap surveys in the Pacific slope and Talamanca Cordillera of Costa Rica. Temporal overlap and segregation were investigated between predator-prey and predator-predator pairs using overlap analysis, circular statistics, and relative abundance after accounting for differences in habitat, season, and human impact among sites. We made the assumption that predators select abundant prey and adjust their activity to maximize their temporal overlap, thus we predicted that abundant prey with high overlap would be preferred prey species for that predator. We also predicted that similar-sized pairs of predator species with the greatest potential for competitive interactions would have the highest temporal segregation. Our results supported the existence of temporal niche separation among the eight species of predators-the smaller Leopardus felids (ocelot, margay, oncilla) were primarily nocturnal, the largest felids (jaguar and puma) and coyote were cathemeral, and the smaller jaguarundi and tayra were mostly diurnal. Most prey species (67%) were primarily nocturnal versus diurnal or cathemeral (33%). Hierarchical clustering identified relationships among species with the most similar activity patterns. We discuss the primary prey and competitor species predicted for each of the eight predators. Contrary to our prediction, the activity pattern of similar-sized intraguild competitors overlapped more than dissimilar-sized competitors, suggesting that similar-sized predators are hunting the same prey at the same time. From this we conclude that prey availability is more important than competition in determining circadian activity patterns of Neotropical predators. Our results indicate the presence of a delicate balance of tropical food webs that may be disrupted by overhunting, leading to a depauperate community consisting of ubiquitous generalists and endangered specialists. With Central America a hotspot for hunting-induced empty forests, community-based conservation approaches may offer the best road to reduce illegal hunting and maintain the biodiversity and community structure of tropical forest systems.","[Botts, Ryan T.] Point Loma Nazarene Univ, Dept Math Informat & Comp Sci, 3900 Lomaland Dr, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [Eppert, Amy A.; Rodriguez, Abner; Blankenship, Steven R.; Asselin, Ellen M.; Garley, Wyatt M.; Wagner, Abigail P.; Ullrich, Sierra E.; Allen, Gabrielle R.; Mooring, Michael S.] Point Loma Nazarene Univ, Dept Biol, 3900 Lomaland Dr, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [Wiegman, Timothy J.] Point Loma Nazarene Univ, Dept Phys & Engn, 3900 Lomaland Dr, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [Mooring, Michael S.] Quetzal Educ & Res Ctr, San Gerardo De Dota, Costa Rica","Mooring, MS (corresponding author), Point Loma Nazarene Univ, Dept Biol, 3900 Lomaland Dr, San Diego, CA 92106 USA.; Mooring, MS (corresponding author), Quetzal Educ & Res Ctr, San Gerardo De Dota, Costa Rica.",mmooring@pointloma.edu,,,Quetzal Education and Research Center (QERC) of Southern Nazarene University; San Diego Zoo Global (SDZG); Point Loma Nazarene University (Wesleyan Center Grant: 2010); Point Loma Nazarene University (RASP Grant: 2010); Point Loma Nazarene University (RASP Grant: 2012-2019); Point Loma Nazarene University (Alumni Award: 2010); Point Loma Nazarene University (Alumni Award: 2012-2013); Point Loma Nazarene University (Alumni Award: 2015-2019); Point Loma Nazarene University (Sabbatical Grant 2019); Quetzal Center for Research and Education (QERC Grants: 2012-2018); Zoological Society of San Diego (San Diego Zoo Global Elusive Mammal Grants: 2011-2019),"We thank the 26 undergraduate Biology students of Point Loma Nazarene University who participated in the Costa Rica Large Mammal Survey and helped assemble the camera trap database: Robert Perry (2010), William Taylor (2010), Jared Yee (2010), Caleb Bryce (2010-2011), Austin Fares (2011-2012), Ryan Dahl (2011-2012), Trisha Stull (2011), Jonathan Piazza (2012-2013), Eduardo Alvarez (2012-2013), Paul Malherbe (2013), Michael Guerro (2013), Mitchell Prins (2013), Carol Williams (2014), Dylan Poorboy (2014-2015), Jessica Fowler (2014-2015), Ellen Asselin (2015), Tanner Mathews (2015-2016), Kirra Connolly (2016), Wyatt Garley (2017), Abner Rodriguez (2017-2018), T.J.

Under low predation intensity (0, 1, 2, 5 predators), B. patulus was able to outcompete and coexist with B. calyciflorus at low and high food level, respectively. Further, increased predation intensity decreased competitive ability of B. patulus at each food level, and it was eliminated from the culture assemblage at high predation intensity (20 predators). However, B. calyciflorus could persist under the highest predation intensity in this experiment. Population growth rate of B. calyciflorus was affected by food level, not by predation intensity, while that of B. patulus showed a reverse result. The maximum population density of B. patulus was significantly influenced by both predation intensity and food level, but for that of B. calyciflorus, food level was the only influence factor. The results suggest that the competition outcome between herbivorous rotifer species with different body sizes are not only affected by food level but also influenced by the predation intensity.","[Yin, Xu Wang; Niu, Cui Juan] Beijing Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Niu, CJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",cjniu@bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,35,10,14,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP,2008,610,,,,,,131,138,,10.1007/s10750-008-9428-7,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,322RF,WOS:000257392300012,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, due in part to the secretive behavior and low detectability of many snake species, this generalization is based on a limited number of studies, most of which focus on a single study site. We examined differences in diet composition, trophic niche overlap, site occupancy and detectability of five sympatric aquatic snake species between two different habitat types in the Southeastern US, replicated at the landscape scale: permanent wetlands with fishes (n=13) and isolated, often ephemeral wetlands without fishes (n=10). We collected >3700 prey items from snakes and compared diet composition among snake species to examine niche breadth and overlap, correcting for relative availability of prey captured independently in the same wetlands. We evaluated evidence for competitive exclusion by estimating the probability of co-occupancy for pairs of snake species in each habitat type using occupancy modeling. In wetlands with fishes, niche overlap was low, suggesting resource partitioning. Conversely, in wetlands without fishes, niche overlap was high, with most species feeding on larval or paedomorphic ambystomatid salamanders, but competitive exclusion did not occur. We suggest that high co-occupancy of aquatic snakes in wetlands without fishes despite the apparent lack of resource partitioning is due to a combination of seasonally high abundance of high quality amphibian prey, unique aspects of predator physiology and stochastic abiotic processes that prevent these systems from reaching equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that snake diets can be highly context (e.g. habitat)-specific. Studies should consider other factors in addition to competition for prey when attempting to understand snake population and community dynamics.","[Durso, A.

Here we report for the first time on a large population of the endangered coral species Euphyllia paradivisa from the MCEs of the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba (GOE/A), Red Sea. The mesophotic zone in some parts of the study site harbors a specialized coral community predominantly comprising E. paradivisa (73 % of the total coral cover), distributed from 36 to 72 m depth. Here we sought to elucidate the strict distribution but high abundance of E. paradivisa in the MCEs at the GOE/A. We present 4 yr of observations and experiments that provide insight into the physiological plasticity of E. paradivisa: its low mortality rates at high light intensities, high competitive abilities, successful symbiont adaptation to the shallow-water environment, and tolerance to bleaching conditions or survival during prolonged bleaching. Despite its ability to survive under high irradiance in shallow water, E. paradivisa is not found in the shallow reef of the GOE/A. We suggest several factors that may explain the high abundance and exclusivity of E. paradivisa in the MCE: its heterotrophic capabilities; its high competition abilities; the possibility of it finding a deep-reef refuge there from fish predation; and its concomitant adaptation to this environment.","[Eyal, Gal; Eyal-Shaham, Lee; Ben-Zvi, Or; Loya, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Eyal, Gal; Eyal-Shaham, Lee; Cohen, Itay; Tamir, Raz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel; [Cohen, Itay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Tamir, Raz] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Life Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Sinniger, Frederic] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, R&D Ctr Submarine Resources, 2-15 Natsushimacho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Sinniger, Frederic] Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, Nishihara, Okinawa 90301, Japan","Eyal, G (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.; Eyal, G (corresponding author), Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel.",galeyal@mail.tau.ac.il,"Loya, Yossi/N-3060-2019; Loya, Yossi/J-3039-2012; Loya, Joseph/AAJ-9014-2020; Eyal, Gal/P-7884-2019","Loya, Yossi/0000-0001-6870-9444; Eyal, Gal/0000-0002-3028-8653; Sinniger, Frederic/0000-0002-4175-5931",Israel Taxonomy Initiative (ITI); Sciences Based Management (SBM); Israel Science Foundation (ISF)Israel Science Foundation [341/12]; USAID/MERC GrantUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) [M32-037],"We would like to thank the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences for making their facilities available to us.

Such hosts offer other significant inclusive fitness benefits to parasites, however, such as increased mobility and migration potential. The parasite fauna of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) is dominated by the directly transmitted ectoparasites Gyrodactylus bullatarudis and Gyrodactylus turnbulli. In the wild, close predatory and competitive interactions occur between the guppy and the killifish Rivulus hartii. Previous observations suggest that these fish can share gyrodactylids, so we tested experimentally whether these parasites can use R. hartii as an alternative host. In aquaria, G. bullatarudis was the only species able to transmit from prey to predator. Both parasite species transferred equally well to prey when the predator was experimentally infected. However, in semi-natural conditions, G. bullatarudis transmitted more successfully to the prey fish. Importantly, G. bullatarudis also survived significantly longer on R. hartii out of water. As R. hartii can migrate overland between isolated guppy populations, G. bullatarudis may have an enhanced ability to disperse and colonize new host populations, consistent with its wider distribution in the wild.

Field surveys and manipulative experiments demonstrated that intraspecific density and sediment organic matter (SOM) content of sediments are among the factors that regulate the proportion of sand dollars that forage as deposit versus suspension feeders. High local density was associated with a lower proportion of deposit feeding animals in both field surveys and under controlled experimental conditions. Conversely, the proportion of deposit feeders was elevated in treatments in which SOM levels were subsidized, regardless of local density. These data fit Levinton's model of resource limitation in relation to deposit-and suspension-feeding communities, and expand the list of biological processes regulated through density dependence. Analyses of carbon stable isotope ratios (delta C-13) of sand dollars and their potential sources of primary production suggest individuals rely primarily on suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) or drift macroalgae. Sediment organic matter was not a substantial source of carbon for most individuals. There was a significant inverse relationship between size and delta C-13 values; smaller individuals depended to a greater extent on macroalgae. There was no consistent relationship between isotopic ratios, feeding mode and density, which may be due to the high mobility of the species, their ability to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions and the dynamic nature of their habitat. Our results suggest that biological interactions influence feeding mode of this species. This is a complementary mechanism to those described previously, in which physical factors such as flow and lift/washout have been shown to regulate sand dollar positioning. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the biological control of herbivorous arthropods can be either enhanced or disrupted by introducing a predator species to an existing host-parasitoid system. We evaluate the impact of introducing a predator, the convergent ladybird beetle, Hippodamia convergens, on the biological control of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, by the parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes, under field conditions. Predation on immature parasitoids by H. convergens was intense: 98-100% of aphid mummies were consumed by the end of the experiment, and H. convergens substantially reduced immature parasitoid populations. Despite the negative impact of H. convergens on aphid parasitoids, aphid population suppression was greatest in treatments containing both H. convergens and parasitoids. The parasitoid alone or in combination with H. convergens suppressed cotton aphids in a density-dependent manner and increased total plant leaf area and biomass, H. convergens did not substantially alter the percentage of aphids mummified by parasitoids and showed a partial feeding preference for unparasitized aphids over aphid mummies. We conclude that under conditions where a predator shows both a partial preference for unparasitized hosts and high levels of predation on unparasitized hosts, we may expect the predator to improve suppression of herbivores even if it produces high levels of intraguild predation. While intraguild predation is an important ecological interaction in the early-season cotton agroecosystem, it does not disrupt cotton aphid biological control.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Colfer, RG (corresponding author), Mission Organ, POB 2357, Salinas, CA 93902 USA.",ramy@nsfoods.com,,,,,,78,133,139,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2001,126,2,,,,,292,304,,10.1007/s004420000510,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393XK,WOS:000166494800018,28547629,,,,2021-09-27,

Tropical Australian fiddler crabs (Uca species) are differentially distributed in mangrove habitats according to levels of canopy cover. Here we conducted experiments to test three hypotheses explaining fiddler crab distributions in a tropical mangrove. Firstly we recorded the time that it took fiddler crabs from different habitats to reorientate themselves upon being placed on their backs. Secondly we transplanted forest inhabiting U.flammula and clearing inhabiting U. elegans into enclosures set up in clearing and forest sites and measured their activities. We then excluded predators from enclosures containing U. elegans in the forest and monitored crab activities over 10 weeks. We found that righting-response times were longer for crabs from low compared to high intertidal zones and longer when in full sun for all crabs living in or near forests compared to those from clearings, suggesting that forest-dwelling crabs experience physiological stress in open canopy habitats. After 10 weeks, transplanted crab activities varied according to species and habitat. In the clearing, crab activities remained high with burrow-enclosure distance varying between species. Neither transplanted crab activities nor burrow-enclosure distance varied with the presence or absence of other species. Our predator exclusion experiments also found no predator effects on the activities of transplanted crabs. Our results suggest that fiddler crab spatial distributions across the mangrove ecosystem are influenced by physiological stressors independent of any sympatric interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A large-scale field experiment was conducted to investigate effects of eliminating the polychaete Arenicola marina on benthic microbes (prokaryotes, heterotrophic and autotrophic protists) and metazoan meiofauna in a marine intertidal flat of the North Sea, Germany. Over a period of 2 years, quantity and composition of micro- and meiobenthos from unmanipulated sites were compared to those from sites deplete of lugworms. These grazer treatments were cross-classified with different sediment characteristics (low- and mid-intertidal areas). Lugworm removal resulted in an initial increase in abundance of prokaryotes and nanoflagellates, which became less pronounced in the second year. Ciliates were not affected quantitatively, but in the absence of lugworms, diversity and the proportion of carnivorous forms increased. Meiobenthos (nematodes, ostracods and copepods) were affected only moderately. The observed changes are probably due to a combination of release from grazing/predation pressure, changes in the species composition of higher trophic levels (namely large polychaetes) and altered environmental conditions (such as depth of the oxygenated layer and sediment grain size). Spatial differences between sites of different tidal exposure/grain size appeared to be as large as temporal differences during the 2 years following the manipulation of the system. We conclude that in intertidal sediments, indirect effects due to habitat transformation are as important as direct biological interactions (grazing pressure and competition) for the dynamics of the benthic microbial food web.","[Lei, Yanli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yanli; Wickham, Stephen A.; Berninger, Ulrike-G.] Salzburg Univ, Dept Organism Biol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Stumm, Karen] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany","Lei, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",leiyanli@qdio.ac.cn,,"Lei, Yanli/0000-0003-3092-8072","CASChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-417, 40706047, 40576072]; German Research CommunityGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [2279/3-1]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [40706047, 40576072]","This work received financial support from the Knowledge Innovation Program of CAS (KZCX2-YW-417), the German Research Community (DFG BE 2279/3-1), the National Science Foundation of China (40706047 and 40576072) and the '100 Talents Project' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

We studied experimentally how extrinsic resource pulses affect evolutionary and ecological dynamics between the prey bacterium Serratia marcescens and the predatory protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. Predation increased the frequency of defensive, nonpigmented prey types, which bore competitive costs in terms of reduced maximum growth rate, most in a constant-resource environment. Furthermore, the predator densities of the pulsed-resource environment regularly fluctuated above and below the mean predator densities of the constant environment. These results suggest that selection favored fast-growing competitor prey types over defensive but slower-growing prey types more often in the pulsed-resource environment (abundance of resources and low predation risk). As a result, the selection for prey defense fluctuated more in the pulsed-resource environment, leading to a weaker mean response in prey defense. At the ecological level, the evolution of prey defense weakened the relative strength of top-down regulation on prey community. This was more evident in the constant-resource environment, whereas the slow emergence of defensive prey types gradually decreased the amplitude of predator peaks in the pulsed-resource environment. Our study suggests that rapid evolution plays a smaller role in the ecological dynamics of communities dominated by resource pulses.","[Friman, Ville-Petri; Laakso, Jouni] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Ctr Excellence Evolutionary Res, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Friman, Ville-Petri; Laakso, Jouni] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Friman, VP (corresponding author), Dept Zool, Tinbergen Bldg,S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",vifriman@gmail.com,"Laakso, Jouni/I-7794-2013","Laakso, Jouni/0000-0001-8245-9912; Friman, Ville-Petri/0000-0002-1592-157X","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [1106993, 1130724]; Centre of Excellence in Evolution Research of Jyvaskyla University","We thank A.

Since a large part of E occidentalis seems to enter the soil passage, a joint release of the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Antblyseius cuctaneris (Oudemans) that feeds on thrips first-instar larvae and the soil-dwelling predatory mite Hypoaspis aculeifer (Canestrini) that preys on thrips pupae in the ground might offer a promising approach for a holistic control strategy. Therefore, two sets of experiments were conducted in cooperation with a commercial vegetable grower where the plants in plots were infested with a defined number of larval and adult F occidentalis. Two species of natural enemies were released either synchronously or solely, and their efficacy was compared to control plots devoid of antagonists. In both experiments, the predatory mites were released twice with a density of 46 A. cucurneris/m(2), and 207 H. aculeifer/m(2) (low-density) in the first experiment and 528 H. aculeifer/m(2) (high-density) in the second one. Population growth of all arthropod species on the plants and in the soil was quantified at regular intervals and included all soil-dwelling mites and alternative preys present in the substrate. The results showed that H. aculeifer alone had a significant impact on thrips population development only when released at high-densities, but competence was lower compared to the other antagonist treatments. The impact of A. cucumeris alone and A. cucumeris & H. aculeifer combined was similar. Thus, the pooled exploitation of natural enemies did not boost thrips control compared to the single species application of A. cucumeris (non-additive effect), which could be explained by resource competition between both predatory mite species. Species number and population size in the soil of the experimental plots both showed a high variability, a possible consequence of their interaction with released soil-dwelling predatory H. aculeifer mites. The impact of resource competition and presence of alternative preys on thrips biological control is exhaustively discussed. From our study, we can extract the subsequent conclusions: (1) the combined use of H. aculeifer and A. cucumeris cannot increase thrips control on cucumber compared to the release of A. cucumeris alone, but the overall reliability of thrips biological control might be enhanced, (2) the availability of alternative preys seemed to affect the thrips predation rate of H. aculeifer, and (3) the impact of naturally occurring soil predatory mites on the control of WFT seemed to be partial.","Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Plant Dis & Plant Protect, D-30419 Hannover, Germany","Wiethoff, J (corresponding author), Fed Biol Res Ctr Agr & Forestry BBA, Messeweg 11-12, D-38104 Braunschweig, Germany.",wiethoff@ipp.uni-hannover.de,"Meyhoefer, Rainer/C-4962-2014","Meyhoefer, Rainer/0000-0001-5624-001X",,,,40,35,41,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

In a nearly fishless lake with unusually high densities of Chaoborus flavicans and C. obscuripes, the two coexisting Daphnia species developed morphological defense structures to a different degree. An enclosure-exclosure setup was applied to investigate the population dynamics of both species in presence and absence of the predators. The field study followed the population growth of freshly hatched juveniles of D. pulex and D. rosea as they naturally emerged from ephippia in the lake's sediment during spring. Both Daphnia species have a large body size and, in enclosures with Chaoborus only, developed neckteeth and elongated tail spines as inducible defenses. Nevertheless, Chaoborus accounted for high mortality rates in ephippial neonates and strongly reduced the chance of individuals to reach maturity, especially in D. rosea, the dominant species in enclosures without Chaoborus. It is concluded that, in the first generation, when otherwise large and morphologically defended Daphnia are synchronized by ephippial origin to a population of only juveniles, atrophic cascade with Chaoborus may become highly effective.","Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrobiol, D-01217 Dresden, Germany","Sell, AF (corresponding author), Fed Res Ctr Fisheries, Inst Sea Fisheries, Palmaille 9, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.",anne.sell@ish.bfa-fisch.de,,,,,,46,8,8,0,11,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

In this study, we examined how these factors interact under field conditions to determine belowground diversity using microarthropods (mites and Collembola) as our test community. To do this, we established a field manipulation experiment consisting of crossed, continuous gradients of nitrogenous (N) fertilizer addition (up to 240 kg N ha(-1)) and disturbance (imitated trampling by cattle) to produce a gradient of soil nutrient availability and disturbance. Due to the relatively short-term nature of our study (i.e. 2 years), we only detected minimal changes in plant diversity due to the experimental manipulations; in the longer term we would expect to detect changes in plant diversity that could potentially impact on soil fauna. However, disturbance reduced, and additions of N increased, aboveground biomass, reflecting the potential effects of these manipulations on resource availability for soil fauna. We found that disturbance strongly reduced the abundance, diversity, and species richness of oribatid mites and Collembola, but had little effect on predatory mites (Mesostigmata). In contrast, N addition, and therefore resource availability, had little effect on microarthropod community structure, but did increase mesostigmatan mite richness and collembolan abundance at high levels of disturbance. Oribatid community structure was mostly influenced by disturbance, whereas collembolan and mesostigmatan diversity were responsive to N addition, suggesting bottom-up control. That maximal species richness of microarthropod groups overall occurred in undisturbed plots, suggests that the microarthropod community was negatively affected by disturbance. We found no change in microarthropod species richness with high N additions, where plant productivity was greatest, indicating that soil biotic communities are unlikely to be strongly regulated by competition. We conclude that the diversity of soil animals is best explained as a combination of their many varied life history tactics, phenology and the heterogeneity of soils that enable so many species to co-exist.

I also present four conceptual models of moose population dynamics and outline their specific predictions. Based on 27 studies where moose were the dominant prey species, the functional and numerical responses of wolves to changing moose density were derived using an hyperbolic, Michaelis-Menten function. Per capita killing rate was strongly related (P = .01) to moose density, as was the density of wolves (P < .01). Killing rate plateaued at 3.36 moose.wolf(-1) (100 days)(-1) when predators were fully satiated. The asymptotic value for wolf density was 58.7 animals/1000 km(2). Wolf predation rate, as derived from the total predator response, proved to be density dependent from 0 to 0.65 moose/km(2), and inversely density dependent at higher moose densities. Predator: prey ratios reflected wolf predation rate poorly because they did not integrate the functional response. An empirical model based on these results suggests that moose would stabilize at 2.0 moose/km(2) in the absence of predators, and at approximate to 1.3 moose/km(2) in the presence of a single predator, the wolf. Density-dependent food competition creates these two high-density equilibrium conditions. If moose productivity is diminished through either deteriorating habitat quality or bear-induced early calf mortality, then a low-density equilibrium (0.2-0.4 moose/km(2)) is predicted. The model also suggests that when a low equilibrium develops, a ''predator pit'' is absent or extremely shallow, thus arguing against the appropriateness of a predation-food two-state model. Further research on the density relationship of bear predation, on the effect of alternate prey on wolf total response, and on the regulatory impact of food competition at high moose densities, is required for a full understanding of moose demography.",,"MESSIER, F (corresponding author), UNIV SASKATCHEWAN, DEPT BIOL, SASKATOON S7N 0W0, SK, CANADA.",,,,,,,83,322,337,4,192,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1994,75,2,,,,,478,488,,10.2307/1939551,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MZ454,WOS:A1994MZ45400019,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, in communities with many different masting species, lack of synchrony in seed production among species may decrease seed survival by maintaining seed predator populations through the inter-mast cycle. Similarly. masting by different plant species may have different effects oil the seed predator community. We conducted a three-year study in a northeastern USA temperate deciduous forest to determine if production of large seed crops by several tree species was synchronous, and if they had similar effects on all small mammal species. We found that red oak mast crops resulted in increased densities of Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus. but had no effect on Clethrionomys gapperi abundance. Conversely, C. gapperi populations, but not Peromyscus populations, appeared to increase in response to a large red maple seed crop. Differences in small mammal abundance resulted in changes in species-specific seed survival: in the year of abundant C. gapperi, experimentally placed red oak acorns had significantly higher survival than in the year of high Peromyscus abundance. Red oak acorn removal was positively correlated with Peromyscus abundance, while red maple seed removal was significantly higher with increased C. gapperi abundance. Thus, species-specific seed production had differential effects on subsequent small mammal abundance, which in turn affected seed survival. We suggest that at the level of the community, even short-term lack of synchrony in production of large seed crops can cause variation in postdispersal seed survival, through differential effects on the community of small mammal seed predators.","Savannah River Ecol Lab, Aiken, SC 29802 USA; Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Schnurr, JL (corresponding author), Savannah River Ecol Lab, Drawer E, Aiken, SC 29802 USA.",,"Canham, Charles D/F-6161-2011","Canham, Charles D/0000-0001-8361-9148; Ostfeld, Richard/0000-0002-3707-9301",,,,44,134,139,2,58,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2002,96,3,,,,,402,410,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.960302.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543QG,WOS:000175112200002,,,,,2021-09-27,

Such changes in traits signify that human actions can lead to cases of increased phenotypic diversity and consequently can strongly impact population-, community- and ecosystem-level dynamics. Here, we examine whether the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation have led to changes in the life histories of three native species of mosquitofish (Gambusia spp.) inhabiting tidal creeks on six different Bahamian islands. We address two important questions: (i) How predictable and parallel are life-history changes in response to HIREC across islands and species, and (ii) what is the relative importance of shared (i.e. parallel) responses to fragmentation, differences between species or islands and species- or island-specific responses to fragmentation? Phenotypic differences between fragmentation regimes were as great or greater than differences between species or islands. While some adult life histories (lean weight and fat content) showed strong, shared responses to fragmentation, offspring-related life histories (embryo fat and fecundity) exhibited idiosyncratic, island-specific responses. While shared responses to fragmentation appeared largely driven by a reduction in piscivorous fish density, increased conspecific density and changes in salinity, we found some evidence that among-population variation in male reproductive investment and embryo fat content may have arisen via variation in conspecific density. Our results suggest that phenotypic responses to HIREC can be complex, with the predictability of response varying across traits. We therefore emphasize the need for more theoretical and empirical work to better understand the predictability of phenotypic responses to human-induced disturbances.","[Riesch, Ruediger] Univ London, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, Sch Biol Sci, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Easter, Tara; Langerhans, Randall Brian] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, WM Keck Ctr Behav Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Easter, Tara] Ctr Biol Divers, Portland, OR 97211 USA; [Layman, Craig A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Riesch, R (corresponding author), Univ London, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, Sch Biol Sci, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",rudiger.riesch@rhul.ac.uk,"Riesch, Rudiger/A-5787-2008","Riesch, Rudiger/0000-0002-6769-8808; Easter, Tara/0000-0002-4694-9700; Riesch, Rudiger/0000-0002-0223-1254",National Science Foundation of the United StatesNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0842364]; North Carolina State University,"We thank The Bahamas government for permission to conduct the work; Sean Giery, Elizabeth Hassell, Corwin Hess, Kathleen Quigley, Kaye Rennirt and Jennifer Warrillow for field assistance and support during data acquisition.

We review evidence for the impact of apple snails on natural and managed wetlands focusing on those studies that have elucidated impact mechanisms. Significant changes in wetland ecosystems have been noted in regions where the snails are established: Two species in particular (Pomacea canaliculata and Pomacea maculata) have become major pests of aquatic crops, including rice, and caused enormous increases in molluscicide use. Invasive apple snails have also altered macrophyte community structure in natural and managed wetlands through selective herbivory and certain apple snail species can potentially shift the balance of freshwater ecosystems from clear water (macrophyte dominated) to turbid (plankton dominated) states by depleting densities of native aquatic plants. Furthermore, the introductions of some apple snail species have altered benthic community structure either directly, through predation, or indirectly, through exploitation competition or as a result of management actions. To date much of the evidence for-these impacts has been based on correlations, with few manipulative field or mesocosm experiments. Greater attention to impact monitoring is required, and, for Asia in particular, a landscape approach to impact management that includes both natural and managed-rice wetlands is recommended.

In addition, plant and consumer diversity should be positively related because more diverse plant communities offer a greater variety of resources for the consumers. Thus, the Functional group composition and richness of a plant community may affect the composition and diversity of the herbivores and even higher trophic levels associated with that community. We tested this hypothesis by sampling arthropods with a Vacuum sampler (34531 individuals of 494 species) from an experiment in which we manipulated plant Functional group richness and composition. Plant manipulations included all combinations of three functional groups (forbs, C-3 graminoids, and C-4 graminoids) removed zero, one, or two at a time from grassland plots at Cedar Creek Natural History Area.

Although total arthropod species richness was unrelated to plant Functional group richness or composition, the species richness of some arthropod orders was affected by plant Functional group composition. Two plant characteristics explained most of the effects of plant functional groups on arthropod species richness. Nutritional quality, a characteristic related to ecosystem Functioning, and taxonomic diversity, a characteristic not used to designate plant Functional groups, seemed to affect arthropod species richness both directly and indirectly.

Conflict is inextricably linked to the ecological processes shaping relationships between pastoralists and native herbivores and carnivores. To elucidate relationships underpinning human-wildlife conflict, we synthesized 15 years of ecological and ethnographic data from Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia's Gobi steppe. The density of argali (Ovis ammon), the world's largest wild sheep, at Ikh Nart was among the highest in Mongolia, yet livestock were >90% of ungulate biomass and dogs >90% of large-carnivore biomass. For argali, pastoral activities decreased food availability, increased mortality from dog predation, and potentially increased disease risk. Isotope analyses indicated that livestock accounted for >50% of the diet of the majority of gray wolves (Canis lupus) and up to 90% of diet in 25% of sampled wolves (n = 8). Livestock composed at least 96% of ungulate prey in the single wolf pack for which we collected species-specific prey data. Interviews with pastoralists indicated that wolves annually killed 1-4% of Ikh Nart's livestock, and pastoralists killed wolves in retribution. Pastoralists reduced wolf survival by killing them, but their livestock were an abundant food source for wolves. Consequently, wolf density appeared to be largely decoupled from argali density, and pastoralists had indirect effects on argali that could be negative if pastoralists increased wolf density (apparent competition) or positive if pastoralists decreased wolf predation (apparent facilitation). Ikh Nart's argali population was stable despite these threats, but livestock are increasingly dominant numerically and functionally relative to argali. To support both native wildlife and pastoral livelihoods, we suggest training dogs to not kill argali, community insurance against livestock losses to wolves, reintroducing key native prey species to hotspots of human-wolf conflict, and developing incentives for pastoralists to reduce livestock density.","[Ekernas, L.

Mean abundance of flowers and fruits per plant and mean number of aborted, predated, and surviving seeds per fruit were estimated, Monthly average number of developed seeds per fruit multiplied by the monthly mean number of fruits per plant gave the monthly average number of seeds produced by a plant of each taxon. Five types of phenological behaviour were differentiated by cluster analyses according to the season during which each species produced most of its mature seeds. This behaviour was related to the taxonomic section to which the taxa belong, to plant architecture, to geographical range, to seed predation and to local climatic seasonality. Herbs were more affected by variation in rainfall than shrubs and trees. Two species did not show any clear seasonal behaviour. Widespread taxa produced most of their mature seeds in the rainy season or immediately after it, and all but one of the narrowly distributed species produced most of their mature seeds in the dry season or in the transition from dry to rainy season. Seed predation is probably not an important selective force affecting reproductive phenology of larger taxa, while the smaller taxa seemed too constrained by abiotic factors for biotic factors to influence their phenology significantly.","Univ Fed Minas Gerais, ICB, DBG, BR-30161970 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Madeira, JA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, CCS, IB, Dept Ecol,Lab Ecol Insetos, Campus Fundao,CP 68-020, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,"Fernandes, Geraldo/AAN-5602-2021","Fernandes, Geraldo/0000-0003-1559-6049",,,,42,108,128,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

However, the asymmetrical negative effect of Ae. albopictus on Ae. aegypti was eliminated in the presence of malathion. In addition, the presence of malathion resulted in shorter development time compared with the controls.

However, when plant density is high, competition for microsites suitable for establishment and growth is expected to have a relatively greater effect. This dichotomous perspective does not account for situations in which the risk of seed predation differs inside versus outside recruitment microsites. We report the results of a field experiment and sampling studies that demonstrate such an interaction between microsite quality and the risk of propagule predation in mangrove forests on the Caribbean coast of Panama, where it appears to play a key role in shaping the demography and dynamics of the mangrove, Rhizophora mangle. Rhizophora's water-borne propagules establish wherever they strand, but long-term sampling revealed that only those that do so in or near lightning-created canopy gaps survive and grow to maturity. These microsites afford better growth conditions than the surrounding understory and, as importantly, provide a refuge from predation by the scolytid beetle, Coccotrypes rhizophorae. This refuge effect was confirmed with a field experiment in which Rhizophora seedlings were planted at different positions relative to gap edges, from 5 m inside to 20 m outside the gap. Mortality due to beetle attack increased linearly from an average of 10% inside a gap to 72% at 20 m into the forest. The interaction between canopy disturbance and propagule predation may be having a large impact on the composition of our study forests. Being shade-tolerant, Rhizophora seedlings that escape or survive beetle attack can persist in the understory for years. However, the high rate of beetle-induced mortality effectively eliminates the contribution of advance regeneration by Rhizophora saplings to gap succession. This may explain why the shade-intolerant mangrove, Laguncularia racemosa, is able to co-dominate the canopy in low intertidal forests at our study sites.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Sousa, WP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 3060 VLSB, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",wpsousa@socrates.berkeley.edu,,,,,,67,42,45,2,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2003,137,3,,,,,436,445,,10.1007/s00442-003-1350-0,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,735CA,WOS:000186093800016,12920640,,,,2021-09-27,

Habitat structural complexity has also been shown to influence the density and diversity of marine organisms and could contribute to vertical zonation where the level of complexity varies significantly with tidal height. To test the hypothesis that vertical zonation of brachyuran crabs was related to structural complexity, shelter was experimentally manipulated at 2 heights at a rocky intertidal site in Tanabe Bay, Japan. The densities of four brachyuran species, varying in size and life history type, were compared before and after the manipulation. Removal of shelter negatively affected all species, regardless of tidal height. Doubling shelter positively affected Hemigrapsus sanguineus de Haan and Leptodius exaratus Milne Edwards, especially at the tidal heights where they were initially more abundant. Two smaller more opportunistic species, Gaetice depressus de Haan and Acmaeopleura parvula Stimpson, did not react positively to shelter increases and each showed unique responses to the experimental manipulations. Differences in the amount of structural complexity in the upper and lower intertidal may be responsible for conflicting literature reports of the vertical distribution of Hemigrapsus sanguineus. Information gathered about the habitat requirements of this invasive grapsid crab will be useful for monitoring its impact and spread along the eastern coast of the United States.

Sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and to a lesser extent Arbacia lixula) were removed by hand from 6 pools, chosen at random out of 12, throughout the study. The other 6 pools remained subject to natural densities of herbivores and served as controls. Two permanent plots were marked with epoxy putty in each pool. One plot was located just in front of the crevices sheltering the sea urchins while the other was marked 50 to 60 cm away. The following algal groups were monitored in these plots until March 1994: (1) articulated corallines, (2) coarsely branched algae, (3) Cystoseira spp., (4) filamentous algae, and (5) foliose algae. Extensive sampling of macroalgae was carried out in April 1994. Four replicated 100 cm(2) plots were randomly located at each distance from shelter in each pool and sampled by a nondestructive method. The results from the permanent plots indicated that the impact of sea urchins was greater close to the crevices for all the algal groups but the coarsely branched algae. In contrast, the large variability between pools often masked the importance of interactive effects between physical and biological factors at the end of the experiment. Nevertheless, reliance on shelter apparently constrained the effect of sea urchins on the filamentous algae and on Cystoseira spp., and thus on a conspicuous portion of the algal assemblage of the pools.

The site was chosen because it: has a simple community structure and thus there is potentially less ecological complexity to cloud any patterns observed. We found an unexpectedly high overlap in habitat use between the two closely related lizards that might be explained either by a high competition for space or through predator-mediated co-existence i.e. the prevention of the competitive exclusion of one lizard over the other. We also found a strong positive correlation between predator density and tail damage in lizards and we suggest that tail damage is a direct consequence of snake activity (because no other natural predators occur in the area).","FIZV Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy; FIZV Mammal, I-00152 Rome, Italy; Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-61032 Fano, PU, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), FIZV Ecol, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,47,11,13,0,6,NATURALIS BIODIVERSITY CENTER,LEIDEN,"DARWINWEG 2, LEIDEN, 2333 CR, NETHERLANDS",1383-4517,1875-9866,,CONTRIB ZOOL,Contrib.

Given their similarities, competition between these species may be high, especially for food resources. We assessed potential competition between fathead minnows and brook sticklebacks, as well as their influence on zooplankton communities, by measuring their selectivity for zooplankton prey in controlled laboratory experiments. Minnows and sticklebacks of varying size were placed in aquaria with mixed zooplankton assemblages to assess selectivity for copepod and Daphnia prey. Sticklebacks of all sizes showed strong selectivity for Daphnia, while minnows were less selective, and prey selectivity varied with fish size. Selectivity of prey was not related to relative prey abundance for either minnows or sticklebacks. Although minnows were less selective, their mass-specific consumption rates were significantly lower than consumption rates for sticklebacks. Our results indicated that effects of predation on zooplankton may differ between these two fish species, with minnows potentially affecting greater numbers of taxa. Additionally, generalist feeding on zooplankton prey by fathead minnows may be advantageous in habitats with low Daphnia densities, as is common in prairie wetlands with dense fish populations.","N Dakota State Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Wetland Wildlife Populat & Res Grp, Bemidji, MN 56601 USA","Butler, MG (corresponding author), N Dakota State Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",,,,,,,17,3,4,0,16,SOC WETLAND SCIENTISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E TENTH ST, P O BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0277-5212,,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,JUN,2003,23,2,,,,,416,422,,10.1672/16-20,,,7,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,698UB,WOS:000184016200016,,,,,2021-09-27,

Pollution may have indirect effects on organisms due to changes in the abundance of competitors, predators or species that act as habitat. In marine hard substrate assemblages, pollution from the heavy metal copper causes predictable changes in the composition of sessile organisms in field conditions. The effects on mobile invertebrates associated with these habitats, however, are unknown. We tested the effects of copper on the entire assemblage of mobile and sessile invertebrates that colonise fouling plates, and demonstrated strong changes in the composition of mobile taxa due to the presence of copper. Manipulative field experiments partitioned the direct effects of water-borne copper from possible indirect effects mediated through changes to their habitat. Sessile assemblages were selectively gardened in the absence of copper to create habitats typical of polluted and unpolluted habitats, and then exposed to copper. The assemblages of mobile invertebrates varied between manipulated habitats, indicating that copper can indirectly affect mobile fauna via habitat change. The mechanisms of these effects were then examined with artificial habitats that mimicked the physical structure of polluted and unpolluted habitats. The composition of the mobile fauna was again dependent on habitat. In both experiments, there were interactions between the effect of habitat and the presence of copper, demonstrating the need for multi-species, field experiments to fully identify the effects of pollutants in natural conditions.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Poore, AGB (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",a.poore@unsw.edu.au,"Johnston, Emma L/B-7210-2009; Poore, Alistair/C-2934-2008","Johnston, Emma L/0000-0002-2117-366X; Poore, Alistair/0000-0002-3560-3659",,,,49,31,32,1,34,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We conducted an experimental manipulation of leaf packs in stream channels, a patchy and ephemeral resource, which is consumed by a number of detritivorous invertebrates. We reduced the number of available food patches (red alder leaf packs) by half and then measured a variety of community responses, including emigration rate, aggregation on remaining food patches, decomposition rate of food patches, and species-specific differences in these responses. Replacement of removed leaf packs with polyester mimics resulted in no statistical difference in emigration rates or aggregation on remaining resources when compared to those removal channels without replacement. These results indicate that leaf packs are not used primarily for refuge. In the removal channels (including those with leaf pack mimics) emigration rate nearly doubled relative to control channels. Those invertebrates that did not emigrate from removal channels aggregated on remaining leaf packs, which led to more rapid decomposition of leaf packs relative to control channels. The increase in emigration rate only became apparent 2-3 days after the manipulation, presumably because animals colonized the remaining leaf packs and did not emigrate until food patch value per individual had been reduced by higher densities or due to increased discharge. Discharge through the channels increased slightly starting 3 days after the manipulation, resulting in increased emigration rates in all channels. Despite the increase in discharge, the effect of the manipulation remained strong. These results show that stream invertebrates colonizing leaf packs responded in predictable ways to a short-term reduction in food resources which would be adaptive in a system which is heterogeneous in space and time.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Rowe, L (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",lrowe@zoo.utoronto.ca,"Richardson, John/G-1513-2012","Richardson, John/0000-0001-8135-7447",,,,46,60,61,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2001,129,3,,,,,473,480,,10.1007/s004420100748,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,496VQ,WOS:000172418100018,28547203,,,,2021-09-27,

Shredders are considered rare in tropical systems, and little information is available about the role of density effects and predation risk (associated with the perception of predators by prey) in relationship to the resources used by these organisms. The aim of this study was to examine experimentally the effects of increased predation risk and of the density of Phylloicus sp. (i.e. of two types of biological relationships) on the processing of the leaf litter of Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) Mez. Phylloicus sp. can use leaf litter for case building and as a food resource. The density effect was measured using four treatments that differed only in the number of individuals (one, two, three or four). A second experiment with five treatments was performed to test the risk of non-lethal predation on detritus consumption (shelter and food) by Phylloicus sp. (T1: Caddisfly; T2: Mayfly; T3: Astyanax sp./fish; T4: Damselflies; T5: Stonefly). A single Phylloicus and one other organism (a potential predator blocked with 0.5mm fine mesh) were placed in each tank (0.002m(3) volume). We observed a negative effect of density on per capita litter consumption (experiment 1). The low density of Phylloicus may be a natural factor that decreases intraspecific competition. In the presence of fish, Phylloicus showed the lowest amount of litter processing observed in the experiment, indicating top-down control (experiment 2). In treatments that involved the presence of invertebrates (non-predatory and predatory), Phylloicus showed the highest amount and an intermediate amount of leaf litter processing, respectively (experiment 2). This observation also suggests that the predation effect is more probable for specific predator-prey pairs. Population density and predation risk in Phylloicus may be important factors controlling leaf litter processing.","[Rezende, Renan de Souza; Marques Leite, Gustavo Figueiredo; Soares De-Lima, Anderson Kennedy; Braga Da Silva Filho, Luis Antonio; Costa Chaves, Camila Vilarinho; Holler Prette, Ana Cecilia; Freitas, June Spriger; Goncalves Junior, Jose Francisco] Univ Brasilia UnB, Dept Ecol, AquaRiparia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil","De-Lima, AKS (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Inst Biol, Dept Ecol, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",renanrezende30@gmail.com,"De-Lima, Anderson Kennedy Soares/W-9453-2019; Goncalves, Jose Francisco/G-3910-2012; De-Lima, Anderson/V-5778-2018; de Souza Rezende, Renan/I-5165-2014","De-Lima, Anderson Kennedy Soares/0000-0002-5790-8584; Goncalves, Jose Francisco/0000-0001-8191-2113; De-Lima, Anderson/0000-0002-5790-8584; de Souza Rezende, Renan/0000-0002-4129-0863",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES - Programa Nacional de Cooperacao Academica - Acao Novas Fronteiras Procad-NF)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [173/2010]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES - Programa Nacional de Apoio e Desenvolvimento da Botanica PNADB/Edital)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [17/2009]; Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [151375/2014-3]; Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq - Programa de Pesquisa Ecologica de Longa Duracao PELD) [558233/2009-0]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [APQ-00274-12]; University of Brasilia (UnB - Decanato de Pesquisa e Pos-graduacao DPP) [121366/2011],"We are grateful to Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES - Programa Nacional de Cooperacao Academica - Acao Novas Fronteiras Procad-NF/ No. 173/2010; Programa Nacional de Apoio e Desenvolvimento da Botanica PNADB/Edital 17/2009), Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq - Post-Doctoral Scholarship number 151375/2014-3 and Programa de Pesquisa Ecologica de Longa Duracao PELD/No. 558233/2009-0), Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG/No. APQ-00274-12) and University of Brasilia (UnB - Decanato de Pesquisa e Pos-graduacao DPP/No. 121366/2011) for financial support.",,48,16,18,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,SEP,2015,40,6,,,,,693,700,,10.1111/aec.12236,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CQ2RC,WOS:000360447800008,,,,,2021-09-27,

We released these presettlement larvae at night into cages surrounding patch reefs and measured larval survivorship after two nights. This caging experiment involved cages enclosing the natural resident fish fauna, including predators, and others cleared of fish before releasing the larvae. The analyses of variance showed that (1) there was no difference in survivorship between the seven trials, (2) there was a significant difference between cleared and uncleared cages, and (3); there were significant differences between larval species tested. For the seven species that had a significant difference in survivorship between cleared and uncleared cages, average mortality of the larvae was 14% (range 0-26%) in cleared cages and 67% (range 29-76%) in cages with predators. The difference in mortality between species was related to the size of the larvae, as larger species exhibited reduced mortality compared to smaller species. Mortality was related to the abundance of resident fish that could act as predators or competitors. Predation can have a significant impact on the survival of metamorphosing fish larvae on coral reefs.","Univ Perpignan, Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, ESA 8046, CNRS, F-66860 Perpignan, France; Ctr Rech Insulaires & Observ Environm, Papetoai, Moorea, France","Planes, S (corresponding author), Univ Perpignan, Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, ESA 8046, CNRS, F-66860 Perpignan, France.",planes@univ-perp.fr,,,,,,33,34,34,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,NOV,2001,20,3,,,,,211,218,,,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,499FR,WOS:000172560800004,,,,,2021-09-27,

The events resulted in regime shifts cascading through all trophic levels, disturbing ecosystem functioning and damaging the water environment. Causal pathways by which the external (hydroclimate, overfishing) and internal (food web interactions) drivers provoke regime shifts are investigated. Statistical data analyses supported by an interpretative framework based on hierarchical ecosystem theory revealed mechanisms of hierarchical incorporation of environmental factors into the ecosystem. Evidence links Atlantic teleconnections to Black Sea hydroclimate, which together with fishing shapes variability in fish stocks. The hydroclimatic signal is conveyed through the food web via changes in productivity at all levels, to planktivorous fish. Fluctuating fish abundance is believed to induce a lagged change in competitor jelly plankton that cascades down to phytoplankton and influences water quality. Deprived of the stabilising role of apex predators, the Black Sea's hierarchical ecosystem organisation is susceptible to both environmental and anthropogenic stresses, and increased fishing makes fish stock collapses highly probable. When declining stocks are confronted with burgeoning fishing effort associated with the inability of fishery managers and decision-makers to adapt rapidly to changes in fish abundance, there is overfishing and stock collapse. Management procedures are ineffective at handling complex phenomena such as ecosystem regime shifts because of the shortage of suitable explanatory models. The proposed concepts and models reported here relate the hydroclimate, overfishing and invasive species to shifts in ecosystem functioning and water quality, unravelling issues such as the causality of ecosystem interactions and mechanisms and offering potential for finding ways to reverse regime shifts. We advocate a management approach aiming at restoring ecosystem hierarchy that might mitigate the costly consequences of regime shifts.","[Daskalov, Georgi M.] Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Res IBER BAS, 2 Yurii Gagarin St, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Boicenco, Laura; Lazar, Luminita] Natl Inst Marine Res & Dev Grigore Antipa, Blvd Mamaia 300, Constanta 900581, Romania; [Grishin, Alexandre N.] Inst Biol Southern Seas InBYuM, 2 Nahimov Ave, Sevastopol, Ukraine; [Mihneva, Vesselina] Inst Fish Resources, POB 72,Boul Primorski 4, Varna 9000, Bulgaria; [Shlyakhov, Vladislav A.] Southern Sci Res Inst Marine Fisheries & Oceanog, 2 Sverdlov St, UA-98300 Kerch, Ukraine; [Zengin, Mustafa] CFRI, Vali Adil Yazar Cad,14 Kasustu, TR-61250 Trabzon, Turkey","Daskalov, GM (corresponding author), Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Res IBER BAS, 2 Yurii Gagarin St, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.",georgi.m.daskalov@gmail.com,"Lazar, Luminita/D-2468-2014; Mihneva, Vesselina/AAK-7421-2020; Shlyakhov, Vladislav/AAX-5260-2021","Lazar, Luminita/0000-0003-2428-7299; Mihneva, Vesselina/0000-0003-4581-7738; ","ECEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [226675, 287600, 287844]; COMFISH [FP7-KBBE.2011.1.4-02]","The authors are grateful to AIL Payne for useful comments and editorial assistance and to an anonymous reviewer for helpful discussion and constructive criticism.

Differences in how predators respond to different forms of disturbance might alter their interaction patterns. We sought to understand how human and livestock disturbance impact co-occurrence of sympatric large carnivores such as tiger (Panthera tigris) and leopard (P. pardus) and thereby mediate the intraguild interaction pattern to enable coexistence of the species in a human-dominated landscape. We surveyed 361 locations in Chitwan National Park, Nepal, to examine how prey abundance and disturbance factors such as human and livestock presence might influence habitat use by tigers and leopards independently and when co-occurring. Single-species single-season models and two-species single-season models were developed to examine hypotheses on unconditional detection and occupancy and species interaction respectively. Pervasive human use of the park had negative impacts on tiger occupancy while the abundance of prey had a positive influence. Despite significant prey overlap between tigers and leopards, none of the native prey species predicted leopard habitat occupancy. However, habitats used extensively by livestock were also used by leopards. Further, we found strong evidence of intraguild competition. For instance tiger occupancy was higher in prey-rich areas and leopard occupancy was low in the sites where tigers were present. These findings, and a species interaction factor of < 1 clearly indicate that leopards avoid tigers, but their use of areas of disturbance enables them to persist in fringe habitats. We provide empirical evidence of how intraguild interaction may result in habitat segregation between competing carnivores, while also showing that human and livestock use of the landscape create disturbance patterns that facilitate co-occurrence of the predators. Thus, because large carnivores compete, some disturbance may mediate coexistence in small protected areas. Understanding such interactions can help address important conservation challenges associated with maintaining diverse carnivore communities in small or disturbed landscapes.

Neither the number of clutches nor number of eggs produced differed among treatments. The size of larvae at hatching was found to be reduced as a result of the stress associated with increased interactions with heterospecific and the transfer of cortisol to offspring. This stress-associated mechanism appears to be an important and directional source of life history variability, but the individual nature of the maternal response is likely to result in a conclusion of a diversified bet hedging reproductive strategy when viewed at the local population level. These findings highlight the complex determinants of individual success and the important role of parental well-being in the population dynamics of the next generation.","James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council,"Many thanks to S.

A field caging experiment was conducted in 2007 to examine whether predation by, and/or competition with, small macrofauna affects mortality or growth of recently settled sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis or sea stars Asterias spp. Kelp was added to half of the sea urchin cages to test whether the addition of this food source (including its associated biofilms) altered growth or survival. Sea urchins survived 25% better in cages where the other organisms were removed, indicating that predation or bulldozing likely plays an important role. The growth of sea urchins was greatest in cages without other organisms and lowest in cages with other organisms and with food, possibly indicating competition that affects sea urchin behaviour. Sea stars showed the opposite trend in survival. A greater proportion of sea stars survived in cages where the other organisms were present (31.3 vs. 11.5%), presumably due to them being a food source for the sea stars, indicating that starvation, cannibalism and/or competition for food are likely important for recent settlers of this taxon. The declines in abundance in the cages were greater than those in the natural environment for sea urchins, but similar for sea stars, suggesting that caution is required when extrapolating experimental results to the field. These results indicate that multiple factors, which differ between these species, affect early post-settlement growth and mortality.","[Jennings, Lindsay B.; Hunt, Heather L.] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada","Jennings, LB (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada.",lindsay.jennings@unb.ca,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank everyone who helped us in the field and the laboratory: M.-J.

Given the importance of shell refuge to their post-settlement ontogeny, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began constructing intertidal plots of oyster shell in the Grays Harbor estuary, Washington, to enhance recruitment and mitigate losses of subtidal C. magister entrained and killed during extensive dredging efforts. When shell habitat was newly constructed, settlement and survival of C. magister were high, and expectations for the mitigation project were met. During the first several years (1992-1997), plots greater than 1 yr postconstruction were colonized by yellow shore crabs, Hemigrapsus oregonensis (often greater than or equal to 75 crabs m(-2)), and abundance of EBP C. magister was reduced to nearly zero. While some predation of settling megalopae by H. oregonensis does occur, the relationship between these species is characterized by density-dependent competitive interactions. Laboratory observations of competition for shell habitat indicate that H. oregonensis are dominant over EBP C. magister and can evict C. magister from refuge spaces. Field experiments show that high densities of the former cause the latter to emigrate from shell, and suggest detection and avoidance of areas with high densities of H. oregonensis by settling C. magister megalopae. More recently (1998-2001), abundance of H. oregonensis has declined dramatically within plots of oyster shell, apparently due to recruitment failure, and patterns of C. magister abundance and production have returned to levels consistent with original expectations of the mitigation project. Both intraspecific and interspecific competition for space are significant factors effecting population regulation of C. magister when they are strongly dependent on refuge from predation. Efficacy of constructed oyster shell plots as a mitigation tool may hinge on the population dynamics of a species previously considered of little consequence to the target species.","Clarkson Univ, Ctr Environm, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Visser, EP (corresponding author), Clarkson Univ, Ctr Environm, Box 5717, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.",emmajoan@northnet.org,,,,,,98,8,8,1,31,ESTUARINE RESEARCH FEDERATION,PORT REPUBLIC,"2018 DAFFODIL, PO BOX 510, PORT REPUBLIC, MD 20676 USA",0160-8347,,,ESTUARIES,Estuaries,AUG,2004,27,4,,,,,699,715,,10.1007/BF02907654,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,849HC,WOS:000223528300011,,,,,2021-09-27,

On the other hand, several studies on predators in various natural and laboratory situations have shown that competitive coexistence can result from predation in a way by resisting any one prey species from becoming sufficiently abundant to outcompete other species such that the predator makes the coexistence possible. It has also been shown that the use of refuges by a fraction of the prey population exerts a stabilizing effect in the interacting population dynamics. Further, the field surveys in the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem reveal that two detritivorous fishes, viz. Liza parsia and Liza tade (prey population) coexist in nature with the presence of the predator fish population, viz. Lates calcarifer by using refuges. In view of such observations in mind, a three-component model consisting of two prey and one predator population is considered in the present investigation with the inclusion of Holling type-II response function incorporating a constant proportion of prey refuge. The essential mathematical features of the present model have been analyzed thoroughly in terms of the local and the global stability and the bifurcations arising in some selected situations as well. The threshold values for some parameters indicating the feasibility and the stability conditions of some equilibria are also determined. The ranges of the significant parameters under which the system admits a Hopf bifurcation are investigated. The explicit formulae for determining the stability, direction and other properties of bifurcating periodic solutions are also derived with the use of both the normal form and the central manifold theory. Numerical illustrations are performed finally in order to validate the applicability of the model under consideration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Field experiments demonstrate that intraspecific competition, effects of other competing benthic invertebrates, and complex interactions between competition and partial predation (siphon cropping by fishes) modify the foraging behavior of Macoma. When protected by caging from siphon nipping by fishes, Macoma demonstrated greater siphon regeneration at lower density, indicating the importance of competition for Limited resources. In the absence of siphon croppers, these same clams also exhibited more deposit feeding at the lower density either because of improved ability to deposit-feed with longer siphons or because deposited foods become more rapidly depleted than suspended foods on local spatial scales. Addition of siphon-nipping fishes caused greater reductions in siphon size of clams at lower density, presumably because the intensity of nipping per clam was greater where clam targets were fewer and because deposit feeding, which was more intense at lower densities, confers a greater risk of cropping from greater siphon extension and activity than characterize suspension feeding. Deposit feeding by Macoma was reduced in the presence of siphon croppers at both high and low density of clams, but the intensity of deposit-feeding activity at low density was substantially higher than predicted by additive effects of clam density and cropping. This suggests operation of a balancing strategy in Macoma whereby it is accepting greater risks of partial predation when rewards of greater food harvest are larger The surprising failure to adopt a risk-averse strategy may be explained by the non-lethal nature of partial predation, which renders siphon loss an energetic penalty replacable through regeneration. The presence of a bed of suspension-feeding Rangia cuneata also altered foraging behavior of Macoma by inducing a switch to more intense deposit feeding, in response either to the documented near-bottom depletion of suspended foods or to likely enhanced biodeposition from feces and pseudofeces. The induction of greater deposit feeding by the presence of this competing suspension feeder led to greater siphon losses during exposure to croppers because Macoma was practicing more risky feeding behavior. This enhanced loss of siphon tissues to croppers in the presence of the suspension-feeding Rangia induced an interaction between the effects of siphon croppers and Rangia, such that Macoma exhibited a larger switch away from deposit feeding in the presence of siphon croppers when Rangia were also present. Clearly, the foraging decisions made by individuals can only be understood in a broad holistic context of population, community, and ecosystem processes.","UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA",,,"Skilleter, Greg Alan/F-9250-2010","Skilleter, Greg Alan/0000-0002-4719-0409",,,,86,60,61,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1994,100,3,,,,,268,278,,10.1007/BF00316954,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PZ755,WOS:A1994PZ75500009,28307010,,,,2021-09-27,

Conflicts often impede effective implementation of needed conservation measures and also have implications for social inequality, resource use and economic development. Bivalve molluscan shellfish aquaculture is commonly considered one of the least impactful forms of protein production worldwide but, in some locations, may interfere with essential activities of threatened species such as the stopover ecology of migrating shorebirds. Here we assess the impact of oyster aquaculture as practiced in Delaware Bay (New Jersey, USA) on the presence and foraging behavior of migratory shorebird species of conservation concern. We conducted counts and behavioral observations of shorebirds across a 4.8-km stretch of the Delaware Bay and tested the effect of regulated aquaculture structures and activities on shorebird presence relative to various environmental factors. We also evaluated differences in mean peck rates for each species within and away from aquaculture areas, and we examined multiple factors influencing foraging rates for each species. For all species, we found that oyster tending reduced the probability of shorebird presence by 1-7%, whereas the untended aquaculture structures had no detectable impact. Foraging rates were mostly influenced by environmental conditions, particularly the presence of competitors (gulls or other shorebirds), and the foraging substrate. None of the focal species substantially altered their time budget or foraging rates in the presence of tended or untended oyster aquaculture. This evidence suggests that intertidal oyster aquaculture and migrating shorebirds can co-utilize the resource rich intertidal areas on which they occur.","[Maslo, Brooke; Yuhas, Tanner; Schumm, Brian; Burger, Joanna; Lockwood, Julie L.] Rutgers State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Burkhalter, J.

The relative importance of host-plants and predators in the population dynamics of herbivorous insects, and the frequency and intensity of inter-specific competition among herbivores, have both been intensively studied and debated. The joint effects of bottom-up, top-down, and within-trophic level interactions, however, have rarely been integrated in a single system. 2. I studied the dynamics of the cactus bug (Narnia pallidicornis), a specialist feeder on tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata), in response to variable host-plant quality, spider predation, and interactions with cactus-feeding beetles (Moneilema appressum). Previous work suggests that cactus reproductive effort (the proportion of meristems allocated to reproduction) is an important component of host-plant quality for Narnia. I conducted a 2-year field experiment to test the hypotheses that Narnia abundance is positively related to host-plant reproductive effort, and that interactions with predators and putative competitors alter the shape of this relationship. 3. I found strong support for the first prediction (positive Narnia-plant quality relationship) in both years, but neither predator removal nor beetle exclusion had detectable effects on this relationship in either year. I conclude that the dynamics of this insect herbivore are driven predominantly from the bottom-up, and that available data from this work and from previous studies are too variable to permit broad generalisations for the combined effects of host-plants, predation, and competition on herbivore dynamics.","[Miller, Tom E.

On Guam, the sponge Dysidea sp. overgrows the sponge Cacospongia sp. and causes necrosis. Using field assays, we tested the effects of crude organic extracts and a major sesquiterpene isolated from Dysidea, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane, on Cacospongia and on the production of the major terpenoid metabolites scalaradial and desacetylscalaradial by Cacospongia. We also tested whether the amounts of organic compounds produced by Dysidea differed in the presence or absence of Cacospongia. To determine whether 7-deacetoxyolepupuane had another ecological function, we tested the compound as a predator deterrent. In field experiments, crude extracts of Dysidea and pure 7-deacetoxyolepupuane both caused necrosis in Cacospongia when they were incorporated into agar strips and placed in contact with Cacospongia for 7 d. Organic extract, scalaradial, and desacetylscalaradial concentrations in Cacospongia were not affected by the overgrowth of Dysidea. However, a greater quantity of organic extract (but not scalaradial or desacetylscalaradial) was found in portions of Cacospongia covered by agar strips containing Dysidea organic extracts than in portions of Cacospongia covered by control agar strips. The production of 7-deacetoxyolepupuane by Dysidea occurring on rock substrates and on Cacospongia did not differ; thus, the production of this compound is not induced by the presence of competitors. In addition to its role in competition, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane deterred predation by a spongivorous fish, illustrating the multiple ecological roles that a single secondary metabolite may play.","Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA","Paul, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA.",,"Becerro, Mikel/A-5325-2008","Thacker, Robert/0000-0002-9654-0073",,,,78,81,92,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1998,79,5,,,,,1740,1750,,,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101CX,WOS:000074853000023,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, in some cases, weaker competitors can persist through intraguild predation, that is, by eating their stronger competitor. Mixotrophs, species that meet their carbon demand by combining photosynthesis and phagotrophic heterotrophy, may function as intraguild predators when they consume the phototrophs with which they compete for light. Thus, theory predicts that mixotrophy may allow for coexistence of two species on a single limiting resource. We tested this prediction by developing a new mathematical model for a unicellular mixotroph and phytoplankter that compete for light, and comparing the model's predictions with a laboratory experimental system. We find that, like other intraguild predators, mixotrophs can persist when an ecosystem is sufficiently productive (i.e., the supply of the limiting resource, light, is relatively high), or when species interactions are strong (i.e., attack rates and conversion efficiencies are high). Both our mathematical and laboratory models show that, depending upon the environment and species traits, a variety of equilibrium outcomes, ranging from competitive exclusion to coexistence, are possible.","[Moeller, Holly, V; Neubert, Michael G.; Johnson, Matthew D.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Moeller, Holly, V] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Moeller, Holly, V] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Moeller, HV (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.; Moeller, HV (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.; Moeller, HV (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",holly.moeller@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,"Neubert, Michael/0000-0001-8820-5008","United States National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology [DBI-1401332]; University of British Columbia Biodiversity Research Centre Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1655686, OCE-1436169]; Simons Foundation/SFARI [561126]; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Investment in Science Program; U.S. Army Research Office [W911NF-19-2-0026]","HVM and MGN designed the model.

Yet, changes in phenology beyond shifts to the first, mean or median date of an ontogenetic event are underexplored in their importance to community dynamics. Using outdoor mesocosms, we experimentally mimicked increasing variability in breeding phenology of a top predatory salamander in pond food webs (Ambystoma annulatum) to assess its impacts on its own demographic traits and survival. We also tested whether variability in predator breeding would cascade to impact survival and diversity of lower trophic levels (intermediate salamander predators, anuran tadpoles, zooplankton and periphyton). We found that only variability in body size at metamorphosis of A. annulatum was impacted by phenological manipulations, with size variability being greater at higher levels of phenological variability. Because size at metamorphosis is often correlated with adult fitness, covarying variability in body size and phenology may lead to altered population dynamics. We also found that the density and size of A. annulatum were better predictors of overall survival and diversity of amphibian prey compared to phenological variability. We speculate that overwintering mortality of A. annulatum due to pond freezing modulated the impacts of phenological variability, such that changes in demographic traits and cascading effects throughout the food web were mollified.","[Anderson, T.

The degree of individual specialization in resource use differs widely among wild populations where individuals range from fully generalized to highly specialized. This interindividual variation has profound implications in many ecological and evolutionary processes. A recent review proposed four main ecological causes of individual specialization: interspecific and intraspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. 2. Using the isotopic signature of subsampled whiskers, we investigated to what degree three of these factors (interspecific and intraspecific competition and ecological opportunity) affect the population niche width and the level of individual foraging specialization in two fur seal species, the Antarctic and subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and Arctocephalus tropicalis), over several years. 3. Population niche width was greater when the two seal species bred in allopatry (low interspecific competition) than in sympatry or when seals bred in high-density stabilized colonies (high intraspecific competition). In agreement with the niche variation hypothesis (NVH), higher population niche width was associated with higher interindividual niche variation. However, in contrast to the NVH, all Antarctic females increased their niche width during the interbreeding period when they had potential access to a wider diversity of foraging grounds and associated prey (high ecological opportunities), suggesting they all dispersed to a similar productive area. 4. The degree of individual specialization varied among populations and within the annual cycle. Highest levels of interindividual variation were found in a context of lower interspecific or higher intraspecific competition. Contrasted results were found concerning the effect of ecological opportunity. Depending on seal species, females exhibited either a greater or lower degree of individual specialization during the interbreeding period, reflecting species-specific biological constraints during that period. 5. These results suggest a significant impact of ecological interactions on the population niche width and degree of individual specialization. Such variation at the individual level may be an important factor in the species plasticity with significant consequences on how it may respond to environmental variability.","[Kernaleguen, Laetitia; Arnould, John P.

Parasitic survival is particularly related to competitive superiority for foster parental care whenever host young are not destroyed in parasitized nests. Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are generalist obligate parasites whose early social environments are unpredictable regarding host species and numbers of nestmates. Young avian brood parasites typically beg more intensively and loudly than foster siblings, but an untested prediction is that young parasites are also more likely to respond by begging to a wider variety of stimulus types. Avian vocalizations were used in a playback experiment to stimulate begging behavior in cowbird hosts. Compared with age-matched cowbird nestlings, hosts begged less frequently to acoustic stimuli, and lower begging responsiveness was irrespective of whether hosts had been reared in parasitized nests.","Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Hauber, ME (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Museum Vertebrate Zool, 3172 VLSB, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hauberm@socrates.berkeley.edu,,,,,,45,31,32,0,9,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7036,1939-2087,,J COMP PSYCHOL,J.

Recent experiments show that some forest insectivorous birds can use herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to locate herbivore-infested trees, but it is unclear how birds combine or prioritize visual and olfactory information when making foraging decisions. Here, we investigated attraction of ground-foraging birds to HIPVs and visible prey in short vegetation on farmland in a series of foraging choice experiments. Birds showed an initial preference for HIPVs when visual information was the same for all choice options (i.e., one experimental setup had all options with visible prey, another setup with hidden prey). However, if the alternatives within an experimental setup included visible prey (without HIPV) in competition with HIPV-only, then birds preferred the visual option over HIPVs. Our results show that olfactory cues can play an important role in birds' foraging choices when visual information contains little variation; however, visual cues are preferred when variation is present. This suggests certain aspects of bird foraging decisions in agricultural habitats are mediated by olfactory interaction mechanisms between birds and plants. We also found that birds from variety of dietary food guilds were attracted to HIPVs; hence, the ability of birds to use plant cues is probably more general than previously thought, and may influence the biological pest control potential of birds on farmland.","[Rubene, Diana; Leidefors, Malin; Ninkovic, Velemir; Eggers, Sonke; Low, Matthew] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Rubene, Diana] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden","Rubene, D (corresponding author), SLU, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden.",Diana.Rubene@slu.se,"Ninkovic, Velemir/E-7677-2011; Rubene, Diana/S-1720-2019; Low, Matthew/D-2292-2013","Ninkovic, Velemir/0000-0001-9276-7169; Low, Matthew/0000-0002-7345-6063",Carl Tryggers Stiftelse for Vetenskaplig Forskning; Svenska Forskningsradet FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [2014-225]; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [2013-3634],"Carl Tryggers Stiftelse for Vetenskaplig Forskning; Svenska Forskningsradet Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2014-225; Vetenskapsradet, Grant/Award Number: 2013-3634",,41,2,2,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Changes in this key functional trait can therefore have important implications for populations as well. For example, among invertebrates, there is typically a positive correlation between female body size and reproductive output. Increasing body size can consequently trigger changes in population density, population structure (e.g. adult to juvenile ratio) and the strength of intraspecific competition. Body size changes have been documented in several species in the Arctic, a region that is warming rapidly. In particular, wolf spiders, one of the most abundant arctic invertebrate predators, are becoming larger and therefore more fecund. Whether these changes are affecting their populations and role within food webs is currently unclear. We investigated the population structure and feeding ecology of the dominant wolf spider species Pardosa lapponica at two tundra sites where adult spiders naturally differ in mean body size. Additionally, we performed a mesocosm experiment to investigate how variation in wolf spider density, which is likely to change as a function of body size, influences feeding ecology and its sensitivity to warming. We found that juvenile abundance is negatively associated with female size and that wolf spiders occupied higher trophic positions where adult females were larger. Because female body size is positively related to fecundity in P. lapponica, the unexpected finding of fewer juveniles with larger females suggests an increase in density-dependent cannibalism as a result of increased intraspecific competition for resources. Higher rates of density-dependent cannibalism are further supported by the results from our mesocosm experiment, in which individuals occupied higher trophic positions in plots with higher wolf spider densities. We observed no changes in wolf spider feeding ecology in association with short-term experimental warming. Our results suggest that body size variation in wolf spiders is associated with variation in intraspecific competition, feeding ecology and population structure. Given the widespread distribution of wolf spiders in arctic ecosystems, body size shifts in these predators as a result of climate change could have implications for lower trophic levels and for ecosystem functioning.","[Koltz, Amanda M.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Wright, Justin P.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA","Koltz, AM (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",akoltz@wustl.edu,,"Wright, Justin/0000-0002-9102-5347","Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International; Lewis and Clark Fund; Arctic Institute of North America; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1210704]; Alaska Geographic; Discover Denali Research Fellowship; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Kappa Delta Foundation","\Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International; Lewis and Clark Fund; Arctic Institute of North America; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1210704; Alaska Geographic; Discover Denali Research Fellowship; National Geographic Society; Kappa Delta Foundation",,85,4,4,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

A rarely considered effect of spatial structure on biodiversity is the interplay of spatial habitat arrangement with species interactions at multiple spatial scales. We investigated how spatial habitat arrangement and predation mediate the assembly of the larval communities of fungivorous insects breeding in the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq. ex Fr.) P.Kumm in a North American woodland. In a two-way factorial design, we varied the spatial arrangement of mushroom clumps ('clustered', 'patchy', and 'uniform'; 3 levels) crossed with predator exclusion (access allowed or not; 2 levels) to study their joint effects on patterns of alpha, beta and gamma diversity of the fungivorous insect communities. Partitioning diversity into these three components suggested that neither spatial nor predation treatments significantly affected alpha, beta and gamma diversity. We found that an intermediate inter-clump distance (i.e., the 'patchy' treatment) increased spatial autocorrelation in insect community composition within experimental blocks, particularly in the mushrooms to which predators had access. The spatial structuring in b diversity indicates that the arrangement of mushroom clumps can structure beta diversity of fungivorous larval communities through direct effects on the species themselves (e.g., increased aggregation and habitat choice of ovipositing females of fungivorous insects), as well as effects mediated through the presence and behavior of predators (e.g., spatially structured selective foraging by predators acting as a filter on which species were in the clumps). The naturally patchy nature of mushroom fruiting may transform the spatial pattern of beta diversity by altering the behavior of ovipositing females, or by weakening the negative effect of larval competition.","[Kadowaki, Kohmei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Kadowaki, Kohmei; Inouye, Brian D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Kadowaki, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",kinokomushi@gmail.com,"Kadowaki, Kohmei/K-8117-2019","Kadowaki, Kohmei/0000-0003-0512-1621","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0816838]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","Comments on the manuscript were provided by T.

These ants harvest seeds from frugivore feces and cache them in their nests in partially decomposed twigs. Most harvested seeds are eaten but some are placed in viable condition on refuse piles. From 24 to 38% of the colonies (depending on ant species) contain cached seeds and 25-32% have seeds on refuse piles. Experiments with captive colonies of Pheidole nebulosa and P. nigricula demonstrated that almost-equal-to 6% of harvested Miconia nervosa and M. centrodesma seeds are deposited on refuse piles. Because seeds generally retain viability longer than the nest twig remains intact, harvested seeds are not trapped inside twigs. Experimental plantings of 4-d-old Miconia nervosa seedlings on two types of substrate (ant refuse pile vs. topsoil) under two light levels (equivalent to small and large clearings) demonstrated that seedlings grew faster and survived better on refuse piles under light levels typical of small clearings. Light levels typical of large gaps are not necessarily advantageous for establishment of understory rain forest plants. These results illustrate the dynamic nature of a tropical soil seed bank and the complexity of plant-animal interactions that occur there. Ants are simultaneously antagonistic and mutualistic towards seeds, killing most but significantly benefiting some. This interaction is extremely common (Pheidole density > 300 individuals/m2) and likely influences plant recruitment patterns. Our results challenge the generalizations that small seeds are largely protected from predation because of their size, that post-dispersal seed harvesting is equivalent to seed predation, that competition among seedlings from a frugivore defecation is common, and that small seeds accumulate over long periods of time in the seed bank. We hypothesize that differential harvesting and treatment of seeds by ant species may be a mechanism underlying community-level patterns of regeneration in small-seeded plants. Also, the incidental benefits to uneaten seeds deposited on refuse piles provide additional evidence that myrmecochory evolved in plants that strengthened rare but consistent benefits of being harvested by ''granivorous'' ants.",,"LEVEY, DJ (corresponding author), UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT ZOOL, 223 BARTRAM HALL, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA.",,,,,,,93,188,198,2,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1993,74,6,,,,,1802,1812,,10.2307/1939938,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LV242,WOS:A1993LV24200020,,,,,2021-09-27,

Altogether 20 pea, 20 alfalfa and 20 red clover plots were established in a sequential block design, whereupon the aphids along with their predators and parasitoids were assessed both in the middle and at the field margins. The performance of aphids and predation/parasitism were also tested in meso-environments (i.e. enclosed field cages) with two different host plant species per environment. The data shows that spider density on pea is generally high, but it is lower on plants in the vicinity of dover and alfalfa. Braconid parasitoids, Aphidius ervi Haliday parasitized pea aphids on all host plants and similar parasitoid pressure was observed on all host plants tested. Meso-environment experiments further explained the low predation of ladybirds when foraging for prey on pea plants. Using five polymorphic microsatellite markers, it was found that whilst there was no clear trend in terms of the pattern of population genetic variation detected, the fact that some pea aphid populations on certain sample plots showed marginally statistically significant differences (divergence) in terms of interpopulation Fst values, may well reflect predator choice in relation to plant host.

One goal of meta-analysis is testing null hypotheses of no response to experimental manipulations. Many ecologists, however, are more interested in quantitatively measuring processes and examining their systematic variation across systems and conditions. This latter goal requires a suite of diverse, ecologically based metrics of effect size, with each appropriately matched to an ecological question of interest. By specifying ecological models, we can develop metrics of effect size that quantify the underlying process or response of interest and are insensitive to extraneous factors irrelevant to the focal question. A model will also help to delineate the set of studies that fit the question addressed by the meta-analysis. We discuss factors that can give rise to heterogeneity in effect sizes (e.g., due to differences in experimental protocol, parameter values, or the structure of the models that describe system dynamics) and illustrate this variation using some simple models of plant competition. Variation in time scale will be one of the most common factors affecting a meta-analysis, by introducing heterogeneity in effect sizes. Different metrics will apply to different time scales, and time-series data will be vital in evaluating the appropriateness of different metrics to different collections of studies. We then illustrate the application of ecological models, and associated metrics of effect size, in meta-analysis by discussing and/or synthesizing data on species interactions, mutual interference between consumers, and individual physiology. We also examine the use of metrics when no single, specific model applies to the synthesized studies. These examples illustrate that the diversity of ecological questions demands a diversity of ecologically meaningful metrics of effect size. The successful application of meta-analysis in ecology will benefit by clear and explicit linkages among ecological theory, the questions being addressed, and the metrics used to summarize the available information.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Osenberg, CW (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",osenberg@zoo.ufl.edu,"Osenberg, Craig/M-9904-2013","Osenberg, Craig/0000-0003-1918-7904",,,,71,308,317,1,148,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1999,80,4,,,,,1105,1117,,10.2307/177058,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,215EG,WOS:000081368500002,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Free-standing water has been considered to be a resource that limits distribution and abundance of many species of wildlife in arid regions of the United States, and water developments have been used since the 1940s to improve habitat. Provision of water has been assumed to be beneficial to wildlife, particularly during dry seasons and in those environments where surface water is scarce. In recent decades, degradation of naturally occurring water sources resulting from anthropogenic factors has further decreased surface water available to wildlife. Nevertheless, water developments have become controversial, in part, because their ecological effects are difficult to quantify. We compiled and evaluated recently available literature for evidence of effects of water sources on wildlife populations. Critics have expressed concern about water quality, species-specific benefits, mortalities of entrapped animals, enhancement of predator populations, increases in predation rates near water sources, and competition; in general, these negative effects are not supported by available data and remain highly speculative. Positive effects of water developments on wildlife have been documented, and species thought previously not to use free-standing water do so when it is available. Long-term studies with strong experimental designs are needed to examine the effects of water developments on productivity, recruitment, and survival of wildlife populations.","[Simpson, Nova O.; Stewart, Kelley M.] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Bleich, Vernon C.] Calif Dept Fish & Game, Wildlife Invest Lab, Rancho Cordova, CA 95670 USA","Stewart, KM (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Reno Mail Stop 186,1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",kstewart@cabnr.unr.edu,"Stewart, Kelley M/F-5897-2012",,Safari Club International Foundation; National Park Service; California Department of Fish and Game; California Department of Agriculture; Nevada Department of Wildlife; University of Nevada Reno; California Deer Association,"We appreciate the support of Safari Club International Foundation, National Park Service, California Department of Fish and Game, California Department of Agriculture, Nevada Department of Wildlife, University of Nevada Reno, and California Deer Association.

This phenomenon, often termed an ecological trap, has been identified as a potential driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. However, few unequivocal examples have been documented, even in agricultural environments where contemporary habitat changes have been rapid and significant. Several problems complicate the detection of ecological traps in the field, including difficulties in measuring key parameters such as relative habitat preference. Here, we assess habitat selection preferences and breeding success of the yellow wagtail Motacilla flava, a UK red-listed declining passerine, in arable farmland. We combine habitat-specific density indices with measures of home range exclusivity to make inferences on relative habitat preference that are robust to the confounding effect of competitive exclusion. Using multiple measures of breeding success, we identify maladaptive habitat selection patterns at the scale of both territory and nest site choice. Yellow wagtails showed a preference for establishing territories within field bean crops, but subsequently suffered high nest predation rates. Similarly, pairs showed a preference for nesting close to tramlines within cereal fields, but nests further from tramlines achieved higher success due to lower predation rates. We found no evidence of competitive exclusion among neighbouring pairs, suggesting that density-based indices provided an accurate reflection of relative habitat preferences. Our findings highlight the potential role of maladaptive habitat selection in suppressing breeding success among farmland species.","[Gilroy, J.

We hypothesized competition between elk and grizzly bears whereby, in the absence of wolves, increases in elk numbers would increase browsing on berry-producing shrubs and decrease fruit availability to grizzly bears. After wolves were reintroduced and with a reduced elk population, we hypothesized there would be an increase in the establishment of berry-producing shrubs, such as serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), which is a major berry-producing plant. We also hypothesized that the percentage fruit in the grizzly bear diet would be greater after than before wolf reintroduction. We compared the frequency of fruit in grizzly bear scats to elk densities prior to wolf reintroduction during a time of increasing elk densities (1968-1987). For a period after wolf reintroduction, we calculated the percentage fruit in grizzly bear scat by month based on scats collected in 2007-2009 (n=778 scats) and compared these results to scat data collected before wolf reintroduction. Additionally, we developed an age structure for serviceberry showing the origination year of stems in a northern range study area. We found that over a 19-year period, the percentage frequency of fruit in the grizzly diet (6231 scats) was inversely correlated (P<0<bold>001</bold>) with elk population size. The average percentage fruit in grizzly bear scats was higher after wolf reintroduction in July (0<bold>3</bold>% vs. 5<bold>9</bold>%) and August (7<bold>8</bold>% vs. 14<bold>6</bold>%) than before. All measured serviceberry stems accessible to ungulates originated since wolf reintroduction, while protected serviceberry growing in a nearby ungulate exclosure originated both before and after wolf reintroduction. Moreover, in recent years, browsing of serviceberry outside of the exclosure decreased while their heights increased. Overall, these results are consistent with a trophic cascade involving increased predation by wolves and other large carnivores on elk, a reduced and redistributed elk population, decreased herbivory and increased production of plant-based foods that may aid threatened grizzly bears.","[Ripple, William J.; Beschta, Robert L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Fortin, Jennifer K.; Robbins, Charles T.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Robbins, Charles T.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Ripple, WJ (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",bill.ripple@oregonstate.edu,"Ripple, William/ABE-9353-2020",,L.L.

The attributes that make up these habitats often covary and are difficult to evaluate. The purpose of our study was to understand how attributes of habitat structure contribute to the survival of a temperate rocky reef fish, the bluebanded goby, Lythrypnus dalli. We first used natural substrata (rock) and then artificial standardized habitat units (SHUs) to explore attributes that likely reduce predation of L. dalli. Survival was positively related to the size of rock, but multiple attributes covaried, including rugosity, interstitial space between rocks, total surface area, rock height, and the number of rocks per plot. Using SHUs, we manipulated gap distance (to limit predator access) and potential refuge volume (interstitial space) orthogonally between artificial 'rocks' while controlling other habitat attributes. Degree of predator access (PA) was more influential on survival of individuals when combined with low interstitial space (IS) than high, but a combination of low IS and low PA was necessary for consistently high survival. We also conducted a behavioral laboratory experiment to ascertain whether the distribution of L. dalli among configurations of habitat differed in the presence and absence of an important predator, the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus. Individuals selected habitat configurations with low spacing between structures, consistent with survival patterns observed in the field. Our study indicates that habitat attributes vary in their importance to survival, but their combined effects may be greater than those of any single attribute.","[Gregor, Christine A.; Anderson, Todd W.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Gregor, Christine A.; Anderson, Todd W.] San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Anderson, Todd W.] San Diego State Univ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Anderson, TW (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.; Anderson, TW (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.; Anderson, TW (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",gregor329@gmail.com,,,"Wrigley Marine Science Center; San Diego, California chapter of Achievement Rewards for College Scientists; National Undersea Research Program, West Coast and Polar Regions Center [UAF(CA)-03-02]; National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology [05-07-006]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0331895]","We thank S.

Global warming has become more tangible, which may negatively affect pest biological control due to the generally weak thermal tolerance of natural enemies. The mirids Cyrtorhinus lividipennis and Tytthus chinensis (Insecta: Hemiptera: Miridae) are important natural predators of planthoppers and leafhoppers in Asian paddy fields. However, the effects of thermal stress on these predators remain poorly understood. We investigated the thermal tolerance, fitness, predation abilities, and transcriptomic response of T. chinensis and C. lividipennis at elevated temperatures. T. chinensis was more heat tolerant than both Nilaparvata lugens (its prey) and C. lividipennis. T. chinensis not only exhibited better development, survival, reproduction, and predation capacities compared with C. lividipennis but also showed stronger competitiveness when the two mirid predators co-persisted under high-temperature conditions. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we sequenced their transcriptomes at different temperatures. Heat shock protein (HSP) genes were identified and analyzed due to their high co-regulation during heat treatment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that T. chinensis induces HSPs expression quickly and strongly over a wider temperature range in response to heat stress compared with C. lividipennis. Taken together, we highlighted the potential of T. chinensis as a biological control agent in future global warming conditions and provided insight into the thermal adaption of mirid species.","[Bai, Yueliang; Quais, Md.

Here we use foraging activity (proportion foraging) and GUDs to assess the effects that two periphyton consumers and potential competitors, green toad (Bufo viridis) tadpoles and mosquito (Culiseta longiareolata) larvae, have on each other. We also examine the effects of perceived risk of predation imposed by a dragonfly nymph (Anax imperator). To do so, we conducted an artificial pool experiment and developed a food patch appropriate for measuring GUDs for periphyton grazers. More Culiseta individuals foraged in rich food patches than in poor patches. Bufo showed a similar tendency. Fewer Bufo foraged in both patch types in the presence of caged Anax. Culiseta showed a similar tendency. However, in the rich patches, only Bufo reduced foraging activity when the caged predator was present. Both Bufo and Culiseta depleted food patches through exploitation, resulting in lower GUDs. Both competitors together resulted in lower GUDs than did food depletion of each species alone. However, the presence of caged Anax had little or no effects on GUDs. Overall, both Bufo and Culiseta respond to food and safety. They are able to direct foraging effort to richer patches and devote more time to those patches, and they respond to predation risk by choosing whether or not to exploit resource patches.","[Stav, Gil; Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolut & Environm Biol, Fac Nat Sci, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel","Kotler, BP (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",kotler@bgu.ac.il,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",U.S.-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [98-305],"We thank Rakefet Stav, Toby Goldberg, Shomen Mukherjee, and Gabrielle Archar for technical help; Gil Ben-Natan for technical help and enlightening discussions; and Joel Brown, Marc Mangel, and Amos Bouskila for enlightening discussions.

We reduced wasp densities by poisoning in three sites over three y. We predicted an increase in the number of invertebrates and a change in the community composition in sites where wasps were poisoned (wasps removed) relative to nearby sites where wasps were not poisoned (wasps maintained). Wasp densities were significantly reduced by an average of 58.9% by poisoning. Despite this reduction in wasp densities, native bush ants (Prolasius advenus Forel) were the only taxa that was significantly influenced by wasp removal. However, contrary to our predictions there were more ants caught in pitfall traps where wasps were maintained. We believe that the higher abundance of these ants is probably because of the scarcity of honeydew in wasp-maintained sites and compensatory foraging by ants in these areas. Otherwise, our results indicated no significant effects of reduced wasp densities on the total number of invertebrates, or the number of invertebrate families, observed in pitfall or Malaise traps. An analysis of community composition (permutational multivariate analysis of variance) also indicated no significant difference between wasp-removed or wasp-maintained communities. The most parsimonious explanation for our results is that although we significantly reduced wasp numbers, we may not have reduced numbers sufficiently or for a sufficiently long period, to see a change or recovery in the community.","[Duthie, Catherine; Lester, Philip J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Ctr Biodivers & Restorat Ecol, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Lester, PJ (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",phil.lester@vuw.ac.nz,"Lester, Phil/A-1296-2008","Lester, Phil/0000-0002-1801-5687",Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ); Victoria University of Wellington Ph.D. Scholarship,"Laura Warman, Zak Murdoch, John Searle, Oren Werker, Paul Marsden, Ilse Corkery, Julien Grangier, Allan Burne, and Laura Bass provided invaluable field help.

Their hunting strategy resembles that of pit-building antlions (Neuroptera: Myrme-leontidae), offering a classical example of convergent evolution, as they belong to different orders of insects. However, compared with other trap-building predators, spiders and antlions, the foraging behaviour of wormlions is almost unknown. In this study we used a combination of field observations and laboratory experiments to close this gap and investigate how hunger and ecological factors such as density and spatial pattern affect pit size, that is, how they shape investment in foraging and indicate competition between neighbouring larvae. We found slight, mainly decreasing, changes in pit size with hunger, with no change in response to prey. Surprisingly, body mass and length were not tightly correlated with pit size, unlike in antlions and spiders. Other factors, in addition to body mass and size, affect pit size, as the correlation between pits constructed in the field and in the laboratory was strong. The evidence for competition was mixed. On the one hand, we detected, in the laboratory, a change towards a regular spatial pattern with increasing pit densities, as expected, suggesting interference competition. On the other hand, we detected, in the field, a positive correlation between the sizes of neighbouring pits, and a negative correlation in the laboratory between pit size and distance to the nearest neighbour, both indicating clustering in favourable microhabitats, and not supporting strong competition. We discuss our findings in comparison with other trap-building predators and locate them within the general framework of foraging theory. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

A minimal model of resource competition predicts that the species that reduces the limiting resource R to the lowest level (R*) will exclude its competitors. Whether this R* rule is robust to violations of model assumptions remains largely unknown. I conducted a competition experiment with four species of bacterivorous protists in laboratory microcosms and predicted the outcome from each species' value. I also examined how the outcome of competition, species R* abundances, and the effect of protists on bacterial density varied with productivity. Microcosms were unstirred batch cultures containing a variety of bacteria, challenging the robustness of the simplest competition models. Protists with low R* values were less affected by competition, although competing protists often coexisted. The values of R* can predict competitive dominance, even in the absence of R competitive exclusion. Other model predictions were less robust. Contrary to expectation, densities of grazed bacteria increased with productivity, and the effect of some protists on bacterial density did not vary with productivity. Bacterial heterogeneity may account for deviations from model predictions. Further experiments should examine the conditions under which simple rules can be expected to identify dominant species.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",jeremy.fox@ic.ac.uk,,,,,,61,48,49,0,42,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Recent studies have identified general patterns in adaptive radiation and inferred that resource competition is a primary factor driving phenotypic divergence. The role and importance of other processes, such as predation, remains controversial. Here we use Timema stick insects to show that adaptive radiation can be driven by divergent selection from visual predators. Ecotypes using different host-plant species satisfy criteria for the early stages of adaptive radiation and differ in quantitative aspects of color, color pattern, body size, and body shape. A manipulative field experiment demonstrates that the direction and strength of divergent selection on these traits is strongly positively correlated with the direction and magnitude of their population divergence in nature but only when selection is estimated in the presence of predation. Our results indicate that both competition and predation may commonly serve as mechanisms of adaptive radiation.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Nosil, P (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",pnosila@sfu.ca,,,,,,37,194,197,0,89,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We examine processes regulating the structure of tidepool communities for comparison with emergent substrata. The physical environment of tidepools is highly regulated by the tidal cycle, although fluctuations in physical factors are smaller in tidepools, and the organisms remain submerged for the entire tidal cycle. As a result, the upper limits of the distribution of organisms are extended in tidepools and some species either tend to aggregate in pools or avoid them. The vertical zonation of organisms is not as pronounced in tidepools as on emergent substrata. Herbivory has been shown to influence the distribution and abundance of algal species in tidepools, but the effect of predation in regulating community structure has been less well documented. The importance of interspecific competition has been consistently shown in tidepools, particularly among algal species, which usually are the dominant space occupiers. Although the introduction of most species into tidepools depends upon recruitment from the surrounding water, the effects of variation in the supply of new individuals has not been examined. Aspects of the physical regime such as habitat complexity and wave exposure affect the community structure of tidepools, as they do communities on emergent substrata. However, the specific characteristics of tidepools such as pool depth, volume, orientation, shading and flushing rate make individual pools unique, resulting in large spatial variability in tidepool community structure. For this reason, replication in tidepool studies should be carefully selected. Because of their variable characteristics, well-defined boundaries and tidepools of manageable size can serve as experimental mesocosms to test general ecological theories about community organization.",,"METAXAS, A (corresponding author), DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, HALIFAX B3H 4J1, NS, CANADA.",,,,,,,140,149,155,1,124,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Interspecific competition, predation, increased disturbance, organochlorine poisoning and food shortages were suggested as main reasons for the overall decrease. Here we contribute to a better understanding of population declines by comparing foraging movements of satellite tracked adult gulls in three geographical areas of Finland (West, South, and East) that differ in their population trends. Our analysis examines potential differences and preferences in the feeding site behaviour of adult gulls. Our comparison of the three geographical areas showed that nLBBGs preferred feeding at fur farms in West Finland, waste dumps in South Finland, and lakes and fields in East Finland. We found individual gulls of this purportedly generalist species to be highly specialised in their foraging behaviour, particularly those that might be associated with their survival probabilities. We hypothesise that differences in foraging behaviour and food availability during the breeding season are partially responsible for differences in demographic trends between populations. Specifically, we identify potential local conservation problems such as shooting in birds visiting fur farms. Our data suggest that the effective conservation and management of endangered nLBBGs could be aided by simple actions in the breeding areas in addition to better protection throughout the annual movement cycle.

We examined the response of several dominant and subordinate cavity-nesting species to a reduction in the availability of an essential resource (nesting cavities) using the novel experimental approach of blocking the entrances to high-quality cavities. We monitored nest abundance on seven treatment and 13 control sites (aspen groves in a grassland matrix) in British Columbia, Canada, for two years pretreatment (2000-2001), two years during treatment (2002-2003), and two years posttreatment (cavities reopened; 2004-2005). At the community level, nest abundance declined by 50% on treatment sites following cavity blocking and returned to pretreatment levels following cavity reopening. Nest abundance of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a dominant secondary cavity-nester (SCN), declined by 89% and failed to recover posttreatment. Conversely, nest abundance of Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides; a subordinate SCN) increased following cavity blocking and remained high following reopening. Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were unaffected by cavity blocking. We suggest that starlings, while being the dominant SCN, may be limited by availability of suitable nest sites, whereas bluebirds may be limited by starling abundance. We propose that plasticity in nest site preferences of subordinate cavity-nesters may enable them to contend with natural variation in availability of critical resources, such as nest cavities and food, in addition to coping with interspecific competition. This is the. first community-level, multiyear study involving manipulation of nest site availability via experimental cavity blocking.","[Aitken, Kathryn E.

Sixty-four mesocosms, inoculated with a regional species pool (mixed dormant egg banks), were exposed to a full factorial treatment combination of four salinity levels and four disturbance regimes during three consecutive years. Both in the active and dormant community component, considerable shifts in community composition occurred because of direct and probably also second-order effects of the treatments. All large branchiopod species had low long-term salinity tolerances and showed species-specific preferences for disturbance regimes according to their life cycle strategy. The highest salinity (5) was not limiting for cladocerans and ostracods, which thrived in the absence of the competitively stronger, predatory, and bioturbating large branchiopods. Copepods were negatively associated with salinity and coped better with the imposed biotic pressure. Zooplankton diversity and density peaked in intermediate-disturbance regimes, probably because only specialized species survived the high-disturbance regimes, whereas at low-disturbance frequencies high densities of predatory Triops controlled zooplankton communities. Although crustacean dormant egg banks can temporarily buffer against unfavorable conditions, persisting bad conditions may lead to their exhaustion within 4 to 10 yr. Predicted aridification (leading to more intense disturbance regimes) may result in the loss of late successional species (chydorids and ostracods), whereas salinization may wipe out sensitive freshwater species such as large branchiopods.","[Waterkeyn, Aline; Vanschoenwinkel, Bram; Vercampt, Hanne; Brendonck, Luc] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Louvain, Belgium; [Waterkeyn, Aline; Grillas, Patrick] Res Ctr Mediterranean Wetlands Tour Valat, Arles, France","Waterkeyn, A (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Louvain, Belgium.",aline.waterkeyn@bio.kuleuven.be,"Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/I-9021-2019","Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/0000-0002-8973-6297; Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420",Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT Vlaanderen)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); Katholieke Universiteit LeuvenKU Leuven [PF/10/007]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-05-BDIV-014],"This work was supported by a Ph.D. grant from the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT Vlaanderen), a postdoctoral fellowship (PDM-kort), and Program Financing PF/10/007 Eco- and Socio-Evolutionary Dynamics'' from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Research Fund, and by a grant from the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR-biodiversite ANR-05-BDIV-014.",,53,18,20,3,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

The present paper is an attempt to examine the role of shore crab predation and initial mussel density on mussel losses in mussel bottom culture using an intertidal culture plot as a case study. Because of their small size and loose attachment, mussels are particularly vulnerable to predation at this stage, as well as to handling stress and intraspecific competition. In the experimental field plots (1 x 1 m) in the intertidal Oosterschelde, three different densities (1, 5 and 10 kg m(-2)) of mussel seed are laid, with half of the experimental plots protected from predation by means of exclosures. Duration of the experiment was 5 weeks (August-September 2012) post-seeding. Protection was the major factor accounting for biomass production, followed by mussel density. Loss rates increased with mussel density, both in the exclosures and in the exposed plots. Losses in the exclosures with the lowest density were still 45 %. There are indications that handling stress prior to the start of the experiment played a major role in these losses. At the higher densities in the exclosures, losses increased to 72.1 % and were not significantly different between 5 and 10 kg m(-2). About one-third of the total loss (32.6 %) was attributed to shore crab predation. The number of shore crabs observed on the plots did not differ between treatments. Byssal thread development during the experimental period was followed and was found to be a slow process that was insufficient to protect mussels from crab predation at the sheltered experimental location.","[Capelle, Jacob J.; Smaal, Aad C.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquaculture & Fisheries, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands; [Capelle, Jacob J.; Scheiberlich, Gerard; Wijsman, Jeroen W.

In North America, introduced G. affinis are thought to have contributed to the population decline of several native fish species. Sunfish (family Centrarchidae) naturally occur across much of North American, thus mosquitofish and sunfish are likely to come into contact and interact more frequently as mosquitofish spread. However, the nature of this interaction is not well known. We used a lab experiment to explore whether and how the aggressive and foraging behaviors of G. affinis might be influenced by a representative and ubiquitous native centrarchid (Lepomis macrochirus; bluegill sunfish), a species with juveniles that inhabit littoral habitats also preferred by mosquitofish. The experiment partnered an individual male or female mosquitofish (focal fish) with a juvenile bluegill, or a same- or opposite-sex conspecific, filmed these one-to-one interactions, and quantified foraging and aggressive actions for the focal mosquitofish. We found that juvenile bluegill affect foraging in male mosquitofish, resulting in lower percent of handling attempts and handling time in which the male consumed a food item. The presence of juvenile bluegill also led to a reduction in the number of aggressive acts by mosquitofish compared to aggression levels when focal mosquitofish were with conspecifics. In nature, when mosquitofish encounter juvenile bluegill in littoral habitats, our results suggest that the foraging and aggressive behaviors of mosquitofish will be modified, especially for males. This mechanism may influence the rate or geographic extent of the spread of mosquitofish into North American waterbodies.","[Clemmer, Jennifer H.; Rettig, Jessica E.] Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA","Rettig, JE (corresponding author), Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",rettig@denison.edu,,,Anderson Endowment of Denison University; Denison University Research Foundation,"Funding for this research was provided by the Anderson Endowment of Denison University and the Denison University Research Foundation.

Such an approach should enhance our understanding of the criteria for coexistence between species that can interact through both competition and predation (i.e. intraguild predators and prey). I conducted a common garden experiment that revealed strong differences between three guild members (larval salamanders Ambystoma laterale, A. maculatum, and A. tigrinum) in behavior, morphology, and growth in the presence and absence of a shared top predator (the larval dragonfly Anax longipes). All three species also reduced their activity and modified their tail fin depth, tail muscle length, and body length in response to non-lethal Anax. Species that act as intraguild predators were more active and could grow faster than their intraguild prey species, but they also suffered higher mortality in laboratory predation trials with Anax. I also used survey data from natural communities to compare the distribution of Ambystoma species between ponds differing in abiotic characteristics and predatory invertebrate assemblages. An intraguild prey species (A. maculatum) was found more reliably, occurred at higher densities, and was more likely to persist late into the larval period in ponds with more diverse invertebrate predator assemblages. Taken together, these results indicate that top predators such as Anax may play an important role in influencing intraguild interactions among Ambystoma and ultimately their local distribution patterns.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Yurewicz, KL (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",kyurewic@nd.edu,,,,,,61,42,42,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2004,138,1,,,,,102,111,,10.1007/s00442-003-1395-0,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,750EM,WOS:000186978400013,14513352,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

The piscivorous dice snake (Natrix tessellata) has been introduced to Geneva Lake, western Switzerland, where the endangered viperine snake (Natrix maura) is native. Local, dramatic declines in the viperine snake population might be associated with the appearance of the dice snake through dietary overlap between these 2 species, which mainly feed on bullhead (Cottus gobio). In response to this decline, a control program for dice snake was implemented in 2007 to reduce numbers of this introduced snake. In 2010, a new species of fish, the freshwater blenny (Salaria fluviatilis), which shares the same habitat as the bullhead, was introduced into Lake Geneva and has since reached high densities. We determined the impact of freshwater blenny on diet composition and body condition of dice snakes. In addition, we tested for effects of the control program on the body condition of dice snakes and viperine snakes. We collected 294 dice snakes between 2007 and 2013. Based on morphology and a genetic marker (cytochrome b gene), we determined the fish species contained in these snakes' stomachs. We found a drastic switch in dice snake diet following the arrival of freshwater blenny, as consumption of bullhead declined by 68% and was replaced by the blenny. In addition, the body condition of dice snakes increased significantly after the arrival of freshwater blenny. The body condition of both snake species was positively correlated with the number of dice snakes removed from the study area. This finding has important implications concerning the conservation of the endangered viperine snake, and suggests that the control program of dice snakes should be continued.

We summarized the distribution of the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) introduced into Italy and documented population densities of and habitat selection by the species compared to the native European hare (Lepus europaeus). The cottontail is presently in a large area in the northwestern part of the country, and there are other small populations in the northeastern and central parts. Cottontails were present in 13 surveyed areas with good populations, while hares were common in only some of them. Cottontails and hares partially differentiated the habitats they used as daily resting sites and during feeding activities. Natural herbaceous vegetation was used as resting sites by both species, but they differed in the use of shores by hares and shrubby areas by cottontails. During feeding, cottontails were found in natural herbaceous vegetation, poplar plantations, meadows, and stubble fields, usually close to shelter which may be used as refuge. Hares were mainly observed in open fields, such as meadows, winter crops, and natural herbaceous vegetation, but at >= 50 m from refuges. Our results suggest that the coexistence of the 2 species is mediated by a partial separation of spatial niches. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/50.3/315.pdf","[Bertolino, Sandro] DIVAPRA Dept Protect & Exploitat Agr Resources En, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy; [Perrone, Aurelio] Wildlife Sci, I-10029 Villastellone, TO, Italy; [Gola, Laura] Parco Fluviale Po & Orba, I-15048 Valenza, AL, Italy; [Viterbi, Ramona] Osservatorio Faunist Reg Piemonte, I-10128 Turin, Italy","Bertolino, S (corresponding author), DIVAPRA Dept Protect & Exploitat Agr Resources En, Via L da Vinci 44, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy.",sandro.bertolino@unito.it,"stud, zool/G-4030-2011; Bertolino, Sandro/V-5508-2019",,"Regione PiemonteRegione Piemonte; Parco Fluviale del Po e dell'Orba (Valenza, Italy)","We thank M.

Ants and spiders are abundant and ubiquitous terrestrial IG predators, yet the strength and consequences of interactions between them are largely unknown. In the leaf-litter food web of a deciduous forest in Kentucky ( USA), we tested the direct and indirect effects of ants on spiders and a category of shared prey (Collembola) by experimentally subsidizing ants in open plots in two field experiments. In the first experiment, ant activity was increased, and the density of ants in the litter was doubled, by placing carbohydrate and protein baits in the center of each plot. Gnaphosa spiders were almost twice as abundant and Schizocosa spiders were half as abundant in baited plots relative to controls. There were more tomocerid Collembola in baited plots, suggesting possible indirect effects on Collembola caused by ant spider interactions. The second experiment, in which screening of two mesh sizes selectively excluded large and small worker ants from a sugar bait, revealed that the large ants, primarily Camponotus, could alone induce similar effects on spiders. Gnaphosa biomass density was almost twice as high in the plots where large ants were more active, whereas Schizocosa biomass density was reduced by half in these plots. Although tomocerid densities did not differ between treatments, tomocerid numbers were negatively correlated with the activity of Formica, another large ant species. Path analysis failed to support the hypothesis that the ant Camponotus indirectly affected tomocerid Collembola through effects on densities of spiders. However, path analysis also revealed other indirect effects of Camponotus affecting tomocerids. These results illustrate the complexity of interactions between and within two major IG predator groups with disparate predatory behaviors, complexities that will have consequences for functioning of the forest-floor food web.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, E-04001 Almeria, Spain","Moya-Larano, J (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",jordi@eeza.csic.es,"Moya-Larano, Jordi/K-8596-2014; Wise, David./J-6111-2019","Moya-Larano, Jordi/0000-0001-7141-3206; Wise, David./0000-0003-4072-0080",,,,55,44,45,0,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2007,88,6,,,,,1454,1465,,10.1890/05-1474,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,178ED,WOS:000247203100013,17601138,,,,2021-09-27,

Dogs are also potential reservoirs of disease that can be transmitted to both wildlife and people. Therefore a range of management interventions have been suggested to control dog populations. In order to monitor interventions to decrease dog populations, estimates of their population size are important and such methods need to be time-and cost-effective. We describe here a potential method that uses natural marks on dogs along with counts of non-marked individuals in a mark-resight framework to estimate the abundance of free-ranging dogs in a suburban area in India. Using the logit-normal mixed effects estimator to incorporate the effects of individual resighting heterogeneity, we found a total (N-j) of 680.64 +/- 34.06 (95% CI = 617.22 - 751.35) dogs in the study area, with an overall mean resighting probability of 0.53 +/- 0.03 (95% CI = 0.47 - 0.58). This corresponds to a density estimate of 57 dogs km(-2) (CI = 51 - 63). Given that certain assumptions are met, this method may be useful to estimate abundance of dogs where other kinds of marks may be unavailable or impractical. This method may be applied to other species of feral animals as well, where some proportion of a population has distinct natural marks.","[Punjabi, Girish Arjun] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, GKVK, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bengaluru 560065, India; [Athreya, Vidya] Wildlife Conservat Soc India, Bengaluru 560070, India; [Athreya, Vidya] Ctr Wildlife Studies, Bengaluru 560070, India; [Linnell, John D.

Ecological and evolutionary processes were generally thought to occur on different time scales, but recent evidence suggests that evolution may alter the ecological effects of predation over the course of ecological experiments. We used a protozoan and its mosquito-larvae predator. naturally found in the water-filled leaves of pitcher plants. to examine the effect of prey evolution on predator prey interactions. In experiments conducted over 12 days (approximately 50 prey generations, but less than one predator generation), we measured a decrease in the effect of mosquito larvae predators on protozoa prey populations. In a separate set of experiments, we found that the presence of predators corresponded with evolution of smaller cell size and increased population growth rate. In ecological experiments, two situations commonly occur: strong selection pressure applied by the treatment itself and discrepancies in generation times of associate species. Our results suggest that in either situation, the resulting evolutionary patterns may lead to dramatic and important changes in ecological effect size.","[Terhorst, Casey P.; Miller, Thomas E.; Levitan, Don R.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Terhorst, CP (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",terhorst@bio.fsu.edu,,,"FSU English Department; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0519170, DEB 0716891]","We thank A.

Fish were caught between April 2008 and March 2009 using a variety of fishing gear. The analysis of 113 individuals revealed a diet essentially composed of fish (16 species), particularly characid species (9). The diet became more diverse and contained larger fish prey with increasing predator size. Feeding strategy analysis revealed a clear specialization towards the consumption of fish. However, individuals did not prey upon particular prey species, instead opportunistically consuming many different fish species, which could be a strategy to avoid intraspecific competition. Characid species were the most important prey, followed by poecillids. A multi-gear sampling of the ichthyofauna revealed that these prey species were the most abundant (Characidae: 61.3%, Poeciliidae 18.8%) of the 14 fish families occurring at the study site, suggesting that the predator exploits the most abundant fish resources available rather than the rarer fish prey. These findings suggest that potential top-down controls exerted by H. aff. malabaricus in this system follow specific food web pathways that seem to be mediated by the abundance of prey resources.","[Correa, Fabiano; Claudino, Marlucy Coelho; Bastos, Rodrigo Ferreira; Huckembeck, Sonia; Garcia, Alexandre Miranda] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Lab Ictiol, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil","Correa, F (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Lab Ictiol, Campus Carreiros,Caixa Postal 474, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",correafecologia@yahoo.com.br; amgarcia@mikrus.com.br,"Huckembeck, Sonia/I-5302-2015; Garcia, Alexandre Miranda/H-2549-2012; Bastos, Rodrigo Ferreira/J-7138-2012; Correa, Fabiano/E-7240-2019","Garcia, Alexandre Miranda/0000-0002-8479-4199; Bastos, Rodrigo Ferreira/0000-0002-9692-4237; Correa, Fabiano/0000-0003-1909-5137","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [482920/2007-6]; International Foundation of Science, IFSInternational Foundation for Science [A/4419-1]","We thank colleagues of the Ichthyology Laboratory of the Oceanographic Institute of the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG) for their assistance in the field, especially Vinicius Condini; the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, CNPq (Grant No. 482920/2007-6) and International Foundation of Science, IFS (Grant No. A/4419-1) for providing financial support and the ICMBIO for providing permit (14523-2 and 14523-4) for sample collections.",,40,8,10,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

The experiment was a simulated reciprocal transplant over two environments (one with homogeneous and abundant resources, one with heterogeneous and fewer resources) with five levels of genetic diversity for inocula, ranging from clonal to the same diversity level as their source population. We tested the hypotheses that increasing genetic diversity of inocula would increase their establishment success, and that this effect would be stronger when inocula were introduced to environments different from that they evolved in. We found that genetic diversity aided in short-term establishment, but only when inocula were introduced to the heterogeneous, low-resource environment. Further, low-diversity inocula sometimes yielded established populations exhibiting greater genetic diversity than high-diversity inocula under the same circumstances (i.e. source and destination environment type). Additionally, we found evidence that the cost of combatting Allee effects via maintaining spatial compactness so as to maintain reproductive success was greater in low-resource environments where intraspecific competition was more intense; this corroborated a mechanical explanation of the evolutionary imbalance hypothesis. Individual-based models have yielded numerous theoretical insights regarding biological invasions, and EcoSim shows promise in producing novel insights in research areas that have proven to be difficult to explore with classical approaches.","[Scott, Ryan; Gras, Robin] Univ Windsor, Sch Comp Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Gras, Robin] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON, Canada","Scott, R (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Sch Comp Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",scotto@uwindsor.ca,,"Scott, Ryan/0000-0002-3445-0339",,,,72,0,0,1,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Whereas many of these parasites are passed directly between ultimate hosts, others need to navigate through a series of intermediate hosts before reaching a host in (or on) which they can attain sexual maturity. The realisation that parasites need not have evolved to minimise their impact on hosts to be successful, and in many cases may even have a requirement for their hosts to be eaten by specific predators to ensure transmission, has renewed interest in the evolutionary basis of infection-associated host behaviour. Fishes have proved popular models for the experimental examination of such hypotheses, and parasitic infections have been demonstrated to have consequences for almost every aspect of fish behaviour. Despite a scarcity of knowledge regarding the mechanistic basis of such behaviour changes in most cases, and an even lower understanding of their ecological consequences, there can be little doubt that infection-associated behaviour changes have the potential to impact severely on the ecology of infected fishes. Changes in foraging efficiency, time budget, habitat selection, competitive ability, predator-prey relationships, swimming performance and sexual behaviour and mate choice have all been associated with - and in some cases been shown to be a result of - parasite infections, and are reviewed here in some detail. Since the behavioural consequences of infections are exposed to evolutionary selection pressures in the same way as are other phenotypic traits, few behavioural changes will be evolutionarily neutral and host behaviour changes that facilitate transmission should be expected. Despite this expectation, we have found little conclusive evidence for the Parasite Increased Trophic Transmission (PITT) hypothesis in fishes, though recent studies suggest it is likely to be an important mechanism. Additionally, since the fitness consequences of the many behavioural changes described have rarely been quantified, their evolutionary and ecological significance is effectively unknown. Potential hosts may also change their behaviour in the presence of infective parasite stages, if they adopt tactics to reduce exposure risk. Such `behavioural resistance', which may take the form of habitat avoidance, prey selectivity or avoidance of infected individuals, can be viewed as behavioural change associated with the threat of being parasitised, and so is included here. Actually harbouring infections may also stimulate fishes to perform certain types of simple or complex behaviours aimed at removing parasites, such as substrate scraping or the visitation of cleaning stations, although the efficacy of the latter as a parasite removal strategy is currently subject to a good deal of debate. The effects parasites have on shoaling behaviour of host fish have attracted a good deal of attention from researchers, and we have provided a case study to summarise the current state of knowledge. Parasites have been shown to affect most of the antipredator effects of shoaling (such as vigilance, co-ordinated evasion and predator confusion) and can also impair an individual's foraging ability. It therefore seems unsurprising that, in a number of species avoidance of parasitised individuals has evolved which may explain the occurrence of parasite-assorted shoals in the field. Parasitised fish are found more often in peripheral shoal positions and show a reduced tendency for shoaling in some fish species. Given the array of host behaviours that may be changed, the fitness consequences of shoal membership for parasitised hosts and their parasites are not always easy to predict, yet an understanding of these is important before we can make predictions regarding the ecological impact of infections on host fish populations. Clearly, there remain many gaps in our knowledge regarding the effects of parasites on the behaviour of host fish.

Theory has mainly taken a bitrophic perspective that excludes the effects of inducible defenses at different trophic levels. However, inducible defenses could either limit or enhance the effects of predation on coexistence, by means of effects on bottom-up control and population stability. Our aim was to investigate how inducible defenses at different trophic levels affect the possibilities for predator-mediated coexistence, as opposed to competitive exclusion, in replicated experimental plankton communities. In particular, we analyzed how the presence or absence of inducible defenses in algal basal prey affected the outcome of competition between an inducible defended and an undefended herbivore, in the presence or absence of a carnivore. We found the undefended herbivore to be a superior competitor in the absence of predation. This outcome was reversed in the presence of a shared carnivore: populations of the undefended herbivore then strongly declined. The extent of this population decline differed between food webs based on undefended as opposed to inducible defended algal prey. In the former the undefended herbivore became undetectable for most of the duration of the experiment. In the latter the undefended herbivore also crashed to low densities, but it could still be detected during most of the experiment. In food webs based on inducible defended algae, the carnivore failed to reach high densities and exerted weaker top-down control on the two competing herbivores. We conclude that the inducible defense in one of our two competing herbivores allowed the outcome of competition to be reversed when a shared carnivore was added. Inducible defenses in algae did not change this outcome, but they significantly delayed extinction of the undefended herbivore. Predation itself did not promote coexistence in these experimental plankton communities.","[van der Stap, Irene; Mooij, Wolf M.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Ctr Limnol, Dept Aquat Food Webs, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands; [Vos, Matthijs] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Ctr Estuarine & Marine Ecol, Dept Ecosyst Studies, NL-4401 NT Yerseke, Netherlands; [Tollrian, Ralph] Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany","van der Stap, I (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Ctr Limnol, Dept Aquat Food Webs, Rijksstr Weg 6, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands.",i.vanderstap@nioo.knaw.nl,"Vos, Matthijs/B-3802-2009; Mooij, Wolf M/C-2677-2008","Mooij, Wolf M/0000-0001-5586-8200",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO-ALW)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [812.04.008],"We thank Nico Helmsing for technical assistance, help in sampling and algal counts and Arie Kersbergen for counts of zooplankton.

The sea star Pisaster ochraceus is a keystone predator in the rocky intertidal zone with a broad geographic distribution along the west coast of North America. We developed a mechanistic heat budget model that uses environmental data to predict the body temperatures of P. ochraceus. Model accuracy was verified by comparing model output temperatures, generated using measured microclimatic data as input, to the temperatures of live P. ochraceus in the field. The average absolute errors between predicted and measured body temperatures were similar to 1 degrees C. To continuously monitor sea star body temperatures in the field, we developed data loggers that thermally mimic P. ochraceus. Accuracy of these biomimetic loggers was tested by comparing logger temperatures to P. ochraceus body temperatures, and they were found to mimic body temperatures within similar to 1 degrees C. Loggers were deployed at different tidal heights at a site in Bamfield, British Columbia, Canada, to investigate within-site body temperature variation. We also explored the relationship between body temperature and vertical distribution of P, ochraceus. A negative correlation was found between maximum body temperatures on Day n and the number of sea stars found in the intertidal on Day n + 1. These results suggest that temperatures reached during aerial exposure at low tide, at least in part, may determine where in the intertidal zone these sea stars are located, which could affect their foraging limits.","[Szathmary, P.

The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) suggests that invasive species have a competitive advantage in their introduced range because they leave behind many of their predators and parasites from their native range, allowing them to shift resources from defences to growth, reproduction and dispersal. Many studies have demonstrated that invasive species have fewer parasites than their native counterparts, but few studies have tested whether the loss of these natural enemies appears to be a primary driver of the invasion process. To test the ERH, we conducted a mark-recapture study in which we used an anthelmintic drug to successfully reduce parasitic worms in invasive Cuban treefrogs Osteopilus septentrionalis and native treefrogs (Hyla spp.) at half of 12 wetlands, marking nearly 4,200 frogs. If the ERH is supported, we would expect that treating for parasitic worms would have a greater benefit to native than invasive hosts. Growth and survival rates of invasive and native treefrogs responded similarly to the anthelmintic treatment, suggesting that the Cuban treefrog's release from parasitic worms does not appear to significantly contribute to its invasiveness in established areas. Instead, it appears that the overall faster rates of growth and maturation, higher survival rates and larger body sizes of Cuban treefrogs that we observed may contribute to their expansion and proliferation. Synthesis and applications. Although Cuban treefrogs have a lower diversity of parasitic worms in their invasive than native range, this does not appear to significantly contribute to their invasion success in areas where they have been established for more than 20 years. This suggests that any manipulation of parasites in invasive or native hosts would not be an effective method of controlling Cuban treefrogs or reducing their impacts. Further research into other hypotheses is needed to explain the Cuban treefrog's success and help guide management actions to reduce their spread and negative impacts. Our study demonstrates that enemy release may not be a primary driver of invasiveness, highlighting the need for more experimental tests of the enemy release hypothesis to examine its generality.","[Roznik, Elizabeth A.; Surbaugh, Kerri L.; Cano, Natalia; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Roznik, Elizabeth A.] Memphis Zoo, Dept Conservat & Res, Memphis, TN 38112 USA; [Rohr, Jason R.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Roznik, EA (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.; Roznik, EA (corresponding author), Memphis Zoo, Dept Conservat & Res, Memphis, TN 38112 USA.",betsy.roznik@gmail.com,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-1241889]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM109499, R01TW010286]; US Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI 2006-01370, 2009-35102-0543]; US Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [CAREER 83518801]","We thank Nicole Ortega for assistance with setting up this project, and we thank Keith Ballou, Jessica Cintron-Frett, Megan Handfield, May Ibrahim, Andres Manrique, Nicole Ortega, David Pike, Jenna Pochy, Jake Pristupa, Chloe Ramsay and Talya Rejtman for help with fieldwork.

Bark and ambrosia beetles are important biotic factors regulating forest ecosystems, especially tree-killing species that can reach outbreak levels. In a recent study we found that although endemic-level Dendroctonus ponderosae, a tree-killing bark beetle, preferentially colonized fire-injured Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) after prescribed fire, colonization rates decreased consistently over a 3-year period after an initial pulse. This decline may be due in part to an increase in the abundance of the subcortical community, especially competitors such as other bark beetles and ambrosia beetles. Additionally, while bark and ambrosia beetles can be attracted to fire-injured trees, we do not yet fully understand the temporal progression of the insect community in burned forest stands, and whether other species can outbreak after fire. Thus, our main objective was to characterize the bark and ambrosia beetle community and to examine if a disturbance (fire) can mediate the regulation of a tree-killing bark beetle by intensifying competition. We divided beetles into four groups: lower-, main-, and upper-stem bark beetles, and ambrosia beetles. We found that all groups generally increased in abundance after fire, and we observed a time-lag of approximately 1 year in the overall abundance of all species, wherein beetles increased in burned stands more rapidly than in non-burned stands. All groups were present in burned pine stands 1 year after fire, albeit at varying abundances relative to subsequent years. Finally, we found differences in the bark and ambrosia beetle community between areas with and without D. ponderosae: areas with D. ponderosae contained more bark and ambrosia beetles. Thus, fire likely increases competition, explaining why an initial increase in D. ponderosae colonization did not result in a long-term population increase after prescribed fire.

We quantified the availability of mammalian and avian prey across different habitats, analyzed scats collected along standardized routes for occurrence of prey items, and estimated the number and biomass of vertebrate prey consumed. Abundances of the most frequently consumed prey (voles, rabbits, and mice) differed significantly over time, especially in relation to an ice storm that occurred during the study. Coyotes and red foxes tended to select voles and rabbits in number, rabbits in biomass, and incorporated greater numbers and biomass of other prey such as deer, pheasants, and sciurids after the ice storm. Log-linear analyses indicated that both coyotes and red foxes exhibited switching behavior, with differential shifts among the number and biomass of alternative prey they consumed. Hence, foraging strategies of coyotes and red foxes appeared to be a combination of prey selectivity and switching behavior. Our study suggests that competition between coyotes and red foxes for similar primary prey species and limited environments to exploit at the urban-rural interface may contribute to displacement of red foxes by coyotes.","[Randa, Lynda A.] Coll DuPage, Nat & Appl Sci Div, Glen Ellyn, IL 60137 USA; [Cooper, Douglass M.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv Ventura FWO, Ventura, CA 93003 USA; [Meserve, Peter L.] No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Yunger, John A.] Governors State Univ, Environm Biol Program, University Pk, IL 60466 USA","Randa, LA (corresponding author), Coll DuPage, Nat & Appl Sci Div, 425 Fawell Blvd, Glen Ellyn, IL 60137 USA.",randal@cod.edu,,,"United States Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [MO-RS023]; Department of Biological Sciences, Northern Illinois University","We thank S.

How is this relationship influenced by the presence of multiple resources that differ in their vulnerability to the consumer? How well do traditional models of density dependence represent these relationships? Methods: Simple differential equation models of one-consumer/multiple-resource systems are used to determine the relationship between the per capita mortality of the consumer and the equilibrium (or average) consumer density, as well as the associated relationship between per capita growth and population size. Most models have either two or very many resources. Key assumptions: Resources are nutritionally substitutable and different resources do not interact with each other. Predictions: If total mortality is low, use of multiple resources is likely to produce a decelerating decrease in consumer population size with an increase in imposed mortality. Deceleration is caused by relaxed apparent competition between resources as consumer mortality increases. This represents a relaxation of the conditions for persistence in a game played between the strategies represented by different prey species. Because most functional responses saturate at high resource densities, the density-mortality relationship becomes accelerating at high mortalities. As a consequence, generalist consumers often have different curvature of density dependence at high and low population sizes (unlike the widely used 'theta-logistic' model of density dependence).","Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",peter.abrams@utoronto.ca,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"This work was supported by a Discovery Grant to the author from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Loss of diversity and alterations in ecosystem function associated with plant invasions may disrupt food webs, potentially leading to further declines of already threatened amphibian populations. We used a combination of small bins, mesocosms, and field experiments to examine the impacts of Eurasian purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) replacing native cattails (Typha latifolia) in North American freshwater wetlands on survival, developmental rate, and diet (freshwater algae) of American toad (Bufo americanus) tadpoles. Tadpoles developed slower in L. salicaria compared to tadpoles developing in T. latifolia. This effect was consistent across experimental venues, although mesocosms showed this effect only in the second year of our study. Survival and development rates were always more variable in purple loosestrife than in cattail. In bins, tadpoles showed significantly reduced survival when raised in purple loosestrife extract and addition of leaf litter exacerbated this negative effect. Tadpole survival rates in mesocosms and field cages were not significantly different between plant species, most likely an effect of high variability among replicates. We suspect a combination of direct toxicity of high tannin concentrations in L. salicaria leaves and their indirect negative impacts on aquatic food webs are responsible for these results. Tadpole gut analyses revealed differences in algal communities among venues and between L. salicaria and T. latifolia suggesting that alterations in tadpole food quality and quantity contribute to the observed reduced tadpole performance. The replacement of native wetland plant species by L. salicaria does not represent a simple exchange of ecological equivalents and the function of invaded habitats for native species has clearly changed. While we were investigating only a single amphibian species, our results suggest that the impact of L. salicaria on ecosystem processes and aquatic food webs may be more general and likely to negatively affect other wetland species. The threats non-indigenous plants represent for amphibian populations and food webs may be underestimated, and warrant further investigation.","Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Ft Drum Mil Installat, Ft Drum, NY 13602 USA","Blossey, B (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bb22@cornell.edu,,,,,,57,65,67,1,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Despite their potential ecological importance, interactions between dreissenid mussels and crayfish in the Laurentian Great Lakes have received little research attention. Invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) have recently spread within the Great Lakes, and we hypothesized that food resources provided by invasive dreissenid mussels may have enhanced this spread. Dreissenid mussels may also benefit native crayfish such as the virile crayfish (O. virilis), but the distribution of virile species has not increased in the Great Lakes in recent years. We tested the interactive effects of dreissenid mussels and crayfish density on the growth, survival and activity of sympatric rusty and virile crayfish using a mesocosm experiment. We found that dreissenid mussels increased growth and activity of rusty crayfish while high crayfish densities negatively affected rusty crayfish growth. Dreissenid mussels did not affect growth or activity of virile crayfish, but high crayfish densities negatively affected their survival. The different responses of rusty and virile crayfish to mussels may be due to a greater ability of invasive crayfish to exploit mussel-associated food resources and/or to behavioral interactions between these species in sympatry. Our results suggest that dreissenid mussels may facilitate the establishment, spread, and potential impacts of invasive crayfish where these taxa co-occur.

To meet this challenge, the field of coral restoration has rapidly evolved over the past decade. However, despite widespread efforts to outplant corals and monitor survivorship, there is a shortage of information on the effects of coral restoration on reef communities or important ecosystem functions. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined the effects of restoration on three major criteria: diversity, community structure, and ecological processes. We conducted surveys of four restored sites in the Florida Keys ranging in restoration effort (500-2,300 corals outplanted) paired with surveys of nearby, unmanipulated control sites. Coral restoration successfully enhanced coral populations, increasing coral cover 4-fold, but manifested in limited differences in coral and fish communities. Some restored sites had higher abundance of herbivorous fish, rates of herbivory, or more juvenile-sized corals, but these effects were limited to individual reefs. Damselfish were consistently more abundant at restored compared to control sites. Despite augmenting target coral populations, 3 years of coral restoration has not facilitated many of the positive feedbacks that help reinforce coral success. In a time of increasingly frequent disturbances, it is urgent we hasten the speed at which reefs recover important ecological processes, such as herbivory and nutrient cycling, that make reefs more resistant and resilient if we are to achieve long-term restoration success.","[Ladd, Mark C.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Burkepile, Deron E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Shantz, Andrew A.] Penn State Univ, Eberly Coll Sci, State Coll, PA 16802 USA","Ladd, MC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.; Shantz, AA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Eberly Coll Sci, State Coll, PA 16802 USA.",mark.ladd@lifesci.ucsb.edu; shantz@psu.edu,,"Shantz, Andrew/0000-0001-5641-8914; Ladd, Mark/0000-0002-8024-5811",,,,62,13,13,6,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Using predatory drillholes produced on fossil bivalve shells by carnivorous gastropods, we provide an example of how climate change affected predator-prey interactions. We quantitatively examine temporal changes in fossil molluscan assemblages and predation patterns from the Pleistocene Japan Sea, which experienced drastic environmental changes in relation to glacial-interglacial climate cycles. We found significant changes in predation patterns associated with a decline in the abundance of warm-water molluscan species. Climate-mediated fluctuations in the eustatic sea level and resultant weakening of the Tsushima Warm Current caused a decline in a warm-water shell-drilling predator, which moderated the predation pressure and size relationship between the predators and the bivalve prey. Our results indicate that climate-mediated range shifts of species in present-day and future marine ecosystems can likewise increase altered predator-prey interactions.","[Chiba, Tomoki] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Aoba Ku, Aoba 6-3, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Sato, Shin'ichi] Tohoku Univ Museum, Aoba Ku, Aoba 6-3, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Sato, Shin'ichi] Shizuoka Univ, Inst Geosci, Oya 836, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan","Chiba, T (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Aoba Ku, Aoba 6-3, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.; Sato, S (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ Museum, Aoba Ku, Aoba 6-3, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.; Sato, S (corresponding author), Shizuoka Univ, Inst Geosci, Oya 836, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan.",tc-fossil@nifty.com; sato.shinichi.c@shizuoka.ac.jp,,,,,,68,5,6,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0094-8373,1938-5331,,PALEOBIOLOGY,Paleobiology,MAY,2016,42,2,,,,,257,268,,10.1017/pab.2015.38,,,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,DK9XK,WOS:000375284900004,,,,,2021-09-27,

The species was first detected in the northeastern United States in 1998 and has rapidly spread throughout much of eastern North America. in addition to used tire casings, Oc. j. japonicus develops in a wide variety of artificial and natural container habitats, especially rock pools along stream beds. In an effort to evaluate the invasion success and impact of Oc. j. japonicus on populations of native container dwelling species, waste tire disposal sites and natural rock pool habitats were sampled for mosquito larvae throughout Connecticut in 2005, and data were compared with results from prior surveys made in 1987 and 1999. Oc. j. japonicus was the predominant species collected at the waste tire disposal sites regardless of surrounding landscape features, accounting for 55.9% of all larvae. A comparison with collections from prior surveys revealed a 90% reduction in the relative abundance of larval populations of Oc. triseriatus (Say) and significant reductions among larval populations of Oc. atropalpus (Coquillett) and Culex restuans Theobald. Oc. j. japonicus was also the most abundant mosquito collected in rock pool habitats, accounting for nearly 80% of all collected larvae, except where water temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. This was concomitant with significant declines in the relative abundance of Oc. atropalpus and Cx. restuans. We conclude that Oc. j. japonicus is a potentially effective competitor in rock pool and tire environments and may be responsible for reducing populations of several native species occupying these habitats through interspecific competition for limited resources. The exclusion of Oc. j. japonicus from warm water pools further suggests that a temperature barrier may exist for Oc. j. japonicus and that populations may not be able to colonize southern regions of the United States with relatively high summer temperatures.","[Andreadis, Theodore G.; Wolfe, Boger J.] Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, New Haven, CT 06504 USA","Andreadis, TG (corresponding author), Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, 123 Huntington St,POB 1106, New Haven, CT 06504 USA.",theodore.andreadis@ct.gov,,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [U50/CCU6806-01-1, 58-6615-1-218]; USDA-administered Hatch [CONH00768]","We wish to acknowledge John Shepard and Michael Thomas; The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, for assistance in establishing collections sites and in collecting, processing and identifying mosquitoes; and Christopher Samorajczyk, CT Department of Environmental Protection for assistance in field collections.

Since its founding in the early 1970s, the programme has been dedicated to a detailed multidisciplinary study of a section of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the Atlantic's largest reef complex, and has generated data far beyond the capability of lone investigators and brief expeditions. This reef complex extends 250 km southward from Yucatan, Mexico, into the Gulf of Honduras, most of it lying 20-40 km off the coast of Belize. A relatively unspoiled ecosystem, it features a great variety of habitats in close proximity, ranging from mangrove islands, seagrass meadows, and patch reefs in its lagoon to the barrier reef along the margin of the continental shelf. Among its varied macrobenthos, sponges stand out for their ubiquity, range of colours, rich species and biomass, and ecological importance; they populate rocky substrates, some sandy bottoms, and the subtidal stilt roots and peat banks of mangroves. Working from a field station established in 1972 on Carrie Bow Cay, a sand islet atop the reef off southern Belize, experts in numerous disciplines from both the Museum and academic institutions throughout the world have explored the area's biodiversity in the broadest sense and community development over time. At last count, 113 researchers (88 working on site) have focused on the biological and geological role of Porifera in Carrie Bow's reef communities, with the results reported in 125 scientific papers to date. The majority of these sponge studies have centred on systematics and faunistics, including quantitative distribution among the various habitats. Taxonomic approaches have ranged from basic morphology to fine structure, DNA barcoding, and ecological manipulations and culminated in a mini-workshop involving several experts on Caribbean Porifera. Ecological work has covered a broad spectrum as well: bioerosion, silica and nutrient cycling, symbiosis, mutualism, space competition, predation, disease, and the effects on sponge individuals and populations of environmental factors such as light, temperature, salinity, desiccation, substrate, and sedimentation. Many projects were enhanced by scientific illustration, laboratory studies of larvae settlement preferences and development, and investigations of microbial and invertebrate sponge associates, notably symbiotic cyanobacteria, parazoanthid epizoans, and crustacean and ophiuroid endobionts. Of the striking discoveries, the work on alpheid shrimps colonizing sponges off Carrie Bow Cay has yielded the first report of eusociality in marine organisms.","Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA","Rutzler, K (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",ruetzler@si.edu,,,,,,149,15,15,3,89,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2881,,978-0-12-387787-1,ADV MAR BIOL,Adv.

The different levels of emphasis are the coral animal and the reef community. The main study area is the Red Sea which reaches over 20 degrees latitude up to the northernmost margin of the global coral reef belt. Supplementary results on microborer ecology are provided from the Bahamas. The desert enclosed Red Sea, not influenced by land runoff and only minimally by anthropogenic (urban and touristic) nutrient inputs, is predestined for a study on the principal influence of light on calcification within bathymetrical and latitudinal gradients. Hence, on the level of the zooxanthellate scleractinian animal phototrophic and heterotrophic energy supply and its bearing on calcification are being measured in different coral species - in particular in Porites sp., one of the most important reef builders. The growth of 15 zooxanthellate scleractinians in the Gulf of Aqaba correlates with the annual light cycle. This correlation is observable down to 40 m depth. Other growth promoting factors seem to have less influence on coral extension. The availability of organically enriched sediments in shallow water probably yields nutritional value, in particular for filter feeding species, thus restricting their distribution to those areas. Zooxanthellae, when isolated from Mycedium elephantotus, are different in their dependence on depth in maximum rates of photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency ( -slope). Increasing concentrations of pigments as a function of depth could be determined. Maximum rates of photosynthesis of zooxanthellae in vivo, collected at corresponding depth, have been 4 times higher. Structural and physiological adaptations improving heterotrophic and phototrophic energy intake are highlighted. Porites sp. was the subject of annual growth studies at locations extending from Aqaba in the North over the northern and southern Egyptian coast and islands, Sanganeb Atoll and Wingate reef offshore Sudan to the Gulf of Tadjoura in the Gulf of Aden (Djibouti). Mean growth rates in the shallow water zone increase with decreasing latitude and are highest at the southernmost studied reefs in the Gulf of Tadjoura. However, the observed latitudinal growth reduction is restricted to the upper ca. 15 m of the water column. The upper limit of growth potential decreases with depth parallel to the decrease of light availability. Highest growth rates are recorded in shallow depth (10-12.9 mm yr(-1)). This zone reaches at Aqaba (29 degrees 30'N) to a depth of ca. 10 m. At the southern Egyptian reefs (24 degrees 30'N) this zone extends to ca. 15 m water depth. This effect is probably a result of the stronger reduction of winter light levels and water temperature in the northern regions. Compared to other oceans the decrease of growth with increasing latitude of Red Sea Porites corals is far less, and growth rates at Aqaba are the highest observed at these latitudes. On the level of the community of reef inhabitants four principal topics are addressed: The first one is the dynamics of the proportions of hermatypic and ahermatypic organisms and open space. The occurrence of stony and soft corals and the sharing of empty space in different reef sections at Aqaba and on Sanganeb Atoll were quantified. Soft corals, mainly Sinularia- and xeniid species, occupy decreasing shares with depth. Among the Xenia species a bathymetrical zonation pattern was detected. The next issue is the growth impeding role of soft corals and gastropod parasites and predators on scleractinians. Experimental and field observations showed xeniid soft corals to be opportunistic i.e. occupying rapidly open space rather than to attacking and outcompeting stony corals. An increasingly specialized behaviour was detected among corallivorous gastropods of the family Corallophilidae to exploit their coral hosts. Whereas these snails are more or less sessile and depend for a long time on the surrounding host polyps the mobile Drupella cornus (Thaididae) forms feeding aggregations which denude mainly branching corals on shallow reef parts. Furthermore, the role counteracting reef growth of macro- and microbioeroders is investigated. Diadema setosum is a major destructive agent on reefs at Aqaba (not in the central Red Sea). The grazing sea urchins do not only keep potential colonization area free but also erode carbonate material (e. g. 1468 g/m(2)/year, 10 m depth). Demographic and bathymetric patterns in the sea urchin population are analyzed including their bearing on bioerosion of the reef. Investigations on microboring organisms in carbonate material have started in the Red Sea; initial results, however, are only available from similar studies near Lee Stocking island, Bahamas. Three major environments have been identified based on the distribution of the different microborers. These are 1) the intertidal environment dominated by boring cyanobacteria, 2) reef sites from 2 to 30 m water depth dominated by a diverse assemblage of boring cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, and 3) the deep reef slope from 100 to 300 m dominated by boring green algae and heterotrophs. The boring chlorophyte genus Phaeophila appears rapidly and dominates at sites from 2 to 30 m, but it leaves vacated borings and is replaced by Ostreobium quekettii after 1 year. Different substrate types show very different rates of colonization by microborers. The greatest excavation rates (100 g /m(2)/3 months) occur in fine-grained limestone, while the slowest rates (0.5 g/m(2)/3 months) occur in calcite crystals. Molluscan shell material shows intermediate rates of excavation. Light conditions appear very important in determining the growth rate and distribution of different microborers between the sites, however, the interaction of light with other factors, such as substrate, time period of exposure, and water quality conditions may be involved.","UNIV FRANKFURT,INST GEOL PALAONTOL,D-60054 FRANKFURT,GERMANY; GEOMAR,D-24148 KIEL,GERMANY; UNIV COLOGNE,INST ZOOL,D-50923 COLOGNE,GERMANY; BOSTON UNIV,DEPT BIOL,BOSTON,MA 02215","SCHUHMACHER, H (corresponding author), UNIV ESSEN GESAMTHSCH,INST OKOL,HYDROBIOL ABT,POSTFACH 103764,D-45117 ESSEN,GERMANY.",,"Reijmer, John/B-5000-2009; Dullo, Wolf-Christian/O-2679-2014; Reijmer, John J.G./M-9759-2019","Reijmer, John/0000-0001-5807-1256; Reijmer, John J.G./0000-0001-5807-1256",,,,145,35,36,0,33,INSTITUT PALAONTOLOGIE UNIVERSITAT ERLANGEN-NURNBERG,ERLANGEN,"LOEWENICHSTRABE 20, D-91054 ERLANGEN, GERMANY",0172-9179,,,FACIES,Facies,,1995,32,,,,,,145,188,,10.1007/BF02536867,,,44,Geology; Paleontology,Geology; Paleontology,QZ615,WOS:A1995QZ61500004,,,,,2021-09-27,

We investigated the hypothesis that the duration of a habitat following disturbance mediates the relative importance of physical and biotic control. We combined detailed information on natural populations in a series of temporary ponds with small-scale experiments on specific processes. We compared data on presence/absence and abundance of taxa from temporary ponds showing a gradient of habitat duration with 3 simple models of community structure that incorporate random forces, life history adaptations, and biotic interactions, respectively. Different scales of resolution in describing community structure provide different emphases on which processes are important in these communities. The Life History Model explained patterns of presence/absence in the ponds, but not patterns of abundance of many taxa which best fit a model in which the importance of predation and competition in structuring communities increases with increasing duration. Experimental studies confirmed that the effect of predation and competition in temporary pond communities depends on habitat duration. Predation on all prey species examined increased with increasing pond duration. Predators were more diverse and more abundant in long-duration ponds where effects of their consumption on the abundance of prey taxa were greater than in shorter-duration ponds. Predators from long-duration ponds fed preferentially on prey taxa that predominate in shorter-duration habitats such as Aedes mosquitoes and the fairy shrimp Eubranchipus. Competition between Daphnia and rotifers occurred primarily in intermediate-duration ponds, where Daphnia at typical densities was capable of drastically reducing abundances of Keratella cochlearis in cultures. However, at densities found in both short- and long-duration habitats, Daphnia had no effect.","UNIV WISCONSIN, CTR LIMNOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA",,,,,,,,103,285,297,3,101,NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0887-3593,,,J N AM BENTHOL SOC,J.

Red-backed Voles will likely change habitat utilization patterns for the endemic subspecies of Meadow Vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus terraenovae.","Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Corner Brook, NF A2H 6J3, Canada; Coll N Atlantic, Fish & Wildlife Program, Corner Brook, NF A2H 6H6, Canada","Hearn, BJ (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, POB 960, Corner Brook, NF A2H 6J3, Canada.",,,,,,,61,5,5,1,12,OTTAWA FIELD-NATURALISTS CLUB,OTTAWA,"PO BOX 35069, WESTGATE PO, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 1A2, CANADA",0008-3550,,,CAN FIELD NAT,Can.

Patterns of predation on tethered juvenile clams exposed to the natural assemblage of predators were compared among different habitat types in fall and summer. Between-habitat patterns of predation on clams varied with season. In fall, predation on tethered clams was greater in subtidal sand bottoms and just inside the edge of intertidal salt marshes than in intertidal sand hats. In summer, predation on clams was similar in all habitats. Experiments conducted in held enclosures showed that: (a) individual crabs spent more time in the salt marsh habitat than in intertidal sand flats; (b) crab individuals placed in a sand bottom habitat had greater predation rates in high-density prey patches than in low-density patches; (c) individuals had greater predation rates in prey patches located just inside the edge of salt marshes than in intertidal sand flats, when prey density was held constant between the two habitats; (d) at intermediate and high crab densities predation mortality of clams was similar between vegetated and unvegetated habitats; (e) both individual crabs and groups of crabs consumed similar numbers of clams in the two habitat types when large predatory birds (mainly various species of terns, Sterna spp., herring gulls, Larus argentatus Coues, and ring-billed gulls, L. delawarensis Ord) were excluded from enclosures, but the crabs consumed more clams in the salt marsh than in the sand flat habitat in control enclosures where birds were not excluded. In the fall, when Herring and Ring-billed Gulls were abundant in the study area, preference by blue crabs for safer and more profitable habitats may explain the greater predation on clams in salt marshes than in intertidal sand flats. In the summer, when Herring and Ring-billed Gulls were rare and crab densities are 1.5-3 times greater than in the fall, competition with conspecifics may have caused crabs to disperse and feed in intertidal flats and may explain the general lack of differences in predation intensity among habitat types observed in the summer. Thus, patterns of predation and habitat use by blue crabs appeared to explain between-habitat and seasonal differences in predation mortality of clams. Focusing on the variation in the feeding rates of individual predators in response to external conditions can produce the mechanistic understanding of spatial and seasonal patterns of predation needed to understand and better predict the processes that structure benthic marine communities.","UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA",,,,,,,,105,100,101,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

These activities are controlled by specific predator and disperser guilds that respond to different microsite conditions such as vegetation density with varying predation and removal rates. In Namibia's arid rangelands, the native, annual herbaceous legume Crotalaria podocarpa has considerably increased after several years of elevated rainfall, thereby reducing density and vitality of economically important fodder grasses. To investigate whether this proliferation entails the risk of a permanent establishment, we studied pre- and post-dispersal seed predation, as well as primary and secondary seed dispersal of the legume and quantified the impact of different predator groups on post-dispersal seed removal. We experimentally excluded (i) neither vertebrates nor invertebrates, (ii) birds, (iii) vertebrates (birds and rodents), and (iv) vertebrates and large invertebrates on plots with different C. podocarpa density (0-35% cover). Seed predation was mainly caused by invertebrates, with 30% pre-dispersal seed predation in pods and up to 90% post-dispersal seed removal for free seeds on the ground which is the most persistent seed stage. C. podocarpa density did not affect post-dispersal seed removal or secondary seed dispersal. As main dispersal mode for the study species explosive dehiscence was identified, with seeds reaching dispersal distances of up to 4 m, while wind or rolling dispersal played a minor role. Subsequent secondary dispersal by animals accounted for dispersal distances up to 19m. Our findings highlight the combined effects of pre- and post-dispersal seed predation to determine the total seed fate. With a contribution of about 370 seeds m(-2) to the species persistent soil seed bank, seed numbers seems to be more important for C podocarpas vagility than the species dispersal ability. Supplemented by seedling fate and adult mortality, this data can contribute to reliably predict the risk of a further spread of the species. (C) 2015 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.

Predicting non-consumptive effects and their impacts on communities can be difficult because predators can affect resources directly through nutrient cycling and indirectly by altering prey resource use, which can lead to complex interactions among resources and consumers. In this study we examined the effects of caged dragonfly predators on aquatic resources in the presence and absence of two focal herbivores, the tadpoles of Neotropical tree frogs Agalychnis callidryas and Dendropsophus ebraccatus. We crossed the presence/absence of caged dragonflies with four tadpole treatments: no tadpoles, each tadpole species alone, and both species together to examine interactions among tadpole composition, predator presence, and time on tadpole growth, resources, and zooplankton abundances. Predator effects on growth changed through ontogeny and was species-dependent. Predators initially reduced then dramatically increased A. callidryas growth, but had no effect on D. ebraccatus. Predators also increased the abundances of both periphyton and phytoplankton. However, there was no evidence of a trait-mediated trophic cascade (i.e., tadpole by predator interaction). Instead, nutrients from prey carcass subsidies likely played an increasingly important role in facilitating resources, and shaping tadpole growth, competitive interactions, and zooplankton abundances through time. In nutrient-poor aquatic systems the release of nutrients via the consumption of terrestrially derived prey items by aquatic predators may have important impacts on food webs by facilitating resources independent of the role of trait-mediated trophic cascades.","[Costa, Zacharia J.; Vonesh, James R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","Costa, ZJ (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 W Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",zachariacosta@gmail.com,"Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717200]; Sigma Xi,"We thank the Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente de Panama for permission to conduct this research in Panama (Permiso No. SE/A-41-08) and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for use of their facilities and logistical support.

In the first set of experiments, the addition of Daphnia was cross-classified with an algal supplement. D. pulex (at densities of 5, 2.5 and 1.25 ind. l-1 in the three successive experiments), algae (7.5 x 10(3) cells ml-1 Cryptomonas sp. and Rhodomonas minuta), or both Daphnia and algae were added to bottles containing a natural microzooplankton community. Addition of algae increased ciliate numbers in all experiments, and increasing densities of Daphnia increasingly suppressed ciliate numbers. Suppression of ciliates by D. pulex was proportionally greater in bottles without added algae. Because Daphnia did not suppress phytoplankton, this difference is probably due to higher filtering rates by Daphnia at lower algal concentrations rather than to exploitative competition for food resources. In the second set of experiments, a much smaller daphnid, D. ambigua, was added at initial densities of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 ind. l-1. Algae (1.5 x 10(3) cells ml-1 Cryptomonas sp. and R. minuta) were added to all bottles to minimize exploitative competition. D. ambigua had a pronounced effect on ciliate numbers, dependent on the size and species of ciliate, but had mixed effects on different algal taxa, either suppressing, enhancing or having no effect on them. The only common rotifer in the community, P. vulgaris, was unaffected by the presence of D. ambigua. These experiments show that both large and small Daphnia suppressed ciliates through predation and interference, rather than exploitative competition. Large ciliates appear to have a size refuge from predation by small daphnids. Among vulnerable ciliates, there is a strong linear negative relationship between cladoceran biomass density and ciliate abundance. If, as previously suggested, ciliates can consume sizable proportions of phytoplankton production, Daphnia predation on ciliates could be an important trophic link between nanoplankton and metazon zooplankton.",,"WICKHAM, SA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL,6044 GILMAN LAB,HANOVER,NH 03755, USA.",,,,,,,64,41,42,0,14,E SCHWEIZERBART'SCHE VERLAGS,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

Few studies have investigated how they operate synergistically to alter trophic interactions among indigenous and nonindigenous species in invaded ecosystems. We experimentally manipulated a suite of interacting invasive mammals, including top predators (cat Felis catus, ferret Mustela furo, stoat M. erminea), herbivores (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, hare Lepus europaeus), and an insectivore (hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus occidentalis), and measured their effects on indigenous lizards and invertebrates and on an invasive mesopredator (house mouse Mus musculus). The work was carried out in a grassland/shrubland ecosystem that had been subjected to two types of habitat modification (widespread introduction of high-seed-producing pasture species, and areas of land use intensification by fertilization and livestock grazing). We also quantified food productivity for indigenous and invasive fauna by measuring pasture biomass, as well as seed and fruit production by grasses and shrubs. Indigenous fauna did not always increase following top-predator suppression: lizards increased on one of two sites; invertebrates did not increase on either site. Mesopredator release of mice was evident at the site where lizards did not increase, suggesting negative effects of mice on lizard populations. High mouse abundance occurred only on the predator-suppression site with regular production of pasture seed, indicating that this food resource was the main driver of mouse populations. Removal of herbivores increased pasture and seed production, which further enhanced ecological release of mice, particularly where pasture swards were overtopped by shrubs. An effect of landscape supplementation was also evident where nearby fertilized pastures boosted rabbit numbers and the associated top predators. Other studies have shown that both suppression of invasive predators and retiring land from grazing can benefit indigenous species, but our results suggest that the ensuing vegetation changes and complex interactions among invasive species can block recovery of indigenous fauna vulnerable to mesopredators. Top-down and bottom-up ecological release of mesopredators and landscape supplementation of top predators are key processes to consider when managing invaded communities in complex landscapes.","[Norbury, Grant; Smith, James] Landcare Res, Alexandra 9340, New Zealand; [Byrom, Andrea; Pech, Roger; Anderson, Dean; Forrester, Guy] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Pech, Roger] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Joint Grad Sch Biodivers & Biosecur, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Clarke, Dean] Landcare Res, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand","Norbury, G (corresponding author), Landcare Res, POB 282, Alexandra 9340, New Zealand.",norburyg@landcareresearch.co.nz,,,"Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [CO9X0505, CO9X0909]","P.

Dietary overlap between three adjacent 10 cm size groups is high. No-choice, two-species-choice and multiple-choice field experiments showed that, within the Mollusca, the wrasse prefers chitons and abalone to other gastropods and limpets; crabs and shrimps are high, and echinoderms are low, on the preference list. A comparison of prey consumed with the relative abundance of prey groups shows that the wrasse takes prey more or less in proportion to its abundance, with variation in this pattern attributed to prey defences and predator choice. A long-term study showed that per capita consumption of cryptic abalone increased with increasing abalone density, suggesting a functional response of wrasse to the density of a preferred prey. The wrasse is a diurnal predator with a defined home range that increases with increasing size of wrasse. Foraging activity commences soon after dawn, reaches a peak during mid morning, declines during the afternoon, and ceases at dusk. Inter- and intraspecific agonistic interactions are few and size-related.

Male sand gobies rely on empty mussel shells for nest building and spawning. The two populations differed considerably in nest-site abundance and sexual-selection regimes. In one population nest sites were scarce, leading to stronger male-male competition over nests, a higher nest site colonization rate and reduced potential for female choice compared with the other population that had a surplus of nests. In the high-competition population, males were larger than females, perhaps as a response to selection, whereas the other population was not sexually size dimorphic. The results from the field were confirmed in a pool experiment that demonstrated the effect of nest abundance on nest occupancy and male reproductive success. Larger males were more successful in obtaining nest sites in both high and low nest availability treatments. Larger males were also favored by females as mating partners, but only in the treatment with surplus nest sites. Nest shortage was associated with an increased potential for intrasexual selection (measured as the coefficient of variation), whereas the potential for intersexual selection was increased when nests were common. In conclusion, nest-site abundance can influence the relative contribution of intrasexual competition and mate choice in a population. Hence, resource availability can contribute to within-species variation in mating patterns.","UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN; HELSINKI UNIV, DEPT SYSTEMAT & ECOL, ZOOL LAB, FIN-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND",,,"/B-5479-2008; Kvarnemo, Charlotta/D-3529-2012; Lindstrom, Kai/ABG-4353-2020","/0000-0002-8356-5538; Kvarnemo, Charlotta/0000-0001-8983-2900; Lindstrom, Kai/0000-0002-8356-5538",,,,43,112,112,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,1996,50,2,,,,,646,654,,10.2307/2410838,,,9,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,UJ156,WOS:A1996UJ15600015,28568956,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

A field study, spanning the 1990s, describes a rapid decline of the Fucus spp. stands along the wave-exposed Swedish southeast coast. During this period, a relative dominance of Fucus vesiculosus L. shifted to a relative dominance of Fucus serratus L. The decline of F. vesiculosus coincided with observations of large numbers of the grazing isopods Idotea baltica (Pallas) and Idotea granulosa Rathke, or with field observations of frequent grazing marks on Fucus fronds. I. baltica, but not I. granulosa, tended to aggregate in the declining Fucus spp. stands, indicating a strong preference for Fucus spp. In a mesocosm experiment I. baltica, when given a choice, grazed both Fucus species at weak water motion. At strong water motion grazing was concentrated on F. vesiculosus. It is hypothesized that one of the reasons I. baltica preferred F. vesiculosus to F. serratus at strong water motion may have been differences in habitat quality, like width of thallus, influencing the ability to cling to the plant. Smaller thallus, as in F. vesiculosus, thus is the preferred habitat for grazing of I. blatica. We postulate that the existence of F. serratus in the area may be favoured by strong wave action and moderate but not strong grazing by I. baltica, relaxing the interspecific competition from F. vesiculosus.","Kalmar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Engkvist, R (corresponding author), Kalmar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.",roland.engkvist@hik.se,,,,,,48,21,21,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

Birds reduced the overall abundance of Lottia digitalis only; L. strigatella abundance increased and the abundance of L. pelta, the species most frequently consumed, did not change. Through crypsis, the goose barnacle Pollicipes polymerus and the mussel Mytilus californianus indirectly affected the abundance of L. digitalis and L. pelta in opposite ways by changing their risk of succumbing to bird predation. These limpets also exhibited strong habitat selection for their cryptic substrates. By altering the amount of preferred habitat, birds indirectly influenced limpet abundance: gull predation reduced the area covered by P. polymerus, releasing M. californianus from space competition. By consuming limpet grazers and reducing space competition, birds indirectly enhanced the abundance of algae. L. strigatella sizes generally fell below the range of limpet sizes consumed by birds. Consequently, birds indirectly increased L. strigatella density by reducing the intensity of exploitative competition with other limpet species; L. strigatella biomass declined significantly with increasing biomass of the other two limpets, and with decreasing algal cover. These results demonstrate that indirect effects and apparently adaptive behaviors can counteract (or reinforce) direct interactions between species pairs, suggesting that conclusions from short-term experiments emphasizing species pairs can be tenuous.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,SEATTLE,WA 98195",,,"Wootton, J.

We explored the effects of plant community composition and soil properties on the soil nematode community, with a particular interest in the regulation of banana plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN). We monitored banana phytometers (Cavendish Grande Naine cultivar) in 85 plots distributed along a plant richness gradient. Plant community composition, soil properties, abundance of bacterivorous, fungivorous and proportion of predaceous soil free-living nematodes, and abundance and damage of PPN (Radopholus sirnilis, Pratylenchus coffeae, HelicoLylenchus multicinctus, and Meloidogyne spp.) in phytometer roots were measured. We used structural equation modeling to investigate ecological processes leading to PPN regulation. Low-stratum plant species richness, but not high-stratum, was positively related to microbivore nematode abundances, supposedly because it promoted qualitative diversity of organic inputs and micro-climatic effects supporting more soil microorganisms. Musa genotype and low-stratum plant species richness induced associational susceptibility because of differential susceptibility of Musa genotypes to PPN and because of polyphagia of PPN spreading outside the Musa family, respectively. We found no regulation of PPN by predaceous nematodes, probably because food web complexity prevented trophic cascades from propagating. Ultimately, fungivorous nematode abundance was negatively related to PPN abundance, suggesting apparent competition or increased regulation by antagonistic fungi. Our results suggest that, when facing generalist pests, cropped plant communities should be diversified to promote pest regulation but must be carefully assembled to limit pest susceptibility heterogeneity among crop genotypes and to exclude alternative host plant species.","[Poeydebat, Charlotte; Daribo, Marie-Odette; Carval, Dominique] CIRAD, CAEC, BP 214, F-97285 La Lamentin 2, Martinique, France; [Tixier, Philippe; Chabrier, Christian; de Bellaire, Luc de lapeyre; Carval, Dominique] CIRAD, UPR GECO 26, TA B-26-PS4,Blvd Lironde, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Tixier, Philippe] CATIE, Dept Agr & Agroforesteria, Cartago 30501, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Vargas, Randall] CORBANA, Direcc Invest, Apdo 390-7210, Guapiles, Costa Rica","Carval, D (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR GECO 26, TA B-26-PS4,Blvd Lironde, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",dominique.carval@cirad.fr,"Tixier, Philippe/C-2119-2008","Tixier, Philippe/0000-0001-5147-9777; Carval, Dominique/0000-0002-1525-2855; de Lapeyre de Bellaire, Luc/0000-0003-1243-0887",CIRAD; E.U.

Theory predicts that predators are more sensitive to fragmentation than their prey, resulting in greater predator loss in small patches. Predator loss, in turn, is predicted to 1) increase herbivory rates overall, and 2) cause herbivores to shift feeding from plants that act as refugia to those that are preferred forage. We tested these predictions in an old-field community using two experiments. The first was a large-scale experiment that included hundreds of arthropod species in fragments of various sizes, and used goldenrod and switchgrass to assess herbivory. Our second experiment manipulated densities of a focal predator species and a focal prey species to determine if changes in densities, rather than other characteristics of fragments, were sufficient to cause the trends observed in the first experiment. We found that predator densities declined in small fragments whereas herbivore densities showed the opposite trend. Total herbivory mirrored herbivore densities by increasing in small patches, and this mean increase was driven by large increases in goldenrod herbivory but declines in switchgrass herbivory. Experimental manipulation of densities confirmed that herbivores preferentially feed on goldenrod, and that predators depress herbivory on goldenrod but have a negligible effect on switchgrass. Our results suggest that fragmentation alters trophic interactions by causing declines in predator densities and increases in herbivore densities, but that feeding preferences of herbivores may generate unequal impacts among plant species.","[Genua, Lucy; Start, Denon; Gilbert, Benjamin] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada","Start, D (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada.",denon.start@mail.utoronto.ca,"Gilbert, Benjamin/E-6616-2010","Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0002-4947-6822",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC-CGSNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Centre for Global Change Science Award,Research funding was provided by NSERC (BG) and personal funding was awarded by NSERC-CGS (DS) and by a Centre for Global Change Science Award (LG).,,57,10,11,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2017,126,9,,,,,1357,1365,,10.1111/oik.04223,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FF4JR,WOS:000408908700015,,,,,2021-09-27,

For large carnivores, difficulties in directly observing individuals and historical hardware limitations of GPS collars mean that relatively little is known of the spatio-temporal factors contributing to encounters. The African large predator guild represents one of the few remaining functionally intact guilds of large carnivores on the globe and so represents a unique study system for understanding competitor interactions. We explored the drivers of male leopard (Panthera pardus) encounters with lions (Panthera leo), African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in the context of habitat characteristics and temporal activity overlaps. Using high-resolution (five minute GPS fixes) data from 48 large African carnivores from 2012 to 2018, we quantified encounter occurrences between male leopards and other guild species and related these to habitat type (open vs closed), activity overlaps and moonlight levels. Leopards met wild dogs 4.56 +/- 1.15 (standard error), lions 3.11 +/- 0.56 and cheetahs 2.27 +/- 0.73 times per month. All species instigated encounters, but leopard instigated encounters with dominant competitors appeared to reflect imperfect information on risk, primarily occurring within habitats with limited visibility. Moreover, encounters peaked during periods of high temporal overlap, suggesting that, although previous research indicates temporal activity patterns may not be driven by predator avoidance, temporal overlap has implications for competitor dynamics. Our results show how habitat characteristics and niche overlaps contribute to encounters between competitors and provide an example of how niche shifts within competitor assemblages can impact competition between species.","[Rafiq, K.; Moloro, C.; Wich, S.

In the work presented here, the relative attractiveness of four species of insectary plants to beneficial and pest insect species was assessed by observing the relative frequencies of flower visits to replicated blocks of the insectary flowers in two Oregon broccoli fields. The four plant species tested were alyssum (Lobularia maritima L. Desv.), coriander (Coriandrum sativa L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), and phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.). Predatory hoverflies (Syrphidae) were identified to species, where possible, because of their previously observed importance as aphid predators in broccoli fields in the study area. The other beneficial insect groups observed were in the families Apidae, Coccinellidae, Tachinidae, and Vespidae, and the three main pest species were western tarnished plant bug (Lygus hesperus Knight), western spotted cucumber beetle (Diabrotica undecimpunctata undecimpunctata Mannerheim), and imported cabbageworm (Pieris rapae L.). The Syrphidae visited mostly coriander, but this preference was probably influenced by competition from other foragers. Bumblebees and the three pest species visited mostly phacelia, and other species groups were less consistent in their flower choices. The different insect preferences for flowers are discussed in terms of the key influencing factors that should be considered when assessing the relative attractiveness of insectary plants in the field.","Oregon State Univ, Integrated Plant Protect Ctr, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Hort, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Lincoln Univ, Natl Ctr Adv Bioprotect Technol, Canterbury, New Zealand","Ambrosino, MD (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Integrated Plant Protect Ctr, 2040 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",ambrosim@science.oregonstate.edu,"Jepson, Paul/E-8669-2011; Wratten, Steve D/J-3467-2013; Luna, Juan Manuel Fernandez/C-6845-2012","Jepson, Paul/0000-0003-3419-4715; Wratten, Steve D/0000-0002-5168-8277; Luna, Juan Manuel Fernandez/0000-0002-0366-4545",,,,40,67,72,2,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

The Florida brittle stars, representing two lineages, are epibionts on shallow (3-18 m depth), tropical/subtropical plexaurid (e.g., Eunicea spp., Muricea spp.) and gorgoniid (Antillogorgia spp.) octocorals. The scope of this study includes recent distributional records of O. mirabilis in south Florida, field abundances in relation to the cohabiting endemic ctenophore Coeloplana waltoni, behavioral observations of the ophiuroid, ctenophore and the predatory amphipod Caprella penantis, as well as a laboratory experiment testing the effects of the non-native ophiuroid on the native ctenophore. Individuals of O. mirabilis have been collected near St. Lucie Inlet, extending its northern-most range by about 110 km since 2019. Two years of field sampling have demonstrated significant declines of the native, benthic ctenophore with increasing abundances of the non-native ophiuroid. Evidence suggests that the ophiuroid is negatively affecting the abundances of the ctenophore through interference competition, greatly aided by its abrasive armature of calcareous spines, plates and hooks. This detrimental effect justifies considering O. mirabilis as an invasive species in south Florida. Sporadic and intense predation by a caprellid amphipod also probably contributes to the ctenophore's decline, but to a lesser extent than that caused by the ophiuroid. Adding to the risk of extinction of C. waltoni is its narrow requirement of living octocorals as hosts and restricted distribution in southeast Florida and the Bahamas.","[Glynn, Peter W.; Gillette, Phillip R.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Coffman, Brian; Dominguez, Joshua; Martinez, Nicholas] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Undergrad Marine & Atmospher Sci Program, 1365 Mem Dr,210 Ungar Bldg, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Dettloff, Kyle] NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Jones, Nicholas P.; Riegl, Bernhard M.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Oceanog Ctr, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, 8000 N Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA","Riegl, BM (corresponding author), Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Oceanog Ctr, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, 8000 N Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA.",rieglb@nova.edu,,"Dettloff, Kyle/0000-0001-8512-2733",,,,76,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

The hypothesis was that seeds occurring in clumps may have a higher probability to be harvested than seeds having a scattered distribution. In order to test this hypothesis, four analysis steps were performed. First, pattern of seed production and dispersal of four species was recorded; two of them were more abundant next to ant nests (Tuberaria guttata, Euphorbia exigua), whereas the other two were more abundant away from ant nests (Bromus scoparius and Plantago bellardi). Second, a stochastic model was developed to simulate the observed dispersal patterns of each studied species. Third, 10 seed spatial arrangements in accordance to the distribution patterns created by the model were offered to ants and the location of predated seeds was recorded. Finally, the observed pattern of seed predation was matched to models performed by different distributions of probability. Results showed that the probability of being predated decreased as distance among seeds increased. This preference of ants for high concentration of food items holds down the dominant species sufficiently to allow the subordinates to survive, thus increasing diversity near nests. The observed higher frequency of small-seeded, small-sized, or creeping therophytes close to the ant nests can be therefore seen as an example of indirect myrmecophily.","Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Bot, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Matemat F Casorati, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Guarino, R (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Bot, Viale S Ignazio Laconi 13, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",guarinotro@hotmail.com,"Guarino, Riccardo/B-4013-2012","Guarino, Riccardo/0000-0003-0106-9416",,,,65,11,12,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,,2005,178,2,,,,,225,235,,10.1007/s11258-004-3655-4,,,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,963LD,WOS:000231804900008,,,,,2021-09-27,

We have analysed and compared the structure of feeding interactions for cereal aphids and their primary and secondary parasitoids in organically and conventionally managed winter wheat fields using quantitative food web metrics (interaction evenness, generality, vulnerability, link density). Despite little variation in the richness of each trophic group, food web structures between the two farming systems differed remarkably. In contrast to common expectations, aphids and primary parasitoids were characterized by (1) a higher evenness of interaction frequencies (interaction evenness) in conventional fields, which cascaded to interactions at the next trophic level, with (2) a higher interaction evenness, (3) a higher ratio of primary parasitoid taxa per secondary parasitoid (generality) and (4) a higher link density. Aphid communities in the organically managed fields almost exclusively consisted of a single ear-colonizing species, Sitobion avenae, while highly fertilized conventional fields were mainly infested by leaf-colonizing aphids that benefit from the nutritional status of winter wheat. In conclusion, agricultural intensification appears to foster the complexity of aphid-parasitoid food webs, thereby not supporting the general expectation on the importance of organic farming practices for species richness and food web complexity.","[Lohaus, Katharina; Vidal, Stefan; Thies, Carsten] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Lohaus, K (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Grisebachstr 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",kalohaus@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Vidal, Stefan/AAC-3130-2020","Vidal, Stefan/0000-0002-1673-4055",German Research Foundation via the European Science Foundation,"KL and SV would like to thank G.

Here we report on studies comparing the aphids Aphis nerii and A. asclepiadis that feed sympatrically on the milkweed Asclepias syriaca in northeastern North America. We sought to identify tradeoffs among species' attributes that might promote coexistence, but in most instances A. nerii was superior to A. asclepiadis. Aphis nerii was 84% more fecund, fed upon 880% more phloem sap, and was affected 70% less by intraspecific competition as compared to A. asclepiadis. In interspecific competition, A. nerii reduced A. asclepiadis abundance by 77%, whereas A. asclepiadis did not affect A. nerii. In dispersal trials, 10% of winged A. nerii but only 1% of A. asclepiadis successfully moved from non-host plants to A. syriaca. We also investigated whether there were differences in aphid interactions with milkweed cardenolides. Jasmonic acid increased milkweed cardenolides by 33%, a realistic amount similar to that induced by several leaf-chewing herbivores. Nevertheless, jasmonate-induced cardenolides failed to affect aphid performance and aphid feeding had no effect on milkweed cardenolide concentration. Yet cardenolides were important for aphid resistance to predators; A. nerii sequestered 25% more cardenolides and was preyed upon 50% less than A. asclepiadis. Interactions with cardenolides thus again favored A. nerii over A. asclepiadis. Given that A. nerii and A. asclepiadis are decidedly not equivalent in their demography, competitive ability, defense and dispersal, our results strongly refute the notion that neutral processes can explain coexistence of these aphids. Based on field observations, we propose two tradeoffs - timing of milkweed colonization and relationships with ants - as putative mechanisms for the coexistence of these congeners.","[Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Mooney, Kailen A.; Jones, Patricia; Agrawal, Anurag A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Mooney, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mooneyk@tritrophic.org,"Agrawal, Anurag A/Y-2497-2019","Agrawal, Anurag A/0000-0003-0095-1220",,,,53,53,59,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2008,117,3,,,,,450,458,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16284.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,269FE,WOS:000253634100016,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although all these birds are known to prey on many fiddler crab species worldwide, there is no estimation of their joint predation impacts, probably due to the difficulty in conducting experiments on an appropriate spatial scale. In these situations, computer simulation methods are useful tools. By using Monte Carlo methods and field data, we modeled the decrease of a fiddler crab population due to bird predation. The model found that under current bird occurrences and crab densities, birds do not consume more than 0.03% of the studied fiddler crab populations. Birds only consume more than 10% of the population if crab density is below 0.02 crabs m(2), or if bird occurrences are at least 3 orders of magnitude higher than currently observed. Both situations are unlikely, as mean crab density is 140 crabs m(2), and bird density is never so high. Furthermore, by monitoring three different fiddler crab patches, we found that bird predation cannot account for temporal density changes, suggesting that other population processes are more important than bird predation. In conclusion, even though fiddler crabs may exhibit strong predator-avoidance behavior, direct lethal effects of bird predation are currently small.","[Ribeiro, Pablo D.; Navarro, Diego D.; Daleo, Pedro; Iribarne, Oscar O.] UNMdP CONICET, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, IIMyC, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Ribeiro, Pablo D.] EBLB, Grp Invest & Educ Temas Ambientales GrIETA, San Eduardo Del Mar, Argentina; [Jaureguy, Luciano M.] UNMdP, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biol, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Ribeiro, PD (corresponding author), UNMdP CONICET, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, IIMyC, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Ribeiro, PD (corresponding author), EBLB, Grp Invest & Educ Temas Ambientales GrIETA, San Eduardo Del Mar, Argentina.",pdribeir@mdp.edu.ar,,"Ribeiro, Pablo/0000-0002-3132-6981",CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP20150100819CO]; ANPCyT [Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica] [PICT2015-3823],This research was funded by CONICET (PIP20150100819CO granted to OOI) and by ANPCyT [Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICT2015-3823 grated to OOI)],,98,0,0,0,14,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1438-387X,1438-3888,,HELGOLAND MAR RES,Helgoland Mar.

Larvae and adult ladybirds were individually put into petri dishes at 25 degreesC with 20 eggs of the selected target species. The tests included three treatments: (a) only coccinellid eggs, (b) coccinellid eggs and 5 aphids, and (c) coccinellid eggs and 40 aphids. Intra-guild predation (IGP) by H. axyridis of eggs of the native species, A. bipunctata, was lower in comparison with egg cannibalism (CANN) by H. axyridis, for both adults and larvae. No differences were detected for larvae at the density of 5 aphids. IGP of exotic against the native species was never higher than CANN of native species. IGP of native species was never higher in comparison with CANN. A. bipunctata adult CANN was significantly higher than IGP at densities of 0 and 40 aphids. In the set of experiments on CANN and IGP an inverse correlation was observed between egg consumption by adults and larvae and aphid density. Our bioassays indicate that H. axyridis does not demonstrate IGP vs. native species at a higher level than CANN of native species. It appears that H. axyridis does show a high potential for CANN and therefore seems unlikely this species will to have a negative impact on native species by IGP of eggs.

However, some recent theoretical work predicts that resource density should first decrease, and then increase as the strength of IGP increases. This occurs because weak to intermediate IGP increases the IG predator density more than it reduces the IG prey density, so that weak to intermediate IGP leads to the lowest resource density compared to weak or strong IGP. We test this prediction that basal resource density would first decrease and then increase as the strength of IGP increase. We used a well-studied system with two protozoa species engaged in IGP and three bacteria species as the basal resources. We experimentally manipulated the percentage of the IG prey population that was available to an IG predator as a proxy for IGP strength. We found that bacterial density first decreased (by similar to 25%) and then increased (by similar to 30%) as the strength of IGP increased. Using a modified version of a published IGP model, we were able to explain similar to 70% of the variation in protozoa and bacterial density. Agreement of the empirical results with model predictions suggests that IGP first increased the IG predator density by consuming a small proportion of the IG prey population, which in turn increased the summed consumer density and decreased the bacterial resource density. As IGP strength increased further, the IG predator became satiated by the IG prey, which then freed the bacterial resource from predation and thus increased bacterial density. Consequently, our work shows that IGP can indeed decrease or increase basal resource density depending on its strength. Consequently, the impacts of IGP on resource density is potentially more complex than previously thought.","[Chang, Feng-Hsun; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Chang, FH (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",fhchang@umich.edu,"Chang, Feng-Hsun/AAY-6710-2021","Chang, Feng-Hsun/0000-0002-8202-6364","Ministry of Education, TaiwanMinistry of Education, Taiwan; Rackham One-Term Dissertation Fellowship, University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan System","We thank Peter Morin's research group for their kindly help on microcosm setup and consultant.

Some of the earliest manipulative experimental ecological studies were undertaken on rocky shores. Many, over time, have made considerable contributions to ecological theory, especially highlighting the importance of biological interactions at the community level. The suitability of rocky shores as convenient test systems for ecological experimentation is outlined. Here we consider contributions from rocky shores to the emerging concepts of supply-side ecology, the roles of competition, predation and grazing, disturbance and succession and positive interactions in structuring communities along environmental gradients. We then address alternative stable states, relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and bottom-up and top-down control of ecosystems. We briefly consider the feedback and synergies between ecological concepts and experimental work on rocky shores, whilst still emphasizing the traditional values of marine natural history upheld in JMBA since its first publication. The importance of rigorous experimental designs championed by Underwood and co-workers is emphasized. Recent progress taking advantage of new technologies and emerging approaches is considered. We illustrate how experimental studies have shown the importance of biological interactions in modulating species and assemblage-level responses to climate change and informed conservation and management of coastal ecosystems.","[Hawkins, Stephen J.; Pack, Kathryn E.] Univ Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Hawkins, Stephen J.; Pack, Kathryn E.] Marine Biol Assoc UK, Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Hawkins, Stephen J.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Hyder, Kieran] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci Cefas, Pakefiled Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Hyder, Kieran] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro] Univ Pisa, Dept Biol, Via Derna 1, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro] CoNISMa, Rome, Italy; [Jenkins, Stuart R.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales","Pack, KE (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.; Pack, KE (corresponding author), Marine Biol Assoc UK, Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England.",katpac@mba.ac.uk,,"Pack, Kathryn/0000-0001-7470-982X; Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/0000-0001-5244-5202",Marine Biological Association of the UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),"SJH, LBC, SRJ, KH wish to thank the European-funded project EUROROCK which enabled us to all work together in such a fruitful and fun way, and was an important step in all our careers.

Calomys musculinus (Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae) is a small rodent species widely distributed in Argentina and particularly abundant in agroecosystems of the Pampean region, where it is known to select border habitats over cropfields. Aims. The aim of the present research was to assess habitat use by C. musculinus in cropfield borders. Assuming that the number of rodent captures in each border reflects the intensity of use, we intended to identify the habitat characteristics that would account for abundance differences among borders. Methods. Seasonal trapping sessions were carried out in borders of the rural zone of Chucul, Cordoba. Environmental variables were registered from both field surveys and remote-sensing imagery. Generalised linear models were used to identify the habitat variables associated with C. musculinus habitat use. Key results. General fit of the models was fairly good; spring, summer and autumn models explained more than 55% of the variation in C. musculinus abundance among borders. Individual plant species were significant predictors of C. musculinus abundance, but they varied with seasons, whereas tree cover and border width were significant predictors in most seasons studied. In general, rodent abundance was positively associated with peanut and maize crops or maize stubbles and negatively related to soybean or its stubbles. In the coldest seasons, rodent abundance increased with increasing land-surface temperature of the border. Conclusions. Border use by C. musculinus appeared to respond to differences in border quality, which seems to be more affected by those environmental characteristics that entail a reduction of the predatory risk rather than by those that involve food supply. Crop-fields may partially afford C. musculinus food requirements. Implications. Because C. musculinus is the natural reservoir of a zoonotic agent, the identification of the habitat characteristics affecting rodent population numbers in borders may be of crucial importance for the implementation of ecologically based rodent-management strategies aimed at reducing human-rodent contacts. We suggest that wide borders, particularly those contiguous to maize and peanut cropfields, should be understood as priority sites for the implementation of specific control actions.","[Simone, Ivana; Provensal, Cecilia; Polop, Jaime] Univ Nacl Rio Cuarto, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis Quim & Nat, Dept Ciencias Nat, Rio Nac 36,Km 601,CP X5804BYA,Agencia Postal 3, Cordoba, Argentina","Simone, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Rio Cuarto, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis Quim & Nat, Dept Ciencias Nat, Rio Nac 36,Km 601,CP X5804BYA,Agencia Postal 3, Cordoba, Argentina.",isimone@exa.unrc.edu.ar,,,Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica de la Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto (SECyT-UNRC)Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnologia (SECYT); Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FONCyT)ANPCyTFONCyT,"This research was made possible by the financial support from Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica de la Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto (SECyT-UNRC) and Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FONCyT).

Aggregation was compared among all species, among life stages, and for each species as its density changed yearly. We found that predators were less aggregated than spider mites, and older life stages were less aggregated than younger ones.

In addition to gradual changes such as climate warming, extreme weather events, such as melting temperatures in winter and rain on snow, can have profound consequences for ecosystems. Rain-on-snow events lead to the formation of ice layers in the snow pack, which can restrict access to forage plants and cause crashes of herbivore populations. These direct impacts can have cascading effects on other ecosystem components, often mediated by trophic interactions. Here we document how heavy rain in early winter, leading to the formation of a thick layer of ice, was associated with dramatic mortality of domestic reindeer on Yamal Peninsula, Russia. In the subsequent summer, breeding of two boreal generalist predators, red fox and Hooded Crow, was recorded for the first time in a monitoring area in the Low Arctic tundra of this region. We suggest that the resource pulse created by the abnormally high reindeer mortality and abundance of carrion may have facilitated these breeding events north of the known breeding range of the two species. Our observations provide an example of how specific emergent weather events may indirectly pave the way for more abrupt, although possibly temporary, species range changes.","[Sokolov, Aleksandr A.; Sokolova, Natalya A.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, Ural Branch, Arctic Res Stn, Labytnangi, Russia; [Sokolov, Aleksandr A.; Sokolova, Natalya A.] State Org Yamal Nenets Autonomous Dist, Sci Ctr Arctic Studies, Salekhard, Russia; [Ims, Rolf A.; Ehrich, Dorothee] Univ Tromso, Dept Arct & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway; [Brucker, Ludovic] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Cryospher Sci Lab, Code 615, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Brucker, Ludovic] Univ Space Res Assoc, GESTAR, Columbia, MD 21046 USA","Sokolov, AA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, Ural Branch, Arctic Res Stn, Labytnangi, Russia.; Sokolov, AA (corresponding author), State Org Yamal Nenets Autonomous Dist, Sci Ctr Arctic Studies, Salekhard, Russia.; Ehrich, D (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arct & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway.",sokhol@yandex.ru; dorothee.ehrich@uit.no,"Sokolova, Natalia/Q-8905-2018; Brucker, Ludovic/L-5412-2019; Sokolov, Aleksandr/P-3421-2017; Brucker, Ludovic/A-8029-2010; Ehrich, Dorothee/F-6492-2015","Sokolova, Natalia/0000-0002-6692-4375; Brucker, Ludovic/0000-0001-7102-8084; Sokolov, Aleksandr/0000-0002-1521-3856; Brucker, Ludovic/0000-0001-7102-8084; Ehrich, Dorothee/0000-0002-3028-9488","programs of Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences [12-4-7-022-Arctic, 15-15-4-35-Arctic]; Norwegian Environment Agency; Inter-regional Expedition Centre Arctic","We thank the Laptander family for their support throughout this study, and Maite Cerezo, Nikolay Erokhin, Ivan Fufachev, Tatyana Strukova, and Sergey Zykov for help and company in the field.

Whereas C maenas was the most common shore crab in these waters, its numbers have declined on the soft sediment substrates during the last 20 years. As the two exotic crab species were first recorded in the Dutch delta in 1999. they could not have initiated the decline of the native C. maenas. However, within a few years H. takanoi completely dominated the intertidal hard substrate environments: the same environments on which juvenile C maenas depend. On soft sediment substrate the native and exotic shore crab species are presently more or less equally abundant. H. takanoi might initially have taken advantage of the fact that C maenas numbers were declining. Additionally H. takanoi are thriving in expanding oyster reefs of Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster) in the Dutch delta waters, which provide new habitat. Nowadays H. takanoi appears to be a fierce interference competitor or predator for small C. maenas specimens by expelling them from their shelters. These interactions have led to increased mortality of juvenile C mamas. At present the C. maenas populations seem to be maintained by crabs that survive and reproduce on available soft sediment habitats where H. takanoi densities are low. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By circumventing prolonged evolutionary processes, behavioural plasticity is critical in allowing species to cope with rapid environmental changes within their lifetimes. Coral reefs have faced multiple mass mortality events of corals related to climate change in the last two decades. The consequent loss of structural complexity adversely impacts long-lived, structure-dependent fish predators. We attempted to determine how well a guild of groupers (Pisces: Epinephelidae) copes with rapid structural change in the lightly fished Lakshadweep Archipelago, Indian Ocean. Of the 15 species, territorial and site-attached groupers declined exponentially with decreasing structural complexity, while widely ranging species showed no change. However, one site-attached species, the peacock grouper, Cephalopholis argus, maintained high densities across the structural gradient. We explored the mechanisms this species employs to cope with declining habitat structure. Our observations indicate that both a potential release from specialist competitors and plasticity in foraging behaviour (foraging territory size, diet and foraging mode) appeared to favour the peacock grouper's survival in sites of high and low structure. While specialist competitors dropped out of the assemblage, the foraging territory size of peacock groupers increased exponentially with structural decline, but remained constant and compact (50 m(2)) above a threshold of structural complexity (corresponding to a canopy height of 60 cm). Interestingly, despite significant differences in prey density in sites of high and low structure, gut content and stable isotope analyses indicated that peacock groupers maintained a specialized dietary niche. In-water behavioural observations suggested that diet specialization was maintained by switching foraging modes from a structure-dependent 'ambush' to a structure-independent 'widely foraging' mode. The remarkable foraging plasticity of species such as the peacock grouper will become increasingly critical in separating winners from losers and may help preserve specialist ecosystem functions as habitats collapse as a result of climate change.

Most prey populations consist of different coexisting size classes that often engage in asymmetrical intraspecific interactions, including cannibalism, which can lead to nonlinear interaction effects. This may be important as the size structure with the prey could alter the overall density-dependent predation rates. In a field experiment with damselfly and dragonfly larvae, 16 treatments manipulated the density of a small prey stage, the presence of large conspecific prey and the presence of heterospecific predators. Size structure in the prey (i.e. when both prey stages were present) decreased the impact of the predator on overall prey mortality by 25-48% at mid and high prey densities, possibly due to density-dependent size-structured cannibalism in the prey. The predation rates on small prey stages were determined by the interaction of large prey and predators. Predation rates increased with prey density in the absence of large prey, but predation rates were constant across densities when large conspecifics were present. The functional response for unstructured prey followed a Holling type III model, but the predation rate for size-structured prey was completely different and followed a complex pattern that could not be explained with any standard functional response. Using additional laboratory experiments, a mortality model was developed and parameterized. It showed that the overall prey mortality of size-structured prey can be adequately predicted with a composite functional response model that modelled the individual functional responses of each prey stage separately and accounted for their cannibalistic interaction. Thus, treating a prey population as a homogeneous entity will lead to erroneous predictions in most real-world food webs. However, if we account for the effects of size structure and the intraspecific interactions on functional responses by treating size classes as different functional groups, it is possible to reliably predict the dynamics of size-structured predator-prey systems.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Rudolf, VHW (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",volker.rudolf@rice.edu,"Rudolf, Volker/B-7913-2009","Rudolf, Volker/0000-0002-9214-2000",,,,59,32,33,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Small juvenile tiger prawns (3-6 mm in carapace length, CL) were stocked in enclosures at densities of 4-32 prawns per enclosure (4.4-35.5 prawns m(-2)) on a high biomass seagrass bed (about 70 g m(-2) of mostly Enhalus aeoroides) and one with low biomass (about 10 g m(-2) of mostly Halodule uninervis). After 2-3 weeks in the enclosures, recovery rates, and hence possibly survival, were greater on the high biomass Enhalus than on the low biomass Halodule. However. not all fish and crustaceans could be excluded from the enclosures. Growth rates were twice as fast on the high biomass Enhalus than on the low biomass Halodule. It is likely that the high biomass Enhalus, with its greater surface area, supported more epiphytic flora and fauna and reduced the potential for interference competition between prawns, compared with the low biomass Halodule. Growth rates on Enhalus were significantly faster at a stocking density of 4 prawns per enclosure (1.3 mm CL week(-1)) than at a stocking density of 16 and 32 prawns per enclosure (both 0.8 mm CL week(-1)), and did not differ significantly between April and October/November (temperatures were about 30 degreesC at both times). The mean growth rate at 8 prawns per enclosure (1.1 mm CL week(-1)) did not differ significantly from those at 4, 16 and 32 prawns per enclosure. These results from two seagrass beds suggest that the carrying capacity for juvenile tiger prawns was greater in the high biomass Enhalus than the low biomass Halodule bed.","CSIRO, Div Marine Res, Cleveland Marine Labs, Cleveland, Qld 4163, Australia","Loneragan, NR (corresponding author), CSIRO, Div Marine Res, Cleveland Marine Labs, POB 120, Cleveland, Qld 4163, Australia.",,"Haywood, Michael/D-4652-2013; Loneragan, Neil/A-3386-2008","Haywood, Michael/0000-0003-2119-4855; Loneragan, Neil/0000-0003-2536-8656",,,,34,25,25,1,15,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Following the footsteps of Volterra and D'Ancona, I will outline the research progress in the area of complex ecological interactions. Ecosystems can be viewed as spatial networks, in which local populations are connected by dispersal, or food webs, in which different species are connected by trophic interactions. Most of the scientific progress in the past century has been made by studying these two aspects. I will discuss that progress considering the following specific topics in a historical perspective: the role of space in consumer-resource interactions, population fluctuations and the predator's functional response, bottom-up and top-down control in the trophic chain, the network structures of ecosystems, the link between stability and ecosystem diversity and complexity.","Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron & Informaz, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Gatto, M (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron & Informaz, Via Ponzio 34-5, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",marino.gatto@polimi.it,"Gatto, Marino/D-9531-2012","Gatto, Marino/0000-0001-8063-9178",,,,52,5,5,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1125-0003,,,ITAL J ZOOL,Ital.

The density of M. nausithous caterpillars was not associated with ant density or plant density. This study suggests that the density of M. nausithous is limited by the density of the host ant M. rubra. We conclude that habitat management for M. nausithous should focus on the maintenance of habitats that hold both resources, but that enable high densities of M. rubra.

Because of their high densities and low mobility, Plethodon are well suited for studies of how fitness-related traits change as species approach their range limits. Across contact zones between the mountaintop endemic Peaks of Otter Salamander (Plethodon hubrichti) and the widespread Eastern Redback Salamander (Plethodon cinereus), we measured changes in three salamander traits: 1) body condition, 2) frequency of tail loss, and 3) proportion of hatchlings. We then used hierarchical Bayesian models to compare these traits among five site types: allopatric sites for both species, sites where one of the species was dominant and the other was rare, and mixed sites containing high densities of both species. For P. hubrichti, we found no consistent changes in body condition across contact zones. However, frequency of tail loss increased continuously from allopatric sites (21%) to rare sites (54%). We also found evidence of reduced hatchling proportions at sites outside of allopatric areas (15-16% versus 30% at allopatric sites). For P. cinereus, body condition was higher at allopatric sites compared to sites within the contact zone. Similar to P. hubrichti, frequency of tail loss in P. cinereus increased continuously from allopatric sites (27%) to sites where P. cinereus were rare (50%). However, for P. cinereus, we did not find evidence of reduced hatchling numbers towards the edge of their range margin. Overall, our results suggest that both species likely have reduced fitness as they approach their range margin. Tail loss, which may reflect interference competition, effects of predation, or interactions between these, could potentially act as a density-dependent factor that stabilizes the range boundary between these species, at least over shorter time scales.","[Marsh, David M.; Caffio-Learner, Alexa; Daccache, Anna M.; Dewing, Margaret B.; McCreary, Kathryn L.; Richendollar, Nathan J.; Skinner, F.

However, complicated food web interactions (i.e., trophic interactions among predators and their impacts on host density and diversity) often obscure the important pathways regulating disease. Here, we disentangle community drivers in a case study of planktonic disease, using a two step approach. In step one, we tested univariate field patterns linking community interactions directly to two disease metrics. Density of focal hosts (Daphnia dentifera) was related to density but not prevalence of fungal (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) infections. Both disease metrics appeared to be driven by selective predators that cull infected hosts (fish, e.g., Lepomis macrochirus), sloppy predators that spread parasites while feeding (midges, Chaoborus punctipennis), and spore predators that reduce contact between focal hosts and parasites (other zooplankton, especially small bodied Ceriodaphnia sp.). Host diversity also negatively correlated with disease, suggesting a dilution effect. However, several of these univariate patterns were initially misleading, due to confounding ecological links among habitat, predators, host density, and host diversity. In step two, path models uncovered and explained these misleading patterns, and grounded them in habitat structure (refuge size). First, rather than directly reducing infection prevalence, fish predation drove disease indirectly through changes in density of midges and frequency of small spore predators (which became more frequent in lakes with small refuges). Second, small spore predators drove the two disease metrics through fundamentally different pathways: they directly reduced infection prevalence, but indirectly reduced density of infected hosts by lowering density of focal hosts (likely via competition). Third, the univariate diversity-disease pattern (signaling a dilution effect) merely reflected the confounding direct effects of these small spore predators. Diversity per se had no effect on disease, after accounting for the links between small spore predators, diversity, and infection prevalence. In turn, these small spore predators were regulated by both size selective fish predation and refuge size. Thus, path models not only explain each of these surprising results, but also trace their origins back to habitat structure.","[Strauss, Alexander T.; Shocket, Marta S.; Hite, Jessica L.; Hall, Spencer R.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; [Civitello, David J.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Penczykowski, Rachel M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Duffy, Meghan A.] Univ Michigan, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Strauss, AT (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.",atstraus@indiana.edu,"Penczykowski, Rachel/AAH-4208-2019","Penczykowski, Rachel/0000-0003-4559-0609; Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802; Strauss, Alexander/0000-0003-0633-8443; Shocket, Marta/0000-0002-8995-4446","NSF GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD); EPA STAR fellowships; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0841679, 0841817, 1120316, 1120804, 1353749, 1354407]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1353806] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","K.

We studied the Mexican species Daibulus quinquenotatus Delong & Nault in the field and greenhouse. In Jalisco, Mexico, field populations of D, quinquenotatus increased in size when ants were present on their. gamagrass (Tripsacum species) hosts. When ants experimentally were excluded, predatory spiders invaded the gamagrass habitat and extinguished D. quinquenotatus populations. Ants also eliminated two nonmyrmecophilous and potential competitor Dalbulus species from the host-plant microhabitat of D. quinquenotatus. Greenhouse populations of D. quinquenotatus killed gamagrass hosts in the absence of predators and attendant ants. Ants (Formica subsericea Say) on gamagrass regulated, captive leafhopper populations by removing nymphs and adults, and kept le;lf surfaces free from contaminating honeydew. Ants also protected leafhoppers from experimentally introduced nabid predators; in the absence of ants, nabids eliminated leafhopper populations. Diet influenced the response of ants to populations of D. quinquenotatus. When ants were denied food, they preyed. upon and extinguished greenhouse populations of D. quinquenotatus, but when supplied with prey (dead eastern yellowjackets), large numbers of ants attended leafhopper populations that grew in size, Few ants attended leafhoppers if they were supplied with pre); and honey.

Despite its importance in understanding the emergent property of plant communities and ecosystems, the question of how genes govern species coexistence has proven very difficult to answer. In a plant community that behaves like a network game, each coexisting plant strives to maximize its fitness by pursuing a rational self-interest strategy in a way that affects the decisive reaction of other plants. 2. We integrated this principle founding game theory into a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping paradigm, on which to derive a game mapping model for the genetic landscaping of how plants coexist. The new mapping model dissolves the phenotype of each plant in a community into two components, autonomous phenotype, characteristic of the plant's intrinsic ability expected to be expressed in isolation, and social phenotype, determined by game theory-guided interactions between the plant and other members. 3. We implemented the new model into a competition experiment by pairwise growing 116 recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis. Most QTLs detected from this experiment reside within biologically meaningful genes, including SCL6, CAR6, CLPB1, ALDH5F1, and EMB2217, which may mediate competitive interactions in unique ways. The new model can chart more detailed genetic architecture of plant community structure and diversity by extracting the genetic effects of QTLs on social phenotypes. 4. Our model lays the groundwork for predicting and managing dynamic relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning from co-species genotypes.","[Jiang, Libo; Shi, Chaozhong; Ye, Meixia; Xi, Feifei; Cao, Yige; Wang, Lina; Zhang, Miaomiao; Sang, Mengmeng; Wu, Rongling] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Ctr Computat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Rongling] Penn State Univ, Ctr Stat Genet, Hershey, PA 16801 USA","Wu, RL (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Ctr Computat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Wu, RL (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Ctr Stat Genet, Hershey, PA 16801 USA.",rwu@bjfu.edu.cn,,"Wu, Rongling/0000-0002-2334-6421","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015ZCQ-SW-06, BLX2015]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31700576, 31600536]; State Administration of Forestry of China [201404102]; One-thousand Person Plan","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2015ZCQ-SW-06 and BLX2015; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31700576 and 31600536; State Administration of Forestry of China, Grant/Award Number: 201404102; One-thousand Person Plan",,89,3,3,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

In recent years, the incorporation of lower levels of organization to the understanding of population ecology, has led to an increase in interest for animal personality and individual foraging specialization. Despite these topics investigating comparable phenomena, that is, individual consistency in behaviour and in food resource use respectively, they have rarely been investigated together. 2. Food resource use is thought to be at the interface between personality and life history. More explorative individuals in a population, for example, are thought to increase encounter rates with food resources and consequently have faster growth than less explorative conspecifics. 3. Such hypotheses have so far only received partial support, and the link between personality and life history is increasingly speculated to be plastic and dependent on spatio-temporal variation in ecological conditions. Intraspecific competition and/or predation risk, for example are known to influence foraging specialization. 4. Here, we investigated the relationship between exploration personality of juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris (measured in captivity) and foraging habitat use (high risk vs. low risk; measured via stable isotope analysis in the field) in relation to conspecific and predator abundance. 5. We identified predator abundance as the main driver for the association between foraging habitat and exploration personality. When predators were less abundant, increased exploration was associated with foraging in riskier habitats. When predator abundance increased, an inverse relationship occurred, with less explorative individuals using more dangerous habitat. 6. We conclude that the relationship between personality and resource use is plastic and context dependent, which could explain the inconclusive results of previous studies investigating links between personality and life history.

The processes of selection and competition can have substantial effects on prey population dynamics, but are rarely studied simultaneously. Moreover, field studies of predator-induced short-term selection pressures on prey populations are scarce. Here we report measurements of density dependence in body composition in a bivalve prey (edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule) during bouts of intense predation by an avian predator (Red Knot, Calidris canutus). We measured densities, patchiness, morphology, and body composition (shell and flesh mass) of cockles in a quasi-experimental setting, i.e., before and after predation in three similar plots of 1 ha each, two of which experienced predation, and one of which remained unvisited in the course of the short study period and served as a reference. An individual's shell and flesh mass declined with cockle density (negative density dependence). Before predation, cockles were patchily distributed. After predation, during which densities were reduced by 78% (from 232 to 50 cockles/m(2)), the patchiness was substantially reduced, i.e., the spatial distribution was homogenized. Red Knots selected juvenile cockles with an average length of 6.9 +/- 1.0 mm (mean +/- SD). Cockles surviving predation had heavier shells than before predation (an increase of 21.5 percentage points), but similar flesh masses. By contrast, in the reference plot shell mass did not differ statistically between initial and final sampling occasions, while flesh mass was larger (an increase of 13.2 percentage points). In this field study, we show that Red Knots imposed a strong selection pressure on cockles to grow fast with thick shells and little flesh mass, with selection gradients among the highest reported in the literature.","[Bijleveld, Allert I.; Twietmeyer, Soenke; Piechocki, Julia; van Gils, Jan A.; Piersma, Theunis] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; [Twietmeyer, Soenke] Univ Trier, Dept Biogeog, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Piersma, Theunis] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Anim Ecol Grp, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","Bijleveld, AI (corresponding author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Ecol, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands.",allert.bijleveld@gmail.com,"Bijleveld, Allert Imre/J-4134-2017; van Gils, Jan/B-5544-2008","Bijleveld, Allert Imre/0000-0002-3159-8944; van Gils, Jan/0000-0002-4132-8243; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X",NIOZ; Waddenfonds [WF 209925]; NWO-VIDINetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [864.09.002],"We thank Ewout Adriaans for transport to Griend, Dirk de Boer and Peter van Tellingen for provisioning us on Griend, and 'Natuurmonumenten' for allowing us access to Griend.

Small (juvenile) pumpkinseeds feed primarily on soft-bodied littoral invertebrates and compete with small bluegill (L. macrochirus), while large (adult) pumpkinseeds feed extensively on snails. We compared pumpkinseed and snail populations in two Michigan lakes that contain bluegill (Three Lakes II and Three Lakes III) with populations inhabiting Wintergreen Lake, a lake lacking bluegill. In the absence of bluegill, pumpkinseeds were abundant and juveniles grew well; however, snail abundances were low and adult pumpkinseeds grew poorly. Furthermore, no ontogenetic diet shift to snails occurred in Wintergreen Lake, and the pharyngeal muscles and bones used to crush snails were smaller than in fish from Three Lakes II. Pumpkinseeds from Wintergreen Lake also required significantly more time to crush and handle thick-shelled snails, but not thin-shelled snails and nongastropod prey, than did fish from Three Lakes II. In a field caging experiment in Wintergreen Lake snail densities increased fourfold when pumpkinseeds were excluded. Historical data as well as the among-lake comparisons-suggest that the changes in Wintergreen Lake occurred in response to the selective elimination of the pumpkinseed's juvenile-stage competitor, the bluegill, via a winterkill event in the late 1970s. It appears that removal of bluegill released juvenile pumpkinseeds from competition and increased pumpkinseed recruitment into the adult stage, which resulted in the overexploitation of the adults' snail resource.

Such costs are generated by invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois spp.) that further threaten already stressed coral reefs in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. This brief review documents rapid range expansion and potential impacts of lionfish. In addition, preliminary experimental data from targeted removals contribute to debates about maintenance management. Removals at sites off Little Cayman Island shifted the size frequency distribution of remaining lionfish toward smaller individuals whose stomachs contained less prey and fewer fish. Fewer lionfish and decreased predation on threatened grouper, herbivores and other economically and ecologically important fishes represent key steps toward protecting reefs. However, complete evaluation of success requires long-term data detailing immigration and recruitment by lionfish, compensatory growth and reproduction of lionfish, reduced direct effects on prey assemblages, and reduced indirect effects mediated by competition for food. Preventing introductions is the best way to avoid impacts from invasive species, and early detection linked to rapid response ranks second. Nevertheless, results from this case study suggest that targeted removals represent a viable option for shifting direct impacts of invasive lionfish away from highly vulnerable components of ecosystems.","[Frazer, Thomas K.; Edwards, Morgan A.; Barry, Savanna C.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jacoby, Charles A.] Univ Florida, Soil & Water Sci Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Manfrino, Carrie M.] Kean Univ, Dept Geol & Meteorol, Union, NJ USA; [Manfrino, Carrie M.] Cent Caribbean Marine Inst, Princeton, NJ USA","Frazer, TK (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, POB 110600, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",frazer@ufl.edu,"Jacoby, Charles/D-5608-2013; Manfrino, Carrie/F-7588-2013","Jacoby, Charles/0000-0002-5948-3241; Manfrino, Carrie/0000-0002-3129-9629; Barry, Savanna/0000-0002-8743-4383",Cayman Islands Department of Environment,"All activities complied with local governmental regulations, and approvals by review boards or ethics committees were not required because removals were organized and performed by local dive masters and volunteers who allowed access to their fish.

Great Tits occupied nest boxes regardless of the number of House Sparrows breeding in the vicinity. During the second part of the breeding season, the percentage of successful Great Tit pairs was negatively correlated with the occupation of nest boxes by the House Sparrows, in both the large- and small-entrance nest boxes. More Great Tit pairs bred and more young were fledged in the small- than large-entrance nest boxes. Great Tits occupied more large-entrance nest boxes during the first than the second part of the breeding season. This difference was probably due to House Sparrows occupying more large-entrance nest boxes during the second than first part of the breeding season. 74 % of the large-entrance nest boxes in which Great Tits built nests in both the first and second parts of the season were later occupied by House Sparrows. Great Tits preferred large-entrance nest boxes in the fall, when House Sparrows use only a few boxes for roosting, but not for breeding. The findings indicate that Great Tits are subject to interspecific competition with House Sparrows for nesting cavities, the intensity of which varies during the breeding season and is higher during the second part when more House Sparrows breed.","[Charter, Motti; Leshem, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Charter, Motti] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",charterm@post.tau.ac.il,"Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021; Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356; Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",,,,41,9,10,1,44,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Multiple regressions with data collected on 11 occasions on fixed back-reef and fore-reef sites suggested that the densities of the congener, other crevice-dwellers, and predators did not significantly affect the density of P. argus in either reef zone, or of P. guttatus on the back-reef, where coexistence of both lobster species was greatest. In contrast, there was a significant negative relationship between predators and the density of P. guttatus on the fore-reef, where this species was dominant. Congeneric cohabitation in dens was less than expected by chance, but this pattern may reflect a differential use of shelter resources rather than interspecific competition. P. guttatus was more prevalent in dens over the middle and upper third of the reef profile, and P. argus over the lower and middle third of the reef profile. Whether individuals cohabited with conspecifics, congeners, or resided solitarily, P. guttatus was more prevalent at the walls and/or ceiling and P. argus on the floor of dens. This differential use of shelter resources may be related to the differential vulnerability to predators, which may have promoted local coexistence of these congeners in reef habitats.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Cancun 77500, Mexico","Lozano-Alvarez, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, PO Box 1152, Cancun 77500, Mexico.",elozano@mar.icmyl.unam.mx,"Fourzan, Patricia Briones/AAD-4736-2020","Briones-Fourzan, Patricia/0000-0003-4096-1415",,,,69,19,19,2,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,JUN,2007,26,2,,,,,361,373,,10.1007/s00338-007-0207-0,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,179RF,WOS:000247307100019,,,,,2021-09-27,

The recent detection of this species in the Bogota plateau of Colombia raised the interest to investigate details about the biology of this new population and evaluate its potential as a biological control agent for use in that country against Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thripidae), the western flower thrips. The objective of this study was to evaluate experimentally the biological characteristics of the Colombian population of G. aculeifer and its predation capacity on F. occidentalis, as well as the possibility to use a factitious prey for its mass production or as complementary food in predator field releases. The study was conducted with three diets: F. occidentalis (T), Aleuroglyphus ovatus (A), and A. ovatus + F. occidentalis (TA), in a randomized design experiment using G. aculeifer females. Predation rate was about 2.6 pre-pupae/pupae of F. occidentalis/female/day when only thrips was available as prey, reducing to 2.0 when thrips was combined with A. ovatus. Oviposition was the same when fed each of those prey and their combination (2.5-2.9 eggs/female/day). Some differences between diets were observed for duration of some periods of the life cycle, but no differences were observed for life table parameters. The greatest differences observed between this population and what has been reported for other populations of the same predator (evaluated when feeding other prey) refer to duration of deutonymphal period and R-o (respectively longer and higher in the former). It is concluded that the Colombian population is able to feed, develop, and reproduce on pre-pupae and pupae of F. occidentalis and that A. ovatus can be used for its small scale mass production and as a complementary diet in predator field releases.","[Rueda-Ramirez, Diana; de Moraes, Gilberto J.] Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Dept Entomol & Acarol, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Rios-Malaver, Diana] Corp Univ Minuto Dios UNIMINUTO, Ctr Reg Zipaquira, Ingn Agroecol, Fac Ingn, Av 15 N 1-22 Sur Barrio La Fraguita, Zipaquira, Colombia; [Rueda-Ramirez, Diana; Rios-Malaver, Diana; Varela-Ramirez, Amanda] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Biol, Unidad Ecol & Sistemat UNESIS, Lab Ecol Suelos & Hongos Trop, Carrera 7 43-82,Bldg 53,Lab 406B, Bogota, DC, Colombia","Rueda-Ramirez, D (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Dept Entomol & Acarol, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.; Rueda-Ramirez, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Biol, Unidad Ecol & Sistemat UNESIS, Lab Ecol Suelos & Hongos Trop, Carrera 7 43-82,Bldg 53,Lab 406B, Bogota, DC, Colombia.",dianarue@usp.br,"Rueda-Ramirez, Diana/AAQ-5662-2020","Rueda-Ramirez, Diana/0000-0002-7642-2256","COLCIENCIAS (Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion, Colombia)Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias [617-2013]; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana-COLCIENCIAS-SENA (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, Colombia) through the program JOVENES INVESTIGADORES E INNOVADORES EN ALIANZA SENA [738-2015]","To COLCIENCIAS (Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion, Colombia) for the scholarship to the first author (Process No. 617-2013, Chapter 3) and the agreement Pontificia Universidad Javeriana-COLCIENCIAS-SENA (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, Colombia) for the support to the second author through the program JOVENES INVESTIGADORES E INNOVADORES EN ALIANZA SENA (Process 738-2015).

Our analysis of field-derived data showed clear spatiotemporal partitioning of shell microhabitats by epizoic algae with different degrees of resource specialization. As a substrate-specializing, obligate epizoic alga,Pseudocladophora conchopheriaoccupied wider micro-niches on the host of different sizes than facultative epizoic algae (encrusting rhodophytes, crustoseCorallinaandGelidium). WhilePseudocladophorademonstrated uniform use of all shell microhabitats on hosts of all sizes, crustoseCorallinaandGelidiumshowed more varied microhabitat use with shifting positions on hosts of different sizes. Furthermore, in addition to slight differences in microhabitat use, crustoseCorallinaandGelidiumdemonstrated differences in their interspecific relationship withPseudocladophora. Our generalized linear models (GLM) analyses indicated that the occurrence/abundance of crustoseCorallinawas negatively affected byPseudocladophorabut that ofGelidiumwas positively affected, whilePseudocladophoraappeared to be competitively inferior to both rhodophytes when they co-occurred on hosts of relatively large sizes. The present study, therefore, points to variable niche partitioning among algae even on a small spatial scale, which may result from complex interactions between spatio-temporal substrate heterogeneity on a live host and interspecific interactions.","[Osawa, Yumiko; Tokeshi, Mutsunori] Kyushu Univ, Amakusa Marine Biol Lab, Kumamoto, Japan","Osawa, Y (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Amakusa Marine Biol Lab, Reiho Ku, Kumamoto 8632507, Japan.",yumosa@ambl-ku.jp,,,Tokyo Institute of Technology [28-148]; Japan Science Society [28-750],"Tokyo Institute of Technology, Grant/Award Number: Research grant (No. 28-148); Japan Science Society, Grant/Award Number: Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant (No. 28-750)",,57,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

The few long-term studies of common eider breeding ecology indicate that reproductive success is low in most years, interrupted by occasional boom years. However, no study has explicitly examined the drivers of long-term variation in reproductive success. Here, we use encounter history data collected across 41years to examine the effects of arctic foxes (a terrestrial nest predator), local abundance and spatial distribution of lesser snow geese (an alternative prey source), and spring climate on common eider nest success. Eider nest success declined over the course of the study, but was also highly variable across years. Our results supported the hypothesis that the long-term decline in eider nest success was caused by apparent competition with lesser snow geese, mediated by shared predators. This effect persisted even following a large-scale exodus of nesting geese from the eider colony. Nest success was also lowest in years of low arctic fox index, presumably driven by prey switching in years of low small mammal availability. However, increased snow goose abundance appeared to buffer this effect through prey swamping. The effect of spring climate depended on the stage of the breeding season; cold and wet and warm and dry conditions in early spring were correlated with decreased nest success, whereas warm and wet conditions in late spring increased eider nest success. These results underscore the significance of both trophic interactions and climate in regulating highly variable vital rates, which likely have important consequences for population dynamics and the conservation of long-lived iteroparous species.","[Iles, David T.; Koons, David.

The objects of the investigations were six species of Cladocera (Sida crystallina, Daphnia magna, Simocephalus vetulus, Daphnia longispina, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, and Ceriodaphnia reticulata). The experiments were run in the laboratory conditions and using computer simulation. Threshold food concentration was used as a measure of the competitive ability of the crustaceans. This parameter was considered to affect a success of alien species settlement in a new environment. In the laboratory conditions, invasions of alien species were simulated by introducing them into the culture with other species every 10 days at two different levels of food renewal under the pressure of predator and without it. The laboratory experiments lasted for 55 days. The abundance dynamics of crustaceans in the computer experiments was observed for 500 days. At the low level of food supply, the superior competitor C. reticulata prevailed; at the high level, the largest species S. vetulus predominated. Thus, such parameter as the competitive ability estimated as a threshold food concentration can influence the success of invasions only during long periods of food depletion and at the low level of food supply. At the higher level of food supply, other factors, such as the higher fecundity of large species as compared to that in small ones, may provide the advantage in species abundance.","[Feniova, I.

Here, we compared von Bertalanffy growth parameters of four independent nine-spined stickleback populations reared in a common laboratory environment: two coastal marine (typical size) and two pond (giant size) populations. We found that both pond populations had larger estimated final size than marine populations, which in turn exhibited higher intrinsic growth rates than the pond populations. Female growth strategies were more divergent among marine and pond populations than those of males. Asymptotic body size and intrinsic growth rate were strongly negatively correlated. Hence, pond versus marine populations exhibited different growth strategies along a continuum. Our data suggest that quick maturation-even with the cost of being small (low fecundity)-is favoured in marine environments. On the contrary, growth to a giant final size (high fecundity)-even if it entails extended growth period-is favoured in ponds. We suggest that the absence (ponds) versus presence (marine environment) of sympatric predatory fish species, and the consequent change in the importance of intraspecific competition are responsible for the divergence in growth strategies. The sex-dependence of the patterns further emphasizes the role of females in the body size divergence in the species. Possible alternative hypotheses are also discussed.","[Herczeg, Gabor; Gonda, Abigel; Kuparinen, Anna; Merila, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Herczeg, G (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biosci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",gabor.herczeg@helsinki.fi,"Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Herczeg, Gabor/AAZ-1661-2021; Herczeg, Gabor/AAF-9978-2020","Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X; ",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Center of Internal Mobility (CIMO),"We thank Victor Berger, Goran Englund, Tuomas Leinonen, Daniel Lussetti, and Pirkko Siikamaki for their help in organising and executing field sampling.

Few studies have examined predator restoration on islands or in ecosanctuaries, where highly endemic faunas have typically undergone precipitous declines and extinctions due to novel invasive predators, and translocations are used to restore species. Currently in New Zealand, discussions regarding predators typically focus on introduced mammalian pests, and the importance of native predators is frequently overlooked. We present a case study of the mesopredatory New Zealand weka (Gallirallus australis), a threatened flightless rail that provokes controversy among restoration practitioners due to concerns that it may decrease populations of other threatened species. We (1) review studies of weka diet and impacts on native and exotic fauna; (2) contrast prehistoric and contemporary predation webs focused on weka; and (3) consider the role of biocultural approaches in the management and restoration of socio-ecological systems with weka. Weka are opportunistic omnivores that can include vertebrates in their diet, and on small islands where weka can reach high densities there is some evidence that they may limit some prey populations. However, very few manipulative experimental studies measuring effects of weka on native species have been carried out, and such studies would be extremely valuable. Weka also consume invasive rodents and, if they obtain a sufficiently high density, may provide benefits in ecosanctuaries by limiting invasive mice populations. Maori historically harvested weka, and such harvest may now valuably limit weka numbers at certain island or ecosanctuary sites, perhaps replacing the effect of extinct avian competitors and apex predators. How weka and other native predators should be managed on islands depends on the value placed on ecosystem restoration, species-focused conservation, or biocultural enrichment.","[Carpenter, Joanna K.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Innes, John G.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Wood, Jamie R.; Lyver, Phil O'B] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Carpenter, JK (corresponding author), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin, New Zealand.",carpenterj@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Wood, Jamie/AAU-5530-2021; Wood, Jamie/A-9393-2008","Carpenter, Jo/0000-0001-7666-2439; Wood, Jamie/0000-0001-8008-6083",Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research Science Den Fund; MBIE's Science and Innovation Group Strategic Science Investment Funding for Crown Research Institutes,"We thank Ralph Powlesland, Rod Morris, Alan Tennyson, Graeme Elliott, and Peter Gaze for stimulating discussions around weka, and many people for supplying unpublished reports.

However, there is no consensus regarding the mechanisms involved, especially in amphibians. At the intraspecific level, different approximations and hypotheses have addressed this problem, but no study has integrated information at different spatio-temporal ecological and (phylo) genetic scales whilst considering differences between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms involved in geographical body size variation in the Iberian newt (Lissotriton boscai), accounting for the main hypotheses potentially explaining variation in this phenotypic trait in amphibians. Location Iberian Peninsula. Methods We used a novel multivariate technique (partial least squares regression) that accounts for interdependence amongst variables whilst allowing for the inclusion of multiple local and macroscale predictors. We considered intraspecific genetic differentiation including information from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in populations representative of the species' distribution. We addressed causal hypotheses of heat conservation, temperature-related development, water and food availability, seasonality, competition and predation. Results Annual primary productivity and intraspecific competition were of greatest relevance to explain body size variation in females, whilst seasonality of primary productivity was more important in males. Differences between sexes are interpreted based on previous experiments on the behavioural ecology of this species. Main conclusions This study shows that sex-dependent implications of competition for food drive geographical body size variation in an urodele amphibian, supporting the density-resource hypothesis. Our results suggest that food availability, conspecific density and competition are important in explaining intraspecific body size variation in amphibians. This study highlights how selecting model species with an experimental background can help interpret geographical variation in phenotypic traits. We emphasize the value of simultaneously considering alternative hypotheses of phenotypic variation at different ecological and (phylo) genetic spatio-temporal scales in revealing potentially hidden relationships.","[Penalver-Alcazar, Miguel; Aragon, Pedro] CSIC, MNCN, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Martinez-Solano, Inigo; Sequeira, Fernando] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agrario Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Martinez-Solano, Inigo] CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, EBD, Ave Americo Vespucio,S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Martinez-Solano, Inigo] CSIC, MNCN, Dept Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain","Penalver-Alcazar, M (corresponding author), CSIC, MNCN, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain.",miguel.penalver@mncn.csic.es,"Sequeira, Fernando/C-3119-2012; Martinez-Solano, Inigo/C-7179-2008; Aragon, Pedro/B-2598-2009","Sequeira, Fernando/0000-0003-0740-7981; Martinez-Solano, Inigo/0000-0002-2260-226X; Aragon, Pedro/0000-0002-6849-7274; Penalver-Alcazar, Miguel/0000-0002-7449-4862","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF, NSRF); Spanish Severo Ochoa Program [SEV-2012-0262]; FEDER (COMPETE)European Commission [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006821]; Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [UID/BIA/50027/2013]; 'Ramon y Cajal' (MINECO) [RYC-2011-07670]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [CGL2014-56416-P, CGL2016-78070-P]; regional Spanish authorities [2013/001627, EP/CYL/57/2013, JML/jml, DGMEN/SEN/avp_13_010_aut, SGYB/AFR/FJRH-17/13, JPG/jmca, CN0002/13/ACA, 002/2013]; ICN from Portugal [2879/2013/DRNCN/DGEFF]","We thank the editor and three anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

However, the indirect effects of such biological interactions are poorly known because of the difficulties in measuring predation risk in nature. We addressed this issue by assessing the effect of asymmetrical competition among brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and two superior non-piscivorous competitors, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and white sucker (Catostomus commersonii), on the predation risk of a brook trout prey, northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos). We determined the spatio-temporal patterns of relative predation risk of dace with tethering experiments in 11 lakes containing either only brook trout and dace (n = 5), or brook trout, dace, chub, and sucker (n = 6). The diel pattern of the relative predation risk and the overall relative predation risk of dace were not significantly different in lakes with or without brook trout competitors. However, we observed a significant shift in the relative predation risk from the lower pelagic to the upper pelagic and littoral zones in the presence of brook trout competitors. This study highlights the fact that the outcome of interactions can vary in space and that care should be used when extrapolating the results of small-scale experiments or coarse-scale estimates to the whole ecosystem.","[Dupuch, Angelique; Bertolo, Andrea; Magnan, Pierre] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Interact Bassins Versants Ecosyst Aquat, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Dill, Lawrence M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Evolutionary & Behav Ecol Res Grp, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Dupuch, A (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",angelique.dupuch@uqo.ca,"Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019","Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163; Bertolo, Andrea/0000-0002-6018-816X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"We thank Julie Adams, Maryse Blanchette, Come Garceau, Annie Jacob, Kathy-Andree Laplante-Albert, Maxime Leveille, Rachel Massicotte, Aurore Perot, Daniel Pouliot, Raphael Proulx, Evelyne Roy, and Sylvain Theleme for their assistance at various stages of this research as well as Daniel Boisclair, Laure Devine, and Jim Grant for their comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Specifically, mast production and acorn weevil (Curculio L., 1758) occupancy were estimated annually from 2006 to 2008 for individual host trees in a sample of 74 northern red oaks (Quercus rubra L.), 100 white oaks (Quercus alba L.), and 81 shagbark hickories (Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch) in west-central Indiana, USA. Occupancy and vital rates of nine Curculio species on their primary host-tree species were derived using multispecies, multiseason (MSMS) models within a Bayesian framework, accounting for imperfect detection. Mast production of host trees had a strong positive effect on community-level occupancy and survival of Curculio. Mast production varied considerably between years and generally was spatially autocorrelated only at distances <2 km, which likely reduced interspecific resource competition. Derived estimates of mean weevil species richness per tree and community similarity were highest in 2007 when mast production on all host-tree species was in phase. Generalist species compensated for lower survival rate on secondary hosts with higher colonization rates on these hosts during a year of mast failure in the primary host. We hypothesize that differential suitability of hosts as resources for Curculio created a spatial storage effect that, when coupled with a temporal storage effect induced by prolonged diapause common among Curculio, facilitated species coexistence. Methodologically, increased precision of parameter estimates from MSMS models makes it generally more useful than single-species models in studies of community dynamics.","[Govindan, Byju N.; Swihart, Robert K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Govindan, BN (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, LJ Smith 211,POB 646120, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",byju.ng@wsu.edu,"Swihart, Robert K/D-2787-2016; Govindan, Byju N./J-7665-2015","Govindan, Byju N./0000-0001-8126-1445","James S.

Here, we sought to determine the abundance and infectivity of prophages ofKlebsiellato understand how the interactions between induced prophages and bacteria affect population dynamics and evolution. We identified many prophages in the species, placing these taxa among the top 5% of the most polylysogenic bacteria. We selected 35 representative strains of theKlebsiella pneumoniaespecies complex to establish a network of induced phage-bacteria interactions. This revealed that many prophages are able to enter the lytic cycle, and subsequently kill or lysogenize closely relatedKlebsiellastrains. Although 60% of the tested strains could produce phages that infect at least one other strain, the interaction network of all pairwise cross-infections is very sparse and mostly organized in modules corresponding to the strains' capsule serotypes. Accordingly, capsule mutants remain uninfected showing that the capsule is a key factor for successful infections. Surprisingly, experiments in which bacteria are predated by their own prophages result in accelerated loss of the capsule. Our results show that phage infectiousness defines interaction modules between small subsets of phages and bacteria in function of capsule serotype. This limits the role of prophages as competitive weapons because they can infect very few strains of the species complex. This should also restrict phage-driven gene flow across the species. Finally, the accelerated loss of the capsule in bacteria being predated by their own phages, suggests that phages drive serotype switch in nature.","[de Sousa, Jorge A.

Functional response models often assume homogenous prey size and size-independent feeding rates. However, variation in prey size due to ontogeny and competition is ubiquitous, and predation rates are often size dependent. Thus, functional responses that ignore prey size may not effectively predict predation rates through ontogeny or in heterogeneous populations. Here, we use short-term response-surface experiments and statistical modeling to develop and test prey size-dependent functional responses for water bugs and dragonfly larvae feeding on red-eyed treefrog tadpoles. We then extend these models through simulations to predict mortality through time for growing prey. Both conventional and size-dependent functional response models predicted average overall mortality in short-term mixed-cohort experiments, but only the size-dependent models accurately captured how mortality was spread across sizes. As a result, simulations that extrapolated these results through prey ontogeny showed that differences in size-specific mortality are compounded as prey grow, causing predictions from conventional and size-dependent functional response models to diverge dramatically through time. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating prey size when modeling consumer-prey dynamics in size-structured, growing prey populations.","[McCoy, Michael W.; Vonesh, James R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [McCoy, Michael W.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bolker, Benjamin M.] McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Warkentin, Karen M.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Warkentin, Karen M.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama","McCoy, MW (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",anura@ufl.edu,"; Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","McCoy, Michael/0000-0002-7993-6236; Warkentin, Karen/0000-0002-7804-800X; Bolker, Benjamin/0000-0002-2127-0443; Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716923, DEB-0717220, IGERT-0801544]; Boston University; Virginia Commonwealth University; STRISmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute","We thank the Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente de Panama for permission to conduct this research in Panama (permiso no.

Here, I document the functional response of semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) foraging on a burrowing amphipod Corophium volutator during three field seasons at the peak of fall migration in the upper Bay of Fundy (New Brunswick, Canada). I gathered data during the ebbing tide when all sandpipers are highly motivated to feed after a lengthy hide-tide fast. As birds follow the receding tideline, foragers encounter prey at different densities and do not aggregate in the richest food patches. Results show that intake rate increased at a decreasing rate with Corophium density, yielding a type II functional response typical of many shorebird species. Intake rate decreased in the later stages of migration stopover at a time where preferred prey items have been shown to occur at lower densities due to prior depletion. At this period of lower prey availability, intake rate also decreased with sandpiper density providing evidence for interference at low prey density. The results illustrate the fact that the functional response may not be unique but instead vary as a function of the type of competitive relationship among foragers.","Univ Montreal, Fac Vet Med, St Hyacinthe, PQ J2S 7C6, Canada","Beauchamp, G (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Fac Vet Med, POB 5000, St Hyacinthe, PQ J2S 7C6, Canada.",guy.beauchamp@umontreal.ca,,,,,,31,8,8,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2009,161,3,,,,,651,655,,10.1007/s00442-009-1398-6,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,483YT,WOS:000269010300019,19543917,,,,2021-09-27,

It was found that for spiders with larger bodies, from the families Lycosidae and Philodromidae, the peak of their activity was in the afternoon, and smaller spiders belonging to the families Linyphiidae and Tetragnathidae showed the greatest activity in the morning. Species Pardosa palustris and Xerolycosa miniata were dominant spiders of the studied grassland. The time of their highest did activity was different by several hours. It was observed that P. palustris individuals were more numerous in that habitat in early June and X. miniata spiders from mid-June.

Steps to formulating statistical models on the dynamics of populations and assemblages are discussed. Current models are mostly conceptual (similar to 70% of studies surveyed), falling into 2 main classes: population dynamics (including recruitment, mortality, dispersal and availability of patches) and process-orientated studies (including the response of individuals to the physical environment, biogenic habitat modification, biological interactions and physical perturbations). Most recent studies were descriptive or on the population dynamics of species and were undertaken mostly at spatial scales of up to 1 km and temporal scales of months. The development of statistical models appears to be impeded by the limited scope of studies, an over-emphasis on conceptual models (but recognizing an important role for a rigorous experiment framework) and a difficulty in using outcomes from small-scale processes at the level of individual organisms to predict larger scale outcomes where many interactions contribute to variation in abundances. Currently, few studies undertake field assessments of the defining characteristics of habitats, the dynamics of those habitats and the relative importance of different habitats to individual populations. Much urgent work is required to develop large scale (space: > 1 km; time: > 1 years) statistical models. This is because attention needs to be given to those interactions and processes in the ecological systems that will provide for the greatest reduction in uncertainty in the quantitative predictions derived from these models.","Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia; Deakin Univ, Sch Aquat Sci & Nat Resources Management, Warrnambool, Vic 3280, Australia","Constable, AJ (corresponding author), Australian Antarctic Div, Channel Highway, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,211,94,99,1,38,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

During an 8-year field study in the Bahamas, we examined selective mortality on size and growth throughout the entire reef-associated life phase of a common coral-reef fish, Stegastes partitus (the bicolour damselfish). On average, faster-growing juveniles experienced greater mortality, though as adults, larger individuals had higher survival. Comparing patterns of selection observed at four separate populations revealed that greater population density was associated with stronger selection for larger adult size. Large adults may be favoured because they are superior competitors and less susceptible to gape-limited predators. Laboratory experiments suggested that selective mortality of fast-growing juveniles was likely because of risk-prone foraging behaviour. These patterns suggest that variation in ecological interactions may lead to complex patterns of lifetime selection on body size.","[Johnson, D. W.; Hixon, M.

We evaluated the effects of interactions with the larvae from unisexual salamander (Ambystoma laterale-complex) populations on blue-spotted (A. laterale) and small-mouthed salamander (A. texanum) larvae. We coupled observations in natural ponds with mesocosm and laboratory approaches to investigate the roles of competition, predation, microhabitat partitioning, and behavior on the coexistence of these populations. Unisexual salamander larvae increased mortality, reduced growth, and were observed to attack and bite small-mouthed and blue-spotted salamander larvae in mesocosms. Unisexual larvae were competitively superior to blue-spotted salamander larvae, but competitively equal to small-mouthed salamander larvae. Laboratory experiments confirmed field observations that both species increased their use of refuges in the presence of unisexual larvae and that this behavior resulted in niche partitioning. Blue-spotted salamander larvae were less active in the presence of unisexuals; however, small-mouthed larvae increased activity and use of refuges in the presence of larger intraguild predators. The hypothesis that microhabitat partitioning and altered activities minimize the effects of competition and predation was supported.","St Joseph Coll, Dept Biol, Rensselaer, IN 47978 USA","Brodman, R (corresponding author), St Joseph Coll, Dept Biol, Rensselaer, IN 47978 USA.",bobb@saintjoe.edu,,,,,,35,9,9,0,18,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,LAWRENCE,"C/O ALLEN PRESS, PO BOX 7065, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0018-0831,1938-5099,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,JUN,2007,63,2,,,,,135,143,,10.1655/0018-0831(2007)63[135:HBASSL]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Zoology,Zoology,169YP,WOS:000246628300002,,,,,2021-09-27,

We assessed tree seed consumption by rodents under two different scenarios: (i) We documented in field spatio-temporal patterns of seed predation by native rodents on two exotic tree species, Gleditsia triacanthos or honey locust' and Robinia pseudoacacia or white locust' (family Leguminosae), in five grassland habitats of the Inland Pampa, Argentina. (ii) We conducted laboratory feeding trials to evaluate tree seed consumption in the presence (cafeteria-style feeding trials) and in the absence (non-choice feeding trials) of alternative food supplies. Seed predation was generally higher for Robinia than for Gleditsia seeds, both in field and laboratory conditions. For both tree species, seed predation varied between habitats and seasons and was higher in the native tussock grassland than in the remaining studied communities, whereas the crop field showed the lowest levels of consumption along with the absence of captured rodents. Seed consumption of Gleditsia and Robinia among the four grassland communities (which did not differ in rodent abundance) was negatively associated with the availability of alternative food. Laboratory feeding trials showed a higher consumption of Gleditsia seeds in the non-choice than in the cafeteria-style feeding trials, while the consumption of Robinia seeds did not differ in the absence or presence of alternative seeds. These patterns indicate that the contribution of resident granivores to invasion resistance might depend on colonizer species identity, recipient community type and season of the year. We suggest that rodent preferences for different invader seeds will interact with the availability of alternative food in the local habitat in influencing the amount of predator-mediated biotic resistance to invasion.","[Muschetto, Emiliano; Cueto, Gerardo R.; Busch, Maria] Univ Buenos Aires IEGEBA CONICET, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Mazia, Noemi] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Catedra Dason, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Muschetto, E (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires IEGEBA CONICET, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 2,C1428EHA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",emuschetto@hotmail.com,,"CUETO, GERARDO/0000-0001-8230-8874",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y tecnicasConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad de Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires,We thank the staff at the 'Estancia San Claudio' and Administracion de Campos (UBA) for logistic support.

Squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, and C. apella form ubiquitous interspecific associations, but the reason remains debatable. With a large biogeographic field study, we tested the degree to which the distribution and abundance of Cebus and S. sciureus is determined by habitat type, fruit availability, and geography (i.e., determinants of the fundamental niche) relative to interspecific interactions, such as competition and facilitation (i.e., the realized niche). We used the competition between the two capuchin monkeys as a natural experiment that subjected S. sciureus to C. apella and C. olivaceus treatments'. Using spatial regression models and principal components analysis, we found that S. sciureus was associated with seasonally flooded forests, and was correlated with fruit abundance and diversity (fundamental niche), but was also correlated with C. apella density even when accounting for habitat and fruit availability (realized niche). Saimiri sciureus density was unrelated to C. olivaceus density. Cebus apella was associated with a variety of forest types, but particularly included disturbed and edge habitats such as logged forests, seasonally flooded forests, and upland savanna, in addition to mature forest. Cebus apella was also positively correlated with S. sciureus density and negatively correlated with the density of C. olivaceus. In contrast, C. olivaceus avoided riparian areas and was associated with mixed-height forests on sloped mountainous terrain. In sum, interspecific interactions such as competition between species of Cebus and facilitation between C. apella and S. sciureus were as important as habitat and fruit availability in determining the distribution and abundance of these primates.","[Levi, Taal] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Levi, Taal] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Silvius, Kirsten M.] Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Oliveira, Luiz F.

Facilitation of recruitment by 'nurse' plants can play a major role in harsh environments. Yet the extent to which consumer-mediated apparent competition from habitat-forming plants may counteract facilitative interactions remains largely unexplored. 2. We examined whether seedling predation by tenebrionid beetles seeking refuge under nurse shrubs may prevent tree recruitment facilitation in a Patagonian steppe-woodland ecotone. Newly emerged seedlings of Austrocedrus chilensis were planted in shrub canopy, off-shrub shelter and bare soil microsites, and monitored for causes of early mortality and for overall survival under ambient and elevated beetle densities. 3. Most seedlings in open microsites died from abiotic stress, whereas shrub cover and artificial shelters decreased desiccation mortality. Herbivory was the main cause of mortality in shrub microsites. Beetle addition increased predation beneath shrubs and in off-shrub shelters, indicating that apparent competition 'spilled over' from shrubs with high insect densities. 4. Litter removal from shrubs prevented seedling predation suggesting that nurse plants altered recruitment by providing food as well as shelter to insects. Herbivory rates did not depend on seedling patch density but decreased with seedling age, with 1-week old plants being most vulnerable to beetle predation. 5. Synthesis. Apparent competition from nurse plants can strongly reduce recruitment facilitation in stressful environments, although weak herbivore density dependence and seedling growth into ontogenetic refuges may limit the strength of apparent competition. An explicit consideration of negative, as well as positive, herbivore-mediated indirect effects from habitat-forming plants would broaden the understanding of community dynamics along stress gradients.","[Chaneton, Enrique J.] Univ Buenos Aires, IFEVA, CONICET, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Noemi Mazia, C.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Prod Vegetal, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Kitzberger, Thomas] Univ Nacl Comahue, CONICET, INIBIOMA, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Chaneton, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, IFEVA, CONICET, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",chaneton@ifeva.edu.ar,"Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y TecnologicaANPCyT [BID 1728-OC-AR, PICT Redes 331, 284]; Universidad de Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires [G-407]; Sigma-Xi Society and Fundacion Antorchas","We thank Guillermo Amico, Norlan Tercero Bucardo, Nicolas Suarez, Baloo Kitzberger and Lucas Garibaldi for valuable field assistance and Gustavo Flores (IADIZA-CONICET) for identifying the beetles.

When different size classes of predators use different habitats, the habitat-specific predation risk for prey may change as prey increase in size due to the size-dependency in predator-prey interactions. 2. To study the effects of predation risk on habitat shifts in growing prey, we used a combination of whole-lake manipulations and field data, covering 5 years from three lakes on (1) body sizes at habitat shifts in young-of-the-year perch (YOY) perch (Perca fluviatilis ) and (2) habitat use and densities of two size classes of cannibals (1 year old and greater than or equal to 2 years old). 3. YOY perch shifted habitat to the pelagic immediately after hatching and exhibited a second shift back to the littoral zone at a size range of 11-30 mm. Cannibalism from 1-year-old perch decreased over time, whereas cannibalism from perch greater than or equal to 2 years old increased over time but did not include early larval stages. The habitat use of 1-year-old perch was restricted to the littoral habitat, whereas perch greater than or equal to 2 years old used both the pelagic and the littoral habitats. 4. Habitat shifts in YOY perch were unrelated to differences in resource levels between the two habitats as YOY perch were either yolk sac feeding (first habitat shift) or had similar foraging gains in both habitats (second habitat shift). 5. The size when YOY perch shifted back to the littoral zone was related positively to the densities of 1-year-old perch, whereas no clear relationship was found between shift size and the density of perch 2 greater than or equal to years old. The latter was suggested to be due to the higher density and the larger variation in densities of 1-year-old perch and that the predation risk from perch greater than or equal to 2 years old was less habitat-specific. 6. Our results suggest that size-dependent habitat use and size specific predation risk evoked by cannibals affect the size when YOY perch shift back to the littoral zone.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquaculture, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquaculture, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",par.bystrom@vabr.slu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,,,,62,66,68,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

A crucial assumption made in such experiments is that the treatment effects are unbiased estimates of the true effects. In this paper we examine how prey movements influence bias in predation experiments with enclosures that allow prey to migrate to and from the surrounding unmanipulated habitat. A mathematical model of a habitat with spatially variable predation intensity was used to analyse how prey movements affect the relationship between treatment effects in predator caging experiments and the effects of predators on the prey populations. Here we define the population effect as the effect on prey population size that would be seen if the density of predators were manipulated in the entire habitat used by the prey population. The model predicts that treatment effects in small scale experiments decrease with prey movement rates, and that population effects increase with prey movement rates. We manipulated the density of benthic feeding sculpins (Cottus gobio) in enclosures for three months during autumn and early winter. Treatment effects were pronounced. Total density of invertebrates as well as the densities of the five most abundant taxa were reduced by more than 50% in cages containing fish. Treatment effects on different taxa were, as predicted, negatively correlated with an index of per capita drift rate. Furthermore, an index of predation rate per prey, used as an indicator of population effects, was positively correlated with the drift rate index. This means that the relationship between the effects found in the experiments and the effects on the prey populations was negative rather than positive as is usually assumed. We conclude that prey movements can cause the effects found in small scale experiments to be severely biased estimates of the population effects of predation on prey populations.",,"Englund, G (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,"Englund, Goran/A-7434-2008","Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602",,,,46,54,55,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,1996,77,3,,,,,519,528,,10.2307/3545941,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WE613,WOS:A1996WE61300016,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, trophic-level interactions, such as mesocarnivore release resulting from intraguild predation, may also be important mediators of cascades. From September 2001 to August 2004, we used spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in wolf distribution and abundance in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to evaluate whether mesopredator release of coyotes ( Canis latrans), resulting from the extirpation of wolves ( Canis lupus), accounts for high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana) fawns observed in some areas. Results of this ecological perturbation in wolf densities, coyote densities, and pronghorn neonatal survival at wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites support the existence of a species-level trophic cascade. That wolves precipitated a trophic cascade was evidenced by fawn survival rates that were four-fold higher at sites used by wolves. A negative correlation between coyote and wolf densities supports the hypothesis that interspecific interactions between the two species facilitated the difference in fawn survival. Whereas densities of resident coyotes were similar between wolf-free and wolf-abundant sites, the abundance of transient coyotes was significantly lower in areas used by wolves. Thus, differential effects of wolves on solitary coyotes may be an important mechanism by which wolves limit coyote densities. Our results support the hypothesis that mesopredator release of coyotes contributes to high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn fawns, and demonstrate the importance of alternative food web pathways in structuring the dynamics of terrestrial systems.","[Berger, Kim Murray] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildlife Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Berger, Kim Murray; Berger, Joel] Univ Montana, No Rockies Field Off, Wildlife Conservat Society, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Gese, Eric M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildlife Resources, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, USDA,Wildlife Serv, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Berger, KM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, No Rockies Field Off, Wildlife Conservat Society, 205 Nat Sci Bldg, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",kberger@wcs.org,"Gese, Eric M/B-4578-2011",,,,,70,122,125,7,228,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2008,89,3,,,,,818,828,,10.1890/07-0193.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,284AS,WOS:000254678200022,18459344,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

This observation has generated several hypotheses. One set of hypotheses suggests that the herbivores are either regulated by predators, social interactions or pathogens, and that the abundant plant biomass is an effect of relatively low herbivore densities and a low grazing pressure. The other set claims that the quality of the bulk of the vegetation is persistently too low to give herbivores positive energy or nutrient balance. The herbivores should be critically dependent on high-quality plants or plant organs, but the bulk of the vegetation will remain untouched. The herbivores should thus live in a ''green desert''. The first set assumes that an plants are edible and of sufficiently high quality, while the second set assumes that plants are generally toxic or of low quality. We have tested this assumption with microtine rodents and productive boreal field layer vegetation in a greenhouse experiment. We found that for three of the studied vole species, Microtus agrestis, Clethrionomys rufocanus, and C. glareolus, the vegetation became severely damaged before the individual voles started to lose weight. On average, 10% of the vegetation remained compared with ungrazed controls. Shoot mortality for toxic tall herbs was almost as high as for corresponding non-toxic species. Toxic species also showed a low ability to recover from damage one year after grazing. Toxicity was thus only marginally successful in protecting plants against grazing. We concluded that the first set of hypotheses thus seemed to be built on a more realistic assumption than the second set. Long-term effects after the grazing had ended showed that herbs generally suffered while grasses were favoured, regardless whether the voles preferred herbs or grasses. This suggests that the graminoid strategy is superior in dealing with pulsatory grazing.","UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN","MOEN, J (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ECOL BOT, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,52,42,46,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,1993,68,3,,,,,401,413,,10.2307/3544908,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MN956,WOS:A1993MN95600003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Such tissue loss can cause reduced activity, feeding, growth, and reproduction. Browsing (or sublethal) predation may also influence competitive interactions via changes in sediment disturbance activity. Increased browsing rates should result in decreased sediment disturbance. We quantified the area of sediment disturbed by groups of spionid polychaetes subject to different regimes of feeding palp loss. For Pseudopolydora kempi (Southern), cores with higher numbers of regenerating worms had less area of surface sediment disturbed (reductions ranged from 30% to nearly 100%), and this effect persisted for at least 1 wk. Fecal production was similarly reduced. Fecal production by another spionid, Rhynchospio glutaeus (Ehlers), was reduced only when all worms in a core were regenerating both feeding palps.

How animals respond to predation risk is generally considered predictable from species life-history and natural-history traits, but rigorous tests of these predictions remain scarce. We report on a large-scale playback experiment with a forest bird community that addresses two questions: (i) does perceived predation risk shape the richness and composition of a breeding bird community? And (ii) can species life-history and natural-history traits predict prey community responses to different types of predation risk? On 9 ha plots, we manipulated cues of three avian predators that preferentially prey on either adult birds or offspring, or both, throughout the breeding season. We found that increased perception of predation risk led to generally negative responses in the abundance, occurrence and/or detection probability of most prey species, which in turn reduced the species richness and shifted the composition of the breeding bird community. Species-level responses were largely predicted from the key natural-history trait of body size, but we did not find support for the life-history theory prediction of the relationship between species' slow/fast life-history strategy and their response to predation risk.","[Hua, Fangyuan; Fletcher, Robert J., Jr.; Sieving, Kathryn E.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hua, Fangyuan] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Dorazio, Robert M.] US Geol Survey, Southeast Ecol Sci Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA","Hua, FY (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Program Sci Technol & Environm Policy, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",slcyane@gmail.com,"Sieving, Kathyrn E/I-6058-2013","Sieving, Kathyrn E/0000-0002-0849-8101; Hua, Fangyuan/0000-0001-8514-8757; Fletcher, Robert/0000-0003-1717-5707",University of FloridaUniversity of Florida,"We thank S.

Some previous researchers have hypothesized that these pre-GABI faunas had a low richness of mammalian carnivores (an impoverished predator guild), while others argue for a predator/prey ratio similar to those of recent communities. In this paper, we analyze faunas from the lower part of the Santa Cruz Formation (FL 1-7) using a methodology that allows us to quantify (i) the meat resources that were available to the secondary consumers of the palaeocommunity; and (ii) the competition intensity for these resources. In our modeling, we considered different scenarios related to meat consumption, including the possibility that several taxa had a scavenging behavior, and also differences in mortality rates between young and adult prey. Our results provide estimates of the nutritional requirements from the predator/scavenger guild under maximum and minimum quantities of meat offered by the prey community, which indicate the presence of a well-balanced palaeocommunity. Moreover, the competition indices point to a relatively high level of competition for prey of small-to-medium size, although competition for resources from large mammal prey was rather low. This suggests that the predator/scavenger guild was not impoverished, although there were insufficient carnivore species to fully consume the megaherbivore biomass.","[Rodriguez-Gomez, Guillermo; Palmqvist, Paul] Univ Malaga, Dept Ecol & Geol, Campus Teatinos, Malaga 29071, Spain; [Cassini, Guillermo H.] Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Div Mastozool, Av Angel Gallardo 470,C1405DJR, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cassini, Guillermo H.] Univ Nacl Lujan, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Ruta 5 & Av Constituc S-N, RA-6700 Lujan, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Cassini, Guillermo H.; Toledo, Nestor; Vizcaino, Sergio F.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bargo, M.

However, relatively little is known about how predators affect herbivore diet selection. We examined diets of 2 common reef herbivores, Sparisoma aurofrenatum and Acanthurus coeruleus, in the Florida Keys, across sites of varying predator biomass. We used stable isotope analysis to understand the importance of predation risk relative to other known drivers of herbivore foraging decisions. For S. aurofrenatum, we found that greater predator biomass was associated with an increase in the diversity of resources consumed within populations. In contrast, increasing densities of damselfishes, which aggressively defend resource-rich algal gardens, were associated with lower diet diversity. However, within A. coeruleus populations, diet diversity increased with damselfish abundance, but was unrelated to predator biomass. Stomach content analyses and direct observation of diet selection in the field corroborated the stable isotope analysis. Importantly, both predator and damselfish abundance impacted diet diversity in different ways for these 2 fishes, which may be linked to differences in sociality and group foraging. A. coeruleus is more likely to forage in schools, potentially reducing predation risk and allowing them to overwhelm damselfishes and access their territories. Interestingly, damselfish abundance was positively correlated with predator biomass, suggesting that predators may influence herbivore diets indirectly via altered densities or behavior of damselfishes. Our work argues for more emphasis on the role of predation risk in affecting herbivore foraging in order to understand the implications of human-mediated predator removal and recovery in coral reef ecosystems.","[Catano, Laura B.; Shantz, Andrew A.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, North Miami, FL 33181 USA","Catano, LB (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",lbhatti@fiu.edu,,"Shantz, Andrew/0000-0001-5641-8914","PADI Foundation Grant; Florida Sea Grant Scholar award; National Science Foundation, Biological OceanographyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1130786]; College of Arts and Sciences at Florida International University","L.B.C. and D.E.B. designed the study; L.B.C., A.A.S., and D.E.B. performed the research; L.B.C. conducted statistical analyses; L.B.C. and D.E.B. wrote the manuscript; A.A.S. contributed to editing the manuscript.

However, many predators commonly found in leaf litter become restricted to simple microhabitat beneath rocks and logs during periods between rains. It is within this structurally simple microhabitat that some predators defend rich prey resources and are likely to interact strongly as the surrounding forest becomes too dry to forage broadly in space. We conducted a 4-y press experiment where we removed focal predators from unfenced field plots. To evaluate the effects of predators on one another we removed either salamanders or centipedes from beneath artificially placed cover objects and compared abundances of these and other intraguild predators to those in non-removal controls. We predicted that salamanders and centipedes would have strong negative effects on each other and on carabid beetles and spiders. We removed a total of 1288 salamanders and 1056 centipedes over 98 sampling dates. In salamander removal plots spider abundance increased by 34%, and carabid beetles decreased by 15% relative to the control. In centipede removal plots salamanders increased by 18% and carabid beetles increased by 29%, but spider abundance decreased by 15%. Interaction strengths were strongest in the drier summer months when territorial predators were confined in spatially fixed microhabitats. It is during these periods that predators may strongly regulate the abundances of guild members. In territorial species that defend areas beneath natural cover, the effect of intraguild predators may be an important mechanism that regulates distribution and abundance of forest floor predators.","[Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.; Anthony, Carl D.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, University Hts, OH 44118 USA; [Walton, B.

However, rarely has propagule size been experimentally manipulated to examine changes in invader behaviour, and propagule longevity and success. We manipulated propagule size of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile in laboratory and field studies. Laboratory experiments involved L. humile propagules containing two queens and 10, 100, 200 or 1000 workers. Propagules were introduced into arenas containing colonies of queens and 200 workers of the competing native ant Monomorium antarcticum. The effects of food availability were investigated via treatments of only one central resource, or 10 separated resources. Field studies used similar colony sizes of L. humile, which were introduced into novel environments near an invasion front. In laboratory studies, small propagules of L. humile were quickly annihilated. Only the larger propagule size survived and killed the native ant colony in some replicates. Aggression was largely independent of food availability, but the behaviour of L. humile changed substantially with propagule size. In larger propagules, aggressive behaviour was significantly more frequent, while L. humile were much more likely to avoid conflict in smaller propagules. In field studies, however, propagule size did not influence colony persistence. Linepithema humile colonies persisted for up to 2 months, even in small propagules of 10 workers. Factors such as temperature or competitor abundance had no effect, although some colonies were decimated by M. antarcticum. Synthesis and applications. Although propagule size has been correlated with invasion success in a wide variety of taxa, our results indicate that it will have limited predictive power with species displaying behavioural plasticity. We recommend that aspects of animal behaviour be given much more consideration in attempts to model invasion success. Secondly, areas of high biodiversity are thought to offer biotic resistance to invasion via the abundance of predators and competitors. Invasive pests such as L. humile appear to modify their behaviour according to local conditions, and establishment was not related to resource availability. We cannot necessarily rely on high levels of native biodiversity to repel invasions.","[Sagata, Katayo; Lester, Philip J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand","Lester, PJ (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",phil.lester@vuw.ac.nz,"Lester, Phil/A-1296-2008","Lester, Phil/0000-0002-1801-5687",NZ Aid Scholarship,"We thank Carrone Conroy, Alex Dixson, Catherine Duthie and Megan Sarty for assistance, and John Haywood for statistical advice.

A broken palate that retains incomplete cheektooth rows demonstrates that this new, very small marsupial lion possessed the elongate, trenchant P3 and predominantly subtriangular upper molars characteristic of thylacoleonids, while other features of the premolar support its placement in a new genus. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Microleo attenboroughi is the sister taxon to all other thylacoleonids, and that Thylacoleonidae may lie outside Vombatomorphia as the sister taxon of all other wombat-like marsupials including koalas. However, given limited data about the cranial morphology of M. attenboroughi, Thylacoleonidae is concluded here, conservatively, to be part of the vom-batomorphian clade. This new thylacoleonid brings to three the number of marsupial lion species that have been recovered from early Miocene deposits at Riversleigh and indicates a level of diversity previously not seen for this group. It is likely that the different size and morphology of the three sympatric taxa reflects niche partitioning and hence reduced competition. Thylacoleonids may have been the dominant arboreal predators of Cenozoic Australia.","[Gillespie, Anna K.; Archer, Michael; Hand, Suzanne J.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Palaeontol Geobiol & Earth Arch PANGEA Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Gillespie, AK (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Palaeontol Geobiol & Earth Arch PANGEA Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",a.gillespie@unsw.edu; m.archer@unsw.edu.au; s.hand@unsw.edu.au,,,"Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP1094569, LP100200486, DE130100467, DP130100197]; Environment Australia, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, Queensland Museum; University of New South Wales; Outback at Isa; Mount Isa City Council; Waanyi people of northwestern Queensland; Riversleigh Society","We thank the following people for providing access to comparative specimens: R.

However, experiments in plant communities suggest that many communities are unsaturated and species richness can be increased by adding propagules of new species. We experimentally tested for community saturation and measured the effects of propagule supply on community structure in a benthic marine system. We manipulated propagule supply (arrival of individuals of numerous species) of mobile grazers in experimental mesocosms over multiple generations and, unlike previous tests, we examined the cascading effects of propagule supply on prey (macroalgae) biomass. We found little evidence for saturation, despite the absence of processes such as disturbance and predation that are thought to alleviate saturation in nature. Increasing propagule supply increased the total number of species and made rare species more abundant. Perhaps surprisingly, given the strong effect of propagule supply on species richness, supply-related changes in body size and composition suggest that competitive interactions remained important. Grazer supply also had strong cascading effects on primary production, possibly because of dietary complementarity modified by territorial behavior. Our results indicate that propagule supply can directly influence the diversity and composition of communities of mobile animals. Furthermore, the supply of consumer propagules can have strong indirect effects on prey and fundamental ecosystem properties.","[Lee, Sarah C.; Bruno, John F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Lee, SC (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",sclee@unc.edu,"Lee, Sarah/Q-3372-2017",,National Science Foundation Predoctoroal FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE0327191]; University of North Carolina,"We thank J.

Understanding the interaction among predators and between predation and climate is critical to understanding the mechanisms for compensatory mortality. We used data from 1999 radio-marked neonatal elk (Cervus elaphus) calves from 12 populations in the north-western United States to test for effects of predation on neonatal survival, and whether predation interacted with climate to render mortality compensatory. 2. Weibull survival models with a random effect for each population were fit as a function of the number of predator species in a community (3-5), seven indices of climatic variability, sex, birth date, birth weight, and all interactions between climate and predators. Cumulative incidence functions (CIF) were used to test whether the effects of individual species of predators were additive or compensatory. 3. Neonatal elk survival to 3 months declined following hotter previous summers and increased with higher May precipitation, especially in areas with wolves and/or grizzly bears. Mortality hazards were significantly lower in systems with only coyotes (Canis latrans), cougars (Puma concolor) and black bears (Ursus americanus) compared to higher mortality hazards experienced with gray wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus horribilis). 4. In systems with wolves and grizzly bears, mortality by cougars decreased, and predation by bears was the dominant cause of neonatal mortality. Only bear predation appeared additive and occurred earlier than other predators, which may render later mortality by other predators compensatory as calves age. Wolf predation was low and most likely a compensatory source of mortality for neonatal elk calves. 5. Functional redundancy and interspecific competition among predators may combine with the effects of climate on vulnerability to predation to drive compensatory mortality of neonatal elk calves. The exception was the evidence for additive bear predation. These results suggest that effects of predation by recovering wolves on neonatal elk survival, a contentious issue for management of elk populations, may be less important than the composition of the predator community. Future studies would benefit by synthesizing overwinter calf and adult-survival data sets, ideally from experimental studies, to test the roles of predation in annual compensatory and additive mortality of elk.","[Griffin, Kathleen A.; Hebblewhite, Mark; Robinson, Hugh S.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Zager, Peter] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Lewiston, ID 83501 USA; [Barber-Meyer, Shannon M.] Teton Sci Sch, Kelly, WY 83011 USA; [Christianson, David; Creel, Scott] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Harris, Nyeema C.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hurley, Mark A.] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Salmon, ID 83467 USA; [Jackson, DeWaine H.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, Roseburg, OR 97470 USA; [Johnson, Bruce K.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Myers, Woodrow L.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Spokane, WA 99216 USA; [Raithel, Jarod D.] Kihei Charter Sch, Kihei, HI 96753 USA; [Schlegel, Mike] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Kamiah, ID 83536 USA; [Smith, Bruce L.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Jackson, WY 83001 USA; [White, Craig] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, Boise, ID 83707 USA; [White, P.

For instance, unequal use of space by consumers can lead to improper characterizations of their interaction with prey if based solely on population density. Instead, quitting harvest rates (QHRs) from resource patches might provide a useful alternative index of predator impacts. We tested whether space use would predict predation rates of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) on experimental songbird nests and whether QHRs or mouse density would best predict the proportion of space used. Our results indicated that space use was an accurate predictor of nest predation rates. Moreover, space use was significantly related to QHRs, but not to mouse density. In our study, space use is the outcome of behavioral mechanisms that do not appear to scale with or lag behind consumer density.

The well-documented range expansion of the rusty crayfish Orconectes rusticus is an ideal system to study potential relationships between the attributes that contribute to invasive success, and the ways in which non-indigenous species alter invaded systems. In Michigan and northern Wisconsin (U.S.A.) lakes where O. rusticus is replacing its native congener O. virilis, it is thought that O. rusticus invasion may account for decreased fish abundance. However, not all of the potential mechanisms that could drive this process have been explored. We examined the hypothesis that O. rusticus are better benthic egg predators than O. virilis, and tested the prediction that O. rusticus would consume substrate bound fish eggs at a higher rate than its native congener. Support for this hypothesis would suggest that O. rusticus may be able to access a high-energy food source better than O. virilis, and exert predation pressures that could limit the abundance of fish species which might otherwise limit crayfish populations through top-down control. In laboratory experiments, we determined that O. rusticus exhibit a positive correlation between feeding rate and carapace length not displayed by O. virilis, and that larger O. rusticus feed at a higher rate than their native congener. We also found that O. rusticus in laboratory feeding trials engaged in longer feeding events than crayfish foraging in situ in a substrate-spawning fish nest, a factor which could give O. rusticus an advantage in resource competition with its native congener O. virilis. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that O. rusticus is a better predator of substrate bound fish eggs than O. virilis, and suggest that direct predation by crayfish may influence fish reproduction in lakes where O. rusticus replaces O. virilis.","[Morse, Joshua W.] Oberlin Coll, Dept Biol, Ctr Sci, Oberlin, OH 44047 USA; [Baldridge, A.

Consequently, it remains controversial if the resulting soil feedbacks on plants are due to alterations in arthropod herbivory or to changes in the activity of detritivores. We investigated the impacts of the application of a commonly used belowground insecticide (chlorpyrifos) on soil animals and soil feedbacks on model plant species representing two main plant functional groups of grassland communities, the grass Lolium perenne and the forb Centaurea jacea. Insecticide application decreased soil insect herbivore densities considerably. However, also Collembola densities and diversity decreased markedly due to insecticide application and this was most pronounced in Entomobryidae, lsotomidae, Hypogastruridae, and Sminthuridae. While densities of other detritivore taxa were not affected or even increased (Oribatida) in insecticide subplots, that of predators mostly decreased. Both model plant species built considerably more biomass in control subplots than in insecticide subplots irrespective of characteristics of the resident plant community. This suggests that soil feedbacks on plants were not due to belowground herbivory and highlights the significance of alternative mechanisms responsible for insecticide-mediated soil feedbacks on plants. The deterioration of model plant species' performances in insecticide subplots most likely was due to decreased densities of Collembola resulting in the deceleration of nutrient cycling and plant nutrition. The results suggest that it is oversimplistic to only ascribe insecticide-mediated soil feedbacks on plants to belowground herbivores. The results further indicate that in the present study the impact of arthropod detritivores on plant productivity was more important than that of belowground herbivores.

Typical food web models assume that individual prey are identical in their susceptibility to predators throughout their lives, but many prey species become less vulnerable to predators through ontogeny. A simple set of models is explored where prey must pass through a vulnerable stage prior to achieving a predator-invulnerable size refuge. As productivity of the environment increases, the proportional impact of predators decreases because more individuals become and remain in the invulnerable adult stage. The addition of a competitor prey species that can not achieve size refuge results in contrasting outcomes. At low productivity the small species wins in competition, and the system is strongly consumer controlled At high productivity, the large species wins due to the presence of predators, and the system becomes less consumer controlled. At intermediate productivity either the small or the large species can win depending on initial conditions, and the system can be either strongly or weakly consumer controlled Such alternative stable equilibria derived from models with prey size refugia may help to explain many natural situations.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Chase, JM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jchase+@pitt.edu,,,,,,86,111,115,0,30,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

We examined whether isolation creates differences in fish assemblages among reefs through changes in predation pressure. First, small artificial reefs were placed at increasing distances from a naturally continuous reef, over a sloping bottom. Species richness and density of each species increased with isolation. Next, artificial reefs were relocated, together with all their fish inhabitants, closer to the natural reef. Following relocation, resident fishes of the artificial reefs exhibited a sharp decline in numbers, while predatory fish density increased. Both video observations of the relocated artificial reefs and the correlation between piscivore aggregation and decline of the resident fishes revealed that the cause of decline was the strong predation around the artificial reefs. The decline was density-dependent, such that the per-capita rate of decline was higher on artificial reefs with higher fish density. This study shows that the impact of piscivores on resident fish is modified by small-scale isolation. The results suggest that the high density of fish on small, isolated reefs is enabled by low predation.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Evolut Syst & Ecol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Belmaker, J (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",belmakej@bgumail.ac.il,"Shashar, Nadav/Y-8552-2019; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012; Belmaker, Jonathan/I-1004-2019; Belmaker, Jonathan/F-7166-2011","Belmaker, Jonathan/0000-0002-5618-7359; Ziv, Yaron/0000-0002-6369-9803",,,,58,23,24,0,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

An experimental approach to determine esocid prey preference in replicated pond systems. Lake Reserv Manage. 28:224-231. Competitive interactions between salmonids and white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) often result in poor salmonid growth, condition, and ultimately angler catch-per-unit-effort. Fisheries managers frequently introduce hybrid northern pike (Esox lucius) and muskellunge (E. masquinongy), known as tiger muskellunge, as biological control agents to reduce the abundance of undesirable species including white suckers, while simultaneously attempting to create viable recreational fisheries with stocked salmonids. In this study, northern pike were used to evaluate esocid prey preference between naive, hatchery-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and wild white suckers. Enclosures containing northern pike were stocked with rainbow trout and white suckers at 2 densities (50: 50 and 20: 80, respectively) to represent different ratios of forage. Weekly sampling by beach seine was used to determine rainbow trout and white sucker mortality. When the experiment was complete, enclosures were drained to determine overall survival of the forage species. Rainbow trout numbers declined precipitously to zero, while 60-75% of white suckers remained across all treatments. This study demonstrated a clear difference in survival of rainbow trout and white suckers (rainbow trout having lower survival) in the presence of northern pike under these conditions. We suggest fisheries managers consider these findings when stocking or managing for piscivores to control undesirable fish species, or to create recreational fisheries, while simultaneously stocking naive sport fish vulnerable to predation.","[Lepak, Jesse M.; Fetherman, Eric R.] Colorado Pk & Wildlife, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Pate, William M.; Craft, Christopher D.; Gardunio, Eric I.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Lepak, JM (corresponding author), Colorado Pk & Wildlife, 317 W Prospect Rd, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",Jesse.Lepak@state.co.us,"Fetherman, Eric/AAZ-7045-2020","Fetherman, Eric/0000-0003-4792-7148",Colorado Parks and Wildlife; United States Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Fund Program,"The authors would like to thank the members of the Colorado State University Student Subunit of the American Fisheries Society for help with the project design and implementation.

By using a non-invasive method, we evaluated the physiological stress responses of Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) to the presence of cattle, sheep and goat, red deer (Cervus elaphus), people (hikers), and predators to identify which factors may affect this endangered species. During September 2012, November 2012, and July 2013, a total of 318 faecal samples were collected in representative sites and analysed for faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM). FCM concentration was analysed through linear mixed-effect models. A significant increase in FCM values in Apennine chamois sharing their habitat with domestic animals was recorded during all study periods. On the contrary, stress responses to red deer and people were limited in time and emerged only during summer months, when hikers are more frequent and red deer extend their altitudinal range reaching chamois' habitat. The observed effects of domestic animals, red deer, and hikers should be considered in future Apennine chamois management plans, which should include the regulation of pastured domestic livestock, anthropogenic disturbances, and possible interferences with other wild species within parks.","[Formenti, Nicoletta; Trogu, Tiziana; Bonfanti, Marta; Lanfranchi, Paolo; Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Dept Vet Med, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Formenti, Nicoletta] Ist Zooprofilatt Sperimentale Lombardia & Emilia, Via Bianchi 7-9, I-25124 Brescia, Italy; [Vigano, Roberto; Fraquelli, Cristina] Studio Associato AlpVet, Piazza Venzaghi 2, I-21052 Busto Arsizio, VA, Italy; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Veterinarpl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Ctr Ric Coordinata Epidemiol & Sorveglianza Mol I, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Ferrari, N (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Vet Med, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy.; Ferrari, N (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Ctr Ric Coordinata Epidemiol & Sorveglianza Mol I, Via Celoria 10, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",nicola.ferrari@unimi.it,"Ferrari, Nicola/E-6331-2013; Vigano, Roberto/ABE-8075-2020; Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008","Ferrari, Nicola/0000-0001-8959-3495; Vigano, Roberto/0000-0001-8594-1296; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Formenti, Nicoletta/0000-0003-1516-1256","Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN project)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) [2010P7LFW4];  [LIFE09 NAT/IT/000183]",This research was supported by the 'Project LIFE09 NAT/IT/000183 Coornata' and partly by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN project no. 2010P7LFW4).,,60,4,4,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Water chemistry, predation, hydroperiod and competition influence tadpole assemblages within waterbodies. We surveyed aquatic predators, habitat refugia, water height and water chemistry variables (pH, salinity and turbidity) at 37 waterbodies over an intensive 22-day field survey to determine which environmental factors influence the relative abundance and occupancy of two habitat specialist anuran tadpole species in naturally acidic, oligotrophic waterbodies within eastern Australian wallum communities. The majority of tadpoles found were of Litoria olongburensis (wallum sedge frog) and Crinia tinnula (wallum froglet) species, both habitat specialists that are associated with wallum waterbodies and listed as Vulnerable under the IUCN Red List. Tadpoles of two other species (Litoria fallax (eastern sedge frog), and Litoria cooloolensis (cooloola sedge frog)) were recorded from two waterbodies. Tadpoles of Litoria gracilenta (graceful treefrog) were recorded from one waterbody. Relative abundance and occupancy of L.olongburensis tadpoles were associated with pH and water depth. Additionally, L.olongburensis tadpole relative abundance was negatively associated with turbidity. Waterbody occupancy by C.tinnula tadpoles was negatively associated with predatory fish and water depth and positively associated with turbidity. Variables associated with relative abundance of C.tinnula tadpoles were inconclusive and further survey work is required to identify these environmental factors. Our results show that the ecology of specialist and non-specialist tadpole species associated with unique' (e.g. wallum) waterbodies is complex and species specific, with specialist species likely dominating unique habitats.","[Simpkins, Clay Alan; Shuker, Jonathan D.; Lollback, Gregory W.; Hero, Jean-Marc] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Ctr, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Castley, J.

By using a quasi-experimental, non-intrusive approach, we go beyond the classical view that predators only compete for living prey and disentangle the mechanisms of exploitative and interference competition between two charismatic apex predators, lionsPanthera leoand spotted hyaenasCrocuta crocuta, at carcasses other than their own kills. Carcasses of different sizes were monitored in two study areas of South Africa: one with both lions and hyaenas and the other with hyaenas only. We found evidence of both symmetric exploitative competition and asymmetric interference competition. Interactions were strongly conditioned by carcass size, and co-occurrence was mostly recorded at large ungulate carcasses. Interference competition seemed to dominate interspecific interactions, with lions having preferential access. However, interference while feeding did not exert any cost on the subordinate hyaenas, in terms of amount of ingested food and consumption rate, probably thanks to the reward provided by large carcasses in the form of abundant carrion, the use of lions to detect carcasses, and spatiotemporal segregation at the carcass-scale. Securing a diverse carrion supply in terms of carcass size, including megaherbivore carcasses, may favor the coexistence of the largest African carnivores, especially in small protected areas. Overall, our study reveals mechanisms related to both the food resource heterogeneity and the competitor behavior that allow the coexistence of strongly interacting species.","[Amoros, Mar] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Barcelona, Spain; [Gil-Sanchez, Jose M.; Moleon, Marcos] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain; [Moleon, Marcos] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Lopez-Pastor, Beatriz de las N.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Biol Aplicada, Alicante, Spain","Gil-Sanchez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain.",jmgilsanchez@yahoo.es,"Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/AAW-1016-2021; Moleon, Marcos/K-2875-2014","Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/0000-0002-7052-8332; Moleon, Marcos/0000-0002-3126-619X",Spanish Ministry of Education (Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011); Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R+D+I [SEV-2012-0262]; Ramon y Cajal ProgramSpanish Government [RYC-2015-19231]; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL2017-89905-R]; ERDF funds,"MM was supported by postdoctoral grants from the Spanish Ministry of Education (Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011), the Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R+D+I (SEV-2012-0262) and the Ramon y Cajal Program (RYC-2015-19231).

We studied cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, which is invading the entire Chinese coast, occupying mudflats throughout this range, and displacing mangroves in the upper intertidal of southern China. For two years, we studied the roles of propagule pressure, competition, disturbance, and herbivory in the dynamics of this invasion at a typical mangrove habitat, Zhangjiang Estuary, southern China. Seed of cordgrass dispersed to all intertidal habitats. The density of seeds in surficial soils was 20-fold greater in cordgrass than in dense mangrove, the ecotone between mangrove and cordgrass, or the open mudflat. Seed predation or herbivory on seedlings was intense in all habitats. While seeds of cordgrass germinated in all habitats, no unprotected seedlings survived anywhere except on the mudflat in our two-year study. Survival was nil in other habitats where seed predation, herbivory, and shading by dense vegetation killed all seeds and seedlings. Seed dispersal to the mudflat exceeded seed predation and herbivory, however, and a few seedlings survived to grow into large clones of cordgrass. Repeated waves of seed dispersal and rapid clonal growth have transformed the mudflat into cordgrass stands within a decade, despite high consumer pressure. Disturbance by typhoons, freezes, and humans make gaps in mangrove that fill with cordgrass. This process is gradually converting mangrove forests into monospecific intertidal grasslands in China.","[Li, Zhengjie; Wang, Wenqing; Zhang, Yihui] Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China","Zhang, YH (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China.",zyh@xmu.edu.cn,,,Zhangjiang Estuary Mangrove National Nature Reserve; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41276078],"We thank Q.

These shores are normally dominated by a lush canopy of perennial fucoid rockweeds, with an associated understory of mussels, barnacles and crustose algae. Several observational and experimental studies have been carried out on the succession which has followed this scouring. This paper reports experimental tests of the effects of fucoid canopy algae and mussels on each other and on other species, during later succession. Previous work suggests that, in the absence of predation or disturbance, mussels Mytilus edulis (L.) would increase and outcompete Fucus vesiculosus L. as the dominant space occupant at the mid-shore level. However, during this experiment, 2-3 yr after the scour, abundance of mussels (as understory) decreased. This decrease was dependent on the presence of canopy and may be mediated by whelk carnivory. Mussels had no effect on canopy cover of Fucus vesiculosus L., and caused only a small decrease in Fucus density. Self-thinning appeared to affect Fucus density far more than mussels. Removal of canopy also affected Fucus recruitment, ephemeral algae, grazers and whelks, but did not affect crustose algae or barnacles significantly. In contrast, mussel removal was not found to affect any of these species, except to decrease whelk abundance. These results suggest that the interactions may be more variable than previous work implies. Although much of the Northwest Atlantic rocky seashore is dominated by rockweeds, and rockweeds are thought to be competitively inferior to mussels, we believe this study is the first to directly examine the effects of mussels on rockweeds.",,"MCCOOK, LJ (corresponding author), DALHOUSIE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,HALIFAX B3H 4J1,NS,CANADA.",,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012",,,,,41,87,88,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

The potential effect of hydrodynamic forces on the zonation patterns of Astraea undosa was tested in laboratory and field experiments. Based on theoretical predictions of the relationship between shear force and water velocity on different-sized snails, large snails are subjected to greater shear forces, as a result of water motion, than medium or small snails. Results of dislodgment experiments conducted in the laboratory indicated that for a given force per unit area, all snails dislodged at nearly the same frequency, with 50% of snails predicted to dislodge at about 4 m/s, and 100% of snails predicted to dislodge at about 8 m/s velocity. These results suggest that hydrodynamic forces may be an important factor in the shallowest subtidal zones. A factorial-designed caging experiment was used to test the effects of snail population density on growth rates of snails of three different size classes. For small and medium size classes, results indicated an inverse relationship between population density and growth rates, which was especially pronounced for smaller snails. These data, in conjunction with long-term patterns of population density and size distribution in the field, suggest that intraspecific competition also plays a role in determining size-specific zonation patterns. Tethering experiments, used to estimate predation rates in different algal-cover zones, suggest that there are no differences in survival rates among different snail size classes; however, survival rates differ among zones and may contribute further to the observed zonation patterns. Overall, data indicate that a combination of physical and biological processes controls the population density and size-distribution of Astraea undosa over a depth gradient at Santa Catalina Island, California.

We described differences in the activity of individuals occurring alone or in sympatry with larger cats. Oncilla presented low densities (7-13 ind./100 km(2)) and high flexibility in its activity. The oncillas were primarily nocturnal in the absence of other larger cat species - margay, ocelot and puma - but became more diurnal, with a cathemeral activity pattern, when the other cats were present. Oncilla is likely to be in a subordinate position in interactions with larger cats and changes its activity to decrease the chances for interspecific encounters. In this study, however, the presence of other cat species covaries with habitat changes (from coastal forest patches to dense evergreen forests). We also verified the highest oncilla relative abundance in an area with no sympatric larger cats, with abundance decreasing when it was in sympatry with margay, ocelot and puma. Our results, together with recent records of oncilla in other degraded landscapes of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, provide evidence that oncillas may thrive even in harsh environments where other cats have already been extinct. This raise interesting conservation insights, as in the absence of other cats, L. tigrinus may assume a top predator role of these impoverished vertebrate communities.","[Oliveira-Santos, Luiz Gustavo R.; Zucco, Carlos A.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol & Conservacao Populacoes, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Graipel, Mauricio E.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol & Zool, BR-88040970 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Tortato, Marcos A.] Univ Fed Parana, Setor Ciencias Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Caceres, Nilton C.] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Biol, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Goulart, Fernando V.

We designed a field study to determine if selective predation by fishes accounts for population dominance of the exotic rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus, in a northern Wisconsin lake. We hypothesized that fish predators avoid consuming O. rusticus in favor of congeners O. propinquus and O. virilis because O. rusticus attains either superior size or is more aggressive than its congeners. Largely based on previous experimental work, we expected that predators would consume smaller individuals of rusty crayfish than of other species, as a result of behavioral differences among crayfish species. Although smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) consumed fewer rusty crayfish than expected based on relative prey abundance, predators consumed similar sized crayfish of all species. Further, our results indicated that predators likely avoid O. rusticus because they have larger chelae than congeners, and that behavioral differences did not appear to contribute substantially to crayfish selection at the whole lake scale. Our results suggest that selective predation based on chelae size is one of the primary drivers of this species replacement. Selective predation commonly accelerates exotic dominance over native prey and should be considered explicitly in exotic species investigations.","Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Roth, BM (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, 680 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",bmroth@wisc.edu,,,,,,50,31,31,3,32,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0011-216X,,,CRUSTACEANA,Crustaceana,MAR,2005,78,,3,,,,297,310,,10.1163/1568540054286583,,,14,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,946FX,WOS:000230558900004,,,,,2021-09-27,

Major findings from 40 years of research in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in north-central New Hampshire reviewed here show that the distributions and abundances of bird species are dynamic, even within well-developed and mature forests, and that species respond differently to habitat (vegetation) structure, food availability, and other features of the forest environment. At the local scale, bird population demography is most affected by factors that influence fecundity and recruitment, mainly food availability, weather, nest predators, and density dependent processes. Fecundity is strongly correlated with subsequent recruitment and is critical for maintaining breeding population size. Events in the non-breeding season, however, also influence the abundance and demography of breeding populations, indicating the need to assess factors operating throughout the species' annual cycle. At the landscape scale, populations in temperate forests are spatially structured by each species' response to habitat and environmental patterns, but also by social interactions such as competition and conspecific attraction. Settlement patterns and ultimately reproductive performance depend on habitat quality, based on vegetation structure, food availability and nest predator effects that vary across the landscape. Results from these long-term studies centered at Hubbard Brook provide a mechanistic understanding of avian population dynamics and community responses. The results provide a framework for predicting how future changes in habitat quality, climate, and other environmental threats may influence bird populations and communities in north-temperate forests.

Little is known, however, about how predator-mediated indirect interactions such as apparent competition alter survival patterns of canopy tree seeds. Understorey plants may enhance tree seed predation by providing sheltered habitat to granivores (non-trophic pathway). In addition, occurrence of different tree seeds in mixed patches may lead to short-term apparent competition between seed types, because of the granivores' foraging response to changes in food patch quality (trophic pathway). We hypothesised that understorey bamboo cover and mixing of seed species in food patches would both increase tree seed predation in a Nothofagus dombeyi-Austrocedrus chilensis forest in northern Patagonia, Argentina. Seed removal experiments were conducted for three consecutive years (2000-2002) differing in overall granivory rates. Seed patch encounter and seed removal rates were consistently higher for the larger and more nutritious Austrocedrus seeds than for the smaller Nothofagus seeds. Seed removal was greater beneath bamboo than in open areas. This apparent competition pathway was stronger in a low-predation year (2000) than in high-predation years (2001-2002), suggesting a shift in microhabitat use by rodents. Patch composition had a significant, though weaker, impact on seed survival across study years, whereas seed density per patch enhanced encounter rates but did not influence seed removal. Removal of the less-preferred Nothofagus seeds increased in the presence of Austrocedrus seeds, but the reciprocal indirect effect was not observed. However, this non-reciprocal apparent competition between seed species was only significant in the high-predation years. Our study shows that granivore-mediated indirect effects can arise through different interaction pathways, affecting seed survival patterns according to the predator's preference for alternative seed types. Moreover, results indicate that the occurrence and relative strength of trophic vs non-trophic pathways of apparent competition may change under contrasting predation scenarios.","Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Prod Vegetal, Fac Agron, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IFEVA, Dept Recursos Nat, Fac Agron, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Nacl Comahue, CRUB, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Caccia, FD (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Prod Vegetal, Fac Agron, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",fcaccia@agro.uba.ar,"Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121",,,,65,41,43,1,25,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2006,113,3,,,,,469,480,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14390.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,050QU,WOS:000238103800009,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, aggregations of conspecifics can generate strong intraspecific competition and inter-cohort cannibalism. We investigated the effects of adult conspecific cues on general fitness parameters of juvenile Carcinus maenas (stages J1-J5), and used geometric morphometrics to investigate patterns of allometric growth indicative of life-history strategies and resource use potential. Cues induced faster metamorphosis and slightly shortened intermolt time in J2 individuals, at the expense of acute mortality in J1 crabs. These effects are cumulative but compensatory processes nullify differences by the end of the experiment. Allometric carapace change toward the adult standard remained unchanged, but conspecific cues induced first a change in size (J1) and then in shape (J5) of claws. In both control and cued juveniles, heterochely was incipient but apparent in J5 crabs. Independently of body side, conspecific cues triggered a very marked increase of the propodus posterior margin, presumably enhancing general strength. Therefore, early benthic stages may grow slightly faster to a size refuge, and develop stronger claws providing competitive advantage for the use of high-value food items when population density-dependent processes are more probable.","[Duarte, Rafael C.; Flores, Augusto A.

The two-spotted stinkbug Perillus bioculatus often feeds gregariously on leaf beetle larvae and caterpillar prey. Consequences of prey sharing among P. bioculatus conspecifics of dissimilar size (instar) was studied using Colorado potato beetle (CPB) prey. Rearing second-instar (N2) nymphs of P. bioculatus with an N5 conspecific facilitated early feeding on L4 CPB larvae (a difficult prey to handle by N2 nymphs but not by N5's), thus increasing survival and accelerating development, One in every 20 cases of P. bioculatus foraging in the field was accounted for by pairs or small groups of mostly feeding individuals. CPB egg masses and L4's represented a disproportionate number of cases of aggregated feeding by P. bioculatus, compared to feeding singly. Small CPB larvae decreased in the diet of aggregated stinkbugs compared to L4 larvae and egg masses, suggesting that sharing these prey may be favorable or unavoidable. In a field test measuring residence/survival of N2's limited to L4 prey, the N2's rate of residence/survival increased significantly when large nymphs acting as food providers were also present. The function of communal feeding in P. bioculatus is discussed, as well as the potential for greater impact on prey density that may be expected from tolerance to opportunistic feeding by conspecifics in slightly gregarious predators.",,"Cloutier, C (corresponding author), UNIV LAVAL, DEPT BIOL, QUEBEC CITY, PQ G1K 7P4, CANADA.",,,,,,,37,5,6,0,2,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0892-7553,1572-8889,,J INSECT BEHAV,J.

We used stable isotope analysis of fox tissues to infer diet during summer and winter for both red and arctic foxes, and lifetime diet for red fox. While the contribution of anthropogenic foods in late summer for both species' diets was low (similar to 10% to 15%), the contribution in late winter was higher and varied between species (red foxes = 49%; arctic foxes = 39%). Estimates of lifetime diet in red foxes suggest consistent use of anthropogenic foods. We found moderate overlap of fox diets, although red foxes appeared to be more specialized on lemmings, whereas arctic foxes had a more diverse diet.

However, research into the behavioral mechanism underlying competition between co-cultured species is lacking. For the first time in co-cultured fish and crustaceans, this study explored experimentally the behavioral interaction between red tilapia and red-claw crayfish in the context of food competion. The effects of the presence of heterospecifics (absent or present), the size of fish relative to crayfish (larger or smaller) and the number of food patches available for the fish (one- versus two-patch conditions) on the foraging decisions and aggression of fish and crayfish were tested. Time spent by fish in the bottom food patch (accessible for fish and crayfish) was shorter in the presence of crayfish, for small but not large fish and when there was an alternative patch for the fish (accessible only for fish). Time spent by crayfish in the bottom food patch was reduced in the presence of large, but not small, fish and when there was no alternative food patch for the fish. Fish were most aggressive towards conspecifics whereas interspecific aggression was exhibited only by crayfish. At the individual level, the dominant fish and crayfish spent more time in the bottom patch and performed more aggressive actions than the other conspecifics. In fish, this was not altered in the presence of crayfish. In crayfish, the overall reduction in foraging duration and aggression was due to an effect of large fish on the dominant individual. The implication of these findings for fish-crayfish communal culture is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the analysis is based on a consumer-resource model introduced by Robert MacArthur. Contrary to many statements in the literature and in textbooks, measures of competition may decrease as similarity increases and may be greatest when similarity of the two species' sets of resource capture rates is very low. High competition with low similarity may occur whether competition is measured by a competition coefficient near equilibrium or is measured by the proportional increase in a species' population density when its competitor is removed. However, these two measures may differ considerably and may change in opposite directions with a given change in similarity. The general conditions required for such counterintuitive relationships between similarity and competition are that the consumer species have relatively low resource requirements for successful reproduction and that the resources be self-reproducing. These same conditions also frequently lead to exclusion of one or more resources via apparent competition, and this is always true of MacArthur's model. A variety of other models of competition are analyzed, and circumstances most likely to produce large competitive effects with little overlap are identified.","Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,46,71,74,0,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5801 S ELLIS AVENUE, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

A field study was conducted in Paso Robles, California in 2006 and 2007 evaluating the effect on plant and ground dwelling arthropod communities of five weed control practices conducted under the vines within the row (berm): (i) flumioxazin, (ii) simazine, (iii) cultivation, (iv) cover crop and (v) untreated control. The cover crop, cultivation and untreated control had 4-50 times higher plant density and more than 15 times higher plant diversity compared with the herbicide treatments. The arthropod activity-density differed among treatments only in 2007, being higher in the cover crop and untreated control. There was a positive relationship between plant and arthropod diversity (r(2) = 0.42, P = 0.02 in 2006; r(2) = 0.64, P < 0.001 in 2007). Laboratory seed predation tests of the two most frequently captured carabid beetles, Calathus ruficollis and Tanystoma maculicolle, indicated they predated more of the common weed species Brassica nigra and Capsella bursapastoris, than other weed species tested. Under field conditions, treatments with higher plant diversity and density favoured arthropod seed predation of these weeds. Predation rates were 20-40% in the cover crop and untreated control, double that observed in the herbicide treatments. The cultivation treatment balanced the benefits of promoting diversity while minimising yield reductions caused by weed competition. The results indicate that weed management practices that promote higher plant diversity and density have the potential to yield ecological benefits within vineyards, for example, enhancing the activity of beneficial organisms.","[Sanguankeo, P.

Metamorphosis is a well-studied life history event in animals, and ecologists have spent decades trying to understand how the size at and time to metamorphosis are altered by natural stressors such as competition and predation. The challenges in interpreting the effects of predators on metamorphic decisions include the need to compare predator species that pose different levels of risk, compare the roles of predators inducing fear versus thinning of the density of prey, and examine prey life history traits and behavior over ontogeny. We addressed these challenges in a mesocosm experiment in which we introduced a high initial density of hatchling Northern Leopard Frogs (Rana pipiens) and exposed them to three different species of caged predators (to induce three different levels of fear), three rates of hand-thinning (to mimic the thinning effect of each predator), or three species of lethal predators (to cause induction and thinning). Under these initial high densities, we found that caged predators had no effects on tadpole activity, growth, and development. This outcome was likely due to the high density of tadpoles causing high competition, which can inhibit anti predator responses. High rates of hand thinning caused decreased tadpole activity, greater mass, and faster development. Interestingly, lethal predators caused phenotypic changes that were largely in line with the hand-thinning effects alone. These results suggest that at high initial prey densities, the thinning process of predation appears to play a much more important role in prey metamorphosis than induction from predatory chemical cues.","[Relyea, Rick A.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Rosenberger, Danielle] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",relyer@rpi.edu; daniellerosenberger@nbnco.com.au,,,University of Pittsburgh's Brackenridge Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"Several people were very helpful in executing this experiment, including N.

However, our knowledge on how brain architecture is affected by commonplace ecological interactions is rudimentary. For example, while intraspecific competition and risk of predation are known to induce adaptive plastic modifications in morphology and behaviour in a wide variety of organisms, their effects on brain development have not been studied. We studied experimentally the influence of density and predation risk on brain development in common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles. Tadpoles grown at low density and under predation risk developed smaller brains than tadpoles at the other treatment combinations. Further, at high densities, tadpoles developed larger optic tecta and smaller medulla oblongata than those grown at low densities. These results demonstrate that ecological interactions - like intraspecific competition and predation risk - can have strong effects on brain development in lower vertebrates.","[Gonda, A.; Trokovic, N.; Herczeg, G.; Merila, J.] Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biosci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Laurila, A.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden","Trokovic, N (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biosci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",trokovic@mappi.helsinki.fi,"Herczeg, Gabor/AAF-9978-2020; Herczeg, Gabor/AAZ-1661-2021; Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008","Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X; Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072",Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments in Uppsala County [C 72/8]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Centre of Excellency in Evolutionary Genetics and Physiology (Finland); Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth foundation; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank Carin Andersson for help in conducting the experiments, and Mirva Turtiainen for help in measuring and processing the brains.

The presence of Anax depressed both growth and survivorship of small bullfrogs and green frogs. In contrast, the presence of Anax had positive effects on growth rates and size at metamorphosis of the large bullfrogs. Increasing density of competitors also decreased survivorship of small classes, and growth rates of all classes. The per-unit-biomass competitive effects of the small bullfrogs on target classes were much greater than those of large bullfrogs. The presence of Anax significantly altered the per-unit-biomass competitive effects of small bullfrogs but not large bullfrogs, presumably because individuals in the small class reduced their activity rates in the presence of Anax. Overall production of new tadpole biomass was quite similar across experimental units, with decreases in production of small size classes in the presence of Anax compensated for by increases in production of the large size class. Thus the non-lethal presence of Anax had substantial effects on the nature of competitive interactions in this system, and we discuss the implications of such behavioral indirect effects in the study of ecological communities; Our results also illustrate the futility of attempting to partition the effects of competitors and predators, as both competitors and the non-lethal presence of predators significantly affected growth rates and death by starvation of small larvae. Finally, our results illustrate how individual behavioral responses may be translated to community and ecosystem properties.","UNIV TORONTO,ERINDALE COLL,DEPT ZOOL,MISSISSAUGA,ON L5L 1C6,CANADA","Werner, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,NAT SCI BLDG,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Proposed mechanisms include preferential predation by starfish and physical disturbances like wave shear. However, an examination of mussel beds along the Californian and Oregonian coastline revealed that virtually all species facing competitive exclusion on the rock are present on the shells of M. californianus. Therefore, while diversity on the rock would decline, that of the community would change little, if at all, were mussels to occupy all rock surfaces. Although the same species are found on the two substrata, their abundances differ on them. However, for the commonest species the sign and magnitude of this difference is different on the two sides of Pt Conception, California. This suggests that the impact of mechanisms which govern the amount of area occupied by mussels will vary depending upon location. While there are several possible explanations for this geographical difference, data are presented suggesting it may be due to differences in the relative hardness of the mussel and rock, or to differences in abundance of the territorial limpet Lottia gigantea Sowerby.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT BIOL SCI,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106",,,,,,,,54,74,76,1,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Introduced predators and pathogens have long been recognized for their direct negative effects on birds, but introduced amphibians can reach high densities on islands with no native amphibians, where they interact with native species. The coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui), introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in the late 1980s, could have significant impacts on birds because it is fully terrestrial and achieves high densities. Coquis have been hypothesized to compete with native birds for invertebrate prey, but could also serve as a novel food resource for birds that consume small vertebrates. To test whether coquis measurably affect bird abundance, we conducted point counts of birds in coqui-invaded and adjacent uninvaded plots across 15 sites on the island of Hawaii, USA. We used N-mixture models to estimate the effect of coqui presence and density on the abundances of both native and nonnative birds, while controlling for possible habitat differences between plots with and without coquis. We found that coquis were associated with similar to 35% higher abundance of nonnative birds in general, and more specifically generalist birds that sometimes consume small vertebrates. We suggest that generalist birds increase in abundance with coquis primarily because coquis serve as an abundant food resource. While 4 native bird species co-occurred with coquis, native bird abundance (20% of our total observations) did not show a difference across coqui-invaded and uninvaded plots. Coquis do not appear to be important competitors with native birds in Hawaii, but the frogs are associated with increased abundances of some nonnative birds, which could induce undesirable ecosystem impacts.","[Smith, Robyn L.; Beard, Karen H.; Koons, David N.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Smith, Robyn L.; Beard, Karen H.; Koons, David N.] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Koons, David N.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Beard, KH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Beard, KH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",karen.beard@usu.edu,"Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011","Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495","USDA-APHIS National Wildlife Research Center; Ecology Center at Utah State University; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University [8937]","This research was funded by the USDA-APHIS National Wildlife Research Center, and the Ecology Center at Utah State University.

In CNP, H. bimaculata occurs in the absence of other fish species and major invertebrate predators along an approximately 1000 m elevation gradient. This allowed for the examination of trait variation along the gradient without the confounding effects of interspecific interactions or habitat patchiness. Heterandria bimaculata exhibited traits characteristic of a low-predation environment: balanced sex ratio, slow growth, late maturity and large female size. Females produced more, smaller eggs from upstream to downstream, but overall reproductive allocation remained constant along the gradient. Maximum male length and annual growth rates increased from upstream to downstream, but female growth showed no trend. The patterns of growth and reproductive allocation tradeoff are consistent with predicted response to a longitudinally-increasing productivity gradient in which food resources become more abundant downstream. Macrobrachium and Bellastoma could have caused some predation, but were sparse and patchily distributed. Fish density remained fairly constant among elevations; if food resources were limiting in upstream habitats, per-capita resource availability would be lower and density-dependent competition would drive selection for larger but fewer, more competitive offspring. Future work should quantify longitudinal changes in productivity and conduct experiments to decouple the effects of stream order and fish density dependence.","[Olinger, Charles T.; Peoples, Brandon K.; Frimpong, Emmanuel A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Peoples, Brandon K.] Operat Wallacea, Wallace House, Spilsby PE23 4EX, Lincs, England","Frimpong, EA (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",colinger@vt.edu; bpeoples@vt.edu; frimp@vt.edu,,,Operation Wallacea,"This project was funded by Operation Wallacea.

G. complanata breeds in advance of H. stagnalis and maintains a body size advantage throughout their annual life-cycle. In experiments, conducted at 14-degrees-C and a photoperiod of 16 hrs L: 8 hrs D, three size classes of leeches of each species were each exposed to each of three size classes of each of five prey species, viz. Tubifex sp., Chironomus sp., Asellus aquaticus, Lymnaea peregra and Potamopyrgus jenkinsi. For each prey species, three different types of experiments were performed: one leech exposed to four prey individuals; four leeches of the same species with sixteen prey; and two leeches of each species with sixteen prey. In the first experiment, all sizes of G. complanata were capable of feeding on all sizes of the prey types offered; the same was true for H. stagnalis with exceptions of feeding on large A. aquaticus and large L. peregra. For both species, but especially for G. complanata, there was a trend within each size class of leech for decreasing proportions of fed leeches with increasing prey size, and within each size class of prey for an increasing proportion of fed leeches with increasing leech size; however there were several exceptions to these trends. Both leeches fed extensively on Tubifex sp. but there were significant differences in the proportions feeding on other prey types; G. complanata fed more on A. aquaticus and the two snail species, and less on Chironomus, than H. stagnalis. The effect of increasing the number of leech individuals from one to four individuals, of the same or mixed species, had little effect on the proportion of leeches which had fed. It is concluded that large G. complanata will have access to large individuals of certain prey taxa denied H. stagnalis, which may lessen the intensity of interspecific competition.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,4,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN 21,1994,273,2,,,,,67,75,,10.1007/BF00006848,,,9,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,MX529,WOS:A1994MX52900001,,,,,2021-09-27,

This view is proficiently interpreted with the classic Lotka-Volterra model that successfully describes the effects of changes in consumption rates due to changes in resource and consumer population densities. These effects are resulted in perpetual oscillatory dynamics of both the population densities, and the extent of the effects for given initial densities is measured by the oscillating frequency determined by the model parameters. But in many ecosystems, it has often observed a steep decline and delayed recovery in resource population that cannot be explained by the traditional Lotka-Volterra model. Foraging habits and behaviors of a consumer population may facilitate others, those usually do not affect them directly, to feed on the same resource and then to reproduce successfully. Such commensal consumers (facilitated population) can heavily influence the rate of resource exploitation and thereby affect the usual resource-consumer cycles. While involving such commensal consumer-induced effects, called here commensal mediation, into the Lotka-Volterra type models, it shows that the commensal mediation can have stabilizing or destabilizing effects on resource dynamics depending on the strength of interactions and the conditions in which the interactions occur. In the natural ecosystems where the growth rate of resource population depends on its own density even in absence of consumers, the commensal mediation provides a destabilizing effect on resource dynamics; increasing commensal population density increases the amplitude of resource fluctuations and the time laps from one peak to the next. On the other hand, in the managed ecosystems where the growth rate of resource population is expected to be maintained at a constant level in absence of consumers, the commensal mediation provides stabilizing effect at a certain condition; with a given restriction on the consumer population, decreasing mortality of the commensal population can stabilize the resource population dynamics at a stable, steady-state. Moreover, while the resource population experiences saturation effect, resource-consumer interactions with the commensal mediation exhibit a range of dynamical behaviours starting from stable equilibrium, then damped oscillation, to limit cycles as the resource carrying capacity increases from a critical level. In addition, commensal mediations with both controlling facilitator consumer population and resource harvesting are analyzed separately and the results are discussed for some exemplified managed and natural ecosystems.","[Chakraborty, Amit; Liu, Quan-Xing; Li, Bai-Lian] Univ Calif Riverside, Ecol Complex & Modeling Lab, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Chakraborty, Amit] Cent Univ Rajasthan, Sch Math Stat & Computat Sci, Bandarsindri, Rajasthan, India; [Shi, Pei-Jian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Quan-Xing] North Univ China, Dept Math, Taiyuan 030051, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qing-Pei] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Forest Sci, Nanchang 330045, Peoples R China","Chakraborty, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Ecol Complex & Modeling Lab, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",amitc.envsc@yahoo.com; bai-lian.li@ucr.edu,,,U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0421530]; Long-Term Ecological Research Program (Sevilleta LTER) [DEB-0620482]; University of California Agricultural Experiment StationUniversity of California System,"The authors are grateful to X.S.

Here we discuss these impacts by drawing on examples from freshwater ecosystems, and argue that future research should quantify changes in such trophic interactions (i.e. the links in a food web), rather than simply focusing on traditional measures of diversity or abundance (i.e. the nodes in a food web). We conceptualise the impacts of invaders on trophic links as either direct consumption, indirect trophic effects (e.g. cascading interactions, competition) or indirect nontrophic effects (e.g. behaviour mediated). We then discuss how invader impacts on trophic links are context-dependent, varying with invader traits (e.g. feeding rates), abiotic variables (e.g. temperature, pH) and the traits of the receiving community (e.g. predators or competitors). Co-occurring invasive species and other environmental stressors, such as climate change, will also influence invader impacts on trophic links. Finally, we discuss the available methods to identify new food web interactions following invasion and to quantify how invasive species disrupt existing feeding links. Methods include direct observations in the field, laboratory trials (e.g. to quantify functional responses) and controlled mesocosm experiments to elucidate impacts on food webs. Field studies which use tracer techniques, such as stable isotope analyses, allow diet characterisation of both invaders and interacting native species in the wild. We conclude that invasive species often drastically alter food webs by creating and disrupting trophic links, and future research should be directed particularly towards disentangling the effects of invaders from other environmental stressors.","[Jackson, M.

The introduction of species can be seen as an uncontrolled experiment of the addition of species. Introduced species lead to multiple changes, frequently threatening the native biodiversity. However, little is known about their direct effect on the upper level of the food web. In this study we review empirical data on the predator preyrelationship between the introduced lagomorphs and their consumers, and use meta-analytical tools to quantify the strength of their interactions. We expect that exotic lagomorphs will destabilize food webs, affect ecological processes and compromise the conservation of the invaded regions. We found 136 studies on the diet of 43 species of predators that consume lagomorphs as exotic preys in South America and Oceania. We found an average exotic lagomorphs predator link of 20 % which indicates a strong interaction, given that the average for the strongest links with native prey (when lagomorphs are not included in the predator diet) is about 24%. Additionally, this last link decreases to 17% when lagomorphs are present. When lagomorphs arrive in a new environment they may become the most important resource for predators, producing an unstable equilibrium in the novel food web. Any disruption of this interaction could have catastrophic consequences for the native diversity by directly impacting predators or indirectly impacting native preys by apparent competition. Eradication or any change in their abundances should be carefully considered in conservation actions since those will have great impacts on predator populations and ultimately in the whole communities.","[Barbar, Facundo; Lambertucci, Sergio A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Grp Biol Conservac, Ecotono Lab, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Hiraldo, Fernando] CSIC Espana, Dept Biol Conservac, Estn Biol Donana, Seville, Spain","Barbar, F (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Grp Biol Conservac, Ecotono Lab, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",facundo.barbar@gmail.com,"Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019","LAMBERTUCCI, SERGIO/0000-0002-2624-2185", [PIP 00758];  [PICT 0725/2014],"lThe authors received financial support from PIP 00758 and PICT 0725/2014.

The aim of this laboratory study was to quantitate the individual and combined effects of the generalist predator Forficula auricularia L. (Dermaptera: Forficulidae) and the specialist Episyrphus balteatus De Geer (Diptera: Syrphidae) on the population growth of the rosy apple aphid (RAA), Dysaphis plantaginea Passerini (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The experiment was carried out using apple seedlings with five levels of initial RAA infestation. In most cases, both predator species (alone and in combination) were able to reduce RAA densities or to keep them at their initial level. This suppression effect was greater when RAA densities were low and resulted in near-complete mortality of the RAA colony after 4-6 days. Without predators, RAA population size almost doubled within 10 days, whereas with predators, RAA population size was reduced by about 20 (alone) and 50% (in combination). Although RAA numbers in the two-predators treatment were ca. 81% of RAA numbers in the one-predator treatment for pooled numbers across dates and densities, the difference between the two treatments was not significant. Some predator mortality occurred with first and second instars of the syrphid larvae and only at the two lowest initial RAA infestation levels. This mortality may be explained by inadequate food supply, intraguild predation (IGP) (in 13.3% of the possible cases), or both. However, the incidence of IGP under natural conditions could be even less frequent, as both predators were never observed on the same leaf.","[Dib, Hazem] Univ Damascus, Fac Agr, Biol Control Studies & Res Ctr, Dept Plant Protect, Damascus, Syria; [Jamont, Marie; Sauphanor, Benoit; Capowiez, Yvan] INRA, Unite PSH, Equipe Ecol Prod Integree, Domaine St Paul, Site Agroparc, F-84914 Avignon 9, France","Dib, H (corresponding author), Univ Damascus, Fac Agr, Biol Control Studies & Res Ctr, Dept Plant Protect, Damascus, Syria.",hazem802005@gmail.com,,,,,,50,10,10,0,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

The propensity of the newly-established mosquito Aedes japonicus to inhabit rock pools throughout the eastern United States provides a natural setting for interspecific larval competition with the native Aedes atropalpus. A laboratory experiment conducted in simulated rock pools to evaluate larval interactions between and within these two species suggested that the performance of both species was more significantly impacted by intraspecific conditions than interspecific conditions of the same mosquito density. Aedes atropalpus was apparently more sensitive to larval densities than Ae. japonicus because it reproduces autogenously, requiring a lengthened period of larval development to obtain nutrient reserves for egg development, which may ultimately put Ae. atropalpus at a disadvantage under larval conditions of competition and limited resources. Excessively stressful experimental conditions, as evidenced by reduced body size, and thus fecundity and estimated finite rate of increase, may have obscured the effects of larval competition between these species. The impact of larval competition between these species in rock pool communities warrants further investigation under more ecologically realistic experimental conditions.

Seabirds and pinnipeds are vulnerable to reductions in prey availability, especially during the breeding season when spatial constraints limit their adaptive capacity. There are growing concerns about the effects of fisheries on prey availability in regions where large commercial fisheries target forage fish. 2. For breeding seabirds and pinnipeds, prey availability depends on a combination of abundance, accessibility, patchiness and distance from the colony. An understanding of the aspects of prey availability that determine foraging success is essential for the design of effective management responses. 3. We used a mechanistic individual-based foraging model based on observed data for two sea-bird species, the Peruvian Booby Sula variegata and Guanay Cormorant Phalacrocorax bougainvilliorum, to simulate the foraging patterns of seabirds feeding on schooling fish. We ran the model over simulated prey fields representing eight possible combinations of high or low prey abundance, shallow or deep prey, and broadly distributed or spatially concentrated prey. 4. The results highlight the importance of the accessibility of prey. Depth distribution was the primary factor determining modelled foraging success for both species, followed by abundance, and then spatial configuration. 5. Synthesis and applications. The individual-based foraging model provides a spatially explicit framework for assessing the effects of fisheries on the foraging success of seabirds and other central place foragers, and for evaluating the potential effectiveness of marine-protected areas and other fisheries management strategies for safeguarding central place foragers in dynamic ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that broad-scale fisheries management strategies that maintain forage fish above critical biomass levels are essential, but may need to be supplemented by targeted actions, such as time-area closures, when environmental conditions lead to low prey abundance or reduce prey accessibility for seabirds or pinnipeds of conservation concern. The individual-based foraging model is adaptable and could be reconfigured for application to other species and systems.","[Boyd, Charlotte; Hunt, George L., Jr.; Punt, Andre E.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Grunbaum, Daniel] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, 1503 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Weimerskirch, Henri] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Bertrand, Sophie] UM2, Inst Rech Dev, UMR248, MARBEC,CNRS,IFREMER,IRD, Ave Jean Monnet,BP 171, F-34203 Sete, France","Boyd, C (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",boydchar@u.washington.edu,"Weimerskirch, Henri/F-5562-2013; Hunt, George/V-9423-2019; Weimerskirch, Henri/K-7306-2019; bertrand, sophie/F-4161-2012","Weimerskirch, Henri/0000-0002-0457-586X; bertrand, sophie/0000-0003-1976-3799",U.S. Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-11-1-0149],"The authors thank J.

However, many field observations show a weak or non-existent effect of group size on per capita mortality rates. Herein we resolve this apparent paradox. We found that Pieris brassicae larvae defended themselves less readily when in groups than when alone, in that they were more reluctant to regurgitate in response to simulated attacks and produced less regurgitant. Furthermore, a simple model demonstrates that this reluctance was sufficient to cancel out the benefit from being in a group. This conditional strategy can be understood in terms of the costs and benefits of defences. For grouped individuals, defence is less often required because attack rates are lower and the costs of defence may be higher due to competition for resources. These phenomena are likely to be widespread in facultatively gregarious species that utilise anti-predator defences.","[Higginson, A.

An experiment, using a series of 0.25-m(2) arenas, was designed to test for inter- and intraspecific exploitative competition. Experimental treatments were established in the arenas in late July. Treatments involved stocking recently hatched spiderlings of each species alone, and with both species together at natural (10 spiderlings per arena) and two times the natural densities. In September the arenas were searched for Pardosa spiderlings, and the survival and mass gain of each species were determined. Other predatory arthropods, and Collembola, a common prey of young wolf spiders, were counted in the arenas before the experimental treatments were established and at the end of the experiment. No evidence for competitive interaction's was uncovered, but spiderling survival was 29% for P. moesta and 20% for P. mackenziana, suggesting other mortality factors (e.g., cannibalism, intraguild predation) may be important. Top-down effects (predatory arthropods) had no effect on Pardosa survival.

Management approaches also require comprehension of temporal variability in spatial distributions that can occur over shorter time scales, such as inter-annually or seasonally. Focussing on the Southern Ocean, one of the most rapidly changing environments on Earth, we used Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and satellite ocean data to reconstruct the likely historical foraging habitats of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) from three populations during the non-breeding winter (Marion Island, Bird Island and Cape Shirreff), to assess whether habitat quality has changed in recent decades. We then quantified temporal variability in distributions to assess overlap with management areas (CCAMLR Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) and the potential for competition with fisheries. Despite notable physical ocean changes, the quality of foraging habitat during the non-breeding season has remained relatively consistent over 20 years at Marion and Bird Islands, but less so at Cape Shirreff, where reduced sea ice cover has improved habitat accessibility. Spatio-temporally explicit SDMs identified variability in habitats across the winter. Some areas overlapped significantly with fisheries activities, suggesting a potential for competition for prey resources at several key periods. A significant component of core habitat at all populations was not within the CCAMLR Convention Area. Although organisations such as CCAMLR adopt a precautionary, ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, changes to the physical environment and developments in the fishing industry can affect how dependant species are impacted. The hindcasting of historical spatial distributions shown here are baselines against which future changes can be assessed. Given recent proposals for a system of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Southern Ocean, our results can be used in the design and evaluation of MPAs, be they static or dynamic. Our study also demonstrates that the core habitat of species may fall outside of areas of active management, providing an important context for the interpretation of monitoring programs and management efforts.","[Arthur, Benjamin; Hindell, Mark; Lea, Mary-Anne] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, 20 Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia; [Arthur, Benjamin; Hindell, Mark; Lea, Mary-Anne] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, 20 Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia; [Bester, Marthan; De Bruyn, P.

Snails and tadpoles reared alone and combined at ambient densities in artificial pools revealed that costs of coexisting differed between taxa. Snails invested resources into growth and survival at the expense of reproduction when with anuran competitors, whereas tadpoles exhibited slowed development and decreased biomass per pool in combined-species treatments. These negative effects were likely a result of food limitation, considering that herbivory by both taxa significantly reduced algal abundance relative to ungrazed controls. Herbivory by both species also affected the assemblage of benthic algae. Diatoms, particularly Nitzschia spp. were the predominant algae in both single-species treatments, whereas the green algae Eudorina and Oedogonium comprised most of the community biovolume in combined-species treatments. The filamentous green algae Cladophora was dominant in ungrazed controls. A survey of 16 isolated pools along three third-ol der streams revealed patterns of snail egg production and benthic algal assemblage similar to treatment effects in the artificial pool experiment. The survey also indicated that snails and tadpoles seldom co-occur in these pools; thus competition between them may be infrequent. Linkages between phosphate availability predation and habitat persistence seem particularly important in mediating competitive interactions between these taxa.","UNIV LOUISVILLE, DEPT BIOL, LOUISVILLE, KY 40292 USA","Holomuzki, JR (corresponding author), TRANSYLVANIA UNIV, DIV NAT SCI & MATH, LEXINGTON, KY 40508 USA.",,,,,,,46,14,15,0,14,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,1938-4238,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

We tested a set of hypotheses to predict egg-laying behaviour in Aedes triseriatus in the field in Massachusetts. These hypotheses reflect three main themes: females avoid competitive or predatory threats to their larvae; females judge larvae or eggs as cues to future permanence or productivity within a treehole; and females are either opportunistic ovipositors, or hedge their bets by scattering their eggs in multiple habitats. We predicted that mosquitoes might vary in their response depending on whether their offspring will hatch immediately or enter diapause and hatch the next year. 2. We stocked artificial treeholes with larvae at four densities ranging from 0 to 90 larvae per habitat for four trials in 1992 and eight trials in 1994. In 1992, we added predatory Anopheles barberi larvae to half the replicates of each density level. In 1994, we tested for an interaction between egg and larval density by stocking additional traps with eggs in batches of 0, 20 and 200, and larvae in densities as in the previous trials. 3. The population revealed a significant interaction between time of year and larval density. More eggs accumulated in traps stocked with fewer larvae (0 or 15) early in the season, but females showed a slight positive response to higher densities (45 or 90) later on, after their offspring were all likely to enter diapause. These results suggest that potential ambiguities of larval cues,with indications of habitat permanence as well as adversity of future competition, are resolved by females. Females did not respond differentially to the predatory Anopheles barberi larvae. 4. The estimated batch size obtained in oviposition traps did not differ from the fecundity of field-caught females allowed to oviposit under confinement in laboratory vials, suggesting that bet-hedging by scattering of eggs among multiple habitats did not occur. 5. An unexpected result, a positive response to higher egg densities, is discussed in light of studies on other insects. This result conflicts with our predictions based on females choosing less competitive environments for their larvae and also conflicts with previously published accounts of avoidance of eggs in this species. Preference for habitats with conspecific eggs might be explained if eggs reflect habitat stability or if larvae gain an advantage from being in an aggregation. Neither hypothesis is resolved by the present study.","Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; Clark Univ, Dept Biol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Edgerly, JS (corresponding author), Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",jedgerlyrooks@mailer.scu.edu,,,,,,53,67,71,0,26,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Based on count data compiled from Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from 1974 to 2012, Christmas Bird Count (CBC) collected from 1914 to 2013, and hunter data from Annual Game Take Survey (AGTS) for years 1948-2010, ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in California have experienced substantial declines in agricultural environments. Using a modeling approach that integrates all three forms of survey data into a joint response abundance index, we found pheasant abundance was related to the amount of harvested and unharvested crop land, types of crops produced, amount of total pesticide applied, minimum temperature, precipitation, and numbers of avian competitors and predators. Specifically, major changes in agricultural practices over the last three decades were associated with declines in pheasant numbers and likely reflected widespread loss of habitat. For example, increases in cropland were associated with increased pheasant abundance during early years of study but this effect decreased through time, such that no association in recent years was evidenced. A post hoc analysis revealed that crops beneficial to pheasant abundance (e.g., barley) have declined substantially in recent decades and were replaced by less advantageous crops (e.g., nut trees). An additional analysis using a restricted data set (1990-2013) indicated recent negative impacts on pheasant numbers associated with land use practices were also associated with relatively high levels of pesticide application. Our results may provide valuable information for management policies aimed at reducing widespread declines in pheasant populations in California and may be applicable to other avian species within agricultural settings. Furthermore, this general analytical approach is not limited to pheasants and could be applied to other taxa for which multiple survey data sources exist.","[Coates, Peter S.; Brussee, Brianne E.; Fleskes, Joseph P.; Dwight, Ian A.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Dixon, CA USA; [Howe, Kristy B.] Nevada Nat Heritage Program, Carson, CA USA; [Meshriy, Matt G.; Gardner, Scott C.] Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Sacramento, CA USA; [Connelly, Daniel P.] Pheasants Forever, St Paul, MN USA","Coates, PS (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Dixon Field Stn, Dixon, CA 95620 USA.",pcoates@usgs.gov,,"Dwight, Ian/0000-0002-8393-5391",California Department of Fish and Wildlife,"We particularly want to thank numerous individuals who responded to data requests and S.

However, this conclusion lacked generality due to limited replication at the site level. We explored how grazing and algal colonization and growth in different zones and multiple sites in intertidal communities varied in relation to processes varying on local to mesoscales, including oceanographic variation. Our approach employed the comparative-experimental method, in which identically-designed and replicated experiments are performed at multiple sites spanning the environmental gradient of interest. In a limpet-algae-barnacle interaction web, we tested the hypothesis that top-down and bottom-up effects were inversely related along the Oregon coast. To distinguish between the alternatives of large-scale oceanographic forcing vs. local control, our experiments spanned scales of meters (between mid and low zones), kilometers (seven sites), 10's to 100's of km (three regions), and similar to 260 km (central and southern coasts). Identically designed and executed experiments on effects and rates of grazing were conducted in a southern coast region of persistent upwelling and two central coast regions, one with intermittent upwelling in an area of weak offshore currents, and another with intermittent upwelling in an area of strong offshore cur-rents. Grazer effects and grazing rates varied on all scales, indicating a complex interplay of processes operating at zone, site, regional, and coastal scales. Grazing was generally highest in all mid zones and in the low zone at the middle region (Cape Perpetura) on the central coast. Growth of early successional colonists tended to be higher at the northern and southern regions (Capes Foulweather and Blanco). Grazers had no effect on barnacle cover, but their foraging was inhibited by high densities of barnacles. Differences in grazing appear to be a complex consequence of direct and indirect effects of variable oceanographic conditions, limpet recruitment, and barnacle abundance. In contrast to positive associations between predation strength and the magnitude of prey subsidies, higher grazing strength was generally associated with lower magnitude of bottom-up effects and vice versa. Hence in this system predator-prey (sea star-filter feeder) and herbivore-plant (limpet-microalgae) interactions evidently respond differently to ecological subsidies.

Here, we examine how predation can regulate fouling communities on artificial substrates in the coast of Brazil. Specifically, we tested whether predators limit colonization and establishment of introduced species. A predation experiment using plastic plates as experimental replicates (predator excluded and not excluded) was carried out in Ceara, Bahia, So Paulo and Santa Catarina, between 3A degrees S and 27A degrees S. Ninety-eight species colonized the plates, 14 of which were introduced. While species richness was similar among the treatments (except in Santa Catarina), community structure varied by treatment and introduced species were less abundant in the predation treatment at all sites. Also, predation was selective and controlled introduced, poorly defended, species, specifically ascidians. Thus, biotic resistance driven by predation was not ubiquitous but apparently targets one group of major economic and environmental impact. As a consequence, introduced barnacles were released from competition with dominant ascidians and thus the ecosystem service (biotic resistance) performed by fish alone was unable to completely avoid or control the introduction of non-native species. Control measures must rely on various approaches, but if we want fish to contribute in this control, it is very important to conserve the local native assembly of predators in order to reap their benefits in this ecosystem service.","[Kremer, Laura Pioli] Inst Fed Santa Catarina Campus Itajai, Ave Vereador Abrahao Joao Francisco 3899, BR-88307303 Itajai, SC, Brazil; [da Rocha, Rosana Moreira] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Zool, CP 19020, BR-81531980 Curitiba, PR, Brazil","Kremer, LP (corresponding author), Inst Fed Santa Catarina Campus Itajai, Ave Vereador Abrahao Joao Francisco 3899, BR-88307303 Itajai, SC, Brazil.",laurapkremer@gmail.com,"da Rocha, Rosana Moreira/AAD-8390-2019; Rocha, Rosana M./H-7989-2012","da Rocha, Rosana Moreira/0000-0001-6712-7960; Rocha, Rosana M./0000-0001-6712-7960","Bentos em regioes portuarias ao longo da Costa Brasileira: biodiversidade, filogeografia and aspectos de bioinvasao [PROCAD-150/2007]; National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development - CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [305201/2014-0, 552037/2010-9]","We thank Lotufo TMC, Menegola C, Migotto AE, Silveira Jr N and their lab teams for their support and help in the field.

The primary hosts are lodgepole and ponderosa pines. Recent rising temperatures, however, have allowed these beetles to survive at higher elevations more commonly than in the past, thus threatening whitebark pine, a keystone species of high elevation ecosystems and a highly susceptible host. 2 The extent to which risk in whitebark pine stands may be mitigated by predators or competitors is unknown. We compared the communities of coleopteran predators and competitors of D. ponderosae in sites of varying elevation and species composition in Montana and Wyoming, U. S. A. Sites were selected for low to moderate levels of tree mortality, where the potential of natural enemies to prevent D. ponderosae from transitioning into outbreaks would bemost relevant. Insect populations were evaluated using unbaited flight- intercept panel traps and pheromone- baitedmultiple funnel traps. 3 Only the predatory beetle species Thanasimus undatulus ( Coleoptera: Cleridae) was captured in these non- outbreak stands. Based on the pheromone- baited traps, predator load was higher at low- elevation stands dominated by lodgepole pine than high- elevation stands dominated by whitebark pine. 4 Phloeophagous insects were more prevalent in the mid- and higher- elevation sites, although most of the species captured would not likely compete substantially for resources with D. ponderosae. We also observed differences in species assemblages between the Montana and Wyoming sites, as well as differing utilities of baited and unbaited traps at low versus moderate tree mortality levels.","[Krause, Adam M.; Raffa, Kenneth F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Townsend, Philip A.; Lee, Young] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Russell Labs, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raffa, KF (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",kfraffa@wisc.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774",University of Wisconsin-Madison Beers Bascom Fellowship; College of Agricultural and Life Sciences; Office of the Vice Chanceller of Research and Graduate Education (VCRGE) Bridge to the Future Program,"Hannah Hubanks, Austin Pethan, Dylan Willis, Maj-brit Nelson, Nichole Boyea, Ryan Geygan and Erin McMahan (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Departments of Entomology and Forest & Wildlife Ecology) assisted with the field sampling, insect identification and data entry.

Occupation rates and the reproductive biology of the blue tit in sample woodlots outside the distribution area of the common dormouse were used as a control in sample areas where the two species were syntopic. A selection test showed that the two species, when living in syntopy, actively chose the small nest-boxes, thus overlapping in the use of the same spatial resource. The experimental exclusion of the common dormouse from nest-boxes caused an increase of blue tit occupation rate. Once the effect of nest-box density was removed, complementary density changes between the two species clearly appeared. The population cycle of both species in the areas of syntopy showed a swinging pattern, i.e. in areas or during years of common dormouse high abundance few blue tits bred and vice versa. The abundance of the blue tit was affected not only by common dormouse abundance, but also by some habitat and climate variables. Blue tits had low breeding success and a high percentage of nest failure (38% in syntopy vs 3% in control areas), owing to nest destruction and predation by common dormouse, as well as probably also by other rodents (23%) and Martes martes (15%). Another experiment, using stuffed models, showed that the blue tit recognized the common dormouse as an enemy, and behaved as if confronted by a competitor or predator species to protect their nests.","Univ Palermo, Dept Biol Anim, I-90123 Palermo, Italy","Sara, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Biol Anim, Via Archirafi-18, I-90123 Palermo, Italy.",mausar@unipa.it,"Sara, Maurizio/H-2662-2012","Sara, Maurizio/0000-0003-4274-422X",,,,41,22,24,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

The process of stocking, as well as the unfamiliarity with novel ecological conditions and the interactions with resident fish may affect translocated individuals, leading to alterations of behaviours and causing fitness impacts. Our objectives were to investigate how aquatic top predators behaviourally establish themselves and compete with resident individuals following introduction in a novel lake environment and to investigate the resulting fitness consequences. Using high-resolution acoustic telemetry, we conducted whole-lake experiments and compared the activity, activity-space size and fate of translocated and resident individuals in two model top predators, the northern pikeEsox lucius(n = 160) and European catfishSilurus glanis(n = 33). Additionally, we compared the reproductive success of translocated and resident northern pike. The experiment was conducted with large (adult) individuals of different origins, resilient to predation, but subject to agonistic interactions and competition with resident fish. Over a period of several months, the translocated catfish exhibited consistently larger activity-space sizes than resident catfish, but did not differ from residents in activity and survival. The pike from one of the two translocated origins we tested also showed elevated space-use, and both translocated origins revealed higher mortality rates than their resident conspecifics, indicating maladjustment to their novel environment. When non-resident pike reproduced, they overwhelmingly produced hybrid offspring with resident fish, indicating that introductions fostered gene flow of non-native genes. Our study indicates that fish introductions result in behavioural and fitness impacts even in large-bodied top predators that experience low levels of natural predation risk.","[Monk, Christopher T.; Cheret, Bernard; Czapla, Philipp; Huehn, Daniel; Hagemann, Robert; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany; [Klefoth, Thomas] Angler Assoc Lower Saxony, Hannover, Germany; [Eschbach, Erik] Thunen Inst Fisheries Ecol, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Berlin, Germany; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Crop & Anim Sci, Div Integrat Fisheries Management, Berlin, Germany","Monk, CT (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany.",monk@igb-berlin.de,,"Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X",Leibniz Community [SAW-2013-IGB-2]; Besatzfisch (German Federal Ministry for Education and Research),"Leibniz Community, Grant/Award Number: SAW-2013-IGB-2; Besatzfisch (German Federal Ministry for Education and Research)",,157,4,4,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Despite the importance of rodent communities, few investigations have explored the effects of increasing anthropogenic modifications to the landscape on rodents. Throughout the western United States, the construction of artificial water developments to benefit game species is commonplace. While benefits for certain species have been documented, several researchers recently hypothesized that these developments may cause unintentional negative effects to desert-adapted species and communities. To test this idea, we sampled rodents near to and distant from wildlife water developments over 4 consecutive summers. We employed an asymmetrical before-after-control-impact (BACI) design with sampling over 4 summers to determine if water developments influenced total rodent abundance. We performed an additional exploratory analysis to determine if factors other than free water influenced rodent abundance. We found no evidence that water developments impacted rodent abundance. Rodent abundance was primarily driven by vegetation type and year of sampling. Our findings suggested that water developments on our study area do not represent a significant disturbance to rodent abundance and that rodent abundance was influenced by the vegetative community and temporal factors linked to precipitation and primary plant production. Our findings represent one of the 1st efforts to determine the effects of an anthropogenic activity on the rodent community utilizing a manipulation design.","[Kluever, Bryan M.; Dempsey, Steven J.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Gese, Eric M.] Utah State Univ, USDA, Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv,Dept Wildland Reso, Wildlife Serv,Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Kluever, BM (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",klueverb@gmail.com,,,"Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense; U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, Environmental Programs, Dugway, Utah; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Wildlife Services, National Wildlife Research Center; Utah State University, Logan, Utah; Quinney College of Natural Resources, Utah State University, Logan, Utah; TE Inc.; American Society of Mammalogists; Utah Chapter of the Wildlife Society; Endangered Species Mitigation Fund of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife Resources, Salt Lake City, Utah","Funding and logistical support provided by the Department of Defense, U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, Environmental Programs, Dugway, Utah, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Wildlife Services, National Wildlife Research Center, and Utah State University, Logan, Utah.

Despite these ascribed significances for behavioral, population, and community ecology, most tests of the search image concept have involved operant conditioning in laboratory experiments. We use foraging theory to model the consequences of a forager's behavior if it were using a search image to detect two types of patchily distributed prey. This requires us to distinguish between search images that depend only on the forager's encounter with specific food types (passive) and search images that involve the forager's choice of a specific search mode (active). Both active and passive search images predict that the forager will appear to use a resource patch containing both food types less thoroughly than patches containing just one of the food types. The giving-up densities on the two foods in a mixed patch will be higher than a weighted average of the giving-up densities on the two foods in single-food patches. We tested this prediction on free-living fox squirrels using triplets of feeding patches containing sunflower seeds, granulated peanuts, and a mixture of both, respectively. We compared the amount of food remaining in the patch (giving-up density) containing both food items with the patches containing only sunflower and only peanuts. Our results provide no evidence for the presence of a search image in the foraging behavior of fox squirrels.","UNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT BIOL SCI, CHICAGO, IL 60607 USA",,,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012",,,,,40,26,26,0,22,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.
