Competition exclusion will occur when habitat overlap between sympatric species is high. In this study, we investigated nesting habitat overlap between internationally protected diurnal tree-nesting avian predators of central Europe, namely, White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Lesser Spotted Eagle (Aquila pomarina), Black Stork (Ciconia nigra), and Osprey (Pandion haliaetus). We found significantly different nesting habitats among the study species and suggest that this could be a consequence of the resource-based segregation, but not a consequence of asymmetrical interspecific competition. The results also show that habitat of the recovering populations of White-tailed Eagle overlapped with the habitat used by the Lesser Spotted Eagle, Black Stork, and Osprey to varying extents with a niche overlap values being below the competition exclusion threshold. Nevertheless, we suggest that competition by White-tailed Eagle at a population level may limit Osprey, though not Lesser Spotted Eagle or Black Stork.","[Treinys, Rimgaudas] Nat Res Ctr, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dementavicius, Deivis; Rumbutis, Saulius] Fdn Dev Nat Protect Projects, LT-03150 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dementavicius, Deivis; Rumbutis, Saulius] T Ivanauskas Zool Museum, Dept Ornithol, LT-44253 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Stoncius, Darius] Lithuanian Fund Nat, LT-03218 Vilnius, Lithuania","Treinys, R (corresponding author), Nat Res Ctr, Akad 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania.",rimga.t@gmail.com,"Mozgeris, Gintautas/W-2850-2019","Mozgeris, Gintautas/0000-0002-8480-6006",Ministry of Environment of the Republic of LithuaniaResearch Council of Lithuania (LMTLT); joint-stock company Stora Enso Miskas,"We thank the private limited companies Litagra and Litagros Prekyba, UNDP Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme, and the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Lithuania for financial support for the monitoring of White-tailed Eagle.

In such environments, population structure is induced by the mixture at any location of individuals with different amounts of stored nutrient, acquired elsewhere in the habitat. Focusing on phytoplankton competing for phosphorus in a partially mixed water column, an individual-based Lagrangian model is used to represent this population structure, and partial differential equations that approximate competitive dynamics are constructed by averaging over this population structure. Although the approximation model overestimates the benefit of resource storage to competitive fitness, both approaches predict that species with high storage capacity are favored by periodic resource pulses that are short lived but large in magnitude. Such storage specialists can competitively exclude or coexist with species that have advantages in maximal nutrient uptake and population growth rates. For very infrequent resource pulses, competitive dynamics become close to neutral. Thus, persistence of diverse species that are differentiated in nutrient storage and uptake capabilities is favored by resource pulses occurring with periods that are many times the average generation time of competitors.","[Grover, James P.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Grover, James P.] Univ Texas Arlington, Program Environm & Earth Sci, Arlington, TX 76019 USA","Grover, JP (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",grover@uta.edu,,"Grover, James/0000-0003-2425-6927","National Center for Theoretical Sciences, National Tsing-Hua University, Taiwan","I thank the National Center for Theoretical Sciences, National Tsing-Hua University, Taiwan, for partial financial support and S.-B.

One approach is to apply stochastic population models to long-term data, yet few studies have included interactions between density-dependent and density-independent factors, or explored more than one type of stochastic population model. However, both are important because model choice critically affects inference on population dynamics and stability. Here, we used a multiple models approach and applied log-linear and non-linear stochastic population models to time series (spanning 29 years) on the population growth rates of Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus, Great Tits Parus major and Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca breeding in two nestbox populations in southern Germany. We focused on the roles of climate conditions and intra-and interspecific competition in determining population growth rates. Density dependence was evident in all populations. For Blue Tits in one population and for Great Tits in both populations, addition of a density-independent factor improved model fit. At one location, Blue Tit population growth rate increased following warmer winters, whereas Great Tit population growth rates decreased following warmer springs. Importantly, Great Tit population growth rate also decreased following years of high Blue Tit abundance, but not vice versa. This finding is consistent with asymmetric interspecific competition and implies that competition could carry over to influence population dynamics. At the other location, Great Tit population growth rate decreased following years of high Pied Flycatcher abundance but only when Great Tit population numbers were low, illustrating that the roles of density-dependent and density-independent factors are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The dynamics of this Great Tit population, in contrast to the other populations, were unstable and chaotic, raising the question of whether interactions between density-dependent and density-independent factors play a role in determining the (in) stability of the dynamics of species populations.","[Smallegange, Isabel M.; Fiedler, Wolfgang] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Vogelwarte Radolfzell, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Smallegange, Isabel M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [van der Meer, Jaap] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Ecol & Evolut, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [van der Meer, Jaap] Free Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Smallegange, IM (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Vogelwarte Radolfzell, Schlossallee 2, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany.",i.smallegange@imperial.ac.uk,"Fiedler, Wolfgang/AAG-4510-2021; Smallegange, Isabel M./A-8198-2010","Fiedler, Wolfgang/0000-0003-1082-4161; Smallegange, Isabel M./0000-0001-6218-7358",Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,We thank Franz Barlein for comments and discussion.

I tested whether such patches reduced species evenness in a community of four old-field species, both with and without interspecific interactions. In species mixtures, patches reduced evenness, while in communities constructed via combined monocultures, in which species did not compete, patches increased evenness. Therefore, the reduction in evenness in response to patches was due to changes in competition. Community-level changes may be attributable to plant foraging traits-in species with low foraging precision, competition reduced abundance much more in patchy soils than in even soils, while in species with high root foraging precision, the effect of competition was similar in patchy and even soils.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA","Rajaniemi, TK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, 285 Old Westport Rd, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",trajaniemi@umassd.edu,,"Rajaniemi, Tara/0000-0003-2861-3901",,,,30,19,22,2,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2011,165,1,,,,,169,174,,10.1007/s00442-010-1710-5,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700YX,WOS:000285782600017,20607293,,,,2021-09-21,

We examined the joint importance of competition and species identity, using subject trees with a high local abundance of a single dominant neighboring species. Interspecific neighbors influenced annual height increment, shoot length, and branch number per unit crown length, especially in Scots pine. Silver birch and Siberian larch were predominantly affected by the level of competition alone, as estimated with competition indices. In Scots pine, the effects may have been a direct consequence of the species identity of neighbors or they may have acted as a substitute for the effect of some non-measured variable associated with species-specific characteristics. These functionally equivalent alternatives suggest that simple indices are not adequate measures of the neighbor effect for Scots pine. A simple extrapolation of individual tree growth to the stand level suggested that Scots pine and silver birch may grow faster in mixed than in pure stands. Siberian larch showed negative growth responses to interspecific neighbors, but the effects may be counterbalanced at the stand level by a corresponding increase in pine or birch growth.","[Kaitaniemi, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Hyytiala Forestry Field Stn, Korkeakoski 35500, Finland; [Lintunen, Anna] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Kaitaniemi, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Hyytiala Forestry Field Stn, Hyytialantie 124, Korkeakoski 35500, Finland.",pekka.j.kaitaniemi@helsinki.fi,"Kaitaniemi, Pekka/A-2022-2008; Lintunen, Anna/D-5942-2015","Kaitaniemi, Pekka/0000-0002-5162-242X; Lintunen, Anna/0000-0002-1077-0784",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank Sauli Valkonen for making possible the use of four experimental stands of the Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) in the study.

In Moorea, French Polynesia, we conducted a factorial field experiment to quantify the independent and combined effects of priority effects and habitat complexity on the strength of intraspecific competitive interactions among recently settled individuals of a coral reef fish (Thalassoma quinquevittatum: Labridae). Simultaneous arrival of focal individuals with competitors resulted in a 2.89-fold increase in survival relative to reefs where focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors (i.e., a priority effect). Increasing habitat complexity resulted in a 1.55-fold increase in survivorship when focal individuals arrived simultaneously with or before competitors. However, increasing habitat complexity did not affect the survivorship of focal individuals arriving 5 days later than competitors. Behavior observations showed that survivorship was negatively correlated with aggression. Aggression by prior residents towards focal individuals was significantly greater when focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors than when they arrived simultaneously. Increasing habitat complexity did not reduce aggression. Our results suggest that, when competitors arrive simultaneously, competitive interactions are weak and subordinates are not displaced from complex habitat; increasing habitat complexity increases survival by disrupting predation. Conversely, when competitors arrive at different times, aggression intensifies and increasing habitat complexity does not disrupt predation because competitive subordinates are excluded from habitat resources. This study demonstrates that the strength of competition can be context-dependent and may vary with the timing of competitive interactions and habitat complexity.","[Geange, Shane Wallace] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",shane.geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272; Stier, Adrian/0000-0002-4704-4145","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; VUW; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology; New Zealand Post Graduate Study Abroad Award; Three Seas Fellowship; French American Cultural Exchange Grant; National Geographic International Ecostations Fellowships","C.

When an individual's persistence in a community depends upon the strength of competitive interactions, changes in the timing of arrival relative to the arrival of a competitor can modify competitive strength and, ultimately, establishment in the community. We investigated whether the strength of intracohort competitive interactions between recent settlers of the reef fishes Thalassoma hardwicke and T. quinquevittatum are dependent on the sequence and temporal separation of their arrival into communities. To achieve this, we manipulated the sequence and timing of arrival of each species onto experimental patch reefs by simulating settlement pulses and monitoring survival and aggressive interactions. Both species survived best in the absence of competitors, but when competitors were present, they did best when they arrived at the same time. Survival declined as each species entered the community progressively later than its competitor and as aggression by its competitor increased. Intraspecific effects of resident T. hardwicke were similar to interspecific effects. This study shows that the strength of competition depends not only on the identity of competitors, but also on the sequence and timing of their interactions, suggesting that when examining interaction strengths, it is important to identify temporal variability in the direction and magnitude of their effects. Furthermore, our findings provide empirical evidence for the importance of competitive lotteries in the maintenance of species diversity in demographically open marine systems.","[Geange, Shane W.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",Shane.Geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Stier, Adrian/0000-0002-4704-4145; Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology","Craig Osenberg, Jeff Shima, Jada-Simone White, Ben Bolker, Todd Palmer, and two anonymous reviewers provided many helpful comments on versions of this manuscript.

However, in deep-water continental margins, where light intensity decreases over depth, interspecific competition may alter behavioral responses to day-night cycles. The burrowing decapod crustacean Nephrops norvegicus is a large-size predator in benthic communities, exerting despotic territorial behavior. In this study, we analysed how the effect of light intensity cycles on decapod behavioral rhythms is reduced as one moves from shelves to slopes. In the Western Mediterranean, the predatory behavior and interspecific competition for substrate use of Nephrops increases moving from the shelf (100-110 m) to the slope (400-430 m). Vector fitting and generalized additive models were used to assess the effect of light intensity and behavioral rhythms of N. norvegicus on the temporal variation of prey decapods co-occurring in trawl tow catches carried out on the shelf and the slope during October 1999 and June 2000. The combination of diel variations in light intensity and N. norvegicus abundance influences the activity rhythms of prey decapods in a depth- and seasonal-dependent manner. Light modulation is stronger on the shelf and weaker on the slope, where Nephrops population size is greater. Although present regression analysis does not necessarily imply a direct cause-effect relationship between rhythms of predators and prey, we suggest that Nephrops alters the temporal patterning in the behavior of its prey on the slope, where light intensity is reduced. This alteration is stronger in endobenthic species than in benthopelagic species; the former rely on bottom substrate for the expression of behavioral rhythms, experiencing stronger interspecific competitions with Nephrops at time of activity.","[Aguzzi, Jacopo] CSIC, ICM, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Bahamon, Nixon] CSIC, CEAB, Carrer Acces Cala St Fra, Blanes, Spain; [Marotta, Leonardo] Entropia Snc, Recanati, Macerata, Italy","Aguzzi, J (corresponding author), CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",jaguzzi@cmima.csic.es,"Fanjul-Moles, Maria Luisa/C-8069-2011; Bahamon, Nixon/O-2476-2019; Aguzzi, Jacopo/D-6574-2012; Bahamon, Nixon/K-8922-2014","Fanjul-Moles, Maria Luisa/0000-0003-2927-0154; Bahamon, Nixon/0000-0002-5802-7367; Aguzzi, Jacopo/0000-0002-1484-8219; Bahamon, Nixon/0000-0002-5802-7367",Spanish CICYTConsejo Interinstitucional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CICYT) [MAR98-0935],"We acknowledge Prof. F.

Before the arrival of B. invaders, the indigenous fruit fly species Ceratitis cosyra (Walker) was the predominant fruit fly pest of mango (Mangifera indica L.). Within 4 yr of invasion, B. invaders has displaced C. cosyra and has become the predominant fruit fly pest of mango, constituting 98 and 88% of the total population in traps and mango fruit at Nguruman, respectively. We tested two possible mechanisms responsible for the displacement namely; resource competition by larvae within mango fruit and aggression between adult flies. Under interspecific competition, larval duration in B. invaders was significantly shorter (6.2 +/- 0.6-7.3 +/- 0.3 d) compared with C. cosyra (8.0 +/- 1.2-9.4 +/- 0.4 d). Pupal mass in C. cosyra was affected by competition and was significantly reduced (7.4 +/- 0.3-9.6 +/- 0.6 mg) under competitive interaction compared with the controls (12.1 +/- 1.5-12.8 +/- 1.1 mg). Interspecific competition also had a significant adverse effect on C. cosyra eclosion, with fewer adults emerging under co-infestation compared with the controls. Interference competition through aggressive behavior showed that fewer C. cosyra (3.1 +/- 0.8) landed on mango dome compared with the controls (14.2 +/- 1.5) when adults were mixed with B. invadens adults in Plexiglas cages. Similarly the number of times C. cosyra was observed ovipositing was significantly lower (0.2 +/- 0.2) under competitive interaction compared with the controls (6.1 +/- 1.8). Aggressive encounters in the form of lunging/head-butting and chasing off other species from the mango dome was higher for B. invades compared with C. cosyra. Our results suggest that exploitative competition through larval scrambling for resources and interference competition through aggressive behaviors of the invader are important mechanisms contributing to the displacement of C. cosyra by B. invadens in mango agroecosystems.","[Ekesi, Sunday; Billah, Maxwell K.; Nderitu, Peterson W.; Lux, Slawomir A.; Rwomushana, Ivan] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, Nairobi, Kenya","Ekesi, S (corresponding author), Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, POB 30772-00100 GPO, Nairobi, Kenya.",sekesi@icipe.org,"Lux, Slawomir A/G-1731-2012; Ekesi, Sunday/P-8944-2019","Lux, Slawomir A/0000-0001-5978-1145; ",International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),We greatly appreciate the efforts by P.

The mosquito Aedes aegypti coexists at some urban sites in southeastern United States with invasive Aedes albopictus, which is often superior in interspecific competition. We tested predictions for three hypotheses of species coexistence: seasonal condition-specific competition, aggregation among individual water-filled containers, and colonization-competition tradeoff across spatially partitioned habitat patches (cemeteries) that have high densities of containers. We measured spatial and temporal patterns of abundance for both species among water-filled resident cemetery vases and experimentally positioned standard cemetery vases and ovitraps in metropolitan Tampa, Florida. Consistent with the seasonal condition-specific competition hypothesis, abundances of both species in resident and standard cemetery vases were higher early in the wet season (June) versus late in the wet season (September), but the proportional increase of A. albopictus was greater than that of A. aegypti, presumably due to higher dry-season egg mortality and strong wet-season competitive superiority of larval A. albopictus. Spatial partitioning was not evident among cemeteries, a result inconsistent with the colonization-competition tradeoff hypothesis, but both species were highly independently aggregated among standard cemetery vases and ovitraps, which is consistent with the aggregation hypothesis. Densities of A. aegypti but not A. albopictus differed among land use categories, with A. aegypti more abundant in ovitraps in residential areas compared to industrial and commercial areas. Spatial partitioning among land use types probably results from effects of land use on conditions in both terrestrial and aquatic-container environments. These results suggest that both temporal and spatial variation may contribute to local coexistence between these Aedes in urban areas.","[Leisnham, Paul T.] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Juliano, S.

In particular, competition with older and larger conspecifics and heterospecifics may influence the number and characteristics of individuals successfully making the transition. We investigated whether the availability of enemy-free space mediated the interaction between adult goldspot gobies (Gnatholepis thompsoni), a common tropical reef fish, and juvenile conspecifics that had recently settled from the plankton. We added rocks, which provide refuge from predators, to one-half of each of five entire coral reefs in the Bahamas and measured the survival and growth of recent settlers in relation to adult goby densities. We also evaluated whether mortality was selective with respect to three larval traits (age at settlement, size at settlement, and presettlement growth rate) and measured the influence of refuge availability and adult goby density on selection intensity. Selective mortality was measured by comparing larval traits of newly settled gobies (<= 5 d postsettlement) with those of survivors (2-3 week postsettlement juveniles). We detected a negative relationship between juvenile survival and adult goby density in both low- and high-refuge habitats, though experimental refuge addition reduced the intensity of this density dependence. Juvenile growth also declined with increasing adult goby density, but this effect was similar in both low- and high-refuge habitats. Refuge availability had no consistent effect on selective mortality, but adult goby density was significantly related to the intensity of size-selective mortality: bigger juveniles were favored where adults were abundant, and smaller juveniles were favored where adults were rare. Given the typically large difference in sizes of juveniles and adults, similar stage-structured interactions may be common but underappreciated in many marine species.","[Samhouri, Jameal F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Steele, Mark A.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Forrester, Graham E.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Samhouri, JF (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",jameal.samhouri@noaa.gov,,"Forrester, Graham/0000-0001-5253-773X; Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0222087]; American Museum of Natural History; American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists; International Women's Fishing Association; Sigma Xi; UC Regents; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; NOAA-NURPNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [CMRC-05-PRRV-01-05A, CMRC-01-NRME-010-3C, CMRC-03-NRME-01-04A, CMRC-03-NRME-01-05C]","Many thanks to those who helped us with field work, including R.

The basic concept is straightforward: host species vary in suitability ( competence) for parasites, and disease transmission decreases when there are more incompetent hosts interacting with vectors or removing free-living stages of a parasite. However, host species also often interact with each other in other ecological ways, e. g., as competitors for resources. The net result of these simultaneous, multiple interactions ( disease dilution and resource competition) is challenging to predict. Nonetheless, we see the signature of both roles operating concurrently in a planktonic host-parasite system. We document pronounced spatiotemporal variation in the size of epidemics of a virulent fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) in Midwestern U. S. lake populations of a dominant crustacean grazer ( Daphnia dentifera). We show that some of this variation is captured by changes in structure of Daphnia assemblages. Lake-years with smaller epidemics were characterized by assemblages dominated by less suitable hosts (diluters,'' D. pulicaria and D. retrocurva, whose suitabilties were determined in lab experiments and field surveys) at the start of epidemics. Furthermore, within a season, less suitable hosts increased as epidemics declined. These observations are consistent with a dilution effect. However, more detailed time series analysis ( using multivariate autoregressive models) of three intensively sampled epidemics show the signature of a likely interaction between dilution and resource competition between these Daphnia species. The net outcome of this interaction likely promoted termination of these fungal outbreaks. Should this outcome always arise in friendly competition'' systems where diluting hosts compete with more competent hosts? The answers to this question lie at a frontier of disease ecology.","[Hall, Spencer R.; Becker, Claes R.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Simonis, Joseph L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Duffy, Meghan A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Tessier, Alan J.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Environm Biol, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Hall, SR (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",sprhall@indiana.edu,"Simonis, Juniper/AAE-2410-2019; Duffy, Meghan A/A-9376-2008; Duffy, Meghan A/E-6867-2016","Simonis, Juniper/0000-0001-9798-0460; Duffy, Meghan A/0000-0002-8142-0802","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [02-35119, 02-35039, DEB 06-13510, 06-14316]","We are grateful for the help of R.

Predicting how these factors will alter local population dynamics and community structure is a monumental challenge. By examining ecologically similar congeners, such as Iris hexagona and I. pseudacorus (which reproduce clonally and sexually and tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions), one can identify life-history traits that are most influential to population growth and viability. We combined empirical data and stage-structured matrix models to investigate the demographic responses of native (I. hexagona) and invasive (I. pseudacorus) plant populations to hurricanes and salinity stress in freshwater and brackish wetlands. In our models I. hexagona and I. pseudacorus responded differently to salinity stress, and species coexistence was rare. In 82% of computer simulations of freshwater marsh, invasive iris populations excluded the native species within 50 years, whereas native populations excluded the invasive species in 99% of the simulations in brackish marsh. The occurrence of hurricanes allowed the species to coexist, and species persistence was determined by the length of time it took the ecosystem to recover. Rapid recovery (2 years) favored the invasive species, whereas gradual recovery (30 years) favored the native species. Little is known about the effects of hurricanes on competitive interactions between native and invasive plant species in marsh ecosystems. Our models contribute new insight into the relationship between environmental disturbance and invasion and demonstrate how influential abiotic factors such as climate change will be in determining interspecific interactions.","[Pathikonda, Sharmila; Hasenstein, Karl H.; Mopper, Susan] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; [Ackleh, Azmy S.] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Math, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA","Mopper, S (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",mop@louisiana.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0618457, DEB-0124901, DUE-0531915]","This work was supported by a National Science Foundation (NSF) grants DEB-0618457 to S.M., DEB-0124901 to S.M. and K.H.H, and DUE-0531915 to A.S.A. and S.M.

Such competition can be minimized through niche dimensions: mechanism of resource partitioning based on prey choice and foraging tactic. This study compared habitat use patterns of 5 top predators (bottlenose dolphins, double-crested cormorants, osprey, brown pelicans and terns) within Florida Bay with respect to each other, their prey and habitat variability. Foraging dolphins, osprey and pelicans exhibited similar habitat use patterns in shallow, turbid, productive waters with high proportions of mud and mudbank bottom types. These same habitat characteristics also described the distribution of their major prey items: mullet and catfish. Competition between these 3 predators is likely diluted by foraging tactic variation. Conversely, the habitat use patterns of cormorants showed strongest association with deeper water, with low chlorophyll a and turbidity levels, less mud and mudbank habitat, and greater proportions of hardbottom and seagrass bottoms. Those prey items of cormorants with less competition from other predators examined displayed the same habitat associations. Cormorants in Florida Bay may concentrate their foraging efforts on less competitive prey, occurring more frequently in habitats where these prey items dominate. Despite Florida Bay's limited bathymetric relief, habitat use patterns of top predators are significantly influenced by depth, and subsequently bottom type. Sighting rates of all predators, except non-foraging dolphins, peaked in shallow mudbank habitats. This pattern of strong habitat overlap among predators implies currently adequate resource availability and/or niche dimensions among interspecific competitors.","[Torres, Leigh G.] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA","Torres, LG (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, 301 Evans Bay Parade,Greta Point,Private Bag 14-9, Wellington 6021, New Zealand.",l.torres@niwa.co.nz,,,"Everglades National Park [EVER-2003-SCI-0042, EVER2004-SCI-0062, EVER-2005-SCI-0062]; Duke University Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) [911-1466, 572-1639]; SERC-FIU; SFWMD/SERC [C-15397]; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [X994621-940]; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; NOAA/Coastal OceanNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Dolphin Ecology; Duke University Marine","This research was conducted under Everglades National Park permits EVER-2003-SCI-0042, EVER2004-SCI-0062, and EVER-2005-SCI-0062, General Authorizations 911-1466 and 572-1639, and approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC).

Postcolonization sorting also affects the ultimate composition of communities assembled by people for restoration, horticulture, or conservation. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms controlling interspecific interactions in plant communities is important for explaining patterns observed in nature and predicting success or failure of utilitarian combinations. Relationships among species, especially those from studies of biological diversity and ecosystem functioning, are largely based on studies of short-lived, temperate-zone plants. Extrapolation to perennial plants in the humid tropics is risky because functional relationships among large-stature species change with time. Shifts in competitive relationships among 3 life forms-trees, palms, and perennial herbs-occurred during 13 yr in experimental tropical ecosystems. In 2 cases the novel competitive mechanism responsible for the shift was reduction in crown volume, and therefore light-capturing capability, of over-topping deciduous trees by intrusive growth from below a palm. In a third case, complementary resource use developed between 2 evergreen life forms (overstory tree and palm), probably because of differential nutrient acquisition. Species-level traits and adequate time for shifts in interspecific relationships to emerge are crucial for predicting community trajectories.","[Ewel, John J.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Julia Mazzarino, Maria] Univ Nacl Comahue, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Argentina, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Ewel, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, POB 118526, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jackewel@ufl.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Andrew W.

The present study quantified egg and pupal cannibalism, and interspecific predation on eggs and pupae, by larvae and adults of seven species of flour beetle (Tribolium spp.) under laboratory conditions: T. anaphe, T. brevicornis, T. castaneum, T. confusum, T. destructor, T. freemani, and T. madens. 2. Variation among species in cannibalism and predation propensities did not reflect taxonomic affinities within the genus, indicating that these behaviours were shaped by ecology at species level. 3. Within species, larvae and adults displayed different propensities for cannibalism and predation, leading to the conclusion that these behaviours evolve independently in the two life stages. 4. All species behaved as intraguild predators to some degree, especially in the adult stage. 5. Three general patterns of cannibalism and predation were described by principal component mapping and cluster analysis. 6. The first group comprised three cosmopolitan pest species that were more voracious as adults than as larvae: T. castaneum, T. confusum, and T. destructor. It is proposed that stored product environments select for high adult voracity because the costs associated with emigration from such rare, but resource-rich, habitats intensifies interference competition among adults. 7. The second group consisted of species that inhabit natural environments and that were more voracious as larvae: T. anaphe, T. freemani, and T. madens. Habitats for these species are probably numerous, but generally poor in quality, a situation that intensifies larval competition, while favouring earlier adult emigration. 8. The largest species, T. brevicornis, demonstrated inconsistent voracity between life stages and was the only species with chemically defended pupae. 9. It is proposed that consumption of eggs provides primarily nutritional benefits, whereas consumption of pupae has a more important role in interference competition.","[Michaud, J.

While this has frequently been shown by use of integrative indicators like growth or biomass, resource-focussed approaches are still lacking, especially those investigating the competitive effect. Here, we present a correlation between neighbour plants' root sizes and their competitive effect on their target plants' nitrate uptake. This was derived from a controlled field experiment where intra- and interspecific combinations of five different herbaceous species from nutrient poor sand ecosystems were examined in an additive design. Short-term pulses of (15)N-labelled nitrate were applied between competing pairs of plant individuals. The sizes of neighbour root systems had high explanatory power for the competitive effect on target plants' nitrate uptake. Equally important, a curve fitting approach revealed that the competitive effect based on (15)N-uptake matched predictions of a size-symmetric interaction. With 66% of the variation in competitive effect on nitrate uptake explained by root system size, the degree to which root size results in a belowground overlap of zones of influence is crucial. Within this overlap, further attributes like architecture or uptake capacity may be important. Our data represent experimental support for a size symmetric competitive effect for a specific belowground resource. Since this is not consistent with an overproportional size advantage when mobile soil resources are limiting, it suggests that the survival of small individuals or species should be facilitated by the symmetric nature of belowground competitive effects.","[Bartelheimer, Maik; Steinlein, Thomas; Beyschlag, Wolfram] Univ Bielefeld, Chair Expt & Syst Ecol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Bartelheimer, Maik] Univ Regensburg, Fac Biol & Preclin Med, Inst Bot, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany","Bartelheimer, M (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Chair Expt & Syst Ecol, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",maik.bartelheimer@biologie.uni-regensburg.de,,,,,,55,21,21,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,DEC,2008,199,2,,,,,243,253,,10.1007/s11258-008-9429-7,,,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,366WN,WOS:000260514400010,,,,,2021-09-21,

Standard resource-competition models from this theory predict that the number of coexisting species should not exceed the number of factors that limit population growth. Here I show that positive interactions among resource competitors can produce species-rich model communities supported by a single limiting resource. Simulations show that when resource competitors reduce each others' per capita mortality rate (e.g. by ameliorating an abiotic stress), stable multispecies coexistence with a single resource may be common, even while the net interspecific interaction remains negative. These results demonstrate that positive interactions may provide an important mechanism for generating species-rich communities in nature. They also show that focusing on the net interaction between species may conceal important coexistence mechanisms when species simultaneously engage in both antagonistic and positive interactions.","N Carolina State Univ, Biomath Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Gross, K (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Biomath Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",kevin_gross@ncsu.edu,"Gross, Kevin/AAX-1589-2020",,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0434298],"I thank C. de Mazancourt, R.

Previous studies report that adult flies exhibit algal-specific behaviour that may influence interspecific interactions. It is predicted that coelopid larvae may also demonstrate algal-specific dietary preferences. Larval dietary preferences are investigated by comparing the ratios of (13)C/(12)C and (15)N/(14)N in both wild flies and macroalgae to those of laboratory-reared flies. Results showed only a small difference between the stable isotope ratios of the most abundant algae, Laminaria spp. (Laminariaceae) and Fucus spp. (Fucaceae), although there were significant differences between wild adult coelopids. This result illustrates different metabolic processes in two closely related species. The stable isotope ratios of wild-caught coelopids were found to differ significantly from laboratory-reared coelopids. This is either the result of red algae in the diet of natural populations or a difference in bacterial communities. We suggest that experiments with laboratory-reared flies/specimens can greatly increase the utility of stable isotope analysis in the investigation of animal food webs, even where potential diets are isotopically similar. However, this approach is dependent on re-creations that accurately mimic natural conditions.","[Edward, Dominic A.; Gilburn, Andre S.] Univ Stirling, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Newton, Jason] Scottish Univ Environm Res Ctr, NERC Life Sci Mass Spect Facil, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland","Gilburn, AS (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",andre.gilburn@stir.ac.uk,"Newton, Jason/A-9536-2009; Edward, Dominic/B-4074-2010","Newton, Jason/0000-0001-7594-3693; Gilburn, Andre/0000-0002-3836-768X",,,,46,3,3,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Here we provide experimental evidence of historical declines in competition effects among competing zooplankton populations. Using diapausing eggs, we resurrected clones of three species of zooplankton obtained from different periods of community assembly in a single lake. We show that clones of Daphnia ambigua obtained from early in assembly when D. ambigua was dominant became extinct in competition with clones of Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia dentifera ( the current lake dominants). In contrast, D. ambigua clones obtained from later in the lake's history experienced weaker competition effects and persisted with D. dentifera. While we cannot rule out the role of intraspecific competition within D. ambigua, our results are in line with the view that natural selection favors reduced interaction strength among co-occurring species, facilitating coexistence and population persistence.","Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Steiner, CF (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",steiner8@msu.edu; caceres@life.uiuc.edu; sdsmith1@uiuc.edu,,,,,,30,25,25,0,49,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

In the species interaction, the offensive trait of the weevil (rostrum length) and the defensive trait of the plant (pericarp thickness) are involved in a geographically-structured arms race, and these traits and selective pressures acting on the plant defence vary greatly across a geographical landscape. To further explore the geographical structure of this interspecific interaction, we tested whether the geographical variation in the weevil rostrum over an 800-km range along latitude is attributed to local natural selection or constrained by historical (phylogeographical) events of local populations. Phylogeographical analyses of the mitochondrial DNA sequences of the camellia weevil revealed that this species has experienced differentiation into two regions, with a population bottleneck and subsequent range and/or population expansion within each region. Although these phylogeographical factors have affected the variation in rostrum length, analyses of competing factors for the geographical variation revealed that this pattern is primarily determined by the defensive trait of the host plant rather than by the effects of historical events of populations and a climatic factor (annual mean temperature). Thus, our study suggests the overwhelming strength of coevolutionary selection against the effect of historical events, which may have limited local adaptation.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Toju, H (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Sci,Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",htojuscb@mbox.nc.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Toju, Hirokazu/T-7355-2019; Toju, Hirokazu/S-7307-2017","Toju, Hirokazu/0000-0002-3362-3285",,,,98,42,43,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We tested whether effects of intra- and interspecific planting density of the calcareous grassland perennials Bromus erectus and Carex flacca change in response to elevated [CO2] (600 ppm) by using factorial combinations of seven densities (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 tillers per 8 x 8 cm(2) cell) of both species in plots with and without CO2 enrichment. Although aboveground biomass of C. flacca was increased by 54% under elevated [CO2], the combined aboveground biomass of the whole stand was not significantly increased. C. flacca tended to produce more tillers under elevated [CO2] while B. erectus produced less tillers. The positive effect of [CO2] on the number of tillers of C. flacca was strongest at high intraspecific densities. On the other hand, the negative effect of [CO2] on the number of tillers of B. erectus was not present at intermediate intraspecific planting densities. Seed production of C. flacca was more than doubled under elevated [CO2], while seed production of B. erectus was not affected. Moreover, the mass per seed of C. flacca was increased by elevated [CO2] at intermediate interspecific planting densities while the mass per seed of B. erectus was decreased by elevated [CO2] at high interspecific planting densities. Our results show that the responses of C. flacca and B. erectus to elevated [CO2] depend in a complex way on initial planting densities of both species. In other words, competition between these two model species is both [CO2]- and density dependent. On average, however, the effects of [CO2] on the individual species indicate that the composition of calcareous grasslands is likely to change under elevated [CO2] in favor of C. flacca.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","van Kleunen, M (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, POB X01 Scottsville, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",vankleunen@ukzn.ac.za,"van Kleunen, Mark/B-3769-2009; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701",,,,49,10,11,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Understanding the development of plants' below-ground zone of influence, the region over which a plant acquires soil resources, is essential for understanding and predicting interplant competition. 2. The objective of this experiment was to characterize root system development of four weed species (Abutilon theophrasti Medic., Amaranthus retroflexus L., Chenopodium album L. and Setaria faberi Herm.) when grown in monoculture and in mixture to assess the influence of maize competition on root system volume and shape. 3. Using a herbicide-injection technique, root development was assessed at two field sites with contrasting soil textures. Lateral root growth (LRG) was measured over the growing season at 15, 30 and 60 cm depths. Similarly, vertical root growth (VRG) was assessed when roots reached 15, 30 and 60 cm depths. The technique proved useful for quantifying VRG and LRG over time for all four weed species. From vertical and lateral root system expansion, the volume of soil exploited by the root system (V) was calculated and used as an estimator of the below-ground zone of influence. 4. For A. theophrasti and A. retroflexus, VRG was less influenced than LRG by interspecific competition, and was independent of plant size. In contrast, LRG was strongly related to plant size. Differences in LRG were primarily responsible for the sizeable reductions in below-ground zone of influence for plants of similar ages but of lower above-ground biomass (AGB) due to competition with maize. 5. Above-ground biomass of A. theophrasti and A. retroflexus was exponentially related to below-ground zone of influence with a scaling exponent of 0.71 (AGB = 84.14V(0.71), R-2 = 0.74). Soil type (sandy loam vs silt loam), plant species, or interspecific competition (monoculture vs mixture with maize) did not substantially influence this relationship. 6. The scaling factor reported in this study could be used to improve dynamic models of plant competition in annual agroecosystems. This work also provides insights into the likelihood of below-ground competition between neighbouring plants during root system development.","Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Berger, AG (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",agb32@cornell.edu,,"Berger, Andres G./0000-0003-1096-8421",,,,37,8,8,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The model predicts, and experimental evidence confirms, that the competitive advantage conferred by the lysogenic phage depends only on the phage pathology on the sensitive bacterial strain and is independent of other phage and host parameters, such as the infection-causing contact rate, the spontaneous and infection-induced lysis rates and the phage burst size.

Theory predicts that functional similarity will increase the intensity of competition between native and invasive species. Ecologically important foundation species, Zostera marina and other seagrasses have globally declined during the past century. This study used transplant and vegetation removal experiments to test the hypotheses that disturbance and competitive interactions with an invasive congener (Z. japonica) are contributing to the decline of native Z. marina in the northeastern Pacific. Interspecific competition reduced Z. marina and Z. japonica above-ground biomass by 44 and 96%, respectively, relative to intraspecific competition. Disturbance substantially enhanced Z. japonica productivity and fitness, and concomitantly decreased Z. marina performance, effects that persisted two years following substratum disturbance. These results demonstrate that disturbance and competitive interactions with Z. japonica reduce Z. marina performance, and suggest that Z. japonica's success as an invasive species stems dually from its ability to persist in competition with Z. marina and its positive response to disturbance. These results highlight the importance of understanding the interconnected roles of species interactions and disturbance in the decline of seagrass habitats, and provide a rationale for amending conservation policy in Washington State. In the interest of conserving native eelgrass populations, the current policy of protecting both native and invasive Zostera spp. should be refined to differentiate between native and invader, and to rescind the protection of invasive eelgrass.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Bando, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",kjbando@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,54,74,81,1,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

The outcome of interspecific competition for food resources depends both on the competitors' sensory abilities and on environmental conditions. In laboratory experiments we tested the influence of daylight and darkness on feeding behaviour and specific growth rate (SGR) of two species with different sensory abilities. 2. We used perch (Perca fluviatilis) as a visually orientated, and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) as a mechano-sensory oriented predator and tested their growth rates and behaviour under conditions of interspecific and intraspecific competition. Three different foraging conditions were used: food supplied (i) only during the day, (ii) only during the night or (iii) during both day and night. 3. In perch neither SGR nor feeding behaviour were influenced substantially by interspecific competition during daylight. During darkness their foraging behaviour changed markedly and their access to the food source as well as their SGR were negatively affected by the presence of ruffe. 4. Ruffe's foraging behaviour did not change during either day or night with interspecific competition. During the night ruffe's SGR was higher with interspecific competition, probably because of a release from intraspecific competition and the competitive inferiority of perch during the night. 5. Because of its seonsory abilities ruffe feeds predominantly at night, thereby reducing competitive interference from perch.","Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Schleuter, D (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",diana.schleuter@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,32,42,43,0,15,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

To aid in parameterization of such models we investigated the effect of temperature (1-2 degrees C, 4-5 degrees C, 7-8 degrees C, and 10-11 degrees C), predator group sze, interspecific competition, egg density (60-600 eggs bairdii) sculpins, round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), and the native crayfish (Oronectes propinquus) in the laboratory. Egg consumption by the sculpins and round goby all increased over the range of temperatures investigated (ca 0.5 eggs(.)day(-1) at 1-2 degrees C to 1.5 eggs(.)day-1 at 10-11 degrees C). Predator group size affected consumption: fewer eggs were eaten per individual slimy sculpin and round goby at densities of 5 or 10 per tanks than 1 individual per tank. There was no effect of interspecific competition on egg consumption by slimy sculpins and round gobies at a density of 10 individuals per tank for various species combinations (10:0, 9:1, 5:5, 1:9, 0:10). A type II functional response to egg density was observed for sculpies, gobies, and crayfish although at extreme densities per capita consumption by crayfish and gobies declined. The presence of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) did not affect the number of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs eaten by round gobies whose mussel consumption averaged 75% BW(.)day(-1). Of the four species examined, round gobies appeared to the most effective egg predator while crayfish were the least.","Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada; Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Charlevoix, MI 49720 USA; Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Fitzsimons, J (corresponding author), Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada.",fitzsimonsj@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,,,,,,40,42,43,1,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Graham & Lambin (2002) have reported on a weasel-reduction experiment, concluding that the impact of weasel predation on field vole survival was neither sufficient nor necessary to initiate and drive the cyclic decline of field vole populations in Kielder Forest, northern England. They also stated that their findings contradict conclusively the specialist predator hypothesis put forward to explain population cycles of voles in North Europe. 2. Straightforward inferences from Kielder Forest to the northern boreal zone are misleading, because the population cycles of voles in Kielder Forest differ essentially from North European vole cycles. The low amplitude of the vole cycles in Kielder Forest, their restricted spatial synchrony in comparison to northern Europe and the virtual lack of interspecific synchrony in Kielder Forest suggest that there are essential differences between the mechanisms responsible for the two types of cyclic fluctuations of voles. 3. The weasel-reduction experiment may provide a misleading picture on the role of predators, even in the Kielder Forest cycle. The experimental reduction of weasels alone may not stop the population decline of voles, because competing larger predators are expected to increase their hunting in the weasel-reduction areas. The small spatial scale of the experiment, which produced only slight, short-term differences in weasel densities between reduction and control areas, also suggests that other predators could have compensated easily for the weasels that were removed. 4. We propose a new version of the predation hypothesis to explain low-amplitude population cycles of voles in temperate Europe, including the Kielder Forest. The interaction between generalist predators and vole populations might account for these cycles because generalists can have a functional response that is destabilizing in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium point. As most generalists are orders of magnitude larger than weasels, and thus need much more food for survival, generalist-driven cycles should be characterized by high prey minima, as observed in Kielder Forest.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia","Korpimaki, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",ekorpi@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X; Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495",,,,89,63,64,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The study was conducted between 1989 and 2000 in the Reserva Biologica de Donana, located at the core of Donana National Park. Both species occurred at high density and showed high productivity. Black kites were slightly increasing, and red kites showed a non-significant trend. The main cause of breeding failure was nest predation, mainly by mammalian predators, most likely Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) or common genet (Genetta genetta). The main cause of mortality was illegal poisoning, which sharply increased in the late 1990s. Nest-site selection models showed that: (1) black kites selected areas near the seasonal marshes, rich in their main prey species and (2) red kites selected areas rich in marshland and far from the park border, possibly in response to illegal poisoning episodes. Productivity was positively related to the availability of marshland and of open terrestrial habitats for black and red kites, respectively, and negatively related for both species to the density of black kites within 200 In of the nest. Our results showed that: (1) intraguild predation and competition among predators make outcomes of interspecific interactions extremely complex, leading to unpredictable side-effects of priority actions targeting one species at a time and (2) though the park was fenced and patrolled by wardens, the wide ranging behaviour of the two species made park borders permeable to negative human pressures, such as poisoning, leading to extreme edge effects and absence of a true, safe core of the park. Park management needs to be better integrated with its regional socio-economic and cultural context. Education programmes against illegal poisoning should be urgently promoted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent theoretical developments indicate that spatial structure in plant communities arises as an outcome of environmental heterogeneity, intra- and interspecific competition, and localized dispersal. Furthermore, each of these forces is predicted to leave a signature on the spatial and temporal pattern within the community. We track the development of spatial structure in successional grasslands in southern California for five years, using a series of large-scale field experiments. We compare the observed changes in spatial structure to the predictions of a spatially explicit model of plant competition in heterogeneous landscapes. We conclude that environmental heterogeneity led to the development of aggregation in the first year at scales of 1-2 in. Over time, aggregation was detectable at distances greater than 4 m, and species become segregated as a result of competition and localized dispersal. Large-scale disturbances (fire) homogenized the community by decreasing the level of aggregation and segregation. In contrast, disturbance by pocket gophers and ground squirrels increased local-scale heterogeneity by creating annual-dominated aggregates. The speed with which spatial structure develops in seemingly homogeneous environments illustrates the importance of incorporating spatial context in empirical studies and models of plant community dynamics.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97311 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Seabloom, EW (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Cordley Hall 3029, Corvallis, OR 97311 USA.",scabloom@science.oregonstate.edu,"Bjornstad, Ottar N/I-4518-2012","Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259; Bolker, Benjamin/0000-0002-2127-0443",,,,58,94,99,0,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Pla. parallelum antennae exhibited different response amplitudes to the three pheromones at quantities above the detection threshold, while Ple. transversus had similar responses to each. Behavioral responses to the same three pheromones were evaluated for both histerid species using pedestrian olfactometer bioassays. Both species were attracted to frontalin and ipsenol, but not ipsdienol. Pla. parallelum was significantly more attracted to frontalin than ipsenol, while Ple. transversus showed no significant preference for either compound.

Similar findings in the shredder C. villosa were effects of site specific temperature patterns, not of direct competition. It was evident that dependencies or interactions discovered at individual sites generally did not occur at all sites simultaneously. Inter- and intraspecific competition for a limited food source was detected only in scrapers during periods of low flow. No effects of food shortage was discovered in shredders or predators.

However, pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are numerous and have an alternating-year pattern of abundance that provides a natural experimental control to test for interspecific competition in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Since a number of studies have recently examined pink salmon interactions with other salmon, we reviewed them in an effort to describe patterns of interaction over broad regions of the ocean. Research consistently indicated that pink salmon significantly altered prey abundance of other salmon species (e.g., zooplankton, squid), leading to altered diet, reduced total prey consumption and growth, delayed maturation, and reduced survival, depending on species and locale. Reduced survival was observed in chum salmon (O. keta) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) originating from Puget Sound and in Bristol Bay sockeye salmon (O. nerka). Growth of pink salmon was not measurably affected by other salmon species, but their growth was sometimes inversely related to their own abundance. In all marine studies, pink salmon affected other species through exploitation of prey resources rather than interference. Interspecific competition was observed in nearshore and offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, and one study documented competition between species originating from different continents. Climate change had variable effects on competition. In the North Pacific Ocean, competition was observed before and after the ocean regime shift in 1977 that significantly altered abundances of many marine species, whereas a study in the Pacific Northwest reported a shift from predation- to competition-based mortality in response to the 1982/1983 El Nino. Key traits of pink salmon that influenced competition with other salmonids included great abundance, high consumption rates and rapid growth, degree of diet overlap or consumption of lower trophic level prey, and early migration timing into the ocean. The consistent pattern of findings from multiple regions of the ocean provides evidence that interspecific competition can significantly influence salmon population dynamics and that pink salmon may be the dominant competitor among salmon in marine waters.","Nat Resources Consultants Inc, Seattle, WA 98119 USA; US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Biol Sci Off, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA","Ruggerone, GT (corresponding author), Nat Resources Consultants Inc, Seattle, WA 98119 USA.",GRuggerone@nrccorp.com; jennifer_niel-sen@usgs.gov,,,,,,83,77,83,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,1573-5184,,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

The species is sometimes seen in primary rainforest, although at a curiously low density compared with that of other monkey species. We conducted a 24-month field study in the tropical rainforest of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast, and found that putty-nosed monkeys require an ecological niche almost identical to that of the Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana. Moreover, the niche breadth of putty-nosed monkeys was significantly decreased in the presence of Diana monkeys, suggesting that feeding competition with Diana monkeys kept putty-nosed monkeys from successfully colonizing a rainforest habitat. However, contrary to the interspecies competition hypothesis, groups of both species almost completely overlapped in home ranges and formed near-permanent mixed-species associations, rather than avoiding each other. We hypothesized that Diana monkeys tolerated immigrating putty-nosed monkeys and formed mixed-species groups with them, despite high levels of competition, because of their merit in predation defense. Direct observations and a series of field experiments confirmed that male putty-nosed monkeys play a vital role in defense against crowned eagles, suggesting that putty-nosed monkeys obtain access to feeding trees by offering antipredation benefits to Diana monkeys. We discuss these findings in light of biological market theory.","Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire; Univ Leipzig, Fak Biowissensch Pharm & Psychol, Abt Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews KY16 9JP, Fife, Scotland","Zuberbuhler, K (corresponding author), Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, BP 1303, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire.",kz3@st-and.ac.uk,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X",,,,44,72,78,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Both species exhibited greatest growth at the high food level and the low (5) salinity. Neither species was affected by the presence of the other species, and there were no overall differences in growth between the two species. Thus, the observed competitive superiority of G. robustum over M. gulosus does not seem to confer an advantage relative to feeding success. Furthermore, as growth of G. robustum was greater at the lower salinity, it is clear that some factor other than salinity is restricting this species from north-eastern Florida Bay. Additional work on the importance of predation and food resources in various regions of Florida Bay is needed to further evaluate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the bay-wide distribution of these species.

Colonisation of rmc was not primarily influenced by inoculum source; minor differences could be attributed to differences in inoculum potential. The mutation is therefore different from other mycorrhiza-defective tomato mutants. Growth of rmc was reduced in the presence of nurse plants, because of competition with them, so a second experiment examined the effects of AM colonisation on competition between rmc and the WT tomato. This experiment was a replacement series in which rmc and WT were grown in competition and as single plants, inoculated with G. coronatum or uninoculated. The WT did not respond to G. coronatum when grown alone, but responded positively when in competition with rmc. We conclude from the second experiment that mycorrhizal responsiveness is influenced by competition with (in this case) a surrogate nonhost plant rmc in a situation that mimics interspecific competition. It is therefore a community-based parameter. Results are discussed in the context of responses of mycorrhizal vs nonmycorrhizal species and competition in natural plant ecosytems.","Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Plant Root Symbioses Soil & Land Syst, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr & Wine, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Cavagnaro, TR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",trcavagnaro@ucdavis.edu,"Smith, Frank Andrew/D-4665-2013","Cavagnaro, Vanessa/0000-0002-3144-7695; Cavagnaro, Timothy/0000-0002-9922-5677",,,,41,54,55,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,FEB,2004,161,2,,,,,485,494,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.00967.x,,,10,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,757FR,WOS:000187550700016,33873510,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Because intraspecific variation in ejaculate investment underlies interspecific patterns, it is critical to understand the causes and consequences of intraspecific variation in ejaculate investment. We examined relationships between ejaculate investment (testis size and sperm length) and reproductive success, body size and condition in the yellow-pine chipmunk (Tamias amoenus), a small ground squirrel in which sperm competition occurs. We examined genetic estimates of male reproductive success from a wild population of yellow-pine chipmunks and determined that males with large testes had higher annual reproductive success than males with small testes. This result provides empirical support for the numerous comparative studies that indicate testis size is associated with the intensity of sperm competition. In addition, males in good condition had relatively larger testes than males in poor condition, but there was no evidence of sperm length being dependent on condition. Finally, contrary to many predictions, males that invested more in sperm production (relatively heavy testes) produced shorter sperm, not longer sperm, than males that invested less.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Schulte-Hostedde, AI (corresponding author), Laurentian Univ, Dept Biol, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",aschultehostedde@laurentian.ca,"Schulte-Hostedde, Albrecht/C-2007-2009",,,,,53,103,104,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

The balance of predation between closely related invasive and native species can be an important determinant of the success or failure of biological invasions. In Irish freshwaters, the introduced amphipod Gammarus pulex has replaced the native G. duebeni celticus, possibly through differential mutual intraguild predation (IGP). Theoretically, parasitism could mediate such predation and hence the invasion outcome. However, this idea remains poorly studied. 2. In a field survey, we show that the acanthocephalan parasite Echinorynchus truttae is present in more G. pulex populations than G. d. celticus populations. In addition, within parasitised populations, E. truttae is more prevalent in the invader than in the native. 3. We show for the first time that an acanthocephalan parasite mediates predation between its intermediate macroinvertebrate hosts. In a field experiment, E. truttae parasitism of the invader lowered IGP upon the unparasitised native. In laboratory experiments, parasitism of G. pulex significantly reduced their predatory impact on recently moulted female G. d. celticus. Parasitism also appeared to cause reduction in predatory behaviour, such as attacks per contact on precopula guarded female natives. 4. We conclude that higher parasite prevalence in invaders as compared with natives, by mediation of interspecific interactions, could promote species coexistence, or at least slow species replacements, in this particular biological invasion.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","MacNeil, C (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Ctr Med Biol, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",,"Briffa, Mark/M-9041-2013","Briffa, Mark/0000-0003-2520-0538; Dunn, Alison/0000-0002-4855-1077",,,,55,35,36,1,27,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

We assume that disturbances are periodically imposed on some parts of the lattice in a block, followed by a period free of disturbance. For convenience, species are ranked in order of competitive ability. We further assume that the intrinsic growth rate of species i, epsilon(i), and the dispersal ability, D-i, increase in decreasing order of rank. Our model can analytically determine the exact number of surviving species when disturbance is absent. In the presence of disturbance, we numerically examine how spatio-temporal changes in environmental heterogeneity affect species coexistence and extinction, for the case in which the value of epsilon(i)/D-i monotonically increases or decreases with rank. The results demonstrate that (1) when the interspecific competition is smaller than the intraspecific competition, we can provide predictions on the prospective order of species to be driven extinct and the order of potential species to revive with increasing extents of disturbance; (2) when the interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition, a small difference in the disturbance level can lead to drastic changes in the species composition, their densities and the order of species extinction. In addition, comparison with other similar models reveals that differences in species interaction in local population dynamics critically affect the disturbance-mediated species diversity.","Nara Womens Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Nara 6308506, Japan; Doshisha Univ, Dept Knowledge Engn & Comp Sci, Kyotanabe, Japan","Shigesada, N (corresponding author), Nara Womens Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Nara 6308506, Japan.",sigesada@ics.nara-wu.ac.jp,,,,,,32,5,6,0,4,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

We tested this prediction by comparing the competitive ability of native St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) from Europe with introduced St John's wort from central North America where plants have long grown free of specialist herbivores, and introduced plants from western North America where plants have been subjected to over 57 years of biological control. Plants were grown in a greenhouse with and without competition with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum). St John's wort from the introduced range were not better interspecific competitors than plants from the native range. The magnitude of the effect of ryegrass on St John's wort was similar for introduced and native genotypes. Furthermore, introduced plants were not uniformly larger than natives; rather, within each region of origin there was a high variability in size between populations. Competition with ryegrass reduced the growth of St John's wort by >90%. In contrast, St John's wort reduced ryegrass growth <10%. These results do not support the contention that plants from the introduced range evolve greater competitive ability in the absence of natural enemies.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Vila, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",,"Vila, Montserrat/D-9339-2013","Vila, Montserrat/0000-0003-3171-8261",,,,22,80,81,0,43,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2003,137,2,,,,,211,215,,10.1007/s00442-003-1342-0,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,726MF,WOS:000185602300007,12883989,,,,2021-09-21,

In this journal 35 years ago, P. H. Leslie, I Park and D. B. Mertz reported<LF>competitive exclusion data for two Tribolium species. It is less well-known that they also reported 'difficult to interpret' coexistence data. We suggest that the species exclusion and the species coexistence are consequences of a stable coexistence two-cycle in the presence of two stable competitive exclusion equilibria. 2. A stage-structured insect population model for two interacting species forecasts that as interspecific interaction is increased there occurs a sequence of dynamic changes (bifurcations) in which the classic Lotka-Volterra-type scenario with two stable competitive exclusion equilibria is altered abruptly to a novel scenario with three locally stable entities; namely, two competitive exclusion equilibria and a stable coexistence cycle. This scenario is novel in that it predicts the competitive coexistence of two nearly identical species on a single limiting resource and does so under circumstances of increased interspecific competition. This prediction is in contradiction to classical tenets of competition theory.","Mary Washington Coll, Dept Math, Fredericksburg, VA 22401 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Math, Interdisciplinary Program Appl Math, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Andrews Univ, Dept Math, Berrien Springs, MI 49104 USA; Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; Univ Idaho, Div Stat, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA","Edmunds, J (corresponding author), Mary Washington Coll, Dept Math, Fredericksburg, VA 22401 USA.",jedmunds@mwc.edu,,"Cushing, Jim/0000-0003-1844-661X",,,,51,22,29,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

This includes intraspecies competitive effects (loading of the reactive iron surface by a single contaminant) as well as interspecies competition of several contaminants for the reactive sites available. In columns packed with zero-valent iron, the degradation behaviour of trichloroethylene (TCE), cis-dichloroethylene (DCE) and mixtures of both was measured in order to investigate interspecies competition. Although a decreasing rate of dechlorination is to be expected, when several degradable substances compete for the reactive sites on the iron surface, TCE degradation is nearly unaffected by the presence of cis-DCE. In contrast, cis-DCE degradation rates decrease significantly when TCE is added. A new modelling approach is developed in order to identify and quantify the observed competitive effects. The numerical model TBC (Transport, Biochemistry and Chemistry, Schafer et al., 1998a) is used to describe adsorption, desorption and dechlorination in a mechanistic way. Adsorption and degradation of a contaminant based on a limited number of reactive sites leads to a combined zero- and first-order degradation kinetics for high and low concentrations, respectively. The adsorption of several contaminants with different sorption parameters to a limited reactive surface causes interspecies competition. The reaction scheme and the parameters required are successfully transferred from Arnold and Roberts (2000b) to the model TBC. The degradation behaviour of the mixed contamination observed in the column experiments can be related to the adsorption properties of TCE and cis-DCE. By predicting the degradation of the single substances TCE and cis-DCE as well as mixtures of both, the calibrated model is used to investigate the effects of interspecies competition on the design of permeable reactive iron barriers. Even if TCE is present in only small concentrations (>3% of molar cis-DCE concentration) it is the contaminant limiting the residence time and the required thickness of the iron barrier.

Diet composition suggested that sympatric brown trout foraged more on invertebrate drift and from the surface than allopatric brown trout.

Paying special attention to functional groups, we analysed responses at three integration levels: carbon economy parameters, vegetative biomass of isolated plants, and growth in competition. CO2 effects on seed biomass and plant-to-plant variability were also studied. Underlying the growth stimulation is an increased unit leaf rate (ULR), especially for herbaceous dicots. This is mainly caused by an increase in the whole-plant rate of photosynthesis. The increased ULR is accompanied by a decrease in specific leaf area. The net result of these and other changes is that relative growth rate is only marginally stimulated. The biomass enhancement ratio (BER) of individually grown plants varies substantially across experiments/species, and size variability in the experimental populations is a vital factor in this. Fast-growing herbaceous C3 species respond more strongly than slow-growing C3 herbs or C4 plants. CAM species and woody plants show intermediate responses. When grown in competition, C4 species show lowest responses to elevated CO2 at high nutrient conditions, whereas at low nutrient levels N-2-fixing dicots respond relatively strongly. No systematic differences were found between slow- and fast-growing species. BER values obtained for isolated plants cannot be used to estimate BER of the same species grown in interspecific competition - the CO2 response of monocultures may be a better predictor.","Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; Ecole Natl Super Agron Montpellier, Dept Sci Protect Plants & Ecol, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France; CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Poorter, H (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, POB 800-84, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.poorter@bio.uu.nl,"Poorter, Hendrik/Y-2542-2019; Poorter, Hendrik/B-8062-2010","Poorter, Hendrik/0000-0001-9900-2433; Poorter, Hendrik/0000-0001-9900-2433",,,,146,391,420,10,301,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,FEB,2003,157,2,,,,,175,198,,10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00680.x,,,24,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,639CH,WOS:000180609700002,33873640,,,,2021-09-21,

The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecitic competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation.

Larvae and adult ladybirds were individually put into petri dishes at 25 degreesC with 20 eggs of the selected target species. The tests included three treatments: (a) only coccinellid eggs, (b) coccinellid eggs and 5 aphids, and (c) coccinellid eggs and 40 aphids. Intra-guild predation (IGP) by H. axyridis of eggs of the native species, A. bipunctata, was lower in comparison with egg cannibalism (CANN) by H. axyridis, for both adults and larvae. No differences were detected for larvae at the density of 5 aphids. IGP of exotic against the native species was never higher than CANN of native species. IGP of native species was never higher in comparison with CANN. A. bipunctata adult CANN was significantly higher than IGP at densities of 0 and 40 aphids. In the set of experiments on CANN and IGP an inverse correlation was observed between egg consumption by adults and larvae and aphid density. Our bioassays indicate that H. axyridis does not demonstrate IGP vs. native species at a higher level than CANN of native species. It appears that H. axyridis does show a high potential for CANN and therefore seems unlikely this species will to have a negative impact on native species by IGP of eggs.

We compared growth and survivorship of the two species at controlled temperatures of 24degrees and 30degreesC in water-containing tires under conditions of intra- and interspecific competition and with or without leaf litter. When other variables were controlled statistically, the estimated finite rate of increase (lambda') was significantly higher for both species at the higher temperature, and the proportional increases in lambda' did not differ between species. Therefore, our experiment predicts that by itself, temperatures between 24degrees and 30degreesC would not alter the outcome of larval competition.

Relative competition intensity (RCI), relative physiological performance and normalized ecological performance were used to characterize the competitive ability of two grasses (Danthonia richardsonii Cashmore, Phalaris aquatica L.) and two legumes (Lotus pedunculatus Cav., Trifolium repens L.) grown in monocultures and mixtures of the four species along a N gradient under conditions of ambient and elevated CO2 . Relative competition intensity could not be used to predict competitive outcomes in mixtures under conditions of elevated CO2 because it failed to account for changes in the size of interspecific differences along the N gradient and between CO2 concentrations. Relative physiological performance and relative ecological performance were more useful for investigating biomass production in mixtures and to predict species performance in mixtures from their performance in monocultures. Both indices of relative performance showed an increase in competitive intensity under elevated CO2 conditions. They also showed a decrease in competitive intensity with increasing N supply over most of the range of N supply, but a reversal of that trend at high levels of N supply. The merits and utility of these relative performance indices for elevated CO2 are discussed.","CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Canberra, ACT, Australia; CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Navas, ML (corresponding author), Ecole Natl Super Agron Montpellier, Dept Sci Protect Plantes & Ecol, Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France.",navas@ensam.inra.fr,"Austin, Mike P./G-2199-2010; Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012","Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154",,,,44,10,11,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,JUN,2002,27,4,,,,,463,473,,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2002.01201.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,569ZJ,WOS:000176633100013,,,,,2021-09-21,

Intraspecific density-dependent effects on worm sizes were observed in the abundant nematode Contracaecum rudolphii, as shown by a negative correlation between mean worm size and intensity of infection. Higher intensities of infection by C. rudolphii were also associated with more variable worm sizes in the nematode Syncuaria squamata, suggesting a one-sided and density-dependent interspecific effect. There was also clear evidence of some form of negative interaction between the nematode S. squamata and the acanthocephalan Southwellina hispida from two fronts. First, there was a strong negative correlation between the intensities of infection of the 2 species across hosts. Second, sizes of worms of 1 species became more variable as the number of worms of the other species per host increased, and vice versa. This interspecific density-dependent effect on growth was thus apparently symmetrical. We also found evidence that worm size is a predictor of egg output in the 3 helminth species, indicating that intra- and interspecific density-dependent effects on growth can affect population dynamics in these worms. These results illustrate the complex nature of density dependence in helminth growth, and how its effects can act both within and among species.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Biol, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy","Poulin, R (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",,"Sayyaf Dezfuli, Bahram/G-4184-2015; Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008; Volponi, Stefano/ABA-1869-2020","Sayyaf Dezfuli, Bahram/0000-0002-9778-5937; Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Volponi, Stefano/0000-0002-7471-2268",,,,28,44,46,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4221 USA",0031-1820,,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,MAY,2002,124,,5,,,,537,544,,10.1017/S0031182002001555,,,8,Parasitology,Parasitology,556HL,WOS:000175843300007,12049416,,,,2021-09-21,

We tested this idea with a native primary parasitoid, Eretmocerus eremicus, and an exotic autoparasitoid Encarsia sophia, both attacking the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill both the immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as whiteflies, and heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids. In population cages on cotton plants in the field in 1997 and 1998, we introduced whiteflies and then parasitoids in a replacement design with constant total numbers of parasitoids, as follows: (1) control (whiteflies only), (2) E. eremicus only, (3) E. sophia only, and (4) both E. eremicus and E. sophia. Destructive samples of plants were taken 2, 4, and 6 wk after wasp releases, and immature whitefly and wasp stages were censused. In 1997, there were no significant differences in whitefly densities among treatments. In 1998, the control treatment densities were significantly greater than parasitoid treatments, but there was no difference among the parasitoid treatments, indicating equivalent suppression of whitefly populations by the two parasitoid species. In both years, similar patterns in parasitoid dynamics were observed. Densities of E. eremicus were significantly higher in the absence of E. sophia. In contrast, E. sophia densities were unaffected by the presence of E, eremicus. The results suggest that interference by the autoparasitoid reduced primary parasitoid density, but with no concommitant disruption of host suppression. The results support theoretical predictions that no disruption should occur when both parasitoids are equally efficient and suggest that an autoparasitoid may be as efficient as a primary parasitoid in suppressing host densities.","Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Hunter, MS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, 410 Forbes Bldg, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mhunter@ag.arizona.edu,"Hunter, Martha/B-7307-2012; Hunter, Martha/AAF-5288-2020","Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X; Hunter, Martha/0000-0002-6342-675X",,,,46,22,31,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2002,83,5,,,,,1459,1469,,10.2307/3071957,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543YK,WOS:000175131300026,,,,,2021-09-21,

Ecological theory predicts a limit to morphological similarity among competing species, ideally manifested as a constant (Hutchinsonian) ratio of mean sizes among successive pairs of competing species. However, this pattern breaks down in many modern ecological systems because the effects of competition are mitigated by nonequilibrium factors such as predation and spatial heterogeneity. To test whether a consistent limit to similarity exists in a competition-dominated system, we analyzed the morphology of four coexisting brachiopod species in an Ordovician paleoenvironment in which nonequilibrium factors were negligible. Analysis of feeding-structure lengths using probabilistic models demonstrates that (1) ratios between means of successive species are unexpectedly constant (p < 0.03); and (2) species distributions overlap significantly less than expected (p < 0.03). These results suggest that a limit to similarity was reached, and that morphospace occupation by the four species was driven by interspecific competition. Demonstration of limiting similarity in this ancient community suggests that similar approaches could be used to assess the relative influence of interspecific competition on community diversity and structure through deep time.","Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Hermoyian, CS (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",,,"Kaplan, Peter/0000-0002-4588-4095",,,,43,11,12,0,7,"GEOLOGICAL SOC AMERICA, INC",BOULDER,"PO BOX 9140, BOULDER, CO 80301-9140 USA",0091-7613,,,GEOLOGY,Geology,JAN,2002,30,1,,,,,15,18,,10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0015:TTROCI>2.0.CO;2,,,4,Geology,Geology,515KR,WOS:000173495200004,,,,,2021-09-21,

The second investigated the fate of fragments of C. taxifolia transplanted into patches of C. racemosa, in contrast to those established on algal turfs. C. racemosa and C. taxifolia had similar temporal trends in growth but reached different sizes, The overall increase in stolon length at higher densities for both species suggested that positive interactions are very important. However, there was a significant interspecific effect on C. taxifolia stolon length but no effect on C. racemosa. Furthermore, C. taxifolia fragments transplanted into C. racemosa patches showed clear signs of stress with respect to those transplanted into algal turfs: blades became blanched and eroded, Overall, the results of this study suggest that growth increases with density augmentation, therefore suggesting that invasive characteristics of the species may increase with the time of colonisation.

In species in which females mate with multiple males and are capable of storing sperm for extended periods, sperm allocation of males should be tailored to the risk of sperm competition. Recent game theory predicts that males should transfer the least sperm when there are no other rivals, and the most sperm when only one other rival is likely to inseminate the female. However, as the numbers of competitors increases beyond two, the models predict a corresponding decrease in ejaculate expenditure. We tested these predictions in three cricket species, Gryllodes sigillatus, Gryllus veletis, and Gryllus texensis, assessing the sperm allocation of males held under three levels of apparent interrival competition: no rivals, one rival and six rivals. Sperm allocation of G. veletis varied according to theory: males increased their sperm allocation with an increased risk of sperm competition (no rivals vs. one), but decreased their allocation with an increased intensity of sperm competition (one rival vs. six). Sperm allocation of male G. texensis showed no significant response to the density of rivals, and sperm allocation in G. sigillatus was influenced by an unexpected interaction between treatment density and the order in which males experienced the three treatments. The observed interspecific variation in facultative sperm allocation may be due to interspecific differences in population density, rearing environment, or female mating behavior.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Sakaluk, SK (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,,,,,49,80,83,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

In this study, we examined the influence of competition on species composition across a salinity gradient. This work involved three common fresh and brackish marsh species. The three species, Spartina patens, Sagittaria lancifolia, and Panicum hernitomon, differ in salt tolerances but are commonly found in overlapping zones across coastal marsh gradients in the southeastern United States. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under four salinity treatments (0, 2, 4, and 8 g/kg), in monocultures and in three-species mixtures. Data from the monocultures and mixtures were used to examine the importance of competition in regulating community composition and species' growth. Results for individual species were significantly different when grown in monoculture vs, the three-species mixture. While with increasing salinity community dominance shifted toward the most salt-tolerant species, Spartina parens, competition was found to alter community composition equally over all salinities. However, the responses of individual species demonstrated a very different pattern; the relative importance of competition in influencing individual growth differed substantially depending on the salinity tolerances of species. These results support the contention that, as abiotic stress increases, competition becomes less of a limiting factor in regulating the abundance of a species. However, the role of competition at the community level is the sum of the individual species' responses and may or may not vary with the level of abiotic stress.","Jonshon Controls World Serv, Natl Wetlands Res Ctr, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA; Louisiana State Univ, Wetland Biogeochem Inst, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","La Peyre, MKG (corresponding author), Jonshon Controls World Serv, Natl Wetlands Res Ctr, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA.",,"Grace, James/B-8472-2009",,,,,47,96,100,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2001,82,1,,,,,62,69,,,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393UN,WOS:000166488200006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Using a plant-pollinator system as a model, I tested the prediction the presence of a competitor for pollination influences the strength and/or direction of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits. I measured phenotypic selection via female fitness on five floral traits of Ipomopsis aggregata in seven populations. Four contained only conspecifics (I only) and three also contained the competitor Castilleja linariaefolia (C + I). Directional selection via fruits/plant and conspecific pollen deposited/flower on corolla length was positive and significantly stronger in C + I populations. This difference in selection was apparently driven by interpopulation variation in the degree to which reproduction of I. aggregata was pollen limited. Consistent with expectations of interspecific competition, I. aggregata plants in C + I populations received less conspecific pollen per flower and set fewer seeds per fruit and fruits per plant than those in I only populations. Ipomopsis aggregata's corollas were also significantly longer in C + I populations, suggesting that there had been a response to a similar selective regime in past generations. Phenotypic correlations between corolla length and width, which determine the variation in I. aggregata's flower shape, were significantly weaker in C + I populations. These data suggest that competition for pollination can influence the strength of selection on and patterns of correlations among floral traits of I. aggregata. If I. aggregata populations with and without competitors for pollination are linked by gene flow, then measuring selection in competitive and noncompetitive environments maybe necessary to accurately predict how floral traits will evolve.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Shelford Vivarium, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Lab, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Caruso, CM (corresponding author), Grinnell Coll, Dept Biol, POB 805, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.",,,"Caruso, Christina/0000-0001-7069-9572",,,,72,149,154,0,60,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,OCT,2000,54,5,,,,,1546,1557,,,,,12,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,376RR,WOS:000165471000008,11108583,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

In this set of field experiments, we evaluated the interactive, dynamic effects of limited food supply and predation from wolf spiders (Lycosidae) on mortality in Ageneotettix deorum, a common grasshopper (Acrididae) from North American sandhills grasslands. We attempted to determine whether the combined effects of food availability and spider predation on mortality were (1) noncompensatory, with the effects of each factor summing to determine ultimate population size, or (2) compensatory, where the effect of one mortality factor alters the impact of subsequent factors so that the ultimate population size changes little, despite variation in specific sources of mortality. We also investigated whether changes in nutritional quality encountered by grasshoppers would result in different dynamic responses to predation in the context of noncompensatory vs. compensatory responses. Both food availability and predation risk contributed to mortality rates. Individuals of A. deorum were food limited. Survival of grasshoppers feeding on fertilized plants was 50% higher than that of grasshoppers feeding on unfertilized plants over a 31-d period. Most of the mortality due to limited food occurred 12-14 d into the experiment. Predation from lycosid spiders decreased the numbers of individuals by 49% in the first 10-15 days of the experiment. Either noncompensatory or compensatory responses resulted from the combined effects of food availability and predation on population size, depending upon the nutritional status of host plants. At ambient-level food quality (no fertilizer), spider predation and food limitation were compensatory; the same numbers of grasshoppers were recovered in treatments with and without spider-predation risk after 31 d. However, with higher food quality (N fertilizer), spider predation reduced the numbers of surviving individuals as compared with the no-spider-predation treatment, a noncompensatory response. In separate, preplanned experiments, individuals surviving spider-predation treatments lived longer than did individuals protected from spider predation when they were caged individually over vegetation of ambient quality. Combined, these experiments emphasize the importance of food quality as a determinant of how this predator-prey system responds, and the results suggest a mechanism underlying the response. After predation, survivors are likely to encounter more food per capita and to exhibit higher individual quality, which promotes longevity, presumably from reduced competition. This leads to a compensatory response. Under high food quality regimes, predation and food probably act in a noncompensatory fashion because grasshoppers are less food limited, and the release of additional food on a per capita basis by predation has less effect on the subsequent number of survivors.","Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Joern, A (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,101,46,50,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2000,81,1,,,,,66,77,,10.2307/177134,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,277BT,WOS:000084913400007,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

P. lozanoi ingested less food during their stay in the creek (2.4 % of its body weight). O. gammarallus also occurred in its diet, but mysids were the main food items both during flood and ebb. In addition to this trophic segregation, a temporal segregation was observed. In fact, Fl minutus stayed longer than P. lozanoi in the saltmarsh; it colonised creeks first and returned to coastal waters the last.

In many cases, odours indicate the presence of both food and predators. Spider mites are known to use odours to locate food and mates, but also to avoid interspecific competitors. We studied the response of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, to cues associated with the presence of their predators, the phytoseiid Phytoseiulus persimilis. We found that the spider mites strongly avoid plants defended by this predator, but do not avoid plants with another predatory mite, Neoseiulus californicus. Since P. persimilis is commonly used in the greenhouse where our strain of T. urticae was collected and strains of this pest are known to adapt to greenhouse environments, we hypothesize that there has been selection on the pest to recognize its enemy. We further hypothesize that there has been no selection to recognize N. californicus, as it has not been used against two-spotted spider mites in the greenhouse where our spider mites were collected. We discuss the implications of avoidance of predation by spider mites and non-lethal effects of predators for biological control of this pest in greenhouses.","Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Anim Biol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, Kruislaan 320, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands.",janssen@bio.uva.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545",,,,49,50,52,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Data from seventy-one islands and 882 specimens are examined fur evidence of the effects of latitude, island size and interspecific competition among rats and the house mouse (Mus musculus L.) on skull size, using multiple regressions. For R. exulans, skull size increases with latitude as predicted by Bergmann's rule, but no such effect occurs for the other two rats. There was a positive relationship between island size and the number of species inhabiting it, and some species combinations were more likely to occur than others. For example, R. exulans and R. norvegicus were more likely to occur together, while R. rattus and R. exulans were rarely sympatric. R. exulans and R. rattus skull size was negatively correlated with the number of other rodents on the same island. Ii. exulans skull size increased on smaller islands in some island groups, perhaps because increased density and consequent increased intraspecific competition on smaller islands favours increased body size. This effect is more pronounced in tropical islands (Solomon islands), than in subtropical ones (Hawaiian islands) and less so in temperate New Zealand. Collectively the data demonstrate that rapid evolution of body size in predictable directions can follow within 150 years of the introduction of species to new receiving communities.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Yom-Tov, Y (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",yomtov@post.tau.ac.il; henrik.moller@stonebow.otago.ac.nz,,"Yom, Sue/0000-0002-0779-7476",,,,82,90,95,2,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Crosses between weed-competitive but low-yielding African rice, Oryza glaberrima, and improved Oryza sativa tropical-japonica rices, might reduce tradeoffs between competitiveness and yield potential. Parallel field studies under moist upland conditions were conducted during the 1996 and 1997 wet seasons at Mbe in Cote d'Ivoire to (1) characterize canopy properties, growth vigor and yield for O. glaberrima, O. sativa and interspecific progenies under monoculture, and (2) determine their competitiveness when grown in single rows in competition with natural weed growth, maize (removed 50 days after sowing [DAS]), the highly weed-competitive O. glaberima IG10, and with themselves, in the monoculture study with 21 lines, dry matter, leaf area index (LAI), PAR extinction coefficient (K-df), mean tip elevation angle (MTA) and specific leaf area (SLA) were measured 31, 46 and 64 DAS. Across lines, LAI was positively correlated with SLA, dry matter partitioning to leaves (31 and 46 DAS) and Kdf (46 DAS); and negatively with MTA (46 and 64 DAS). Plant height was negatively correlated with tiller number. In the competition study with 16 lines, the O. glaberrima landraces had superior relative yield (yield under interspecific competition/yield under intraspecific competition). Some breeding lines were competitive with specific competitors. Correlations between canopy characteristics under monoculture and competition indicated that LAI, SLA and tillering ability were predictive of competitiveness regardless of the competing species, whereas partitioning, Kdf and MTA were correlated with competitiveness only for specific growth stages and/or competitors. Competitiveness was negatively but weakly correlated with yield potential, and positively, with crop duration. The authors conclude that SLA and tillering ability, which are major determinants of vegetative vigor, and crop duration, which affects the ability to recover from early competition, are useful traits in the selection of weed-competitive rices, particularly in breeding programs that use O. glaberrima. The traits are compatible with high yield potential if cultivars have large SLA during early developmental stages and small SLA during advanced stages. Major knowledge gaps remain on weed competitiveness under drought- and flood-prone conditions, which are frequently associated with weed problems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ranging up to 10 cm in length, the bryoliths are composed almost exclusively of the anascan cheilostome Biflustra commensale. Approximately 50% of the bryoliths are nucleated on cerithiid or muricoid gastropod shells; secondary occupants (presumably pagurid crabs) determined the subspherical growth and associated epibionts of all of these specimens. Evidence for crab occupation includes the thick and relatively symmetrical bryozoan overgrowths that form short tubes extending from the aperture, thinning and pinchout of laminae on the undersides of bryoliths (wear facets), and the distinctive borings (Helicotaphrichnus) of symbiotic worms. In some instances, shells were infested by bryozoans and other encrusters before death of the gastropod, but these overgrowths are thin relative to hermit-associated bryozoan colonies. Episodic hermit abandonment, indicated by extensive erosion of the bryolith and/or its colonization by a more diverse epibiont assemblage including oysters and serpulids, was more frequent among bryoliths nucleated on the largest and most fouled gastropod shells; it was also more frequent among bryoliths in the relatively high-energy tidal channel thalweg than among those associated with oyster thickets on muddy channel margins. Bryoliths nucleated on other shell substrata are similarly thick, but have more irregular stratigraphies including more sedimentary inclusions, more borings, and fewer encrusting epibionts. Pebbles of crystalline basement rock are also encrusted by B. commensale, but only thinly. Ail of these bryoliths nor inhabited by crabs are limited to the channel thalweg. As many as four distinct colonies of B. commensale could coexist on a single bryolith; lines of competitive standoff between colonies are marked by mineralized walls and topographic ridges on the bryolith exterior, and by teepee-like structures in cross-section. These standoffs were preferred sites of infestation by other epibionts and were remarkably stable in position on bryoliths with continuous hermit occupation. Bryoliths that suffered repeated abandonment by hermits, or that depended entirely upon chance reorientation, are characterized by highly unstable standoff positions, reflecting scramble competition under less predictable conditions. These circumstances were most common among large bryoliths and among those in channel thalwegs.","Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Kidwell, SM (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",skidwell@midway.uchicago.edu,,,,,,47,18,18,1,3,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0024-1164,,,LETHAIA,Lethaia,SEP,1998,31,3,,,,,221,239,,,,,19,Paleontology,Paleontology,126QP,WOS:000076304900007,,,,,2021-09-21,

In the last two decades predator-prey models have shown that 'refuges', in which prey can seek respite from predation, are crucial for the persistence of prey and predator. This concept is equally applicable to interspecific competition and, in a heterogeneous environment, species with low competitive ability should seek out 'competition refuges' where competition is reduced. 2. Cheetahs have low competitive ability compared with their principal competitors, hyenas and lions, which are directly responsible for their low density. This study uses distribution data collected in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania over a 4-year period to show that cheetahs are more strongly associated with each other than with their competitors and utilize areas with low-density prey. 3. Cheetahs exhibit local avoidance behaviour in both space and time with respect to lions and hyenas. This behaviour is facultative and is strongest when cheetahs are engaged in activities that might expose them to food loss or increase the risk of close interactions, such as when they are hunting or eating. 4. Lactating cheetahs, whose range is restricted, are more likely to have difficulties finding prey and come into more frequent contact with lions than free-ranging animals. 5. It is argued that although cheetahs always lose in direct competition, they persist in the ecosystem by seeking out 'competition refuges' with low densities of lions and hyenas and that their mobility is the key to their continued coexistence with these predators. This pattern of distribution may be generally applicable to other species which, although widely distributed, always occur at low densities.","Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England","Durant, SM (corresponding author), Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England.",,"Durant, Sarah M/AAB-9659-2019","Durant, Sarah M/0000-0003-0724-0878",,,,47,265,268,3,117,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Theory predicts that the species with the lowest food level (TFL) should always be the superior competitor if only one food source is offered. However, TFLs are not species specific constants but may change along environmental gradients such as food size or temperature. The hypothesis that temperature differentially affects the TFLs of three planktonic rotifers (Asplanchna priodonta, Brachionus calyciflorus and Synchaeta pectinata) was tested in laboratory experiments. Numerical responses were assessed for all three rotifers at 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 degrees C with Cryptomonas erosa as food alga. Growth rates of all three rotifers at high food concentrations (1 mg C l(-1)) increased as temperature increased until the limits of thermal tolerance were reached. This increase was very pronounced for Brachionus, but less for Synchaeta which already had relatively high growth rates at 12 degrees C. Along the temperature gradient, the TFLs of Synchaeta increased from 0.074 to 0.66 mg C l(-1), whereas those of Asplanchna and Brachionus stayed relatively constant at 0.3 and 0.2 mg C l(-1), respectively. Hence, the zero net growth isocline (ZNGI) of Synchaeta crossed those of Brachionus and Asplanchna at 16 and 20.5 degrees C, respectively. The results suggest that Synchaeta is better adapted to low temperatures than the other two rotifers and should be the superior competitor below 16 degrees C.","Max Planck Inst Limnol, D-24306 Plon, Germany","Stelzer, CP (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Limnol, POB 165, D-24306 Plon, Germany.",,"Stelzer, Claus-Peter/F-3789-2018","Stelzer, Claus-Peter/0000-0002-6682-0904",,,,18,29,33,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,,1998,387,,,,,,349,353,,10.1023/A:1017043222783,,,5,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,195DR,WOS:000080234300048,,,,,2021-09-21,

In this paper, we describe responses of benthic, trout stream communities to replicated, whole-ecosystem perturbations resulting from pathogen-induced reductions in populations of a dominant grazer the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior. Previous small-scale experiments suggested that Glossosoma had strong competitive effects on other grazers (through exploitation) and small-bodied filter-feeders (through interference). Glossosoma populations collapsed in a number of Michigan trout streams since the late 1980s and have been maintained at low levels by recurrent pathogen outbreaks. Here we address the effects on periphyton, grazers, and filter-feeders of parasite-induced Glossosoma reductions in six streams for which considerable pre-and post-collapse data are available, and we compare the results of this large-scale perturbation to responses predicted from a small-scale experiment that had been previously conducted in one of these streams. Periphyton and most grazers and filter-feeders showed marked increases in abundance following reduction in Glossosoma populations. Several grazers that were rare or absent prior to Glossosoma collapse have established sizable populations, suggesting that they had been excluded by competition with Glossosoma. The small-scale experiment successfully predicted the direction of response of most taxa to whole-stream reductions in Glossosoma abundance, but it tended to underestimate the extent and magnitude of Glossosoma's effects in the community. In these systems, observations at larger spatial and temporal scales have been essential to developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms structuring communities.","UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH NAT RESOURCES & ENVIRONM, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA","Kohler, SL (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,"Wiley, Michael/A-6853-2012",,,,,62,111,113,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1997,78,7,,,,,2164,2176,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2164:PORLSE]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ789,WOS:A1997XZ78900020,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

A model for evolution of body size under asymmetric competition within and between species is described. The model links processes operating at the scale of the individual to that of macroscopic evolution through a stochastic mutation-selection process. Phase portraits of evolution in a phenotype space characteristically show character convergence and parallel character shifts, with character divergence being relatively uncommon. The asymptotic states of evolution depend very much on the properties of asymmetric competition. Given relatively weak asymmetries between species, a single equilibrium point exists; this is a local attractor, and its position is determined by the intra- and interspecific asymmetries. When the asymmetries are made stronger, several fixed points may come about, creating further equilibrium points which are local attractors. It is also possible for periodic attractors to occur; such attractors comprise Red Queen dynamics with phenotype values that continue to change without ever settling down to constant values. From certain initial conditions, evolution leading to extinction of one of the species is also a likely outcome.","LEIDEN UNIV, INST EVOLUT & ECOL SCI, NL-2300 AA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","Law, R (corresponding author), UNIV YORK, DEPT BIOL, YORK YO1 5DD, N YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.",,"Dieckmann, Ulf/E-1424-2011","Dieckmann, Ulf/0000-0001-7089-0393; Marrow, Paul/0000-0001-9335-6433",,,,60,77,79,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

However, while monogamous anthropoids show low degrees of weight dimorphism, as predicted by the sexual selection hypothesis, polygynous anthropoids show high variation in weight dimorphism that is not associated with measures of mating system or sex ratio. This observation has led many to debate the role of other factors such as dietary constraints, predation pressure, substrate constraints, allometric effects, and phylogeny in the evolution of anthropoid weight dimorphism. Here, we re-evaluate variation in adult body weight dimorphism in anthropoids, testing the sexual selection hypothesis using categorical estimates of the degree of male-male intrasexual competition (''competition levels''). We also test the hypotheses that interspecific variation in body weight dimorphism is associated with female body weight and categorical estimates of diet, substrate use, and phylogeny. Weight dimorphism is strongly associated with competition levels, corroborating the sexual selection hypothesis. Weight dimorphism is positively correlated with increasing female body weight, but evidence suggests that the correlation reflects an interaction between overall size and behavior, Arboreal species are, on average, less dimorphic than terrestrial species, while more frugivorous species tend to be more dimorphic than folivorous or insectivorous species. Several alternative hypotheses can explain these latter results. Weight dimorphism is correlated with taxonomy, but so too are competition levels. We suggest that most taxonomic correlations of weight dimorphism represent ''phylogenetic niche conservatism''; however, colobines show consistently low degrees of weight dimorphism for reasons that are not clear.

We test the hypothesis that the thermal physiology of Otomys sloggetti restricts its distribution to altitudes above 2000 m, below which it does not occur. 2. The thermal physiology of O. sloggetti is typical of rodents from warm/hot areas: the thermoneutral zone is relatively broad and lies between 26 and 28 degrees C; the upper limit of the thermoneutral zone can be extended by 4 degrees C through the use of hyperthermia; basal metabolic rate concurs with the allometrically predicted value; the lower critical temperature is high; minimal thermal conductance is 21% higher than the allometrically predicted value; and the capacity for noradrenaline-induced nonshivering thermogenesis is 19% lower than the allometrically predicted value. 3. Evaporative water loss and water flux rates are high and typical of mesic-adapted rodents. 4. The absence of O. sloggetti from warmer, lower-lying habitats cannot be attributed to its thermal physiology.

We compared short-term competition between single cohorts of the two species and long-term competition involving four cohorts of each species, which were introduced at 6-day intervals. In the single cohort experiment, A. albopictus grew faster than T. bambusa. However, in the multiple cohort experiment, although the first cohort of A. albopictus grew faster and began to pupate earlier than that of T. bambusa, molting rates of later cohorts of A. albopictus, that were introduced on the 12th and the 18th day, were lower than those of T. bambusa. The survival rate of A. albopictus became lower than that of A. bambusa after the 18th day. The cumulative number of the pupated T. bambusa individuals exceeded that of A. albopictus on the 96th day. The final pupation success was higher in T. bambusa than in A. albopictus, especially when additional leaves were supplied on the 48th and the 96th days.

Plant responses to density and relative time of emergence in different stands are investigated in pot and box experiments. Principles shown have relevance to annual crop and crop-weed stands. Measurement methods are in focus as a continuation of discussions in ''Paper 1'' (Hakansson, 1997). Growth is described by graphs representing regression equations based on dry weights of aerial shoots measured at different times. From these equations, growth rate (GR) and relative growth rate (RGR) and other biomass ratios, such as the unit production ratio (UPR), are calculated as functions of time (in days or temperature sums). Rather soon after emergence, aerial shoot growth is affected by competition. With an increased intra- and/or interspecific competition resulting from increased plant densities, GR reaches its maximum earlier and RGR decreases more rapidly with the progress of time in early periods. In many respects, a delayed emergence of ''B plants'' in a stand of ''A plants'' affects growth similarly to an increased density of A. Such effects of competition should be considered when plants are to be characterized regarding their growth rhythm. The growth reduction rate (RR), i.e. the reduction of the biomass growth per unit of time, reaches its maximum rather early, near the times of GR maxima, i.e. at times depending on densities. Biomass ratios such as ''Y(rel.)'' and UPR show that the regulation of biomass proportions between different plants in a stand caused by competition mainly occurs in a rather concentrated period before and up to GR maxima. This phenomenon is of great interest for the choice of suitable times of measuring competitive effects and ought to be studied in more detail. Problems in judging the ''need for weed control'' in a particular crop by predicting the yield loss on the basis of early assessments of the crop's and weeds' leaf cover, or the like - reflected here by measurements of biomasses - are discussed. It is argued that interest should be increasingly focused on knowledge allowing long-term predictions of the occurrence and impact of different weeds in different cropping and management systems.",,"Hakansson, S (corresponding author), SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, DEPT CROP PROD SCI, POB 7043, S-75007 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,14,9,9,0,9,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0049-2701,,,SWED J AGR RES,Swed.

In laboratory experiments cores containing no macrofauna had significantly higher densities of diatoms than cores with C. volutator and cores with N. diversicolor after 8 d. In field experiments the densities of diatoms increased where C. volulator were removed, by spraying with insecticide, and where N. diversicolor were prevented from surface deposit feeding, by the insertion of porous mats under the surface. The mean daily rates of consumption of diatoms by individual C, volutator and N. diversicolor in the field were estimated to be 2150 to 3767 and 5476 to 12 184 cells respectively. In the laboratory the effects of C, volutator and N, diversicolor on the species composition of the diatom assemblage were similar. In the field the assemblages that developed where predation was reduced were different because of initial differences in diatom assemblage structure in the 2 experimental areas. The laboratory results showed that C. volutator and N, diversicolor may feed on the same species of diatoms when presented with the same diatom assemblage, indicating that interspecific competition for food may be important under some natural conditions.","UNIV LONDON QUEEN MARY & WESTFIELD COLL, SCH BIOL SCI, LONDON E1 4NS, ENGLAND; NAT HIST MUSEUM, DEPT BOT, LONDON SW7 5BD, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,35,46,47,0,11,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Dense growth of introduced Spartina spp. reduces open mud feeding habitats of shorebirds, while in the upper intertidal, introduced Spartina spp. compete with native salt mal sh vegetation. Prediction of Spartina invasions is facilitated by the remarkable restriction of these species to distinct estuarine habitats which generally lack interspecific competitors and herbivores. We used physical characteristics to identify 31 specific sites along the US Pacific coast that are vulnerable to future Spartina invasions and then used species characteristics, like native latitudinal range and past invasion success, to predict which Spartina species will be likely to invade these sites in the future. All 31 sites were predicted to be vulnerable to S. alterniflora, while the other invasive Spartina spp. may be restricted to a subset of the vulnerable sites. At a finer scale, within a vulnerable site, the mean tidal range can be used to predict the extent of spatial spread of a Spartina sp. after colonization. These prediction techniques might be used to identify and prioritize sites for protection against future invasions. We suggest that a cost-effective way to prevent the transformation of unique North American Pacific mudflat and saltmarsh communities into introduced Spartina-dominated marshes is to survey the vulnerable sites frequently and eliminate introduced Spartina spp. propagules before they spread.

The spatial distributions of these beetles at the microhabitat scale were negatively correlated. We performed a removal experiment, progressively removing first 25% and then a further 25% of the population of the most abundant species, P. globosa, under the trees where most of the preferred food of both species is concentrated. There was no response of O. rugatipennis to this removal in the tree habitat. In the open, barely-vegetated habitat where most O. rugatipennis are found, the number of this species caught in pitfall traps increased following both removals and decreased following P. globosa replacement under the trees. It appears that intraspecific competition forces some P. globosa to occupy the open habitat. Interspecific competition between P. globosa and O. rugatipennis in the open habitat reduces the number of O. rugatipennis that can co-exist with P. globosa there. Removal of P. globosa under the trees allows conspecifics in the open habitat to move under the trees, releasing O. rugatipennis in the open habitat from competition. This then results in an increase in the numbers of O. rugatipennis in the open habitat as a result of immigration from neighbouring areas. We found that differences in foraging efficiency, measured as giving-up times in artificial food patches, create a likely mechanism of co-existence that explains the distinct preferences of these two species for tree and open habitats.","DESERT ECOL RES UNIT NAMIBIA,SWAKOPMUND 9000,NAMIBIA",,,"Seely, Mary Kathryn/AAI-1072-2019; Ward, David/E-9814-2010",,,,,64,14,14,0,14,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

These aspects were also investigated by releasing T. pyri, A. andersoni and Amblyseius aberrans (Oudemans) on some of the above varieties. Tn most of the experimental years (1989-1992), selective pesticides were used in order to allow a successful release of phytoseiids, in particular A. aberrans. The use of non-selective insecticides was re-established during 1993 in order to test its effect on the new mite communities originating from 1989 onwards. In the first years of the experiments an apparent relationship between grape variety and phytoseiid species was observed: in the control plots, A. andersoni occurred on Merlot where T. pyri was rare, while the latter species was largely dominant over A. andersoni on Trebbiano and Garganega. Panonychus ulmi populations reached moderate levels only on Merlot and in the first part of experiments. The variety-phytoseiid species relationship was temporary as, at the end of experiments, T. pyri was completely dominant on all varieties. This new situation started when prey occurrence and interspecific competition decreased in importance. The moderate success of the T. pyri release on Merlot contrasts with the results of previous experiments. Two factors could be involved in this phenomenon: low interspecific competition by phytoseiids and predation by macropredators. Amblyseius aberrans was able to displace A. andersoni and T. pyri on grape varieties where the two species were more abundant and reached higher population densities on varieties with pubescent leaf undersurfaces. In the first experimental year, spider mite densities were reduced more effectively in A. aberrans release plots than in the control or in T. pyri release plots. One year later, P. ulmi reached lower levels in the release treatments than in the control. Typhlodromus pyri and A. aberrans persisted in conditions of prey scarcity. The high competitivity of A. aberrans over the remaining two phytoseiid species constitutes a major factor in selecting predatory species for inoculative releases in vineyards.",,"Camporese, P (corresponding author), UNIV PADUA,INST AGR ENTOMOL,VIA GRADENIGO 6,I-35100 PADUA,ITALY.",,"duso, carlo/AAG-8435-2020","Duso, Carlo/0000-0002-2600-2536",,,,33,45,47,0,2,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

The effects of intraspecific and interspecific larval competition on larval survival, adult size, adult longevity and fecundity were quantified in four species of coexisting Lucilia blowflies: illustris, silvarum, sericata and caesar. 2. There was a general negative effect of increasing density on larval and adult survival, size and fecundity. Additionally, complex species-specific and frequency-dependent responses were identified, which were not expected in these biologically and morphologically closely similar species. 3. Lucilia illustris, the numerically dominant species in the natural community, was a superior competitor to L.silvarum at intermediate densities but an inferior competitor at high density. Such nonlinear responses may be related to differences in the life histories and larval behaviour of the species (bigger eggs and more contest-type outcome of competition in L.silvarum). 4. We parameterized a model of interspecific competition on a subdivided resource in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting results on larval competitive abilities and the abundances of the species in the field. Using laboratory and field-estimated parameter values the model predicted coexistence of L.illustris and L.silvarum and the observed numerical dominance of the former species.

The model provided a good fit to observed density patterns and indicated that habitat suitability declined non-linearly with increased heterospecific competitor densities. Competitive effects in riffles appeared to be due to exploitative resource use, with salmon always emerging as the superior competitor. No evidence was found for interference competition in riffles. In contrast, interspecific competition in pools seemed to occur through exploitation and interference. The specific identity of the superior competitor in pools depended on the density of both species; pools provided the charr with refuge from competition with the salmon, presumably through the adoption by the charr of density-dependent behaviours, such as schooling and group foraging, that mitigated the negative impact of the salmon. Charr were displaced from the riffles toward the pools as the total salmon density increased.

The experiments were conducted using oyster shell habitats constructed in the intertidal zone. First we tested whether crab losses from intertidal shell habitat constructed in the intertidal zone. First we tested whether crab losses from intertidal shell habitat were due to density-dependent emigration, density-dependent predation, or both. Our results show that although both processes account for crab losses, predation is not density-dependent, and most crabs had emigrated rather than being eaten at high crab density. Field experiments were also conducted to test the effect of crab density, food availability and conspecific physical contact on crab emigration. Treatments were different densities of free crabs to allow physical contact between them or individually caged crabs to prevent physical contact, with or without enhanced food (small clams). Emigration of crabs from experimental shell habitat increased with density of free crabs, irrespective of whether food was enhanced or risk of predation increased. Our results suggest that physical interactions regulate density because: (1) the per capita consumption rate of clams in the artificial shell plots was significantly lower at high crab density; and (2) density of enclosed crabs did not affect the immigration rate of conspecifics. Although the ultimate cause may be competition for food or avoidance of cannibalism, we suggest that when crab recruitment to epibenthic shell substratum has been successful, crab density over the short term is regulated primarily by space competition mediated by physical interactions.",,"IRIBARNE, O (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH FISHERIES,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.",,,,,,,43,38,38,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Co-occurrence of 11 species of crepuscular-nocturnal medium-sized tunnelling dung beetles from two core functional groups that vary in their rate of dung burial was examined at a range of spatial and temporal scales to identify the likely extent to which competition for dung might affect the structure of beetle communities of subtropical pasture. 2. At the largest scale, clear seasonal co-occurrence and similar habitat preferences (soil type and vegetation associations) were found amongst the species. 3. Medium- and fine-scale distributions of the species were investigated across nine blocks of dung-baited traps dispersed over a 400 ha tract of open cattle pasture, on deep sandy soil in Natal, South Africa. Traps were baited overnight and cleared in the morning in two series of three successive days. 4. There was marked variation in mean numbers caught within and between each 3-day trapping period, and also between blocks in the total number of beetles (pooled over species) or individual species caught per block. The spatial relationship for total beetles between blocks persisted for several days, but not several weeks. 5. Significant intraspecific aggregation was apparent for all species at the medium spatial scale amongst individual pads and between blocks over the 400 ha, but at the finest spatial scale (within blocks) most species were randomly distributed on most occasions, irrespective of the abundance of the species. The actual level of aggregation was thus found to increase at higher spatial scales. 6. Pairwise species comparisons showed little or no positive association on the majority of occasions and negative pairwise associations were exceedingly rare. Positive association between the two functional groups was stronger, however, and positive species association at the community-wide level was evident on most occasions. 7. There was thus some evidence of independent spatial aggregation patterns amongst individual species on a medium spatial scale (400 ha), but not on a fine scale (100 m2). Intraspecific/functional group aggregation tended to be greater than interspecific/functional group aggregation at all scales of analysis. Despite this, beetle densities in a considerable proportion of pads in the field would indicate, based on previous experimental evidence, that significant levels of inter- and intraspecific/functional group competition for dung is likely to occur. Thus, the aggregative behaviour of species documented here is not predicted to significantly diminish the level of interspecific competition within and between the two functional groups in this system.","CSIRO,DUNG BEETLE RES UNIT,PRETORIA,SOUTH AFRICA",,,"Giller, Paul/AAB-1187-2021","Giller, Paul/0000-0002-0641-7152",,,,46,47,48,1,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We extend one of these analyses to Bermuda, which differs from the previous islands in its size, latitude and isolation from the mainland. We tested for the presence of morphological overdispersion in surviving introduced passeriforms. Despite a possible predominance of random events in the assembly process due to Bermuda's small size and the presence of migrant species, the surviving passeriforms were morphologically overdispersed. The presence of this pattern supports the hypothesis that the assembly of the Bermuda passeriform community has been influenced by interspecific competition. This marks the third distinct community of island land birds in which this competitive pattern has been identified. This is particularly interesting because certain attributes of Bermuda and its avifauna make it more equivalent to communities in mainland refuges than avian assemblages on islands studied previously. This suggests that interspecific competition may have important effects on the structure of refuge communities.","GEORGIA SO UNIV,DEPT BIOL,STATESBORO,GA 30460","LOCKWOOD, JL (corresponding author), UNIV TENNESSEE,DEPT ZOOL,KNOXVILLE,TN 37996, USA.",,,"Moulton, Michael/0000-0003-4041-9343; Lockwood, Julie/0000-0003-0177-449X",,,,37,34,35,1,7,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities. Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by superior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs among competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity. This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade-offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.",,"TILMAN, D (corresponding author), UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, 1987 UPPER BUFORD CIRCLE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA.",,,,,,,77,1723,1840,25,1223,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1994,75,1,,,,,2,16,,10.2307/1939377,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MP602,WOS:A1994MP60200002,,,,,2021-09-21,

The gradient contained plots ranging from 100% sand to 100% black soil, plus plots that received additional N fertilizer. To examine the impact of initial conditions on the long-term outcome of interspecific competition, three competitive situations were created: seed vs. seed competition (both species planted simultaneously), seed invasions (each species added as seed to year-old monocultures of the other), and vegetative invasions (dividers separating adjacent monocultures of two species removed after 1 yr). Extractable soil NO3- and NH4+ were measured to test if species differences in the concentration of available soil N in monoculture (i.e., R* for N, Tilman 1982) could predict the long-term outcome of competition. By year 5, Schizachyrium displaced or greatly reduced the biomass of both Poa and Agropyron on the soil mixture gradient (the mixed soils but not the added-N plots) independent of the wide range of starting conditions. On these soils, Schizachyrium monocultures had significantly lower soil concentrations of both NO3- and NH4+ than either Poa or Agropyron monocultures. Similarly, Agropyron displaced or greatly reduced the biomass of Agrostis by year 5. Agropyron monocultures had significantly lower concentrations of NO3- and NO3- + NH4+, but not NH4+, than Agrostis monocultures. In contrast, no competitive displacement occurred in competition between Poa and Agropyron, and initial differences persisted over 5 yr. Monocultures of these two species did not differ in NO3- concentration, but did differ for NH4+ and NO3- + NH4+. Thus, species differences in ability to deplete soil NO3- successfully predicted the outcome of competition for all four species pairs on the soil mixture gradient. If resource preemption or asymmetric competition had been the mechanism of competition, initial conditions would have affected the long-term outcome of competition. Rather, these results support the R* (i.e., resource reduction) model for competition for soil N. In the added-N fertilizer plots, Schizachyrium had decreased biomass in competition with both Poa and Agropyron. However, neither Agropyron nor Poa appeared to have an advantage when they competed with each other in the added-N plots. For these three species pairs, the 5-yr results of competition in the added-N plots, which had greatly reduced light availability because of increased production and litter accumulation, depended on initial conditions. In the fourth pair, Agrostis was displaced by Agropyron in all competition treatments in the added-N plots. Thus, we cannot reject the hypothesis that resource preemption (i.e., asymmetric competition) is important in light competition.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA",,,"Wedin, David A/K-4093-2012",,,,,55,306,321,4,137,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Crabs, lobsters and predatory fish (Tautoga onitis Linnaeus) were placed in large circular tanks, each containing three habitats: cobble, featureless sand, and sand with shelter boxes. Two treatments of shelter availability were used: one shelter for every two decapods (limited) or two shelters per decapod (excess). Three size-classes of crabs (encompassing 65-158 mm carapace width) were tested with lobsters 49-59 mm carapace length. When excess shelter was available, crabs and lobsters occupied shelters significantly more frequently than the other habitats. When shelter availability was limited, crabs were displaced to other areas. The alternative habitat selected by crabs and the way in which they used it depended on crab size. Most small and medium crabs chose cobble, while large crabs were found equally in cobble and sand. Small crabs burrowed more deeply than large crabs, and burrowed more deeply in sand than in cobble. Interspecific aggressive interactions increased in intensity with crab size. T. onitis readily kill and consume Jonah crabs in tanks with no substratum or shelter. Based on the literature and my qualitative observations, I predicted that smaller crabs would be more vulnerable to predation than large crabs. However in my habitat choice experiments, crab mortality due to predation was low and was not related to crab size or habitat type.

We investigated the effects of two factors on the within-host dynamics of malaria in mice: initial infectious dose and co-infection with a helminth that limits the availability of red blood cells (RBCs). Using a statistical, time-series approach to model the within-host 'epidemiology' of malaria, we found that increasing initial dose reduced the time to peak cell-to-cell parasite propagation, but also reduced its magnitude, while helminth co-infection delayed peak cell-to-cell propagation, except at the highest malaria doses. Using a mechanistic model of within-host infection dynamics, we identified dose-dependence in parameters describing host responses to malaria infection and uncovered a plausible explanation of the observed differences in single vs co-infections. Specifically, in co-infections, our model predicted a higher background death rate of RBCs. However, at the highest dose, when intraspecific competition between malaria parasites would be highest, these effects of co-infection were not observed. Such interactions between initial dose and co-infection, although difficult to predict a priori, are key to understanding variation in the severity of disease experienced by hosts and could inform studies of malaria transmission dynamics in nature, where co-infection and low doses are the norm.","[Wait, L.

Volatile aldehydes in sonicated filtrates of the three diatoms were analyzed by GC/MS. Furthermore, effects of 2E, 4E-decadienal (2,4-D) on the growth and the photosynthetic efficiency of the four microalgal species were studied. The growth of Sc. acuminata was significantly inhibited by the three diatoms in all cocultures, and the inhibitory effects were higher under nutrient-rich conditions. Both cell-free and sonicatedcell filtrates of the three diatoms showed significant inhibitions on the growth of Sc. acuminata, which highlighted that diatoms produce allelopathic compounds not only to the surrounding environments but also inside the cells. Fifteen aldehydes were detected in the sonicated-cell filtrates of the three diatoms, and 5, 5, and 12 types of aldehydes were detected in C. curvisetus, P. tricornutum, and Sk. dohrnii, respectively. Polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) composition differed among the three diatom species. Phenylglyoxal (C8H6O2) dominated in C. curvisetus, 2,4-D (C10H16O) predominated in P. tricornutum, and high proportions of 2-hexenal (C6H10O), 2E, 4E-heptadienal (C7H10O), and 2,4-D were detected in Sk. dohrnii. 2,4-D showed significantly inhibitory effects on the growth of algal cells including diatoms themselves in a dose-dependent manner, and photosynthetic efficiency was significantly decreased as well. Sc. acuminata was the most sensitive species. The 96 h EC50 values of 2,4-D on the growth of the four microalgae were 1.64 mu mol/L for Sc. acuminata, 3.09 mu mol/L for C. curvisetus, 4.93 mu mol/L for P. tricornutum, and 8.54 mu mol/L for Sk. dohrnii, respectively. The results suggest that PUAs produced by diatoms may help them to take the competitive advantages in phytoplankton community, and thus to sustain diatom-dominated community structure in nutrient rich coastal waters.","[Wang, Zhaohui; Wang, Chaofan; Li, Weiguo; Wang, Maoting; Xiao, Lijuan] Jinan Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China","Wang, ZH; Xiao, LJ (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.",twzh@jnu.edu.cn; tljxiao@jnu.edu.cn,,"Wang, chaofan/0000-0002-3072-4128","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [42,076,141]; Science & Technology Basic Resources Investigation Program of China [2018FY100200]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42,076,141); the Science & Technology Basic Resources Investigation Program of China (2018FY100200).",,55,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-445X,1879-1514,,AQUAT TOXICOL,Aquat.

Empirically-based predictive models of the spatial distribution of these species would aid surveillance and vector control efforts. To predict the occurrence and abundance of these species, we fit a mixed-effects zero-inflated negative binomial regression to a mosquito surveillance dataset with records from more than 200,000 trap days, representative of 53% of the land area and ranging from 2004 to 2018 in Florida. We found an asymmetrical competitive interaction between adult populations of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus for the sampled sites. Wind speed was negatively associated with the occurrence and abundance of both vectors. Our model predictions show high accuracy (72.9% to 94.5%) in validation tests leaving out a random 10% subset of sites and data since 2017, suggesting a potential for predicting the distribution of the two Aedes vectors. Author summary Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are two prime mosquito vectors that transmit emerging arboviral pathogens (e.g. dengue virus, Zika virus and chikungunya virus), which cause substantial disease burden in humans. This study attempts to improve previous studies to map the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus with greater validation and provide a finer resolution of current and future projections of mosquito populations. We found evidence of an asymmetrical competitive interaction between Aedes vectors where Aedes aegypti is suppressed by Aedes albopictus. In addition to the role of species interactions, abiotic factors, including meteorological factors and human population density, are important predictors of the distribution of these two Aedes mosquito species. Our models demonstrate the potential to predict the occurrence and abundance of the two Aedes vectors, which can enhance domestic mosquito control efforts.","[Yang, Bingyi; Borgert, Brooke A.; Cummings, Derek A.

Seven traits related to resource and habitat utilization were identified in Rossia: no trait was shared by all three species. High boreal R. megaptera and Arctic endemic R. moelleri shared three traits with each other, while both R. megaptera and R. moelleri shared only two unique traits each with widespread boreal-Arctic R. palpebrosa.

Here we synthesize recent information on Neotropical insectivorous birds, including their diversity, evolutionary ages and locations of origin, phylogenies, and both competitive and predator-prey species interactions. We propose a novel evolutionary hypothesis for the origin and coexistence of the phenotypic diversity of insectivore foraging morphologies in species-rich communities, based on their extraordinary food-resource specializations. Specifically, we develop the Biotic Challenge Hypothesis to explain the evolution of these specializations, and we provide preliminary evidence in support of this hypothesis based on a synopsis of both Neotropical insectivore specializations by family and arthropod antipredator adaptations by category. We argue that, from the perspective of tropical insectivorous birds, and particularly in the most species-rich, mainland Neotropical communities, the environment is an arthropod desert. Coexistence with all of the other insectivores requires feeding specialization to compete exploitatively and diffusely against evolutionarily diverse species and far less frequently against sister species. The arthropod desert arises primarily because of (1) the tactical diversity of arthropod predators as insectivore competitors and (2) the evolutionary arms races involving arthropod predators with their prey, which render many arthropods inaccessible to most insectivorous predators. Our idea provides an explicit mechanism for pervasive, diffuse tropical interspecific competition, for evolutionary specialization, and for positive feedback on speciation rates at low latitudes, thereby generating new predictions and insights into tropical life histories and the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient. Other recent ideas concerning the coexistence of Neotropical insectivores, including positive species interactions within mixed species flocks, are recognized and evaluated. We discuss ways to test predictions resulting from the new view of communities developed here, including a case study of diet specialization by Costa Rican tyrannid flycatchers. Our synthesis of the origin and nature of Neotropical insectivore communities injects new life into the zombie idea that evolution works differently in the species-rich tropics.","[Sherry, Thomas W.; Kent, Cody M.] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Sanchez, Natalie, V] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Sekercioglu, Cagan H.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Sekercioglu, Cagan H.] Koc Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Istanbul, Turkey","Sherry, TW (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",tsherry@tulane.edu,,"Kent, Cody M./0000-0002-6764-8050","Organization for Tropical Studies; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Tulane University; Charles Bullard Fellowship in Forest Research at the Harvard Forest, Petersham, Massachusetts","The Organization for Tropical Studies provided considerable financial and logistical support over several decades (to TWS), and TWS and CMK also thank the US National Science Foundation and Tulane University for extensive financial and logistical support.

Given inherent fecundity advantages, why don't small-seeded species dominate communities? In perennial grasslands, we evaluated whether small-seeded species are less tolerant of competition from the community dominant bunchgrass than large-seeded species, but also less vulnerable to seed predation by mice. We also explored whether trade-offs involving competitive tolerance include two other functional traits, height and leaf mass per area (LMA). We added seeds of 17 forb species to plots where bunchgrass competition and rodent seed predation were manipulated across sites varying in bunchgrass productivity and thus competitive intensity. Seeds were added at densities mimicking interspecific variation in fecundity among target species. Standardizing for differences in fecundity (i.e. seed input, which enabled us to evaluate inherent interspecific differences in susceptibility to biotic interactions), bunchgrass competition more greatly reduced recruitment and establishment of small- versus large-seeded species, whereas rodent seed predation more greatly reduced the recruitment of large- versus small-seeded species. Plant height and LMA were unrelated to the competition effect size. Small-seeded species abundance decreased across sites increasing in bunchgrass productivity, whereas this was not the case for large-seeded species. For adult plants but not seedlings, community-weighted functional trait means (CWM) for seed size, height and LMA increased in plots with versus without bunchgrass competition and the CWM for seed size and height also increased at sites with greater bunchgrass productivity (for adults only). In contrast, rodent seed predation had no significant effects on CWM seed size. At the end of the experiment, adult abundance positively correlated with plant fecundity in plots lacking bunchgrass, indicating the inherent advantages accrued to high fecundity small-seeded species. However, with bunchgrass competition, abundances were equalized across species due to reduced competitive tolerance of high fecundity small-seeded species. Synthesis. Our results suggest that coexistence among subordinate forb species varying in seed size and fecundity is in-part due to a trade-off involving competitive tolerance and fecundity, mediated by seed size and associated functional traits.","[Maron, John L.; Hajek, Karyn L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hahn, Philip G.] Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT USA","Maron, JL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,"Hahn, Philip/0000-0001-9717-9489",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518],"U.S. National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1553518",,77,1,1,9,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We investigate potential benefits and costs of a common and varied morphological trait, cuticular spines, for foraging behavior, interspecific competition, and predator-prey interactions in naturally co-occurring spiny ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Polyrhachis) in an experimental setting. We expect that a defensive trait like spines might be associated with more conspicuous foraging, a greater number of workers sent out to forage, and potentially increased competitive ability. Alternatively, consistent with the ecological trade-off hypothesis, we expect that investment in spines for antipredator defense might be negatively correlated with these other ecological traits. We find little evidence for any costs to ecological traits, instead finding that species with longer spines either outperform or do not differ from species with shorter spines for all tested metrics, including resource discovery rate and foraging effort as well as competitive ability and antipredator defense. Spines appear to confer broad antipredator benefits and serve as a form of defense with undetectable costs to key ecological abilities like resource foraging and competitive ability, providing an explanation for both the ecological success of the study genus and the large number of evolutionary origins of this trait across all ants. This study also provides a rare quantitative empirical test of ecological effects related to a morphological trait in ants.","[Blanchard, Benjamin D.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Blanchard, Benjamin D.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Dept Sci & Educ, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Nakamura, Akihiro; Cao, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun, Peoples R China; [Chen, Stephanie T.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Stat, Raleigh, NC USA; [Moreau, Corrie S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol & Ecol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Moreau, Corrie S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Blanchard, BD (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bblanchard@fieldmuseum.org,"Nakamura, Akihiro/O-8384-2018","Nakamura, Akihiro/0000-0001-7349-5102; Blanchard, Benjamin/0000-0002-7747-6934; Moreau, Corrie/0000-0003-1139-5792","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1614105, DEB-1701352, IOS-1916995]","We express our gratitude to XTBG for extensive logistical support, especially Hui Xian, Yi Wan, Hui Wang, and Xiao Yang.

Using summer bottom trawl survey data from 1982 to 2017, spatial analyses and geostatistical regressions were conducted for each species for three population categories (immature females, oldshell mature females, and oldshell large males) to explore intra and interspecies differences in habitat and spatial distributions as well as interspecific spatial co-occurrence patterns. Variability in depth distributions rather than poleward distributional shifts may be a Tanner crab response to ocean warming, the apparent converse of snow crab. Both temperature and depth have strong effects on the Tanner crab distributions and 2 degrees C is an approximate minimum temperature threshold for Tanner crab habitat. 2 degrees C is an important maximum temperature threshold for immature female snow crab but temperature effects are weaker for adult snow crab. Snow crab ontogenetic movement results in loose coupling between settlement and adult habitat and in significant spatial overlap between older snow crab and Tanner crab. The similarity in spatial distributions and habitat of older snow crab with juvenile Tanner crab habitat and the predatory nature of snow suggest a possible regulatory role of snow crab on the northern extent of spatial distributions of Tanner crab, along with other possible factors such as groundfish predation. Snow crab distributions will most probably continue to shift northwards with warming ocean temperatures but a poleward shift for Tanner crab appears more uncertain. The utilities of comparing spatial and non-spatial models and accounting for spatial confounding in spatial regression modeling are also addressed.","[Murphy, James T.] Cascadia Sci, 4403 Francis Ave 4, Seattle, WA 98103 USA","Murphy, JT (corresponding author), Cascadia Sci, 4403 Francis Ave 4, Seattle, WA 98103 USA.",murphyjames04@gmail.com,,,,,,88,8,8,2,53,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-7836,1872-6763,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,MAR,2020,223,,,,,,,,105417,10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105417,,,16,Fisheries,Fisheries,KG0HR,WOS:000509622800001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Distributional differences caused by such forces are particularly noticeable on tropical mountains, where high species turnover along elevational gradients occurs over relatively short distances and elevational distributions of particular species can shift among mountains. Such shifts are interpreted as evidence of the importance of spatial variation in interspecific competition and habitat or climatic gradients. To assess the relative importance of competition and compression of habitat and climatic zones in setting range limits, we examined differences in elevational ranges of forest bird species among four Bornean mountains with distinct features. Location Bornean mountains Kinabalu, Mulu, Pueh and Topap Oso. Taxon Rain forest bird communities along elevational gradients. Methods We surveyed the elevational ranges of rain forest birds on four mountains in Borneo to test which environmental variables-habitat zone compression or presence of likely competitors-best predicted differences in elevational ranges of species among mountains. For this purpose, we used two complementary tests: a comparison of elevational range limits between pairs of mountains, and linear mixed models with naive occupancy as the response variable. Results We found that lowland species occur higher in elevation on two small mountains compared to Mt. Mulu. This result is inconsistent with the expectation that distributions of habitats are elevationally compressed on small mountains, but is consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in competition (likely diffuse) on short mountains, which largely lack montane specialist species, allows lowland species to occur higher in elevation. The relative influence of competition changes with elevation, and the correlation between lower range limits of montane species and the distribution of their competitors was weaker than in lowland species. Main conclusions These findings provide support for the importance of biotic interactions in setting elevational range limits of tropical bird species, although abiotic gradients explain the majority of distribution patterns. Thus, models predicting range shifts under climate change scenarios must include not only climatic variables, as is currently most common, but also information on potentially resulting changes in species interactions, especially for lowland species.","[Burner, Ryan C.; Shakya, Subir B.; Sheldon, Frederick H.] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Burner, Ryan C.; Shakya, Subir B.; Sheldon, Frederick H.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Boyce, Andy J.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Bernasconi, David] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, AgCtr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Styring, Alison R.] Evergreen State Coll, Olympia, WA 98505 USA; [Boer, Chandradewana] Mulawarman Univ, Forestry Fac, Wildlife Ecol & Biodivers Lab, East Kalimantan, Indonesia; [Rahman, Mustafa Abdul] Univ Coll Sabah Fdn, Fac Nat Sci & Sustainabil, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Martin, Thomas E.] Univ Montana, US Geol Survey, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Burner, Ryan C.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Management, N-1433 As, Norway; [Boyce, Andy J.] Natl Zool Pk, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA; [Bernasconi, David] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Burner, RC (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Management, N-1433 As, Norway.",ryan.c.burner@gmail.com,"Burner, Ryan C./AAF-6638-2020","Burner, Ryan C./0000-0002-7314-9506; Boyce, Andy/0000-0003-3508-6599; Shakya, Subir/0000-0002-3561-2336","Louisiana Board of Regents Fellowship; AOU Graduate Student Research; Wesley M.

In the Pampean region, extensive extensions of farming lands are affected by at least five cutworm species belonging to the genus Agrotis, Feltia and Peridroma. Due to the competitive environment that exposes these insects to stressors, certain individual features such as morphology could provide useful insights about functional diversity related to its dispersion and dominance. In this study, we analyze whether the shape of the mandibles is a contrasting trait between seven cutworm species, and we discuss whether this morphological trait can be an influential factor in the abundance and predominance of species within the complex between the southern and northern part of the Pampean region. Using geometric morphometrics tools, the results evidenced that cutworms complex differs in this functional trait. Closer phylogenetically species of Agrotis were widely different between them, while species phylogenetically distant belonging to Feltia and Peridroma were lightly similar. These results showed that functional traits have a fundamental importance to develop a predictive framework linking the herbivory damage with the herbivore functional diversity.

A competition experiment was set up to investigate the effect of warming on plant-plant interactions in semi-dry grasslands. The dominant grass Festuca rupicola and the four rare forbs Biscutella laevigata, Filipendula vulgaris, Scabiosa canescens, and Veronica spicata were placed in pots as monocultures (similar densities), as mixtures (varying densities), and as single individuals. In growth chambers, ambient temperatures (20 degrees C by day / 10 degrees C by night) and warmer temperatures predicted under climate change (+ 3.5 degrees C) were simulated. After nine months, growth parameters, aboveground biomass and leaf number, and a trait of phenotypic plasticity, leaf length, were measured and plant-plant interactions calculated. Warming significantly increased the growth of the four forbs, while the growth of the grass decreased or remained unchanged. The plant-plant interactions were negative and species-specific, and affected the three parameters differently, with the strongest effect on biomass and the lowest effect on leaf length. In monocultures, the strongest intraspecific competition on biomass was found in the grass. Warming only significantly reduced intraspecific competition on biomass in B. laevigata, but significantly decreased intraspecific competition measured on leaf length for all species. In mixtures with the grass, interspecific competition was the strongest to F. vulgaris and S. canescens, and did not change by warming. Interspecific competition to B. Iaevigata and V. spicata was reduced by warming. The associated grass was significantly reduced in interspecific competition on biomass in the presence of F. vulgaris and S. canescens by warming. But the grass was unaffected in mixtures with B. Iaevigata and V. spicata. A temperature increase can led to different patterns in interspecific and intraspecific competition, which suggests that some forbs, like B. Iaevigata and V. spicata, can benefit from warming but that other species are unaffected. The grass exhibited different responses depending on its heterospecific neighbors. Although the effects of warming and competition are species-specific, warming generally decreased competition. This effect may shape patterns of plant performance and biodiversity in the face of warming in semi-dry grasslands.","[Partzsch, Monika] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Geobot & Bot Garden, Inst Biol, Kirchtor 1, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany","Partzsch, M (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Geobot & Bot Garden, Inst Biol, Kirchtor 1, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany.",monika.partzsch@botanik.uni-halle.de,,,,,,67,0,1,10,43,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1433-8319,,,PERSPECT PLANT ECOL,Perspect.

This may be important in Madagascar, as lemurs face diminishing resources due to deforestation. We examined the range overlap and spatiotemporal relationships of three species of frugivorous lemur in the fragmented forests of Kianjavato, Madagascar. We conducted simultaneous location and behaviour sampling of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, red-fronted lemurs, Eulemur rufifrons, and red-bellied lemurs, Eulemur rubriventer, at two sites over a period of 11 months. We used Doncaster's index of dynamic interaction to investigate the relative amount of time species spent within 30 m and 100 m of each other, compared to the time expected based on random use of location points. All three species showed low core range overlap compared to home range overlap, and while core overlap was higher between interspecific groups than intraspecific groups, the difference was not substantial. Conversely, no spatiotemporal avoidance was observed, and red-fronted lemurs showed positive association (indicating possible attraction) with both red-bellied and ruffed lemurs. These positive spatiotemporal associations may be related to shared resource use in small forests, or predation avoidance strategies. At present, these species may rely more on spatial segregation and niche separation than spatiotemporal avoidance to minimize interspecific competition.

We tested the predictions that (i) submerged macrophyte occurrences correlate positively with the presence of detritus over sediment; (ii) the colonization of submerged macrophytes increases in the presence of detritus; (iii) the invasive macrophyte Hydrilla verticillata grows faster than the native macrophyte Egeria najas independent of the presence of detritus and (iv) E. najas is affected by competition with H. verticillata, and competition is mediated by the presence of detritus. We evaluated the co-occurrences of submerged macrophytes and detritus in situ and experimentally tested the effects of detritus on submerged macrophyte growth with and without competition. The presence of submerged macrophytes and detritus was negatively correlated in situ. Our experiments indicate that the detritus of emergent macrophytes, including invasive macrophytes, enhances nutrients after reflooding and increases the early growth of submerged macrophytes but does not influence the outcome of competition. Thus, the facilitation of invasive success at the beginning of detritus decomposition (indicated by our experiments) may be counteracted by negative effects after a long decomposition period (indicated by our field data).","[Dainez-Filho, Mario Sergio; Louback-Franco, Nayara; Souza, Douglas Costa; Cafofo, Emanuel Giovani; Thomaz, Sidinei Magela] Univ Estadual Maringa, Nucleo Pesquisas Limnol Ictiol & Aquicultura Nupe, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Michelan, Thaisa Sala] Univ Fed Para, Lab Ecol & Conservacao, Inst Ciencias Biol, Rua Augusto Correia 1, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil","Dainez, MS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maringa, Nucleo Pesquisas Limnol Ictiol & Aquicultura Nupe, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",mario.dainez@gmail.com,"Filho, Mario Dainez/P-1013-2019; Franco, Nayara/AAG-9476-2020; Michelan, Thaisa S/I-5255-2012","Filho, Mario Dainez/0000-0003-1706-2948; Michelan, Thaisa S/0000-0001-9416-0758; Louback-Franco, Nayara/0000-0002-1986-9465; Thomaz, Sidinei M./0000-0002-5236-1364","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Itaipu Binacional; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES/Proex), an organization of the Brazilian Government","M.S.

Consequently, nest-site characteristics together with space-use proxies may reveal the social organization of species, which is critical when direct observation of social interactions is hindered in nature. Importantly, nest-site choice is expected to be under strong selective pressures and the object of intra- and interspecific competition. Although the bulk of research on sociality focuses on its ecological drivers, our study introduces interspecific competition as a potential factor that could influence social evolution. We investigated the influence of habitat and interspecific competition on the social organization of two sister species of the African four striped mouse, Rhabdomys dilectus dilectus and Rhabdomys bechuanae, in a similar macroenvironment. These species diverged in allopatry and occupy distinct environmental niches. We radiotracked 140 adults to identify their nest-sites, determine nest characteristics and record groups that shared nest-sites. Group cohesion was estimated from nest-site fidelity, group association strength, and home range overlap within versus between group members. We compared the two species in sympatry versus parapatry to determine the impact of species interference on sociality. In parapatry, the two species selected distinct nest-site types, interpreted as different anti-predator strategies: R. bechuanae selected fewer, spaced, less concealed nest-sites whereas R. d. dilectus selected clumped and less visible nest-sites. Rhabdomys bechuanae also showed more cohesive and stable social groups than R. d. dilectus. In sympatry, compared to R. bechuanae, R. d. dilectus occupied similar nest-sites, however slightly more exposed and clumped, and displayed similar nest-site fidelity and group association strength. We conclude that although habitat selection may be an important driver of social divergence in Rhabdomys, species interference, by limiting R. d. dilectus movements and forcing nest-site sharing may induce new ecological pressures that could influence its social evolution.","[Dufour, Claire M.

While both competition and predation can control the size of animal populations, changes in the relative importance of these two density-dependent processes remain poorly documented during ecological succession. Here, we combined habitat selection and optimal foraging theory to identify the processes that can explain the increase in red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) during post-logging forest succession in boreal ecosystems. Specifically, we assessed the extent to which changes in intra- and interspecific competition and in predation risk can explain variation in abundance and distribution of voles during post-harvest forest succession. We estimated the abundances of the red-backed vole and of its main competitor, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), in adjacent pairs of logged (5-66years old) forest stands and uncut stands (>120years old). We found that voles increased their preference for uncut stands with increasing conspecific density. Foraging experiments revealed that in early-seral forest stands, voles increased their feeding effort in the presence of deer mice, particularly in safer food patches. This behaviour is expected from foraging theory when interspecific competitors increase predation risk. Apparent competition would thus limit the density of red-backed voles, and changes in the relative strength of this process during forest succession would control patterns of distribution and abundance of the species.","[Le Borgne, Helene; Dupuch, Angelique; Fortin, Daniel] Univ Laval, Univ Laval Sylviculture & Faune, Dept Biol, Chaire Rech Ind CRSNG, Pavillon Alexandre Vachon,1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Le Borgne, Helene; Dupuch, Angelique] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada","Le Borgne, H (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Univ Laval Sylviculture & Faune, Dept Biol, Chaire Rech Ind CRSNG, Pavillon Alexandre Vachon,1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.; Le Borgne, H (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",helene.le.borgne.1@gmail.com,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)-Laval University Industrial Research Chair in Silviculture and WildlifeNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank Orphe Bichet, Andreanne Beardsell, Maxime Cotnoir, Pascal Royer-Boutin, Marie-Helene Chabot, Gabriel Emond, Adam Moreira and Jean-Pierre Michaud for their help at different stages of the study, and W.F.J.

Several paleobiological studies have already been conducted on this genus, but its body mass has not yet been calculated accurately. The aim of the present work is to reconstruct Mikrotia magna's weight, a paramount aspect of organismal biology, especially on islands where mammals modify their size, becoming giants or dwarfs ('island rule'). Our analysis using postcranial elements (femora and humeri) predicts weights ranging from 1300 g to 1900 g (old and young populations, respectively). The presence of a large number of micromammals on the Gargano paleo-island suggests a high interspecific competition for species of the same ecological guild (Prolagus or cricetids were direct competitors of Mikrotia), which may lead to only moderate gigantism, or even body mass reductions in small mammals, following Palkovacs's model. This contrasts with the huge weight of M. magna inferred in this study. In this regard, stratigraphic and taxonomic studies suggest that M. magna was an immigrant from a neighboring island, indicating that this species originated and achieved its enormous size under other selective pressures. A native island with a lower number of competitors, and therefore with less resource limitation than Terre Rosse, might be the principal explanation for such a degree of gigantism.

Increases in stress hormones in vertebrates may be associated with these processes and contribute to the decline in survival or reproduction of the native species. Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) have gone extinct across much of the British Isles and parts of Northern Italy following the introduction of North American invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We extracted glucocorticoid metabolites from faecal samples to measure whether the presence of the invasive species causes an increase in physiological stress in individuals of the native species. We show that native red squirrels in seven sites where they co-occurred with invasive grey squirrels had glucocorticoid concentrations that were three times higher than those in five sites without the invasive species. Moreover, in a longitudinal study, stress hormones in native red squirrels increased after colonisation by grey squirrels. When we experimentally reduced the abundance of the invasive grey squirrels, the concentration of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in co-occurring red squirrels decreased significantly between pre- and postremoval periods. Hence, we found that the invasive species acts as a stressor which significantly increases the concentrations of glucocorticoids in the native species. Given that sustained elevations in glucocorticoids could reduce body growth and reproductive rate, our results are consistent with previous studies where the co-occurrence of the invasive grey squirrel was associated with smaller size and lower reproductive output in red squirrels.","[Santicchia, Francesca; Martinoli, Adriano; Wauters, Lucas Armand] Univ Insubria, Guido Tosi Res Grp, Environ Anal & Management Unit, Varese, Italy; [Dantzer, Ben; van Kesteren, Freya] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Dantzer, Ben] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Palme, Rupert] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Unit Physiol Pathophysiol & Expt Endocrinol, Dept Biomed Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Ferrari, Nicola] Univ Milan, Dept Vet Sci & Publ Hlth, Milan, Italy; [Wauters, Lucas Armand] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Antwerp, Belgium","Santicchia, F (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Via JH Dunant 3, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",f.santicchia@uninsubria.it,"Palme, Rupert/AAC-7981-2020; Ferrari, Nicola/E-6331-2013; Dantzer, Ben/E-9779-2011; Santicchia, Francesca/L-2591-2019; Palme, Rupert/A-3499-2008; Martinoli, Adriano/L-4924-2016","Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Ferrari, Nicola/0000-0001-8959-3495; Dantzer, Ben/0000-0002-3058-265X; Santicchia, Francesca/0000-0003-4814-9632; Palme, Rupert/0000-0001-9466-3662; Wauters, Lucas/0000-0002-4871-5035; van Kesteren, Freya/0000-0002-3034-9022; Martinoli, Adriano/0000-0003-0298-0869; Wauters, Lucas Armand/0000-0002-7012-9200",ESI (European Squirrel Initiative),ESI (European Squirrel Initiative),,69,20,20,2,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Theory predicts that interspecific competition and predation pressures are relaxed on small, remote islands, and that these conditions promote body size evolution. We studied body size variation across multiple insular populations of 16 reptile species co-occurring in the same archipelago and tested which island characteristics primarily drive body size evolution, the nature of the common patterns, and whether co-occurring species respond in a similar manner to insular conditions. Location: Aegean Sea islands. Time period: 1984-2016. Major taxa studied: Reptiles. Methods: We combined fieldwork, museum measurements and a comprehensive literature survey to collect data on nearly 10,000 individuals, representing eight lizard and eight snake species across 273 islands. We also quantified a large array of predictors to assess directly the effects of island area, isolation (both spatial and temporal), predation and interspecific competition on body size evolution. We used linear models and meta-analyses to determine which predictors are informative for all reptiles, for lizards and snakes separately, and for each species. Results: Body size varies with different predictors across the species we studied, and patterns differ within families and between lizards and snakes. Each predictor influenced body size in at least one species, but no general trend was recovered. As a group, lizards are hardly affected by any of the predictors we tested, whereas snake size generally increases with area and with competitor and predator richness, and decreases with isolation. Main conclusions: No factor emerges as a predominant driver of Aegean reptile sizes. This contradicts theories of general body size evolutionary trajectories on islands. We conclude that overarching generalizations oversimplify patterns and processes of reptile body size evolution on islands. Instead, species' autecology and island particularities interact to drive the course of size evolution.","[Itescu, Yuval; Schwarz, Rachel; Slavenko, Alex; Meiri, Shai] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Donihue, Colin M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Roussos, Stephanos A.] Univ North Texas, Dept Biol Sci, Denton, TX USA; [Roussos, Stephanos A.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Sagonas, Kostas] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Valakos, Efstratios D.; Pafilis, Panayiotis] Univ Athens, Dept Biol, Athens, Greece; [Foufopoulos, Johannes] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Itescu, Y (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",yuvitescu@gmail.com,"Slavenko, Alex/ABC-7200-2020; Schwarz, Rachel/AAB-6987-2020; Meiri, Shai/D-2403-2010","Slavenko, Alex/0000-0002-3265-7715; Sagonas, Kostas/0000-0002-5972-210X; Pafilis, Panayiotis/0000-0002-1832-4906; Meiri, Shai/0000-0003-3839-6330; Foufopoulos, Johannes/0000-0002-8341-8271; Donihue, Colin/0000-0003-1096-8536",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1005/12],"Israel Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1005/12",,74,17,17,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Predator effects on competitively superior species is one possible mechanism. In this study, we tested whether the presence of size-selective predators (fishes) acts as a mechanism for the coexistence of two species of case-bearing caddisfly larvae, Perissoneura paradoxa and Psilotreta kisoensis (Odontoceridae, Trichoptera). The larvae of these two species have similar ecological and life history traits except their body size, and they have been found to coexist only in habitats shared with predatory fishes. Experiments on intra and interspecific competition revealed that the larger Pe. paradoxa always outcompeted the smaller Ps. kisoensis in the absence of predatory fishes, suggesting that Pe. paradoxa performed intra-guild predation on Ps. kisoensis. We also conducted experiments to examine how strongly each of these species responded in terms of case repair with/without a predator chemical cue after their cases were partly dismantled. Perissoneura paradoxa exhibited a stronger case repair response in the presence of a predator chemical cue than that exhibited by Ps. kisoensis, suggesting that Pe. paradoxa is more vulnerable to fish predation, probably because their body size is in the preferred prey range of fishes. We suggest that the presence of predators works in the favor of smaller, subordinate species through size-selective predator effects, enabling these two competitive species to coexist in the same habitat.","[Okano, Jun-ichi; Tayasu, Ichiro; Nakano, Shin-ichi; Okuda, Noboru] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Tayasu, Ichiro; Okuda, Noboru] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, 457-4 Motoyama, Kamigamo, Kyoto 6038047, Japan","Okano, J (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",j.oj.o55222@gmail.com,"Nakano, Shin-ichi/M-5483-2016; Tayasu, Ichiro/A-9924-2009","Nakano, Shin-ichi/0000-0001-5235-8547; Tayasu, Ichiro/0000-0002-3006-7973; Okano, Jun-ichi/0000-0002-1295-4114","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [12J01273, 26840146]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26840146] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (No. 12J01273 & No. 26840146).

Several theories exist about the reasons why leopards could not subsist in Sumatra, while today, national parks still bear tigers (Panthera tigris) and Asiatic wild dogs (Cuon alpinus). One often debated theory is that the competition for prey was the reason for the extinction of leopards in Sumatra. The aim of our study is to model the impacts of competition for prey in the carnivore guild of the Padang Highlands in Sumatra to test if competition pressure was sufficient to force the leopard to extinction. In the first step, we reconstructed the carnivore guild of the Padang Highlands based on fossils collected by Dubois in the three cave sites of Sibrambang, Djamboe and Lida Ajer. In the second step, we developed and applied an agent-based model based on population density, prey spectrum and daily meat intake and simulated different scenarios of competition among the Sumatran predators. We simulated the reconstructed guild and further tested scenarios with the absence of guild members to see under which circumstances leopards could have survived in Sumatra. Simulation of the reconstructed carnivore guild revealed that, in fact, the leopard could have been driven to extinction by competition from other carnivores. Excluding one of the competing medium-sized cats or the Asiatic wild dog leads to the survival of the leopard in our simulations. Interestingly, our model demonstrates that humans and tigers were not the strongest competitors for leopards because their exclusion from the scenarios does not conclude with the survival of leopards in our simulations. According to our results, the presence of two medium-sized cats and the Asiatic wild dog, in combination with the small litter size of the leopard, were the main reasons why the leopard could not tolerate the competition for prey in the Padang Highlands in Sumatra and thus became extinct in Sumatra.","[Volmer, Rebekka; Ferreras, Maria Rebecca] Univ Philippines, Archaeol Study Program, Albert Hall Bldg,Lakandula St, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Hoelzchen, Ericson; Wurster, Alexia; Hertler, Christine] Res Inst Senckenberg, ROCEEH, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hertler, Christine] Heidelberg Acad Sci, Karlstr 4, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Volmer, R (corresponding author), Univ Philippines, Archaeol Study Program, Albert Hall Bldg,Lakandula St, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",rebekka.volmer@gmx.de,,"Hertler, Christine/0000-0002-8252-9674","Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, University of the Philippines [OVPAABPhD-2015-10]; Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Development [161605 PNSE]; Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities; Leibniz Association [SAW-2013-IZW-2]","This research was funded by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, University of the Philippines, in the frame of the project Subsistence Strategies and Prey Spectra of First Humans in the Philippines (grant OVPAABPhD-2015-10); Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research & Development, in the frame of the project Animal and Human patterns of Philippine Fauna during Pleistocene (161605 PNSE); and the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, in the frame of the project The role of culture in Early Expansions by Humans (ROCEEH).

Reactivity, traditionally defined as the maximum instantaneous growth rate of small perturbations to a stable steady state, is a simple yet powerful measure of the short-term instability of a system as a whole. In many ecological applications, however, it could be important to focus on the reactivity properties of just some specific, problem-dependent state variables, such as the abundance of a focal species engaged in interspecific competition, either predators or preys in a trophic community, or infectious individuals in disease transmission. 2. We propose a generalized definition of reactivity (g-reactivity) that allows to evaluate the differential contribution of the state space components to the transient behaviour of an ecological system following a perturbation. Our definition is based on the dynamic analysis of a system output, corresponding to an ecologically motivated linear transformation of the relevant state variables. We demonstrate that the g-reactivity properties of an equilibrium are determined by the dominant eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix that can be easily obtained from the Jacobian associated with the equilibrium and the system output transformation. 3. As a testbed for our methodological framework, we analyse the g-reactivity properties of simple spatially implicit metapopulation models of some prototypical ecological interactions, namely competition, predation and transmission of an infectious disease. We identify conditions for the temporary coexistence of an invader with a (possibly competitively superior) resident species, for transitory invasion of either prey or predator in otherwise predator- or prey-dominated ecosystems, and for transient epidemic outbreaks. 4. Through suitable examples, we show that characterizing the transient dynamics associated with an ecosystem's steady state can be, in some cases, as important as determining its asymptotic behaviour, from both theoretical and management perspective. Because g-reactivity analysis can be performed for systems of any complexity in a relatively straightforward way, we conclude that it may represent a useful addition to the toolbox of quantitative ecologists.","[Mari, Lorenzo; Casagrandi, Renato; Gatto, Marino] Polytech Univ Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Rinaldo, Andrea] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Lab Ecohydrol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rinaldo, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Mari, L (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",lorenzo.mari@polimi.it,"Mari, Lorenzo/M-8528-2015; Casagrandi, Renato/L-3985-2013; Gatto, Marino/D-9531-2012","Mari, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1326-9992; Casagrandi, Renato/0000-0001-5177-803X; RINALDO, ANDREA/0000-0002-7854-7992; Gatto, Marino/0000-0001-8063-9178","Politecnico di Milano; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [RINEC 22172]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [200021 1249301, 31003A 135622, PP00P3 150698]; H2020 project 'ECOPOTENTIAL: Improving future ecosystem benefits through Earth observations' [641762]","L.M., R.C. and M.G. acknowledge support from Politecnico di Milano.

How these predator species interact, and how their interactions influence their spatial distribution is still poorly understood. Here we studied interactions among top predators in a guild of diurnal forest raptors in order to test the hypothesis that predation among competing predators (intraguild predation) significantly affects the spatial distribution of predator species, causing subordinate species to nest farther away from the dominant ones. The study analyzed a guild in southwestern Europe comprising three raptor species. For 8 years we studied the spatial distribution of used nests, breeding phenology, intraguild predation, territory occupancy, and nest-builder species and subsequent nest-user species. The subordinate species (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus) nested farther away from the dominant species (goshawk A. gentilis), which preyed on sparrowhawks but not on buzzards Buteo buteo, and closer to buzzards, with which sparrowhawks do not share many common prey. This presumably reflects an effort to seek protection from goshawks. This potential positive effect of buzzards on sparrowhawks may be reciprocal, because buzzards benefit from old sparrowhawk nests, which buzzards used as a base for their nests, and from used sparrowhawk nests, from which buzzards stole prey. Buzzards occasionally occupied old goshawk nests. These results support our initial hypothesis that interspecific interactions within the raptor guild influence the spatial distribution of predator species in forest ecosystems, with intraguild predation as a key driver. We discuss several mechanisms that may promote the coexistence of subordinate and dominant predators and the spatial assembly of this raptor guild: spatial refuges, different breeding phenology, spatial avoidance, low territory occupancy between neighboring nesting territories, nest concealment and protection, and diet segregation.","[Rebollo, S.; Martinez-Hesterkamp, S.; Garcia-Salgado, G.; Perez-Camacho, L.; Fernandez-Pereira, J.

Results showed no significant differences between laboratory and field outcomes for D. insulare alone and when D. insulare and M. plutellae were combined. For M. plutellae alone, parasitism in the laboratory cages was significantly less than in the field cages.

The range expansion has brought together historically allopatric species, creating the potential for significant changes in the avian predator community with possible cascading effects on food-web dynamics. The adverse effects of the barred owl on the behavior and demography of the northern spotted owl are well-documented, but little is known about the immediate and long-term effects changes in the predator community may have on native species composition and ecosystem processes. Based on northern spotted owl and barred owl selection for diet and habitat resources, there is a potential for trophic cascades within the region's predator and prey communities, differing responses by their shared and unique prey species, and possible direct and indirect effects on ecosystem processes. We explored the possible ecological consequences of the barred owl range expansion to wildlife communities of the Pacific Northwest based on the theoretical underpinnings of predator-prey relationships, interspecific competition, intraguild predation, and potential cascading trophic interactions. Negative effects on fitness of northern spotted owls because of interspecific competition with barred owls are strong selection forces that may contribute to the regional extinction of the northern spotted owl. In addition, we posit that shared prey species and those uniquely consumed by barred owls, along with other competing native predators, may experience changes in behavior, abundance, and distribution as a result of increased rates of predation by rapidly expanding populations of barred owls.

Their ranges and dispersal rates vary across Europe, which may result from their interspecific interactions, accelerating or reducing migrations. We checked this hypothesis by testing interference competition among co-occurring invaders: Dikerogammarus villosus, D. haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides. We used 140-cm long tanks (gravel substratum), divided into seven compartments. We introduced 25 residents into the outermost compartment, separated with a barrier. After 1 h, we introduced 25 intruders. After the next 1 h, we removed the barrier and the gammarids dispersed in the tank. After 4 or 20 h, we counted the gammarids in the compartments. We tested all pairwise species combinations and single-species controls. Dikerogammarus villosus displaced other species (P. robustoides only after 4 h) and reduced its own motility after 20 h in their presence. Pontogammarus robustoides stimulated the short-time migrations of D. villosus intruders and of D. haemobaphes. As P. robustoides migrated spontaneously much more than Dikerogammarus spp., its impact decreased after longer time. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes stimulated the short-time movement of P. robustoides intruders but reduced the long-time relocation of this species. In general, gammarid dispersal increased in the presence of stronger competitors (D. villosus and P. robustoides, especially residents) and decreased in response to weaker competitors (D. haemobaphes). Thus, competitive interactions may affect dispersal of invasive gammarids and contribute to the fastest spread of the weakest competitor, D. haemobaphes observed in the field, whereas the strongest species, D. villosus was the latest newcomer in many novel areas.","[Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland; [Rachalewski, Michal; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina] Univ Lodz, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Hydrobiol, Lodz, Poland","Kobak, J (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland.",jkob73@umk.pl,"Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina/E-4234-2015","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Bacela-Spychalska, Karolina/0000-0003-4498-5107","National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland [2011/03/D/NZ8/03012, 2012/05/B/NZ8/00479]",The authors would like to thank Lukasz Jermacz and Kamil Hupalo for help in collecting animals used in the experiments.

To assess the cogency of this argument, we construct and analyze an interspecific cultural competition model based on the Lotka-Volterra model, which is widely used in ecology, but which incorporates the culture level of a species as a variable interacting with population size. We investigate the conditions under which a difference in culture level between cognitively equivalent species, or alternatively a difference in underlying learning ability, may produce competitive exclusion of a comparatively ( although not absolutely) large local Neanderthal population by an initially smaller modern human population. We find, in particular, that this competitive exclusion is more likely to occur when population growth occurs on a shorter timescale than cultural change, or when the competition coefficients of the Lotka-Volterra model depend on the difference in the culture levels of the interacting species.","[Gilpin, William] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Feldman, Marcus W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Aoki, Kenichi] Meiji Univ, Org Strateg Coordinat Res & Intellectual Properti, Tokyo 1648525, Japan","Feldman, MW (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mfeldman@stanford.edu,,,National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); John Templeton Foundation; Monbukagakusho Grant [22101004],"This research was supported in part by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (to W.G.), the John Templeton Foundation (M.W.F.), and Monbukagakusho Grant 22101004 (to K.A.).",,48,40,40,2,578,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Interactions between apex predators can have cascading effects through the entire natural community, which supports broadening the scope of conservation from single species to a much wider ecosystem perspective. However, competition between wild large carnivores can hardly be measured experimentally. In this study, we analyzed the expansion of the Scandinavian wolf (Canis lupus) population during its recovery from the early 1990s. We took into account wolf-, habitat-, human-and brown bear (Ursus arctos)-related factors, because wolf expansion occurred within an area partially sympatric with bears. Wolf pair establishment was positively related to previous wolf presence and was negatively related to road density, distance to other wolf territories, and bear density. These findings suggest that both human-related habitat modification and interspecific competition have been influential factors modulating the expansion of the wolf population. Interactions between large carnivores have the potential to affect overall biodiversity. Therefore, conservation-oriented management of such species should consider interspecific interactions, rather than focusing only on target populations of single species. Long-term monitoring data across large areas should also help quantify and predict the influence of biotic interactions on species assemblages and distributions elsewhere. This is important because interactive processes can be essential in the regulation, stability, and resilience of ecological communities.","[Ordiz, Andres; Mansson, Johan; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Milleret, Cyril; Wabakken, Petter] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, NO-2480 Evenstad, Koppang, Norway; [Kindberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway","Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",andres.ordiz@gmail.com,"Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020; Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019","Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457; Milleret, Cyril/0000-0002-8563-981X; Mansson, Johan/0000-0002-5189-2091",Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission; Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk; Hedmark University College; Office of Environmental Affairs in Hedmark County; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; Worldwide Fund for Nature (Sweden); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse,"A.

The processes regulating ungulate populations have been the focus of numerous studies. For the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer Sparrman) population inhabiting the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, rinderpest was the primary regulatory factor up to the mid-1960s. Following reduction of rinderpest and buffalo population increase, interspecific competition for food, notably with cattle and wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus Burchell), was thought to be the primary regulatory factor in the ecosystem. Aims. We analysed buffalo population trends and the relationship between buffalo population growth and rainfall and density dependence in the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem and discuss the findings in the context of the key ecosystem processes governing buffalo population dynamics in African savannas, namely, food limitation, competition, predation, disease and land use changes. Methods. We analysed buffalo population dynamics in the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem in relation to rainfall and density dependence feedback between 1984 and 2010. Key results. Buffalo population growth was both significantly density-dependent and positively correlated with the dry season rainfall after, but not before, a severe drought in 1993. Buffalo numbers crashed by 48.6% in 1984-85 and by 76.1% in 1993-94 during severe droughts when food availability was lowest and competition with the more numerous cattle and wildebeest was highest. Conclusions. Recovery of buffalo numbers to pre-drought levels took 8-9 years after the 1984-85 drought but was much slower, with buffaloes numbering merely 36% of their 1993 population (12 895 animals) 18 years after the 1993-94 drought despite intermittent periods of high rainfall, probably due to demographic and/or reproductive factors, heightened competition with livestock, land use changes in the adjoining pastoral ranches, lion predation and recurrent severe droughts. Implications. Our findings demonstrate how food limitation caused by droughts associated with the hemispheric El NiNo-Southern Oscillation can cause severe declines in and threaten the persistence of large ungulate populations.

Leopards generally feed on small to medium-sized ungulates and risk klepto-parasitism from intraguild competitors. One unique, adaptive response to intraguild competition is arboreal caching ('hoisting') by leopards. Hoisting behaviour is thought to vary in frequency among individuals, populations, and between sexes. In our study, leopards fed primarily (85% of observed kills) on impala (Aepyceros melampus), which is the most locally abundant potential prey species. Although we did not detect statistical differences in hoisting rates among individuals within each sex, our results confirmed moderate hoisting rates of 35% in an area with medium densities of lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). Sex differences in prey hoisting were related to size, and males as the larger sex, hoisted kills (47.7%, n = 44) more often than overlapping females (27%, n = 62). Female leopards hoisted 25-33% of detected kills irrespective of prey size, season, habitat type, presence of dependent cubs, or location in relation to high competitor density areas ('competitor hotspots'). Consistent with this, males hoisted kills more often where visibility and, therefore, probability of detection was highest. We conclude that hoisting is likely correlated with energetic costs, seasonally increased detection by competitors, and direct competitor interactions rather than the potential risk of conflicts within generalized areas of high competitor use ('hotspots').","[Stein, Andrew B.; Bourquin, Sven L.; McNutt, J.

Two time periods were modeled; one when spiny dogfish populations were depressed and one after recovery. According to our results, the ecological role of spiny dogfish has changed overtime. During the depressed time period, spiny dogfish were not a keystone species and had little impact, positive or negative, on other species/groups in this ecosystem. Spiny dogfish currently have one of the highest trophic levels in this ecosystem and are akeystone species, having a high prey overlap with commercially depleted Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Spiny dogfish appear to have responded well to changes in this ecosystem caused by fishing and perhaps environmental change or a combination of both, while other species in the region have not. This is important, as spiny dogfish could now be potentially out competing commercially valuable and highly depleted populations of groundfish for resources. Based on our results, we suggest fisheries managers should look toward ecosystem based management measures in the future in order to actively and properly manage the ecosystem as a whole.

But defence of space is costly, and unless the benefits of excluding heterospecifics exceed the costs, natural selection should favour divergence in competitor recognition until the species no longer interact aggressively. Ordinarily males of different species do not compete for mates, but when males cannot distinguish females of sympatric species, females may effectively become a shared resource. We model how reproductive interference caused by undiscriminating males can prevent interspecific divergence, or even cause convergence, in traits used to recognize competitors. We then test the model in a genus of visually orienting insects and show that, as predicted by the model, differences between species pairs in the level of reproductive interference, which is causally related to species differences in female coloration, are strongly predictive of the current level of interspecific aggression. Interspecific reproductive interference is very common and we discuss how it may account for the persistence of interspecific aggression in many taxonomic groups.","[Drury, Jonathan P.; Grether, Gregory F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Okamoto, Kenichi W.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Anderson, Christopher N.] Dominican Univ, Dept Biol Sci, River Forest, IL 60305 USA","Grether, GF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",ggrether@ucla.edu,"Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011; Okamoto, Kenichi/AAA-3763-2021","Okamoto, Kenichi/0000-0002-1889-4538",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1020586]; UCLA's Graduate Division and Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1020586] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,J.P.D. received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and fellowship support from UCLA's Graduate Division and Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology.

Yet the epidemiological and ecological processes determining the outcome of mixed infections are poorly understood. Here, we use two intracellular gut parasites (Microsporidia), one exotic and one co-evolved in the western honeybee (Apis mellifera), in an experiment in which either one or both parasites were administered either simultaneously or sequentially. We provide clear evidence of within-host competition; order of infection was an important determinant of the competitive outcome between parasites, with the first parasite significantly inhibiting the growth of the second, regardless of species. However, the strength of this 'priority effect' was highly asymmetric, with the exotic Nosema ceranae exhibiting stronger inhibition of Nosema apis than vice versa. Our results reveal an unusual asymmetry in parasite competition that is dependent on order of infection. When incorporated into a mathematical model of disease prevalence, we find asymmetric competitionto be an important predictor of the patterns of parasite prevalence found in nature. Our findings demonstrate the wider significance of complex multi-host-multi-parasite interactions as drivers of host-pathogen community structure.","[Natsopoulou, Myrsini E.; McMahon, Dino P.; Doublet, Vincent; Paxton, Robert J.] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [McMahon, Dino P.; Paxton, Robert J.] Queens Univ Belfast, MBC, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [McMahon, Dino P.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [McMahon, Dino P.] BAM Fed Inst Mat Res & Testing, Dept Mat & Environm, D-12205 Berlin, Germany; [Doublet, Vincent; Paxton, Robert J.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Bryden, John] Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Natsopoulou, ME (corresponding author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",myrsini.natsopoulou@zoologie.uni-halle.de,"Paxton, Robert/D-7082-2015; McMahon, Dino/S-2620-2019; Doublet, Vincent/D-8050-2015; McMahon, Dino P/F-7006-2012; Natsopoulou, Myrsini/D-4862-2015","Paxton, Robert/0000-0003-2517-1351; McMahon, Dino/0000-0003-1119-5299; Doublet, Vincent/0000-0002-6313-1222; McMahon, Dino P/0000-0003-1119-5299; Natsopoulou, Myrsini/0000-0001-7751-3793; Bryden, John/0000-0002-5301-5367","Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (Germany) [511-06.01-28-1-71.007-10]; EUEuropean Commission [244956, BB/1000100/1, BB/I000151/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Department for Environment, Food and Rural AffairsDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA); Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Scottish Government; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/I000151/1, BB/I000100/1] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was supported by the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (Germany): Fit Bee project (grant no. 511-06.01-28-1-71.007-10), the EU: BeeDoc (grant no. 244956) and the Insect Pollinators Initiative (IPI grant no.

Gradients in competition and predation that regulate communities should guide biogenic habitat restoration, while restoration ecology provides opportunities to address fundamental questions regarding food web dynamics via large-scale field manipulations. 2. We restored oyster reefs across an aerial exposure gradient (shallow-subtidal-to-mid-intertidal) to explore how vertical gradients in natural settlement, growth and interspecific interactions affected the trajectory of man-made shellfish reefs. 3. We recorded nearly an order-of-magnitude higher oyster settlement on the deepest (subtidal) reefs, but within a year abundance patterns reversed, and oyster densities were ultimately highest on the shallowest (intertidal) reefs by over an order-of-magnitude. 4. This reversal was due to (i) significantly elevated survivorship on intertidal reefs and (ii) larger surviving oysters on intertidal reefs. These patterns are likely to have developed from greater levels of biofouling and predator abundance (e.g. stone crabs, gastropods) on deeper reefs where aerial exposure was <5% of the monthly tidal cycle. 5. Synthesis and applications. The success of restoration initiatives involving habitat-forming species can be enhanced by accounting for the biotic interactions that regulate population fitness. In littoral systems, vertical gradients in predation, competition and disturbance can be exploited to guide restoration of vegetated (e.g. mangrove, seagrass) or biogenic reef habitats. In particular, our results demonstrate that paradigms of vertical zonation learned from the rocky intertidal and saltmarshes also describe the fate of restored shellfish reefs. As with rocky shores, the lower vertical limit of adult oyster distribution in our study system was most likely driven by predatory and competitive (i.e. smothering) interactions, with a threshold depth at c. 5% daily aerial exposure. Below this depth, experimentally restored reefs failed completely. As with Spartina saltmarsh, accumulation of oyster biomass was greatest at an intermediate vertical position relative to mean sea level (i.e. mid-to-low intertidal). Our developing model proscribes a vertical 'hot spot' for restoration efforts to maximize biogenic reef fitness and production.","[Fodrie, F.

Resource availability affects recolonization success and resulting distribution patterns, but top-down processes may also play a role through density-mediated or trait-mediated indirect effects that may exclude a species from otherwise suitable habitat. We predicted that the spatial distribution of recolonizing sea otters, Enhydra lutris, on the Canadian Pacific coastline was explained by resources as well as interspecific interactions - spatial segregation from pinnipeds, the preferred prey of killer whales Orcinus orca. We surveyed the summer occurrence of sea otters and pinnipeds on Vancouver Island, Canada. We quantified coastline density and bathymetry at multiple spatial scales as indices of habitat complexity and foraging habitat availability. We used generalized linear model selection to test hypotheses about sea otters' spatial relationship to resources and heterospecifics. Pinniped presence negatively predicted sea otter presence, even after accounting for complexity and foraging habitat. Sea otters may segregate from pinnipeds due to trait-mediated indirect effects of predation, leading us to hypothesize apparent competition between sea otters and pinnipeds. Research is needed to test this hypothesis; if true, refuge from apparent competitors may be a key component of recolonization habitat for sea otters. Species distribution models should quantify resource landscapes but also species-scapes: the spatial plane of species interactions that combines with resources to drive species distributions. Conservation plans based on recolonization models that include only resources may overestimate available habitat, carrying capacity, and recolonization success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However the results of a recent national squirrel survey suggested that the normally invasive grey squirrel had gone into decline in the Irish midlands, which was anecdotally attributed to an increase in European pine marten, Martes martes, range and numbers. This study aimed to quantify changes in squirrel distribution in Ireland and to investigate the role, if any, of the pine marten in red and grey squirrel population dynamics. A distribution survey of the midlands was carried out which confirmed the grey squirrel population has crashed in approximately 9,000 km(2) of its former range and the red squirrel is common after an absence of up to 30 years. At landscape level, pine marten and red squirrel abundance were positively correlated, whereas a strong negative correlation between pine marten and grey squirrel presence at woodland level was found to exist. Squirrel demographics were determined by means of live trapping programs which confirmed that the red squirrel in the midlands is now in competitive release and the grey squirrel is present at unusually low density. This study provides the first evidence of a regional grey squirrel population crash and suggests that European pine marten abundance may be a critical factor in the American grey squirrel's success or failure as an invasive species.","[Sheehy, Emma; Lawton, Colin] Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst, Sch Nat Sci, Mammal Ecol Grp, Galway, Ireland","Sheehy, E (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst, Sch Nat Sci, Mammal Ecol Grp, Galway, Ireland.",emmasheehy@gmail.com,"Lawton, Colin/R-5900-2016","Lawton, Colin/0000-0002-7515-3699","Irish Research Council under the 'Embark' initiativeIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology","Author one was funded by the Irish Research Council under the 'Embark' initiative.

However, few studies have rigorously tested predictions of IFD models in situations involving multiple species and trophic levels. We fully parameterized and tested predictions of a general interference IFD model for both predators and prey in a tritrophic system: seven-spotted lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Hemiptera: Aphididae), and tic bean plants (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae). We used habitat selection treatments having both predators and prey in the presence and absence of one another. We also performed experiments to quantify the strength of interspecific competition, the functional response of predators and several measures of fitness for the prey. Our results show that whether prey were present or not, predators followed IFD predictions and aggregated most strongly in the patch with the highest-quality resource. Prey in the presence of predators followed the predicted IFD, which was similar to a uniform distribution. However, prey in the absence of predators moved infrequently and were far from ideal free, suggesting that predators instigated habitat selection behaviour. Our results underscore the importance of considering trophic interactions and multiple measures of patch quality in studies of habitat selection. The observed departures from theoretical predictions also usefully suggest promising extensions for future theory and experiments. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

To fill this gap, we sought to illuminate the extent of HP receipt and quantitatively evaluate the fitness consequences of HP receipt. We consider plant traits that could mediate the fitness costs of HP receipt in an effort to better understand the potential consequences of pollinator sharing in natural communities. Methods: We survey the literature for occurrence of HP receipt and assess variation in the fitness effects of a standard HP treatment. We develop a conceptual framework for understanding variation in fitness consequences of HP receipt. Key results: We find evidence for variation in HP receipt and its costs. Our framework predicts that certain traits (self-incompatibility, small, highly aperaturate or allelopathic pollen) will lead to detrimental HP donors, whereas others (self-compatibility, small or wet stigmas, short styles) will lead to vulnerable HP recipients. We also predict that detrimental effects of HP receipt will increase with decreasing phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient. Conclusions: Our framework can guide much needed additional work so that we can evaluate whether and which plant traits contribute to the variation in the effects of HP receipt. This will be a step toward predicting the consequences of HP receipt in natural communities, and ultimately transform our understanding of the role of postpollination interactions in floral trait evolution and pollinator sharing.","[Ashman, Tia-Lynn; Arceo-Gomez, Gerardo] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Ashman, TL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, 4249 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",tia1@pitt.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OIS 0852846, DEB 1020523]; FBBVA through the research project ENDLIMIT [BIOCON08/125]; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [211982]; SEP","The authors thank C.

To detect nonrandom patterns in the various assemblages under study, the original datasets were re-analysed using null models [two independent randomization algorithms (RA) for niche overlap] and Monte Carlo simulations. The total species richness in the countries considered in this review was 45 species for soricomorphs and 101 for rodents, and the studies reviewed here reported data for 53.3% of these soricomorph species and for 76.2% of these rodent species. Nonrandom habitat niche partitioning was rarely observed in both rodents and soricomorphs. Instead, aggregated use of habitat resources was frequently detected in both groups. Forest habitat was generally selected as aggregating resource type by small mammal assemblages. Thus, contrary to expectations, our review revealed little evidence for interspecific competition along the habitat niche axis in West African small mammals. However, it is possible that the aggregated use of the forest resource by small mammal species may be apparent, but that the various species partitioned space at a lower scale, for instance selecting different microhabitats. Interspecific competition appeared to be stronger in altered habitats, as predicted by previous studies on other forest organisms in West Africa.","[Amori, Giovanni] CNR, Inst Ecosyst Studies, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Luiselli, Luca] NAOC Environm Dept, Environm Studies Ctr Demetra Srl, I-00198 Rome, Italy","Amori, G (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Ecosyst Studies, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",giovanni.amori@uniroma1.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,E.N.I.

In simultaneous host exploitations, T. basalis females displayed an aggressive behavior against O. telenomicida females. The outcome of multiparasitism showed that interspecific larval competition was dominated by O. telenomicida regardless of the sequence in which oviposition occurred and which parasitoid was or was not simultaneously released in the patch. Finally, O. telenomicida can successfully develop in hosts already parasitized by T. basalis up to seven days earlier, acting as a facultative hyperparasitoid, so that intraguild predation (IGP) also occurred.

Harcourt (1999) hypothesized that in insular Southeast Asia, slow lorises and tarsiers showed a checkerboard distribution on 12 small (< 12,000 km(2)) islands, i.e., only one or the other occurs, and attributed this to extreme levels of competition between these 2 largely faunivorous primates. Further, he predicted slow lorises were able to persist on smaller islands than tarsiers. We re-evaluated these findings using an expanded dataset including 49 islands where tarsiers or slow lorises occur. Tarsiers and slow lorises live on islands of similar size (median size of ca. 300-900 km(2)), and both taxa inhabit an equal proportion of small, medium, and large islands. On small islands within their area of sympatry tarsiers occur on 1 island, slow lorises on 8, both genera on 3, and we can assume they have become extinct from 11 small islands since the Last Glacial Maximum. Sizes of islands where tarsiers or slow lorises have become extinct do not differ from islands where they are still extant. We show that slow lorises occur on more islands in insular Southeast Asia than perhaps previously assumed, but these islands are not smaller on average than islands where tarsiers occur. A checkerboard distribution between these taxa is not evident. More studies are needed at the macroecological level to assess the importance of biogeographic history in explaining their present-day distribution patterns.","[Nijman, V.; Nekaris, K. A.

However, experimentally demonstrating this role of resource partitioning in diverse communities has been difficult. We used an experimental response-surface design, varying intra- and interspecific consumer densities, to compare patterns of resource exploitation between simple and diverse communities of aphid predators. With increasing density, each single consumer species rapidly plateaued in its ability to extract more resources. This suggests intraspecific competition for a subset of the resource pool, a hallmark of resource partitioning. In contrast, more diverse-predator communities achieved greater overall resource depletion. By statistically fitting mechanistic models to the data, we demonstrated that resource partitioning rather than facilitation provides the better explanation for the observed differences in resource use between simple and diverse communities. This model-fitting approach also allowed us to quantify overlap in resource use by different consumer species.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Snyder, Gretchen B.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Snyder, WE (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",wesnyder@wsu.edu,"Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X; Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523; Snyder, William/0000-0002-2747-3102",,,,45,59,60,1,86,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

What is not known is whether such coexistence would occur if organisms dispersed non-randomly, using cues such as density and habitat quality to gauge fitness differences between habitats. Here, I conduct a comparative analysis of random and non-random dispersal strategies in a foodweb with a basal resource, top predator, and two intermediate consumers that exhibit a trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility. I find a striking contrast between density- and habitat-dependent dispersal in their effects on spatial coexistence. Dispersal in response to competitor and predator density facilitates coexistence while dispersal in response to habitat quality (resource productivity and predator pressure) inhibits it. Moreover, density-dependent dispersal changes species' distribution patterns from interspecific segregation to interspecific aggregation, while habitat-dependent dispersal preserves the interspecific segregation observed in the absence of dispersal. Under density-dependent dispersal, widespread spatial coexistence results in an overall decline in the abundance of the inferior competitor that is less susceptible to predation and an overall increase in the abundance of the superior competitor that is more susceptible to predation. Under habitat-dependent dispersal, restricted spatial coexistence results in species' abundances being essentially unchanged from those observed in the absence of dispersal. A key outcome is that when the superior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the inferior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is possible in both resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. However, when the inferior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the superior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is precluded in resource-poor habitats and greatly reduced in resource-rich habitats. This suggests that species-specific differences may play an important role in driving spatial coexistence patterns. The comparative framework yields predictions that can be tested with experiments that manipulate the relative mobilities of interacting species, or observational data on relative abundances and distribution patterns.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",amarasek@ucla.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717350],This research was supported by NSF grant DEB-0717350.

The species was first detected in the northeastern United States in 1998 and has rapidly spread throughout much of eastern North America. in addition to used tire casings, Oc. j. japonicus develops in a wide variety of artificial and natural container habitats, especially rock pools along stream beds. In an effort to evaluate the invasion success and impact of Oc. j. japonicus on populations of native container dwelling species, waste tire disposal sites and natural rock pool habitats were sampled for mosquito larvae throughout Connecticut in 2005, and data were compared with results from prior surveys made in 1987 and 1999. Oc. j. japonicus was the predominant species collected at the waste tire disposal sites regardless of surrounding landscape features, accounting for 55.9% of all larvae. A comparison with collections from prior surveys revealed a 90% reduction in the relative abundance of larval populations of Oc. triseriatus (Say) and significant reductions among larval populations of Oc. atropalpus (Coquillett) and Culex restuans Theobald. Oc. j. japonicus was also the most abundant mosquito collected in rock pool habitats, accounting for nearly 80% of all collected larvae, except where water temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. This was concomitant with significant declines in the relative abundance of Oc. atropalpus and Cx. restuans. We conclude that Oc. j. japonicus is a potentially effective competitor in rock pool and tire environments and may be responsible for reducing populations of several native species occupying these habitats through interspecific competition for limited resources. The exclusion of Oc. j. japonicus from warm water pools further suggests that a temperature barrier may exist for Oc. j. japonicus and that populations may not be able to colonize southern regions of the United States with relatively high summer temperatures.","[Andreadis, Theodore G.; Wolfe, Boger J.] Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, New Haven, CT 06504 USA","Andreadis, TG (corresponding author), Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, 123 Huntington St,POB 1106, New Haven, CT 06504 USA.",theodore.andreadis@ct.gov,,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [U50/CCU6806-01-1, 58-6615-1-218]; USDA-administered Hatch [CONH00768]","We wish to acknowledge John Shepard and Michael Thomas; The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, for assistance in establishing collections sites and in collecting, processing and identifying mosquitoes; and Christopher Samorajczyk, CT Department of Environmental Protection for assistance in field collections.

However, details of the fundamental causes of survival and mortality of both species remain largely unquantified, but may be crucial for understanding interspecific relationships and developing effective conservation actions. We studied a radiomarked population of sympatric corsac and red foxes in central Mongolia to quantify survival and cause-specific mortality rates from April 2005 to April 2007. Survival probability was 0.34 for corsacs (n = 18) and 0.46 for red foxes (n = 17) and did not vary by year within or between each species. Among both foxes, mortality occurred mainly from hunting by humans, but also from predation by larger canids and unknown causes. Our results suggest that illegal human hunting represents the principal source of mortality for both species and that a recently initiated ranger patrol program in the study area did not affect fox survival. As such, more stringent protective measures will likely be necessary to halt declines of both foxes. Our results also suggest that interference competition occurs between species as red foxes killed but did not consume corsacs. Our results will be useful for developing science-based management strategies to protect foxes in Mongolia, and in understanding the competitive relationships between them.","[Murdoch, James D.; Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio] Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney OX13 5QL, England; [Munkhzul, Tserendorj] Mongolian Acad Sci, Inst Biol, Mammal Lab, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; [Buyandelger, Suuri] Natl Univ Mongolia, Dept Biol, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia","Murdoch, JD (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Tubney OX13 5QL, England.",jd_murdoch@yahoo.com,,,Denver Zoological Foundation; Rufford Foundation; Trust for Mutual Understanding,"We thank the Denver Zoological Foundation, Rufford Foundation, and Trust for Mutual Understanding for supporting the project.

Theoretically, invasive species could have negligible or even positive effects if they sufficiently reduce the intensity of processes regulating native populations. Understanding such mechanisms is crucial to predicting ultimate ecological impacts. We used a mesocosm experiment to quantify the impact of eggs and larvae of the introduced cane toad (Bufo marinus) on fitness-related traits (number, size and time of emergence of metamorphs) of a native Australian frog species (Opisthodon ornatus). The results depended upon the timing of oviposition of the two taxa, and hence the life-history stages that came into contact. Growth and survival of O. ornatus tadpoles were enhanced when they preceded B. marinus tadpoles into ponds, and reduced when they followed B. marinus tadpoles into ponds, relative to when tadpoles of both species were added to ponds simultaneously. The dominant tadpole-tadpole interaction is competition, and the results are consistent with competitive priority effects. However, these priority effects were reduced or reversed when O. ornatus tadpoles encountered B. marinus eggs. Predation on toxic toad eggs reduced the survival of O. ornatus and B. marinus. The consequent reduction in tadpole densities allowed the remaining O. ornatus tadpoles to grow more rapidly and to metamorphose at larger body sizes (> 60% disparity in mean mass). Thus, exposure to B. marinus eggs reduced the number of O. ornatus metamorphs, but increased their body sizes. If the increased size at metamorphosis more than compensates for the reduced survival, the effective reproductive output of native anurans may be increased rather than decreased by the invasive toad. Minor interspecific differences in the seasonal timing of oviposition thus have the potential to massively alter the impact of invasive cane toads on native anurans.","[Crossland, Michael R.; Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Alford, Ross A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Shine, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rics@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Alford, Ross A/H-1577-2011; Crossland, Michael R/G-1091-2012","Alford, Ross A/0000-0002-3010-6768; Crossland, Michael R/0000-0001-9967-7158",CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and the Australian Research Council,"We thank Kay Bradfield for assistance with experimental work, the members of TeamBufo for encouragement and discussion, and the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology and the Australian Research Council for financial support.

We investigated the role of several factors in promoting coexistence among the aphids Aphis nerii, Aphis asclepiadis, and Myzocallis asclepiadis that all specialize on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). Competitive exclusion is thought to occur when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. Consequently, we investigated whether predators, mutualists, or resource quality affected the strength of intra- vs. interspecific competition among aphids in factorial manipulations of competition with exposure to predation, ants, and variable plant genotypes in three separate experiments. In the predation X competition experiment, predators reduced aphid per capita growth by 66%, but the strength of intra- and interspecific competition did not depend on predators. In the ants 3 competition experiment, ants reduced per capita growth of A. nerii and M. asclepiadis (neither of which were mutualists with ants) by approximately one-half. In so doing, ants ameliorated the negative effects of these competitors on ant-tended A. asclepiadis by two-thirds, representing a novel benefit of ant - aphid mutualism. Nevertheless, ants alone did not explain the persistence of competitively inferior A. asclepiadis as, even in the presence of ants, interspecific competition remained stronger than intraspecific competition. In the plant genotype 3 competition experiment, both A. asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis were competitively inferior to A. nerii, with the strength of interspeci. c competition exceeding that of intraspecific competition by 83% and 23%, respectively. Yet these effects differed among milkweed genotypes, and there were one or more plant genotypes for each aphid species where coexistence was predicted. A synthesis of our results shows that predators play little or no role in preferentially suppressing competitively dominant A. nerii. Nonetheless, A. asclepiadis benefits from ants, and A. asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis may escape competitive exclusion by A. nerii on select milkweed genotypes. Taken as a whole, the coexistence of three host-specific aphid species sharing the same resource was promoted by the dual action of ants as antagonists and mutualists and by genetic diversity in the plant population itself.","[Smith, R.

K. deyrolli nymphs and the predator Laccotrephes japonensis (Nepidae: Heteroptera) adults coexist in rice paddy fields. It was predicted that the difference in tadpole density may influence the K. deyrolli nymph survival rate. We first compared survival rates of the first instar nymphs of K. deyrolli in June (high tadpole density period) and July (low tadpole density period). Secondly, we investigated the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs at different tadpole densities and under the presence or absence of L. japonensis adults to examine whether higher tadpole density moderates predation pressure from L. japonensis adults to K. deyrolli nymphs, e.g., density-mediated indirect effects. As a result of the comparison, the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs in June was higher than that in July. For the field experiment, the slopes between the survival rate of K. deyrolli nymphs and tadpole density were positive under both predator presence and absence. However, the slope under the presence of a predator was steeper than that under absence of the predator (predator-by-tadpole density interaction was significant). These results suggest that a higher tadpole density in June provides an abundant food resource for K. deyrolli nymphs and also moderates predation pressure from L. japonensis.","Okayama Univ, Lab Insect Ecol, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Ohba, S (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Lab Insect Ecol, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",oobah8ag@yahoo.co.jp,"Ohba, Shin-ya/M-5406-2019","Ohba, Shin-ya/0000-0003-3854-0902",,,,33,6,8,0,10,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

Population densities of C. aleuticus were only consistent with resource densities across years during two of five study years, indicating a lack of resource matching at large temporal scales. On shorter temporal scales, fish growth rates that were two to three times higher in the estuary compared with the stream were inconsistent with the predictions of resource matching theory. A manipulation of C. aleuticus density showed that the estuary could support at least twice the number of individuals that occurred there; thus, the profitable estuary is underutilized. Interspecific competition with Cottus asper was partially responsible for this underutilization as indicated by a substantial reduction in growth and condition among C. aleuticus individuals in experimental manipulations that compared intra- and inter-specific effects. Observed spatial overlap between these two cottids combined with the results of the competition experiment suggests that C. aleuticus is more strongly limited in its ability to use estuarine habitats opportunistically by interspecific competition than by intraspecific competition.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Polivka, KM (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Wenatchee Forestry Sci Lab, 1133 N Western Ave, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA.",kpolivka@fs.fed.us,,,,,,83,9,10,0,8,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

In particular, we study interaction and distribution of two species in a two-patch environment assuming that individuals behave adaptively (i.e., they maximize Darwinian fitness). Either the two species are competing for resources or they are in a predatorprey relationship. Using some recent advances in evolutionary game theory, we extend the classical ideal free distribution (IFD) concept for single species to two interacting species. We study population dynamical consequences of two-species IFD by comparing two systems: one where individuals cannot migrate between habitats and one where migration is possible. For single species, predator-prey interactions, and competing species, we show that these two types of behavior lead to the same population equilibria and corresponding species spatial distributions, provided interspecific competition is patch independent. However, if differences between patches are such that competition is patch dependent, then our predictions strongly depend on whether animals can migrate or not. In particular, we show that when species are settled at their equilibrium population densities in both habitats in the environment where migration between habitats is blocked, then the corresponding species spatial distribution need not be an IFD. Thus, when species are given the opportunity to migrate, they will redistribute to reach an IFD (e.g., under which the two species can completely segregate), and this redistribution will also influence species population equilibrial densities. Alternatively, we also show that when two species are distributed according to the IFD, the corresponding population equilibrium can be unstable.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Biol, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; Fac Biol Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; Hungarian Acad Sci, Ecol & Theoret Biol Res Grp, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Plant Taxon & Ecol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary","Krivan, V (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Biol, Branisovska 31, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",rcressma@wlu.ca; krivan@entu.cas.cz; garayj@ludens.elte.hu,"Krivan, Vlastimil/F-1709-2010; Krivan, Vlastimil/J-7015-2019","Krivan, Vlastimil/0000-0003-0971-1231; ",,,,42,90,93,3,37,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Nine vegetation management treatments, imposed from planting, included a weedy control treatment, a manually weeded treatment, a chemically weeded treatment (glyphosate), a 1.2m row and a 1.2m inter-row weeding, a 0.5m radius ring weeding, a complete weeding except for a 0.5m radius ring around the tree (no ring weeding), and the use of two legume cover-crops, Mucuna puriens (L.) DC. (velvet bean) and Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. (cowpea). The different treatments applied during establishment resulted in the differential growth of the trees as determined by measurements of tree height and crown diameter. This occurred from as early as 60 days after planting. The degree of competition could be directly related to the type of vegetation (cover-crops or naturally occurring weeds) and its proximity to the tree. The predominant vegetation on this site, yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.), was able to colonise the site rapidly, causing severe and early competition. There were strong indications that this initial competition was mainly for moisture and possibly also for nutrients, rather than competition for light. Initially, trees in those treatments that had vegetation within their immediate vicinity were most affected (weedy control, inter-row weeding and no ring weeding). With time, tree performance was more closely related to an increase in the percentage of the area kept free of vegetation. At 180 days after planting the ranking of the top five treatments in relation to the area kept free of vegetation was: manually weeded treatment (100% of area free of vegetation) > chemically weeded treatment (100% of area free of vegetation) > no ring weeding (90% of area free of vegetation) > row weeding (40% of area free of vegetation) > ring weeding (10% of area free of vegetation). The planting of cover-crops, although beneficial in terms of the suppression of competing vegetation, also caused significant tree suppression. This occurred despite the fact that their initial biomass accumulation was slower than that of the natural weed population. Of the two cover-crops, the use of a velvet bean cover-crop was not considered suitable due to its vigorous vining habit which adversely affected growth form.","Inst Commercial Forestry Res, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa","Little, KM (corresponding author), Inst Commercial Forestry Res, POB 100281, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",keith@icfr.unp.ac.za,,,,,,32,11,11,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0254-6299,1727-9321,,S AFR J BOT,S.

Most of these models are based on epidemiological factors (population size, number of host species), biological factors (patch quality, interspecific competition) and the spatial and temporal structure of the host metapopulation. We studied the parasites of 137 rock pool populations of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna to determine the factors that account for total parasite richness, richness of endoparasites and epibionts, and the presence/absence patterns of individual parasite species. The rock pools of 86 of these populations have been studied since 1982, and it is known how long these pools have been continuously inhabited by Daphnia. By far the best predictor of total parasite richness was host population age, which explained similar to 50% of the variance. While endoparasite richness increased linearly with age over 16 yr, epibiont richness saturated similar to3 yr after pool colonization, which may be explained by the higher dispersal rate of epibionts. After we corrected for host population age, endoparasite richness was positively correlated with the water volume of the rock pool (an estimator for host population size), and epibiont richness was correlated with water conductivity. Pools with lower water conductivity (less influenced by the brackish water of the Baltic Sea) had more epibiont species. The local network size of the host metapopulation (local pool density and number of pools per island) hardly influenced parasite richness. There was also no strong indication of spatial effects (isolation by distance and island effects) on the parasite community. The factors that were correlated with species richness were, however, not the same as those related to the presence of single parasite species. At least for certain epibionts, it appears that presence/absence patterns were influenced by interspecific competition. In conclusion, our analysis shows that predictions derived from epidemiological and temporal models, but not from spatial models, can explain parasite richness patterns, despite apparent conflicting patterns found for individual, parasite species. Our analysis extends the scope of these models, which were previously supported mainly with helminths, to bacteria and protozoa.","Univ Basel, Inst Zool, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; Tvarminne Zool Stn, SF-10900 Hango, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Div Populat Biol, SF-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Ebert, D (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol Ecol & Evolut, Chemin Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",,"Ebert, Dieter/P-6134-2019; Ebert, Dieter/B-5502-2009","Ebert, Dieter/0000-0003-2653-3772; Ebert, Dieter/0000-0003-2653-3772",,,,65,92,93,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2001,82,12,,,,,3417,3434,,,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,503GY,WOS:000172791800012,,,,,2021-09-21,

We used seminatural stream channels, landscaped to provide a choice of water depths, and hence velocities, to test whether Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and brown trout, Salmo trutta, show similar habitat preferences during winter. We also tested whether there was any spatial or temporal displacement of Atlantic salmon when in sympatry with brown trout. Nighttime observations revealed that Atlantic salmon did have a preference for slow-flowing water. However, when in direct competition with trout, salmon either remained predominantly nocturnal but occupied shallower water, or became significantly less nocturnal, spending more time active during the day than when in allopatry. These results, which were especially marked in relatively larger fish, indicate that competition between the two species for food and resources is not restricted to the summer months and may affect both the short- and long-term growth and survival of overwintering wild Atlantic salmon.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Fish Biol Grp, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Freshwater Fisheries Lab, Pitlochry PH16 5LB, Perth, Scotland; Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Fish Biol Grp, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Harwood, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Fish Biol Grp, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,"Griffiths, Sian/A-5240-2010; Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009","Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349; Armstrong, John/0000-0003-2015-0500; Griffiths, Sian/0000-0001-6348-7352",,,,36,37,39,1,16,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

The extent of habitat lost, over 90% in some regions, has led to the local extinction of some bird species, simply through random sampling effects. Habitat specialists and those that move sequentially among several habitats, are especially at risk, as some habitats have been lost disproportionally. Fragmentation introduces additional problems by subdividing populations into small, isolated sub-populations. Whereas some of the remaining species of birds appear able to move through highly fragmented landscapes, it is possible that they suffer high mortality while doing so. Some species that have been lost regionally may have had difficulty dispersing, but there have been few detailed studies of the demography of Australian birds in fragmented landscapes. Such studies are necessary before we can assess the value of corridors, or other means, to assist dispersal of birds. Fragmentation also leads to edge effects, which, when compounded by habitat degradation, may alter the intensity of a number of ecological processes. There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that loss of nest sites and increased predation on nests and free-living birds have contributed to the decline of woodland birds. Increased interspecific competition, for instance with noisy miners Manorina melanocephala, may also have a major impact on smaller insectivores and honeyeaters. Effects of parasites and disease have barely been studied in Australia, though brood parasitism could account for local losses. Dieback of eucalypts and loss of understorey are common in fragmented and degraded landscapes and are associated with a greatly reduced diversity of birds. The effect of fragmentation and degradation on food has received minimal attention. We propose further research that tests the importance of some of these ecological processes in causing the decline and loss of bird species in agricultural woodlands. Although management should proceed immediately, including a cessation of any further clearing of native vegetation, it should be conducted in conjunction with research. We suggest how the findings of research can inform managers, which will make management more effective in achieving conservation of regional avifaunas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This waterfowl guild contains three 'core' species with typical bill morphologies and four 'peripheral' species which vary from the typical morphology in bill length and width or interlamellar spacing. Nearest neighbors in morphological space tend to have high ecological (dietary) overlap; i.e., similarity in morphology corresponds to similarity in ecology. Moreover, by employing Monte Carlo techniques, correlations between morphology and ecology are shown to be weaker during winter than summer, implying that species 'overcompensate' during winter and reduce dietary overlap even more than would be expected by similarities in bill morphology alone. Additionally, I examine morphological variation among populations of North American mallards(A. platyrhynchos)to test Roughgarden's (1974) predictions regarding relationships between intraspecific morphological variation and interspecific competition. Specifically, morphological variation should decrease with either an increase in number of competing species or a decrease in available resources. Although populations show expected trends in bill morphology with sex (males have larger bills than females) and latitude (Bergmann's rule), I am able to demonstrate only a weak trend in females in relationship between morphological variation and intensity of interspecific competition. Examinations of relationships between morphology and ecology should be considered during that time of year when ecological 'crunches' occur, as this should be when selection for different morphologies and feeding strategies occurs, although species may utilize other mechanisms (e.g., foraging behavior, habitat selection) which could mediate resource partitioning to a greater degree than would be expected solely by morphological differences.","[DuBowy, P.

The hypothesis of competition with Skylark (Alauda arvensis) was tested by analysis of territoriality and agonistic behaviour as well as foraging-sites behaviour. The possible indispensability of perches was investigated by an artificial perch experiment. Flight behaviour was tested in comparison with the Skylark. Woodlark and Skylark showed neither interspecific territoriality nor a high level of interspecific agonistic interactions. Even though some perches were used frequently, Woodlarks did not change territories in grassland areas because of the artificial perches. On closer examination of anti-predation-strategies it became clear that forest edge is not a factor of woodlark-territories but the habitat of that species. As Skylarks try to escape by overflying or hiding in grass, Woodlarks mostly flew to the forest. Together with morphological and singing aspects both nest type and flight-behaviour show obvious adaptations to field-forest ecotones.","Max Planck Gesell, Forschungsstelle Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell, Germany","Schaefer, T (corresponding author), Max Planck Gesell, Forschungsstelle Ornithol, Vogelwarte Radolfzell,Schlossallee 2, D-78315 Radolfzell, Germany.",,,,,,,48,15,15,0,13,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Shared enemies can also mediate non-reciprocal (-,0) indirect effects, i.e. indirect amensalism. whenever one prey species is not affected by the presence of alternative prey. We review 34 studies on terrestrial and freshwater systems to evaluate the extent to which apparent competition has been perceived as a reciprocal (-. -) or non-reciprocal (-,0) interaction. We found only three studies showing reciprocal effects between apparent competitors. Indirect amensalism was documented in 10 studies and could be inferred For 16 other cases (76% in total). The remaining five studies provided insufficient data to determine the form of indirect interaction. The apparent prevalence of non-reciprocal enemy-mediated interactions resembles that observed for resource-based interspecific competition. Amensal indirect effects via shared predation may result from differences in population size, nutritional value, susceptibility to attack, or asynchronous dynamics of alternative prey, or the predator's Feeding preferences. Moreover, experimental protocols may confound the actual form of apparent competition through short-term observations, incomplete designs, or biased consideration of conspicuous interactions, leading to reciprocal effects being overlooked. We conclude that. at present. it is still difficult to determine the relative role of apparent competition vs indirect amensalism in natural food webs because most published studies have failed to document in full interactions via shared enemies.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Chaneton, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Ecol, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,"Bonsall, Michael/0000-0003-0250-0423",,,,78,186,190,0,69,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2000,88,2,,,,,380,394,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880217.x,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,287QV,WOS:000085518000017,,,,,2021-09-21,

In both vineyards native phytoseiids were present: Amblyseius andersoni in one vineyard, and Phytoseius finitimus in the other. The economically important predators Kampimodromus aberrans and Typhlodromus pyri were released in both vineyards in order to study their efficacy in controlling tetranychids and eriophyids and their persistence during periods of prey scarcity. In both vineyards, relative abundances of the mite species, especially phytoseiids, were found to differ on different varieties in the same vineyard. In the first experiment, A. andersoni reached higher densities and was more persistent on the variety with slightly pubescent leaf under-surface (Merlot). Typhlodromus pyri and K. aberrans releases were successful and the mites became more abundant on the variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Verduzzo). In the second experiment, P. finitimus was more abundant on a variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Prosecco) than with glabrous leaf under-surface (Riesling). The most interesting results of the present study concerned the interactions between native and released predators. In the first vineyard, different results were obtained when releasing T. pyri on the two varieties. On the variety with pubescent leaves, A. andersoni was rapidly displaced by T. pyri, whereas the former species persisted on the other variety throughout the three-year study, apparently becoming dominant during the last season. In contrast to T. pyri, interactions between K. aberrans and A. andersoni in this vineyard did not depend on variety. The results of the experiments carried out in the second vineyard stressed the importance of interspecific competition for phytoseiid releases. Typhlodromus pyri colonization failed on both varieties. Kampimodromus aberrans releases appeared to be more successful on Riesling than on Prosecco, where P. finitimus was more abundant.

Tests were run in the presence and absence of a potential competitor, Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii). From tracks in the sand, we determined that, when alone, deer mice decreased total activity as moonlight increased and were more active in areas with cover than in open areas. However, deer mice did not vary proportions of activity allocated to open areas (ca. 20%) and cover/edge areas (ca. 80%) with variations in moonlight. Deer mice consumed more seeds in areas with cover but also did not vary the proportions of seeds eaten in the open (ca. 43%) or cover (ca. 57%) with variations in moonlight. Using infrared video filming, we determined that deer mice increased use of cover to nearly 100% in the presence of Ord's kangaroo rats. Aggression (active chasing and locking fights) by kangaroo rats towards deer mice caused this shift. Our experiments substantiate field observations of variable microhabitat use by deer mice in areas with and without kangaroo rats and identify behavioral interactions involved.","Univ No Colorado, Dept Sci Biol, Greeley, CO 80631 USA","Clarke, JA (corresponding author), Univ No Colorado, Dept Sci Biol, Greeley, CO 80631 USA.",,,,,,,40,45,50,0,17,AMER SOC MAMMALOGISTS,PROVO,"BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV, DEPT OF ZOOLOGY, PROVO, UT 84602 USA",0022-2372,,,J MAMMAL,J.

Yearly population estimates of the green oak leaf roller moth, Tortrix viridana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and the winter moth, Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), were taken from the pedunculate oak, Quercus robur, from 1951 to 1966 in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, U.K. Larval mortality from parasitoids was recorded for both species over the same period. 2. Operophtera brumata population density fluctuated around a constant mean, whereas I viridana population density exhibited a linear decline over the sampling period. Population counts were subjected to time-series analysis after the linear decline was removed from the T. viridana data by detrending. Multiple regression models were built so that variation in the per capita rate of increase of each population could be partitioned among (a) current and previous population density, (b) current and previous population density of the second moth species, and (c) rates of larval parasitism. 3. Multiple regression analysis suggested that variation in the per capita rate of increase of O. brumata could be explained by negative feedback from O. brumata density at T-2 (32%), a negative relationship with I viridana density at T-l (18%), and a positive relationship with parasitism suffered by I viridana at T-l (24%). 4. The I viridana population time-series was dominated by a rapid feedback process such that per capita rate of increase at time T was negatively related to population density at time T-l, explaining 53% of variance in population growth rate. Per capita rate of increase was unrelated to larval parasitism or densities of O. brumata. 5. In light of previous life-table and experimental studies on O. brumata and I viridana, the current analyses suggest that pupal predation (data not presented) and interspecific competition are significant determinants of O. brumata population growth rates in Wytham Woods. In contrast, T. viridana population growth rates appear to be dominated by rapid negative feedback consistent with intraspecific competition.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Hunter, MD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",mhunter@sparc.ecology.uga.edu,,,,,,28,14,16,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

A reanalysis of this data set suggests that abiotic factors such as conductivity and pH are also important in structuring fish communities. It is suggested that abiotic factors affect perch abundance mainly by their effects on other species' performance, particularly roach. The analyses of the whole data set and a subset of this data set consisting of nine lakes having perch only, or perch and piscivores only, also provided evidence that piscivores affect perch biomass.

Considerable disagreement exists over the relative contribution of each process to patterns of abundance. Using multifactorial experiments, I assessed the effects of resident conspecifics, potential interspecific competitors, predators, and reef location on patterns of recruitment of two temperate reef fishes. Recruitment of bluebanded gobies (Lythrypnus dalli) and blackeye gobies (Coryphopterus nicholsii) consistently increased with distance from a nearby large reef. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was enhanced by the presence of older resident conspecifics. I found no strong evidence of any competitive effects between the two species. Predators had a variety of important effects on the density of recruits. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was halved by predators; this was the result of direct and indirect effects of predators: in addition to directly reducing recruit density, predators also reduced recruitment indirectly by reducing the density of older residents to which recruits responded. I developed two related methods for quantifying the contributions of the direct and indirect components of the predator effect. The effect of predation was spatially variable for both species: the net effect of this variability was the elimination of recruitment patterns related to reef location. Hence, the effects of spatially variable input of recruits was dependent upon the presence of predators, and thereby, predation altered the relative importance of the other factors that affected recruitment of the gobies. I argue that a much broader understanding of the ''relative importance'' of multiple causal processes will be gained by striving to understand how the contribution of each process is modified by other processes than by attempting to quantify the ''importance'' of each process.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA",,,,"Steele, Mark/0000-0002-0281-7917",,,,56,57,57,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1997,78,1,,,,,129,145,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0129:TRIOPA]2.0.CO;2,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD345,WOS:A1997WD34500010,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Despite quantitative differences, the same species succession was observed during the three years and at all the lake sampling stations. Thus the zooplankton community shifted from rotifers in early spring to small-bodied cladocerans (Bosmina spp.), and, finally, to larger cladocerans (Daphnia spp.) in early summer. Shifts in zooplankton composition have also frequently been observed in midsummer, when the cladoceran assemblage of Daphnia-Bosmina was generally replaced by a combination of Ceriodaphnia-Diaphanosoma.

The two predators were functionally equivalent, eliminating Bufo and Hyla, while leaving Pseudacris to numerically dominate ponds with salamanders. Effects of both predators also cascaded down to algal primary producers, which became more abundant where predators reduced the abundance of herbivorous tadpoles. Combined impacts of the two predator species on the survival of Pseudacris were less than that predicted by an additive model of the effects of each predator measured in the absence of the other, but greater than predicted by a multiplicative model of joint predator effects. Reduced growth of Ambystoma with Notophthalmus provides one possible mechanism for the observed shift to less than additive per capita predator effects.

In order to understand this pattern I performed experiments at two levels. First, at the community level, I evaluated the importance of competition, predation, and pond permanence for patterns of larval performance. Second, at the behavioral level, I asked whether a hypothesized trade-off between gain and risk underlies ecological interactions, and ultimately, patterns of performance and distribution of these species. I employed a field manipulation to assess the contributions of competition and predation within different ponds that varied in permanence. In order to examine the effect of interspecific competition, enclosures contained each tadpole species either alone or in the presence of an equal density of the other species; these enclosures were placed in two temporary ponds, two intermediate ponds, and two permanent ponds. Tadpole stocking densities reflected local natural densities. This competition treatment was crossed with a predator treatment manipulating the absence or presence of predators (with ''presence'' representing the naturally occurring density within each pond). Patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across the pond permanence gradient: chorus frogs performed best relative to spring peepers in temporary ponds while spring peepers performed best relative to chorus frogs in permanent ponds (performance was measured as survivorship and growth). The dominant sources of mortality were pond drying in temporary ponds and predation in more permanent ponds. In contrast to most previous experimental studies of larval anurans, competition had small effects on tadpole performance. Results from the held experiment suggest that pond drying and predation may be important determinants of performance, and that the two species are differentially susceptible to these mortality agents. In a set of laboratory experiments I evaluated the hypothesis that a trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk mediated through activity (proportion of time spent moving) might explain patterns of Pseudacris distribution. In both species, individuals facultatively reduced activity in the presence of a caged predator with a corresponding drop in growth rate. In general, larval chorus frogs also tend to be more active and faster growing and developing than spring peepers. These results provide support for the existence of the trade-off and suggest that interspecific differences in activity may contribute to patterns of larval performance and distribution among ponds. The general nature of this trade-off suggests that it may also be important in other systems.","UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",,,"Skelly, David/D-3878-2013",,,,,57,142,144,0,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1995,76,1,,,,,150,164,,10.2307/1940638,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QC872,WOS:A1995QC87200013,,,,,2021-09-21,

We analyzed the effects of competition on the biomass of organisms belonging to 93 species in a wide variety of habitats. Competition had a large effect overall, with a great deal of heterogeneity in that effect among organisms. There were large differences among trophic levels in competitive effects, but the relative magnitude of competition at different trophic levels was contrary to the predictions of ecological theory. Primary producers and carnivores displayed small to medium effects. In these two groups, interspecific effects did not differ from intraspecific effects, nor did effects differ in terrestrial versus aquatic habitats. The effects of competition on herbivores ranged from large effects on anurans and lotic arthropods, to medium effects on marine mollusks and echinoderms, to effects that were not statistically distinguishable from zero for terrestrial arthropods. Interspecific competitive effects among these herbivore groups were generally less than intraspecific effects. Among primary producers, the effects of competition were not different in high- and low-productivity habitats. Across all taxa, large organisms did not experience greater competitive effects than small organisms, and competitive effects did not depend on the size attained in the absence of competitors. The effects of competition were weakly density-dependent in cases in which it was possible to examine the effects of the density of neighbors. Experiments conducted on caged organisms resulted in greater competitive effects than those with free-roaming and unenclosed organisms. Experiments with small sample sizes, short durations, and poor experimental design were more variable than experiments that were larger, longer, and better planned.",,"GUREVITCH, J (corresponding author), SUNY STONY BROOK, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA.",,"Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008",,,,,101,639,653,6,361,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The impact of a suite of coccinellid and syrphid predators emerged as the predominant factor affecting the success of aphid colonies: colonies protected from natural enemies grew in size at a rate of ten percent per day, were only one tenth as likely to go extinct, and produced over ten times more dispersing alates. In contrast, I found only minor effects of removing flea beetles, the most abundant herbivore with which A. varians colonies cohabit fireweed stems, and of supplementing water availability to fireweed host plants, in spite of a significant effect of watering frequency on aphid growth in the greenhouse. There was no evidence of significant two- or three-way interactions among factors. Hence, despite the potential complexity of the food web in which it is embedded, the dynamics of A. varians appears to be driven predominantly by a single factor, i.e. interactions with natural enemies.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,SEATTLE,WA 98195",,,,,,,,48,23,24,0,15,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1992,90,3,,,,,359,365,,10.1007/BF00317692,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HW294,WOS:A1992HW29400007,28313522,,,,2021-09-21,

Because females were most predictably found in forest light gaps and oviposited randomly with respect to tree-hole volume, morphology, and tree condition, the spatial distribution of neither females nor oviposition sites sufficiently accounted for differences in male mating strategies. Tree holes over 1 L in volume were the best larval habitats because they supported multiple cohorts per season. The two largest species emerged from larger tree holes than did the two smaller guild members. A laboratory experiment demonstrated that in large holes, small individuals of Megaloprepus eventually killed larger individuals of the two smaller Mecistogaster species, whereas Mecistogaster survived to emergence in small holes if they were the first to hatch there. A field experiment demonstrated that Mecistogaster colonized tree holes earlier in the wet season than did the two larger guild members, thereby gaining the head start in growth critical to its survival. The inferior competitive ability of its larvae countered any advantage that Mecistogaster adult males might otherwise derive from defending tree holes and resulted in seasonal clumping of emerging adults. In contrast, by defending large tree holes, male Megaloprepus coerulatus increased their chances of producing multiple offspring and sons of high quality.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST, MIAMI, FL 34002 USA","FINCKE, OM (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.",,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,17,62,67,2,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

I then assessed the extent to which species-specific distributions were correlated with habitat availability and the potential for interspecific competition to modify patterns of abundance and resource use. The six common cottid species were Artedius fenestralis, A. harringtoni, Asemichthys taylori, Chitonotus pugetensis, Icelinus borealis, and Jordania zonope. A comparison of their observed distributions with the distributions of microhabitats along the transects revealed that all species demonstrated significant affinities for or avoidance of many of the predominant substrates: clean rock, silt rock, shell sand, gravel, mud, and algae. Using a stepwise regression technique, I found that the densities of individual cottid species were significantly correlated with the percentage cover of these substrate types along the transects and with transect depth. Several lines of evidence suggest that interspecific competition does not play a strong role in this assemblage. Species pairs that co-occurred on at least some transects did not show disjunct distributions. Microhabitat overlap of these species pairs was higher in sympatry (comparison of transects with both species present) than in allopatry (comparisons of transects with only one species present), counter to the expectation of niche divergence. Correlations of species densities after correcting for habitat heterogeneity with the Schoener-Crowell-Pimm technique revealed only one significant negative density correlation out of thirty potential correlations. Cottid diversity was not correlated with structural diversity along transects in spite of strong associations of each species with habitat structure. This suggests that the transect areas were undersaturated in the number of individuals and/or species of cottid fishes. The apparent lack of competition among subtidal cottids contrasts with studies on intertidal fish communities dominated by cottids for which there is observational evidence of interspecific competition.","UNIV WASHINGTON,FRIDAY HARBOR LABS,FRIDAY HARBOR,WA 98250","NORTON, SF (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,FISHERIES RES INST,620 UNIV RD,FRIDAY HARBOR,WA 98250, USA.",,,,,,,87,33,34,0,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1991,72,6,,,,,2181,2192,,10.2307/1941569,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV769,WOS:A1991GV76900025,,,,,2021-09-21,

We examined how these factors and their interactions affected mass at metamorphosis, length of larval period, growth rate, and survival. These experiments demonstrated the effect of body size on predator-prey interactions by manipulating time of introduction of size-structured prey in a system with a gape-limited predator. Microhabitat differences in primary productivity, sources of predation other than salamanders, and abiotic factors were important determinants of community structure. High levels of salamander predation negatively affected tadpole survival, but affected no other response variable. We detected no density-dependent effects in either taxon. Tadpoles in the early treatment had longer larval periods and lower survival rates than those in the late treatment. Interactions of factors, including time of introduction, were common. Biotic and abiotic factors differentially affecting growth of predator or prey appear to be responsible for these differences. Priority effects in arrival to breeding sites, or climatic events affecting the growth rate of predator, prey, or both, play a role in determining community structure. Interactions of factors complicate the predator-prey relationship. In our experiment, the effects of time of introduction are highly correlated with body size in the two temporal treatments. Our results indicate that more realistic models of predator-prey systems, or population dynamics, should incorporate size structure of predator and prey.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287; ARIZONA GAME & FISH DEPT,NONGAME BRANCH,2221 W GREENWAY RD,PHOENIX,AZ 85023",,,,,,,,45,22,24,0,15,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1991,72,6,,,,,2232,2239,,10.2307/1941573,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV769,WOS:A1991GV76900029,,,,,2021-09-21,

Here, we investigate the dynamics of a food web system with Allee effect and intraguild predation. In the present study, generalist and specialist natural enemies competing for a shared resource (prey) (intraguild predation) have been introduced. The Allee effect has also been incorporated in the shared prey growth rate. We investigate how parameters defining Allee effect and intraguild predation affect the long-term persistence, extinction and co-existence regions of such species. We outline the conditions under which different types of interior and non-interior equilibria exist and are locally stable. Bi-stable dynamics has also been investigated for the proposed model system for a suitable range of parametric values. A threshold condition on the strength of Allee effect has been obtained assuring the absence of IG predator population along with extinction region of shared prey. To understand the dynamics of the system, a comprehensive study of bifurcation analysis has also been provided taking Allee effect and fertility rate of intraguild predator as bifurcation parameters. These two parameters generate various interesting bifurcations like saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf-bifurcation. We have obtained different parametric regions of Allee parameter for the existence of different boundary and interior equilibria. All the analytical results related with local stability of equilibrium points and all possible successive bifurcations have been supported by different numerical examples, one and two parameter bifurcation diagrams, bi-stability diagram and stability regions of all possible equilibrium points. The impacts of Allee effect on co-existence, stability, extinction of species, their persistence, bistability and bifurcations have been explicitly discussed and the whole dynamics has also been successfully compared with the dynamics of food web without Allee effect. It is observed that the introduction of Allee effect and IG predator induce more rich dynamics and compel the system to be more sensitive to initial population densities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, ecological opportunity can be described with regard to both diversity and abundance of resources. The degree to which these two components contribute to niche variation remains unexplored. To address this, we used an extensive dataset on fish diet and benthic invertebrate diversity and density from 73 sampling events in three Norwegian rivers in order to explore realised trophic niches and the response of dietary niche variation along gradients of resource diversity (potential trophic niches), resource density (as a proxy of resource abundance) and fish density (as a proxy of inter- and intra-specific competition) in a freshwater top predator (the brown trout,Salmo truttaL.). Linear models indicated that individual and population niche variation increased with increasing ecological opportunity in terms of prey diversity. However, no simple cause-and-effect associations between niche indices and prey abundance were found. Our multiple regression analyses indicated that the abundance of certain resources (e.g. Chironomidae) can interact with prey diversity to determine individual and population realised trophic niches. Niche variation (within-individual component and inter-individual diet variation) decreased with increasing inter- and intra-specific competition. This study extends prevailing trophic ecology theory by identifying diversity, rather than density, of available prey resources as a primary driver of niche variation in fish of temperate riverine systems with no extensive resource limitation. The study also shows that ecological opportunity may mask the direction of the effect (compression or expansion) of competition on niche variation when food resources are diverse. Our study provides novel empirical insight to the driving forces behind niche variation and reveals that diversity, rather than density, of available prey resources may be a primary driver of niche variation in freshwater fish. Our study supports the view that a broader potential trophic niche promotes broader realised trophic niche variation by individuals, which leads to individual niche diversification by opening access to alternatives resources, resulting in a concomitant rise in the realised trophic niche width of the population.","[Sanchez-Hernandez, Javier] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, Madrid, Spain; [Finstad, Anders G.; Arnekleiv, Jo Vegar; Kjaerstad, Gaute] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU Univ Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Trondheim, Norway; [Finstad, Anders G.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Aquat Ecol Dept, Trondheim, Norway; [Amundsen, Per-Arne] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway","Sanchez-Hernandez, J (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, Madrid, Spain.",javier.sanchezh@urjc.es,"Sanchez-Hernandez, Javier/J-2544-2014","Sanchez-Hernandez, Javier/0000-0001-9684-4774; Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216",,,,67,4,4,7,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Several different empirical methods have been proposed for quantifying ND and RFD in order to make predictions about coexistence between pairs of species, yet it remains unclear which method(s) are appropriate for a given empirical study and whether or not those methods yield the same information. Here we compare six different empirical methods and provide a practical guide to help empiricists determine which method(s) are best for their study system. We show that there are important tradeoffs between mechanistic methods, which require detailed understanding of species' resource use and physiology but are more tractable experimentally, and phenomenological methods which do not require this detailed information but can be impractical for some study designs. Finally, we show that the methods do not always yield the same values and therefore we caution against future syntheses that compile these estimates from different empirical studies.","[Godwin, Casey M.; Chang, Feng-Hsun; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Godwin, Casey M.; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Godwin, CM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Godwin, CM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",cgodwin@umich.edu,"Chang, Feng-Hsun/AAY-6710-2021; Godwin, Casey/E-6892-2014","Chang, Feng-Hsun/0000-0002-8202-6364; Godwin, Casey/0000-0002-4454-7521",,,,78,3,4,5,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2020,129,8,,,,,1109,1127,,10.1111/oik.06957,,JUN 2020,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MS1LT,WOS:000539776900001,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

The invasive species establishes complex relationships with the native one, out-competing it through resource and disease-mediated competition. However, recent research shed light on the potential role of a predator, the pine marten, in reversing the outcome of the competition between squirrels. Here, we investigate this hypothesis developing a one predator-two prey ecoepidemic model, including disease (squirrel poxvirus) transmission. We assess the equilibria of the dynamical system and investigate their sensitivity to ecosystem parameters changes through numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals that the system is more likely to evolve toward points where the red squirrels thrive than toward a disease-and-red-squirrels-free point. Although the disease is likely to remain endemic in the system, the introduction of the pine marten destabilizes previous equilibria, favouring the native squirrel and facilitating wildlife managers in their efforts to protect it. Nevertheless, the complete eradication of grey squirrels could be achieved only for specified values of the predation rates and pine marten carrying capacity. The active management of grey squirrel populations remains therefore necessary to try to eradicate the invader from the system.","[Travaglia, Elena; Venturino, Ezio] Univ Torino, Dipartmento Matemat Giuseppe Peano, Via Carlo Alberto 10, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [La Morgia, Valentina] Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Via Ca Fornacetta 9, I-40064 Ozzano Dell Emilia, BO, Italy","Venturino, E (corresponding author), Univ Torino, Dipartmento Matemat Giuseppe Peano, Via Carlo Alberto 10, I-10123 Turin, Italy.",elena.travaglia@unito.it; valentina.lamorgia@isprambiente.it; ezio.venturino@unito.it,,"La Morgia, Valentina/0000-0001-9915-3194",LIFE+ Biodiversity Programme of the European Commission [LIFE13 BIO/IT/000204],"This research has been carried out within the framework of the LIFE U-SAVEREDS Project (LIFE13 BIO/IT/000204), funded by the LIFE+ Biodiversity Programme of the European Commission.",,38,1,1,3,16,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",1531-3492,1553-524X,,DISCRETE CONT DYN-B,Discrete Contin.

Results showed that the co-occurrence patterns of top predators and prey were driven by a combination of environmental and biotic factors, which highlighted the importance of considering both components to fully understand the community structure. In addition, results also revealed that many biotic interactions, such as schooling in prey (e.g. anchovy-sardine), local enhancement/facilitation in predators (e.g. Cory's shearwater-fin whale), and predation between predator-prey species (e.g. northern gannet-horse mackerel), were led by positive associations, although predator avoidance behaviour was also suggested between negatively associated species (e.g. striped dolphin-blue whiting). The identification of interspecific associations can therefore provide insights on the functioning of predators-prey network and help advance towards an ecosystem-based management.","[Astarloa, Amaia; Louzao, Maite; Boyra, Guillermo; Martinez, Udane; Rubio, Anna; Irigoien, Xabier] AZTI, Portualdea Z-G, Pasaia, Spain; [Hui, Francis K.

Prey arriving from predator-free patches might also have evolved weaker defenses against predators and thus enhance trophic subsidies by providing easily captured prey. Using local models assuming a linear or accelerating trade-off between defense and population growth rate, we demonstrate that immigration of undefended prey increased predator abundances and decreased defended prey through eco-evolutionary apparent competition. In individual-based models with spatial structure, explicit genetics, and gene flow along an environmental gradient, prey became maladapted to predators at the predator's range edge, and greater gene flow enhanced this maladaptation. The predator gained a subsidy from these easily captured prey, which enhanced its abundance, facilitated its persistence in marginal habitats, extended its range extent, and enhanced range shifts during environmental changes, such as climate change. Once the predator expanded, prey adapted to it and the advantage disappeared, resulting in an elastic predator range margin driven by eco-evolutionary dynamics. Overall, the results indicate a need to consider gene flow-induced maladaptation and species interactions as mutual forces that frequently determine ecological and evolutionary dynamics and patterns in nature.","[Urban, Mark C.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Biol Risk, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Urban, Mark C.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Scarpa, Alice; Travis, Justin M.

This endemic primate species from the northeast of Brazil includes vertebrates such as lizards and marsupials in its diet, but we can find no previously published record of an attack upon or consumption of snakes by this species of platyrhine monkey. During the attack, the group mobbed the snake, with individuals uttering agonistic vocalizations and displaying behaviors such as raising their tails, moving tree branches, piloerecting, and baring their teeth. An adult male monkey seized the snake, bit and twisted its body, thereby killing it; he then dropped the carcass onto tree branches, but did not consume it. This single event suggests that this Cebidae species may be able to distinguish dangerous from harmless snakes, and it also may be an example of a lethally violent reaction to a potential predator or competitor, exemplifying the plasticity and cognitive skills exhibited by genus Sapajus.","[Oliveira Da Silva, Gibran Anderson; Valenca-Montenegro, Monica Mafra] Ctr Nacl Pesquisa & Conservacao Primatas Brasilei, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [Oliveira Da Silva, Gibran Anderson; Valenca-Montenegro, Monica Mafra] Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Oliveira Da Silva, Gibran Anderson] Univ Fed Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [Falotico, Tiago] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Falotico, Tiago] Neotrop Primates Res Grp, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Nash, Stephen David] SUNY Stony Brook, New York, NY USA","Da Silva, GAO (corresponding author), Ctr Nacl Pesquisa & Conservacao Primatas Brasilei, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.; Da Silva, GAO (corresponding author), Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.; Da Silva, GAO (corresponding author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.",gibranderson@gmail.com; tfalotico@gmail.com; stephen.nash@stonybrook.edu; monica.montenegro@icmbio.gov.br,"Falotico, Tiago/I-1918-2012","Falotico, Tiago/0000-0002-0638-1989; Anderson Oliveira da Silva, Gibran/0000-0001-8451-2123",,,,38,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",0032-8332,1610-7365,,PRIMATES,Primates,SEP,2019,60,5,,,,,459,465,,10.1007/s10329-019-00738-9,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,IW9KQ,WOS:000485312700008,31392448,,,,2021-09-21,

According to the specialist predator hypothesis, reciprocal interactions between voles and small predators that specialize on voles, such as weasels, can cause multiannual cycles. A fundamental feature of classical weasel-vole models is a long time-lag in the numerical response of the predator to variations in prey abundance: weasel abundance increases with that of voles and peaks approximately 1 yr later. We investigated the numerical response of the common weasel (Mustela nivalis) to fluctuating abundances of common voles (Microtus arvalis) in recently colonized agrosteppes of Castilla-y-Leon, northwestern Spain, at the southern limit of the species' range. Populations of both weasels and voles exhibited multiannual cycles with a 3-yr period. Weasels responded quickly and numerically to changes in common-vole abundance, with a time lag between prey and weasel abundance that did not exceed 4 months and occurred during the breeding season, reflecting the quick conversion of prey into predator offspring and/or immigration to sites with high vole populations. We found no evidence of a sustained, high weasel abundance following vole abundance peaks. Weasel population growth rates showed spatial synchrony across study sites approximately 60 km apart. Weasel dynamics were more synchronized with that of common voles than with other prey species (mice or shrews). However, asynchrony within, as well as among sites, in the abundance of voles and alternative prey suggests that weasel mobility could allow them to avoid starvation during low-vole phases, precluding the emergence of prolonged time lag in the numerical response to voles. Our observations are inconsistent with the specialist predator hypothesis as currently formulated, and suggest that weasels might follow rather than cause the vole cycles in northwestern Spain. The reliance of a specialized predator on a functional group of prey such as small rodents does not necessarily lead to a long delay in the numerical response by the predator, depending on the spatial and interspecific synchrony in prey dynamics.","[Mougeot, Francois] Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Rondo Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [Lambin, Xavier] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth; Romairone, Juan; Luque-Larena, Juan-Jose] Univ Valladolid, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agr, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, E-34004 Palencia, Spain; [Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth; Romairone, Juan; Luque-Larena, Juan-Jose] Inst Univ Invest Gest Forestal Sostenible, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, E-34004 Palencia, Spain","Mougeot, F (corresponding author), Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Rondo Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.",francois.mougeot@uclm.es,"Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011; Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth/E-7922-2016; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/D-6454-2014; Mougeot, Francois/B-1894-2009","Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth/0000-0001-8435-6386; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/0000-0001-6425-637X; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275","project ECOCYCLES (Era-net European project) [EUI2008-03641, EUI2008-03658]; project ECOVOLE [CGL2012-35348]; project ECOTULA [CGL2015-66962-C2-1-R]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G002045/1]","This work was funded through the projects ECOCYCLES (BIODIVERSA 2008, Era-net European project, EUI2008-03641 and EUI2008-03658), ECOVOLE (CGL2012-35348), and ECOTULA (CGL2015-66962-C2-1-R; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain), and by NERC NE/G002045/1 to XL.

We investigated co-occurrence patterns of habitat generalist and specialist terrestrial rodents at two spatial scales in the Atlantic Forest, aiming at evaluating the following hypotheses: 1) within-patch spatial niche partitioning promotes coexistence of generalists and specialists, leading to checkerboard presence-absence patterns at small (within-patch) rather than large (among-patch) scales; and 2) the decrease in abundance of specialists due to habitat loss promotes a competitive release of generalists, leading to negative covariance in abundance between generalists and specialists among patches. Drawing on a large data set including 363 sites within three patches in continuous forest, and 45 patches within three landscapes, we used C-scores based on presence-absence and abundance data to evaluate spatial segregation. We found consistent segregation between specialists and generalists at the within-patch rather than among-patch scale, but no consistent negative covariance in abundance between generalists and specialists among patches (as covarying species pairs varied across landscapes). Our findings suggest that spatial patterns caused by competition are scale-dependent, and coexistence of generalists and specialists is promoted by within-patch spatial niche partitioning. However, the influence of competitive release on the proliferation of generalists may be outweighed by other factors in fragmented landscapes. A teoria ecologica preve que especies generalistas de habitat sAo excluidas por especies especialistas em habitats otimos para as especialistas, e dados empiricos comumente mostram uma mudanca de dominancia das comunidades - de especialistas para generalistas - apos disturbios.

It has long been recognized - at least since Darwin's On the Origin of Species - that a harsh climate strengthens competition and thus sets species range limits. Using thorough field manipulations along a large elevation gradient, we show the mechanisms by which temperature determines competition type, resulting in a transition from interference to exploitative competition from the lower to the upper elevation limits in burying beetles (Nicrophorus nepalensis). This transition is an example of Darwin's classic hypothesis that benign climates favor direct competition for highly accessible resources while harsh climates result in competition through resources of high rivalry. We propose that identifying the properties of these key resources will provide a more predictive framework to understand the interplay between biotic and abiotic factors in determining geographic range limits.","[Chan, Shih-Fan; Chang, An-Yu; Shen, Sheng-Feng] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Shih, Wei-Kai; Chen, I-Ching] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Chang, An-Yu] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei 10617, Taiwan","Shen, SF (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.; Chen, IC (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",shensf@sinica.edu.tw; chenic@mail.ncku.edu.tw,"CHEN, I-CHING/Y-1535-2019; Shih-Fan, Chan/AAU-3609-2020","CHEN, I-CHING/0000-0002-1909-7290; Shih-Fan, Chan/0000-0003-2955-9433; Shen, Sheng-Feng/0000-0002-0631-6343","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [103-2621-B-001 -003 -MY3, 101-2313-B-001 -008 -MY3, 104-2311-B-006-006-MY3]; Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan [AS-SS-106-05]","We thank Noah Last for editing the English in this manuscript.

The aphidophagous predators, Coccinella septempunctata L. and Hippodamia variegata (G.) comprise major part of coccinellid predator species in the agroecosystem of Turkey. We investigated the IG interactions between these aphidophagous predators under laboratory conditions. Our results revealed that predation of the eggs of H. variegata by the adult male, female and 4th instar larvae of C. septempunctata was maximum at 0 prey abundance, however, substantial number of eggs were also consumed at aphid densities of 30 and 80. Consumption of 1st and 2nd instar larvae was also higher in the absence of aphids, intermediate at 80 aphid density and greatly reduced or almost negligible at 350 prey abundance. The same sequence was also true for the predation of the different juvenile stages of C. septempunctata by H. variegata adult male, female and 4th instar larvae. The adult female and 4th instar larvae of both C. septempunctata and H. variegata proved to be more voracious towards different heterospecific juvenile stages compared to adult male. Results on the preference of C. septempunctata and H. variegata towards conspecific or heterospecific eggs revealed that both the aphidophagous coccinellids showed higher degree of preference for egg cannibalism (conspecific egg consumption) over IGP (heterospecific egg consumption).","[Khan, Muhammad Hamayoon; Yoldas, Zeynep] Ege Univ, Dept Plant Protect, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey","Khan, MH (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Dept Plant Protect, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey.",mhkhan170@gmail.com,,,Ege University Scientific Research ProjectEge University [2016-ZRF-008],The authors are highly thankful to Prof. Dr. Feit Turanli and Prof. Dr. Ismail Karaca for their valuable guidance and suggestions.

We hypothesized temporal segregation by ocelots as the main strategy of reducing direct contact with pumas and humans in Atlantic Forest protected areas. Through a standardized camera trap protocol, we measured the degree of activity overlap between ocelots and pumas and between ocelots and humans using circular statistics. Additionally, we investigated predictor variables that may influence the temporal activity of ocelots. Ocelots and pumas showed nocturnal and cathemeral activity, respectively, whereas humans were diurnal. Although the coefficient of overlap between the activity of ocelots and pumas was high (Delta(1) =0.74), the Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test showed significant dissimilarities between their daily distributions of records (W = 5.86; d.f. = 2; P = 0.05). The coefficient of overlap between the activity of ocelots and humans was low (Delta(4) = 0.32) as also revealed by the Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test (W=179.51; d.f. = 2; P<0.001). Ocelots enhanced their nocturnal activity in sites where occupancy probability of pumas was high and either in sites with more pasture or near human settlements. Our finding suggests that temporal segregation may be one mechanism adopted by ocelots to allow its coexistence with pumas and humans in Atlantic Forest remnants. However, it is unknown whether temporal segregation per se will be enough to guarantee long-term persistence of ocelots in the current degraded scenario of the Atlantic Forest.

In many cases, however, evidence linking introduced species to native declines is weak. Failure to make strong inferences regarding the role of introduced species can hamper attempts to predict population viability and delay effective management responses. For many species, mark-recapture analysis is the more rigorous form of demographic analysis. However, to our knowledge, there are no mark-recapture models that allow for joint modeling of interacting species. Here, we introduce a two-species mark-recapture population model in which the vital rates (and capture probabilities) of one species are allowed to vary in response to the abundance of the other species. We use a simulation study to explore bias and choose an approach to model selection. We then use the model to investigate species interactions between endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha) and introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Colorado River between 2009 and 2016. In particular, we test hypotheses about how two environmental factors (turbidity and temperature), intraspecific density dependence, and rainbow trout abundance are related to survival, growth, and capture of juvenile humpback chub. We also project the long-term effects of different rainbow trout abundances on adult humpback chub abundances. Our simulation study suggests this approach has minimal bias under potentially challenging circumstances (i.e., low capture probabilities) that characterized our application and that model selection using indicator variables could reliably identify the true generating model even when process error was high. When the model was applied to rainbow trout and humpback chub, we identified negative relationships between rainbow trout abundance and the survival, growth, and capture probability of juvenile humpback chub. Effects on interspecific interactions on survival and capture probability were strongly supported, whereas support for the growth effect was weaker. Environmental factors were also identified to be important and in many cases stronger than interspecific interactions, and there was still substantial unexplained variation in growth and survival rates. The general approach presented here for combining mark-recapture data for two species is applicable in many other systems and could be modified to model abundance of the invader via other modeling approaches.","[Yackulic, Charles B.; Yard, Michael D.; Dzul, Maria] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Grand Canyon Monitoring & Res Ctr, 2255 N Gemini Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Korman, Josh] Ecometr Res Inc, 3560 West 22nd Ave, Vancouver, BC V6S 1J3, Canada","Yackulic, CB (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Grand Canyon Monitoring & Res Ctr, 2255 N Gemini Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.",cyackulic@usgs.gov,,,,,,45,12,12,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2018,99,4,,,,,812,821,,10.1002/ecy.2166,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GB2JM,WOS:000428878200006,29465780,,,,2021-09-21,

Yet less is known about the role of environmental change in facilitating or mitigating exclusion in the context of invasive species. In these situations, decline in a native species can be due to the effects of habitat change, or due to direct effects from invasive species themselves. This is summarized by the driver-passenger concept of native species loss. We present a multi-year study of tree squirrels that tested the hypothesis that tree canopy fragmentation, often a result of human development, influenced the replacement of native western gray tree squirrels (Sciurus griseus) by non-native eastern gray tree squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We tested this hypothesis along a continuum of invasion across three study sites in central California. We found that within the developed areas of the University of California at Santa Cruz campus and city of Santa Cruz, S. carolinensis excluded S. griseus from viable habitat. The competitive advantage of S. carolinensis may be due to morphological and/or behavioral adaptation to terrestrial life in fragmented hardwood forests. We classify S. carolinensis as a driver of the decline of native S. griseus in areas with high tree canopy fragmentation. Future habitat fragmentation in western North America may result in similar invasion dynamics between these species. Our study warrants consideration of existing and predicted interactions between potentially invasive species that co-occur with native species where land use change is proposed.","[Jessen, Tyler; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Jessen, Tyler] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Wang, Yiwei] San Francisco Bay Bird Observ, 524 Valley Way, Milpitas, CA 95035 USA; [Jessen, Tyler] Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, Ecosyst & Publ Hlth Dept, 3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada","Jessen, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.; Jessen, T (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, Ecosyst & Publ Hlth Dept, 3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.",tjessen1213@gmail.com,,,James Stuart Chanley Memorial Foundation,"We thank the James Stuart Chanley Memorial Foundation for providing funds for this study.

In order to examine the relationships between the morphology of the prey-capture apparatus, its adhesive performance and the prey-capture success, we combined force measurements, morphological and behavioural investigations of representatives of 14 Central European species of this genus. The direct relationship between these traits was studied by using phylogenetic generalized least squares and a molecular phylogeny generated from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I partial sequences. Force measurements revealed strong interspecific differences in the adhesive forces generated during the predatory attack; these differences entail significant differences in the prey-capture success. The interspecific differences in adhesive performance were functionally correlated with the pad morphology and divergences in the compressive forces generated during the predatory strike. Allometric analyses revealed that the pad area scaled with positive allometry with respect to body size, whereas the adhesive forces scaled with negative allometry with respect to body size, that is, the pads' efficiency decreased with body size. Our experimental approach demonstrates a direct functional relationship between the morphology of the prey-capture device of Stenus beetles and its performance in a natural behavioural context.","[Koerner, Lars; Betz, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Dept Evolutionary Biol Invertebrates, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Morgenstelle 28, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Zsolt Garamszegi, Laszlo] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, C Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Heethoff, Michael] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany","Koerner, L (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Evolutionary Biol Invertebrates, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Morgenstelle 28, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",LarsKoerner3@hotmail.com,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015","Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183","German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [PAK 478: BE 2233/10-1]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) [CGL2015-70639-P]; National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) [K-115970]","We thank Karl-Heinz Hellmer and Monika Meinert for taking the scanning electron micrographs.

It has the potential to shape population dynamics and community structure. Although there is much empirical evidence for the occurrence of intraguild predation in natural ecosystems, the study of its effects is mainly limited to short-term microcosm experiments. There is, therefore, certain skepticism about its actual significance in nature. A relevant concern is that there is no consensus regarding criteria to evaluate the possible occurrence of intraguild predation in short-term experiments, and methodological differences may therefore underlie apparent inconsistencies among studies. Our purpose here was to evaluate existing criteria to offer guidance for the design of experiments to determine whether two species may potentially engage in intraguild predation. The criteria are based on the condition that intraguild predators need to experience immediate energetic gains when feeding on the intraguild prey. Thus, a relevant experimental design must quantify predation but also fitness benefits of feeding on the other species, i.e. increases in reproduction, somatic growth, or survival.","[Fonseca, Morgana Maria; Pallini, Angelo] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Entomol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Montserrat, Marta; Guzman, Celeste; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada] IHSM UMA CSIC, Inst Mediterranean & Subtrop Hort La Mayora, Malaga 29750, Spain; [Guzman, Celeste] EEZA CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",arne.janssen@uva.nl,"Pallini, Angelo/F-7791-2012; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada/AAF-4983-2020; Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Montserrat, Marta/A-7625-2012; Guzman, Celeste/L-4519-2014; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/Z-3908-2019","Pallini, Angelo/0000-0003-3752-3545; Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Montserrat, Marta/0000-0002-6859-4955; Guzman, Celeste/0000-0003-2053-4213; Fonseca, Morgana Maria/0000-0002-2135-8488; Torres-Campos, Inmaculada/0000-0002-8775-7537",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [151777/2013-6]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [CBB-3000309]; MINECO [CGL2015-66192-R],"We thank two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

The effect of interactions between competing animals on a population's survival has been studied for many decades. However, interactions also affect an animal's subsequent movement decisions. Despite this, the indirect effect of these decisions on animal survival is much less well-understood. Here, we incorporate movement responses to foreign animals into a model of two competing populations, where inter-specific competition is greater than intra-specific competition. When movement is diffusive, the travelling wave moves from the stronger population to the weaker. However, by incorporating behaviourally induced directed movement towards the stronger population, the weaker one can slow the travelling wave down, even reversing its direction. Hence movement responses can switch the predictions of traditional mechanistic models. Furthermore, when environmental heterogeneity is combined with aggressive movement strategies, it is possible for spatially segregated co-existence to emerge. In this situation, the spatial patterns of the competing populations have the unusual feature that they are slightly out of-phase with the environmental patterns. Finally, incorporating dynamic movement responses can also enable stable co-existence in a homogeneous environment, giving a new mechanism for spatially segregated co-existence.","[Potts, Jonathan R.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Hicks Bldg,Hounsfield Rd, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England; [Petrovskii, Sergei V.] Univ Leicester, Dept Math, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Potts, JR (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Hicks Bldg,Hounsfield Rd, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England.",j.potts@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,64,9,9,0,6,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0022-5193,1095-8541,,J THEOR BIOL,J.

This investigation attempted to explore the scale-dependent competition among Persian oaks and highlight the impacts of competitive interactions on their biophysical properties (i.e. tree height, diameter at root collar and crown attributes) via point pattern analysis. Structurally different summary statistics were implemented to analyse the spatial pattern of Persian oaks in a pure 9-ha study plot. Nearest neighbour distribution function D(r) indicated that these coppice trees had no nearest neighbours up to the spatial scale of 2 m, and they all had a nearest neighbour at distances shorter than 12 m. Furthermore, pair correlation function g(r) showed the significant dispersion of Persian oaks up to the scale of 5 m, which may be the outcome of intraspecific competition for resources such as soil nutrients and water. As explored by mark variograms gamma (m) (r), Persian oaks of the same size had significant spatial correlations that illustrated the competitive (not facilitative) interactions of these coppice trees in the study plot. Mark correlation function k (mm) (r) additionally revealed negative correlations of height and radial growth up to large spatial scales.

In such dense vegetation cover, competition mostly occurs over free space, which conditions niche availability. Clonal growth determines how plants exploit horizontal space, by (1) exploring and colonizing free patches (guerilla form) or (2) resisting competitors through space consolidation (phalanx form), with possible intermediate strategies. Few studies have explored the dynamics of co-existing plants belonging to different clonal strategies. Models predict that guerilla forms may be advantageous during the early stages of succession, whereas phalanx forms are expected to be better competitors over time. We investigated whether these predictions are true under experimental conditions and explored possible mechanisms that promote clonal plant co-existence.

MethodsWe set up a large-scale mesocosm, in which we manipulated different mixtures of three clonal growth forms (guerilla, intermediate and phalanx) over 5yr (2009-2014), which impeded all types of reproduction other than clonal spread of the initial planted individuals. We analysed the spatio-temporal dynamics of the communities using linear mixed models to compare the change in relative cover and spatial association (differentiating between associations with similar and different species) for each clonal form. ResultsGuerilla forms dominated the early community, but decreased in dominance at later stages, at which point intermediate forms benefitted. Furthermore, guerilla forms were more likely to co-occur with other guerrillas, with this pattern remaining consistent over time. In contrast, and contrary to our expectations, phalanx forms had the lowest cover throughout the experiment, and exhibited clear segregation from intermediate or other phalanx species. Intermediate growth forms between guerilla and phalanx were the most variable over time, displaying both consolidative and explorative patterns depending on the clonal forms of the other species which they coexisted with, suggesting plastic variation in their traits. ConclusionsOur results highlight the key role of clonal forms in driving competitive interactions and, hence, determining the spatio-temporal dynamics of grassland communities.","[Saiz, Hugo; Jung, Vincent; Mony, Cendrine] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR ECOBIO 6553, Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Bittebiere, Anne-Kristel] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR LEHNA 5023, 43 Blvd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Benot, Marie-Lise] Univ Bordeaux, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Benot, Marie-Lise] INRA, BIOGECO, UMR 1202, F-33610 Cestas, France","Saiz, H (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR ECOBIO 6553, Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France.",saizhugo@gmail.com; Anne-Kristel.Bittebiere@univ-lyon1.fr; marie-lise.benot@u-bordeaux.fr; vincent.jung@univ-rennes1.fr; cendrine.mony@univ-rennes1.fr,"Jung, Vincent/AAV-1382-2020; Saiz, Hugo/K-8724-2014","Saiz, Hugo/0000-0002-7568-2996",ANR MODECOLFrench National Research Agency (ANR); ANR ECSFrench National Research Agency (ANR),"This study was funded by the ANR MODECOL, ANR ECS for data collection and the Diversify Project for the postdoctoral position of H.

Previous research has suggested that a competitive lottery for space promotes coexistence between two ecologically similar species, Gobiodon histrio and Gobiodon erythrospilus. However, not all the assumptions of lottery competition have been tested, and patterns of habitat use by adults suggest niche partitioning. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the mechanism of competition changes with ontogeny, with a lottery for space operating at settlement and niche partitioning occurring in adults. Patterns of resource use in the field were compared for juveniles and adults of the two species. Pelagic larval duration (PLD) and size-at-settlement was also estimated to determine if size differences at settlement could affect the outcome of competitive interactions among juveniles. Habitat preference and size-based competitive ability were then tested for juveniles and adults in laboratory experiments. Finally, a transplant experiment was performed to test the fitness-associated consequences of niche partitioning among adults and its implications for coexistence of the two species. G. histrio had a similar PLD (20.7 +/- 2.0 days) to G. erythrospilus (18.5 +/- 1.9 days), and there was no difference in size-at-settlement between the species. Juveniles of the two species had similar patterns of habitat use and similar competitive abilities, supporting the lottery mechanism at settlement. However, adults differ in their habitat use, supporting the prediction that resource partitioning increases with ontogeny. In laboratory experiments, adults of each species preferred colonies of Acropora nasuta. However, G. histrio was a superior competitor and prevented G. erythrospilus from using A. nasuta in >70% of the trials. In the field transplant experiment, G. erythrospilus (inferior competitor) suffered less of a fitness loss when occupying the non-preferred coral (A. spathulata) compared with G. histrio, which could explain its ability to persist when displaced by the superior competitor. These results suggest that the competitive mechanism operating between the two Gobiodon species shifts from a lottery for space to niche partitioning through ontogeny, and that these two mechanisms of competitive coexistence are not mutually exclusive.","[Pereira, Pedro H.

Recent changes in both climate and vertebrate community assemblages have created a unique opportunity to examine the impacts of two dynamic forces on population regulation. We examined the effects of warming winter conditions and the reestablishment of a previously extirpated predator, the fisher (Martes pennanti), on regulatory mechanisms in a northern-adapted mammal, the porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), along their southern range boundary. Using a long-term (17-year) capture-recapture data set, we (1) quantified the impacts of climate change and increased fisher predation on the survival of adult porcupines at their regional southern terminus, (2) assessed recruitment (via both adult fecundity and juvenile survival) of porcupines, and (3) modeled the relative importance of predation and winter conditions on the demography and population growth rate (lambda). Severe winters and abundant predators interacted synergistically to reduce adult survivorship by as much as 44%, while expanding predator populations led to near reproductive failure among porcupines. Increasing predatory pressure, disruptions in this community module, and more frequent extreme winter weather events led to predicted extirpation within 50 years, whereas in the absence of predators, the population was viable. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding behind distributional shifts resulting from climate change and may be broadly relevant for predicting future distributional shifts in other northern-adapted mammalian species.","[Pokallus, John W.; Pauli, Jonathan N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Pokallus, JW (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jnpauli@wisc.edu,,,Plum Creek Foundation; University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; University of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate School Fall Competition,"We sincerely thank Richard P.

We studied the behavior of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and pine martens (Martes martes) scavenging at carcasses of moose (Alces alces) killed by wolves (Canis lupus) in Sweden. Red foxes were observed visiting carcasses more often and at a higher frequency than pine martens, which restricted carcass use to certain habitats. Both species followed a similar daily and seasonal activity pattern. The seasonal peak of scavenging, in April for pine martens and April May for red foxes, showed that remains of wolf-killed prey are likely an important food source for both of these species during reproduction. Pine martens displayed an overall higher level of vigilance and a lower level of feeding than red foxes. Vigilance by pine martens was affected by habitat, visibility, and vegetative cover at carcass sites. Pine martens did not display increased vigilance during time periods of high red fox activity and there was no effect of the time of day. Our study showed support for the importance of interspecific predation risk leading smaller predators to trade off foraging for increased vigilance, but habitat characteristics affected vigilance patterns more than the mere presence of a larger predator.","[Wikenros, Camilla; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Stahlberg, Sophie] Univ Sassari, Dept Nat & Environm Sci, I-07100 Sassari, Italy","Wikenros, C (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",camilla.wikenros@slu.se,"Stahlberg, Sophie/E-8884-2017; Stahlberg, Sophie/ABI-8247-2020","Stahlberg, Sophie/0000-0002-6376-3887; Stahlberg, Sophie/0000-0002-6376-3887","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)Swedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Association of Hunting and Wildlife Management; Swedish University for Agricultural Sciences (SLU); Olle Foundation; Carl Trygger Foundation; Axel and Margaret Ax:son Johnson Foundation; Helge Ax:son Johnsons Foundation; Swedish Carnivore Association; World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF-Sweden); Signhild Engkvist Foundation","We thank P.

Although competitive interactions are a strong selective force, an analysis of net selection on tolerance to competition is absent in the literature. Using 55 full/half-sibling families from 18 maternal lines in the crop weed Ipomoea purpurea, we measured fitness and putative tolerance traits when grown with and without competition in an agricultural field. We tested for the presence of genetic variation for tolerance to competition and determined if there were costs and benefits of this trait. We also assessed correlations between tolerance and potential tolerance traits. We uncovered a fitness benefit of tolerance in the presence of competition and a cost in its absence. We failed to detect evidence of additive genetic variation underlying tolerance, but did uncover the presence of a significant maternal-line effect for tolerance, which suggests its evolutionary trajectory is not easily predicted. The cost of tolerance is likely due to later initiation of flowering of tolerant individuals in the absence of competition, whereas relative growth rate was found to positively covary with tolerance in the presence of competition, and can thus be considered a tolerance trait.","[Chaney, Lindsay] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Biol Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Baucom, Regina S.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Chaney, L (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Biol Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",chaneyly@mail.uc.edu,,"Chaney, Lindsay/0000-0002-1132-5156; Baucom, Regina/0000-0001-7960-498X",,,,71,10,10,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUN,2014,68,6,,,,,1698,1709,,10.1111/evo.12383,,,12,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,AJ3IE,WOS:000337558900013,24611886,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2021-09-21,

The impact of IGP on introduced phytoseiid mites and native species in the context of biological control is a matter of considerable debate. Amblyseius eharai is the dominant native citrus species in central China, while Amblyseius cucumeris and Amblyseius barkeri are candidates for importation. All three species can feed on the spider mite Panonychus citri, which is the main pest in citrus. This study investigated, in the laboratory, possible IGP among these species in the absence and presence of P. citri, respectively. IGP in different densities of shared prey and intraguild (IG) prey was also studied. All three species consumed heterospecific larvae and eggs but not adults, and the IGP rate of larvae was significantly higher than that of eggs in the absence of shared prey. Additionally, the IGP rate of each group was reduced dramatically in the presence of both shared and IG prey when compared to the absence of shared prey. This occurs most likely because the three species prefer to feed on their natural prey P. citri, rather than on IG prey. Our results showed that A. eharai seems to be a more voracious IG predator than A. cucumeris. A. eharai was much more prone to IGP than A. barkeri.","[Zhang, Bei; Zheng, Weiwei; Zhao, Wenjuan; Zhang, Hongyu] Huazhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Hubei Key Lab Insect Resource Applicat & Sustaina, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bei; Zheng, Weiwei; Zhao, Wenjuan; Zhang, Hongyu] Huazhong Agr Univ, Inst Urban & Hort Pests, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xuenong] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Crops, Minist Agr, Inst Plant Protect, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xuenong; Liu, Jin] Specialty Crop Ctr Yiling Dist, Yichang, Peoples R China","Zhang, HY (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Hubei Key Lab Insect Resource Applicat & Sustaina, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",hongyu.zhang@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,,Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [200903032]; earmarked fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [CARS-27],This research project was supported by the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [grant number 200903032] and the earmarked fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [grant number CARS-27].,,31,5,8,0,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-3157,1360-0478,,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

We selected, a priori, three species pairs consisting of species that are morphologically and taxonomically similar and may therefore be likely to engage in interspecific, consumptive competition. We then examined a large-scale database of snake detection/nondetection data and used occupancy modelling to determine whether these species occur together more or less frequently than expected by chance while accounting for variation in detection probability among species and incorporating important habitat categories in the models. For some snakes, we obtained evidence that the probabilities that habitat patches are used are influenced by the presence of potentially competing congeneric species. Specifically, timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) were less likely than expected by chance to use areas that also contained eastern diamond-backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus adamanteus) when the proportion of evergreen forest was relatively high. Otherwise, they occurred together more often than expected by chance. Complex relationships were revealed between habitat use, detection probabilities and occupancy probabilities of North American racers (Coluber constrictor) and coachwhips (Coluber flagellum) that indicated the probability of competitive exclusion increased with increasing area of grassland habitat, although there was some model uncertainty. Cornsnakes (Pantherophis guttatus or Pantherophis slowinskii) and ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis, Pantherophis spiloides, or Pantherophis obsoletus) exhibited differences in habitat selection, but we obtained no evidence that patterns of use for this species pair were influenced by current interspecific interactions. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that competitive interactions influence snake assemblage composition; the strength of these effects was affected by landscape-scale habitat features. Furthermore, we suggest that current interspecific interactions may influence snake occupancy, challenging the paradigm that contemporary patterns of snake co-occurrence are largely a function of diet partitioning that arose over evolutionary time.","[Steen, David A.; Brock, Jean C.; Smith, Lora L.] Joseph W Jones Ecol Res Ctr, Newton, GA 39870 USA; [Steen, David A.; McClure, Christopher J.

For this purpose, between May 2010 and May 2011 a field experiment was conducted on an intertidal area in the Bay of Santander (N Spain) where both species coexist without an extreme predominance of the introduced species. Relative density of clam species was manipulated in a randomized block experimental design. The results obtained show that (i) the increased density of Manila clam simulating species expansion scenario does not affect growth or mortality of the native clam; and (ii) for densities of Manila clam substantially higher than observed in the field, predation plays an essential role in regulating both species populations, limiting their density increase. Moreover, Manila clam appears to be more negatively impacted by predation compared to the native clam. Overall, our results indicate that predation has a more significant effect on both populations when compared to competitive interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An important trait that induces asymmetric competition is size (body size in animals, height in plants). There is usually a trade-off between fecundity and the trait that leads to competitive superiority (e.g. seed number vs seed size), enabling coexistence of populations with different trait values. These predictions on coexistence are based on classic deterministic models. Here, we explore the behaviour of a stochastic model of asymmetric competition where stochasticity is assumed to be demographic. We derive approximations for the temporal variance and covariance of the population sizes of the coexisting species. The derivations highlight that the variability of the population size of a species strongly depends on the stochastic fluctuations of species with higher trait values, while they are less influenced by species with lower trait values. Particularly, species with intermediate trait values are strongly affected resulting in relatively high variability. As a result these species have a relative high probability of extinction even though they have a larger population size than species with high trait values. We confirm these approximations with individual-based simulations. Thus, our analysis can explain gaps in size distributions as an emergent property of systems with a fecundity-competition trade-off.

To identify variations in the risk of predation, nocturnal rodents may use moonlight as a cue of risk. Moonlight avoidance behaviors have been observed in many nocturnal rodent species and are widely generalized to small mammals. However, most prior studies have been limited to 1 species or 1 study site, or occurred in modified habitats. We evaluated desert rodent activity patterns in natural habitats from 1999 to 2006 at 62 study sites across the Great Basin Desert of western North America. Rodent activity was examined by livetrapping in open habitats, using the presence of the sand-obligate kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops) as a habitat indicator. Activity patterns were assessed on 69 nights with clear skies and compared to corresponding moonlight values (moon phase and brightness) to evaluate the frequency of moonlight avoidance. Analyses of total activity of all species in the rodent assemblage relative to moonlight showed a distinct nonrandom (triangular-shaped) pattern but no significant correlations. However, individual genera of desert rodents responded differently to moonlight. Only kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) displayed significant moonlight avoidance patterns; they were maximally active at significantly different moonlight levels and avoided bright moonlight to a greater extent than co-occurring rodents. Moonlight seemed to limit the activity of kangaroo rats most strongly on bright nights during waxing moon phases and summer seasons, but not significantly during the spring or fall seasons, or during waning moons. Rather than avoiding moonlight, the activity of deer mice (Peromyscus), pocket mice (Perognathus), and kangaroo mice may be governed by changes in competition with kangaroo rats. Differences in the body size, locomotion, and space use of kangaroo rats relative to other rodents may explain why different moonlight responses were detected, especially if these traits alter how rodents perceive risk from bright moonlight. These findings indicate that moonlight avoidance may be a specialized trait of kangaroo rats rather than a general behavior of nocturnal desert rodents in the Great Basin.","[Upham, Nathan S.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Upham, Nathan S.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Zool, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Upham, Nathan S.; Hafner, John C.] Occidental Coll, Moore Lab Zool, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA; [Upham, Nathan S.; Hafner, John C.] Occidental Coll, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA","Upham, NS (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",nsupham@uchicago.edu,,"Upham, Nathan/0000-0001-5412-9342","Nevada Department of Wildlife [05-21, 8-15]; Moore Laboratory of Zoology at Occidental College; Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago; United States Department of EducationUS Department of Education [P200A090336]","Fieldwork for this project was assisted by the diligent efforts of P.

Eggs of Spodoptera frugiperda previously parasitized by Telenomus remus were offered to Trichogramma pretiosum, and those parasitized by Trichogramma pretiosum were offered to Telenomus remus. The previously parasitized eggs were tested at different embryonic development stages for each parasitoid. In addition, to evaluate the competition between species, Spodoptera frugiperda eggs were offered to the parasitoids simultaneously. The behavior of the insects was recorded under a stereomicroscope. When Spodoptera frugiperda eggs were previously exposed to either parasitoid, there was no emergence of the other parasitoid. When the Telenomus remus and Trichogramma pretiosum females were placed together with Spodoptera frugiperda eggs, Telenomus remus had a greater parasitism rate. Except searching time, all Trichogramma pretiosum behaviors took a longer time than Telenomus remus behaviors. Thus, despite belonging to different families, each of these parasitoids is able to recognize host eggs previously parasitized by the other. So, this suggests that the recognition mechanism involved is not exclusively specific.","[Fernandes, Odair A.] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, FCAV, Dept Fitossanidade, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Carneiro, Tatiana R.] Ctr Univ Sete Lagoas UNIFEMM, BR-35701242 Sete Lagoas, MG, Brazil","Fernandes, OA (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, FCAV, Dept Fitossanidade, Rod Prof Paulo D Castellane,Km 5, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil.",oafernandes@fcav.unesp.br,"Fernandes, Odair A/C-1345-2013","Fernandes, Odair A/0000-0003-3489-4754",,,,32,9,14,4,52,ACAD BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS,RIO JANEIRO,"RUA ANFILOFIO DE CARVALHO, 29, 3 ANDAR, 20030-060 RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL",0001-3765,1678-2690,,AN ACAD BRAS CIENC,An.

ACANTHOIDES; COUNT DATA; PATTERNS; CURCULIONIDAE; METAANALYSIS; REPLACEMENT,"As the number of biological invasions increases, the potential for invader-invader interactions also rises. The effect of multiple invaders can be superadditive (invasional meltdown), additive, or subadditive (invasional interference); which of these situations occurs has critical implications for prioritization of management efforts. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides, two congeneric invasive weeds, have a striking, segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, USA. Possible hypotheses for this pattern include invasion history and chance, direct competition, or negative interactions mediated by other species, such as shared pollinators. To explore the role of resource competition in generating this pattern, we conducted three related experiments using a response-surface design throughout the life cycles of two cohorts. Although these species have similar niche requirements, we found no differential response to competition between conspecifics vs. congeners. The response to combined density was relatively weak for both species. While direct competitive interactions do not explain the segregated distributional patterns of these two species, we predict that invasions of either species singly, or both species together, would have similar impacts. When prioritizing which areas to target to prevent the spread of one of the species, it is better to focus on areas as yet unaffected by its congener; where the congener is already present, invasional interference makes it unlikely that the net effect will change.","[Rauschert, Emily Sofia Jalics; Shea, Katriona] Penn State Univ, IGDP Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Rauschert, Emily Sofia Jalics] Penn State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Shea, Katriona] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Rauschert, ESJ (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, IGDP Ecol, 116 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",erauschert@psu.edu,"Shea, Katriona/B-7954-2008","Shea, Katriona/0000-0002-7607-8248",USDA grantUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2002-35320-1228]; NASA Space Grant Fellowship,"This research was partially supported by USDA grant 2002-35320-1228 to K.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict geographic range shifts in response to climate change. However, because species communities are likely to change with the climate, accounting for biotic interactions is imperative. A shortcoming of introducing biotic interactions in SDMs is the assumption that biotic interactions remain the same under changing climatic factors, which is disputable. We explore the performance of SDMs while including biotic interactions. Location Fennoscandia, Europe. Methods We investigate the appropriateness of the inclusion of biotic factors (predator pressure and prey availability) in assessing the future distribution of the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) in Fennoscandia by means of SDM, using the algorithm MaxEnt. Results Our results show that the inclusion of biotic interactions enhanced the accuracy of SDMs to predict the current arctic fox distribution, and we argue that the accuracy of future predictions might also be enhanced. While the range of the arctic fox is predicted to have decreased by 43% in 2080 because of temperature-related variables, projected increases in predator pressure and reduced prey availability are predicted to constrain the potential future geographic range of the arctic fox in Fennoscandia 13% more. Main conclusions The results indicate that, provided one has a good knowledge of past changes and a clear understanding of interactions in the community involved, the inclusion of biotic interactions in modelling future geographic ranges of species increases the predictive power of such models. This likely has far-reaching impacts upon the design and implementation of possible conservation and management plans. Control of competing predators and supplementary feeding are suggested as necessary management actions to preserve the Fennoscandian arctic fox population in the face of climate change.","[Hof, Anouschka R.; Jansson, Roland; Nilsson, Christer] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Landscape Ecol Grp, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Hof, Anouschka R.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Hof, AR (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Landscape Ecol Grp, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",anouschka.hof@emg.umu.se,"Nilsson, Christer/AAI-1354-2019; Hof, Anouschka R/V-5994-2019; Jansson, Roland/B-7972-2013; Nilsson, Christer/I-9407-2012","Hof, Anouschka R/0000-0001-6743-0089; Jansson, Roland/0000-0003-1767-7010; Nilsson, Christer/0000-0003-1186-8115",Nordic Council of Ministers,This project was funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers.

Difficulty in the evaluation of interspecific interactions and trophic links using conventional rearing and dissection methods has prevented a deeper understanding of such relationships. The analysis of trophic links in the parasitoid community associated with the melon aphid (Aphis gossypii) in Hawaii provides a unique opportunity to assess complex interactions that occur in a system where all of the aphids and parasitoids have been introduced. Here, we developed and applied multiplex PCR assays to investigate the occurrence of in-host competition between parasitoids and/or hyperparasitoids on melon aphids collected from fields of Colocasia esculenta. To fully document the parasitoid-hyperparasitoid community within A. gossypii, both live and mummified aphids were examined. A total of 818 live and 245 mummified aphids were analyzed using the multiplex assays, with congruent rearing of over 600 mummified aphids serving as a basis for qualitative comparisons in terms of species composition and trophic linkages. The rearing and the DNA methods showed similar trends, with sharp declines in one parasitoid species followed by sharp increases in another during the course of the season. Molecular analyses revealed that hyperparasitism and multiparasitism of live aphids is remarkably low, whereas hyperparasitism of mummified aphids was extraordinarily high in both rearing and molecular analyses. In comparison to reared samples, molecular analysis of the parasitoid community was more complete and permitted the identification of previously unknown or unconfirmed trophic linkages. The potential of this approach in future studies on the biological control of aphids in Hawaii, particularly in light of new parasitoid introductions, is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of introduced non-mammalian competitors, however, is poorly understood. The house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, is one of the most successful invasive reptiles and has been implicated in the decline of endemic geckos and other taxa on a number of tropical and subtropical islands. We investigated the patterns of niche utilization between the house gecko and endemic ornate day gecko, Phelsuma ornata, in Mauritius, two species which were not believed to compete because they had different diel activity periods. The dietary and temporal niche partitioning of the two species were examined in relation to seasonal invertebrate prey abundance for three seasons. Dietary overlap between the two species was least when prey abundance was lowest and temporal overlap in activity greatest. Exploitative competition was therefore inferred, whereby changes in dietary overlap were attributed to shifts in prey selection by the day, but not the house, gecko, which was hypothesized to deplete prey. The compensatory response of the day gecko may have been to increase its tendency for cannibalism, such that the smaller house gecko was indirectly responsible for population reduction of its larger competitor. This is the first study to show how an invasive nocturnal gecko may be affecting a predominantly diurnal species.","[Cole, Nik C.; Harris, Stephen] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England","Cole, NC (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England.",nik.cole@durrell.org,,,"Mauritian Wildlife Foundation; National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Ago-Industry, Mauritius; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust; Dulverton Trust","We thank the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, particularly Asha Poonyth and Poonam Gangaram for phenology data, and the National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Ago-Industry, Mauritius for supporting this study, Lisa Cole for assistance in the field, and Phil Baker and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments that improved the manuscript.

Therefore, survival and reproductive success depend not only on the ability to secure prey but also on minimizing foraging costs. African wild dogs often coexist with lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta); these competitors can seriously increase foraging costs by kleptoparasitism. In this study, we empirically and experimentally assessed the risk and costs of kleptoparasitism for African wild dogs inside Hwange National Park, where hyena densities are high, and outside the park, where hyena densities are lower. Lion densities within the study area have been fluctuating. The risk and costs of kleptoparasitism were determined by comparing direct observations during hunt follows of radio collared African wild dog packs and by the use of experimental call-ups with African wild dog sounds inside and outside Hwange National Park. The risk of kleptoparasitism was found to be significantly higher inside the park. The time it took lions and hyenas to get to the kill site during African wild dog hunts was longer outside the park allowing the dogs a longer carcass access time. The found differences in risk and costs of kleptoparasitism could contribute to African wild dog habitat choice for the buffer zone outside Hwange National Park. As habitat choice in and around protected areas is often related to the possibility of exposure to an edge effect,'' interspecific competition should be considered in the conservation strategy of African wild dogs.","[van der Meer, Ester; Moyo, Mkhalalwa; Rasmussen, Gregory S.

We characterized distributional and behavioral patterns of the most common benthic grazers coexisting in the rocky shores of central Chile: the chiton Chiton granosus, the pulmonate limpet Siphonaria lessoni, the scurrinid limpet Scurria araucana and the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa. C. granosus and F. crassa were strictly nocturnal foragers whereas S. lessoni foraged during daytime. Most S. araucana individuals foraged at night, but daytime foraging was also common. The spatial distribution at resting varied from aggregated for C. granosus and S. lessoni to a more dispersive pattern for F. crassa and S. araucana. C. granosus dispersed slightly from aggregation when foraging whereas S. lessoni foraged in tight conspecific aggregations. Foraging excursions varied from over 60 cm in F. crassa to less than 7 cm in S. araucana. Homing behavior ranged from extreme fidelity in F. crassa to low fidelity in S. lessoni. Positive associations were observed between C. granosus and F. crassa during resting and foraging whereas negative associations were observed between these species and S. lessoni. These general patterns varied little between 2 sites separated by a few kilometers. Interspecific competition might be important in structuring this guild, but it may affect only some species pairs. Direct interference in the use of shelter or while foraging, rather than food exploitation, seems the most likely mechanism. The marked differences in individual behavior among species, despite ample diet overlap, might translate into different functional effects, which should be explored in future experiments.","[Aguilera, Moises A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Las Cruces, Chile; [Aguilera, Moises A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile; [Aguilera, Moises A.] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, CEAZA, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile","Aguilera, MA (corresponding author), Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Las Cruces, Chile.",moises.aguilera@ceaza.cl,"Aguilera, Moises/AAC-2981-2020; Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013","Aguilera, Moises/0000-0002-3517-6255; ",Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Andrew Mellon Foundation; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1070335]; Fondap FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYTCONICYT FONDAP [15001-001],"We greatly appreciate comments by B.

To assess the effects of radiation acquisition and resource allocation on competitive ability, S. arvensis was grown together with spring barley (Hordeum distichon L.) in six mixtures in a replacement series with initial above-ground biomass proportions of S. arvensis ranging from 2% to 96%. A one-season experiment was made outdoors in boxes in Uppsala, Sweden, at a low level of nitrogen supply (5 g N m(-2)). The study tested the predictability of shoot biomass of each species based on two principal assumptions: (i) growth model parameters derived from species in monocultures could be applied in mixtures, and (ii) radiation in the mixed stand was partitioned between species proportional to their leaf area. Calibration of two parameters, for scaling of shoot radiation use efficiency and radiation partitioning respectively, were the base for the evaluation. When the coefficients were close to unity, which was the case for all mixtures dominated by barley, and for one of the mixtures with high proportion of S. arvensis in the early season, observed and predicted shoot biomass coincided well. For the evenly composed mixtures, total shoot biomass was underestimated (the scaling coefficient of shoot radiation use efficiency was > 1), whereas the relative composition among species was predicted well. In the late season the principal model assumptions were not applicable to S. arvensis, likely due to increasing root allocation not accounted for in the model. Sonchus arvensis in mixtures with high proportions was planted early in relation to sowing of barley, which resulted in a comparably late development stage of S. arvensis. Consequently the relation between species development stages varied with species composition suggesting a need to introduce effects of differences in development stage into the model.","[Eckersten, H.; Lundkvist, A.; Torssell, B.; Verwijst, T.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Lundkvist, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, POB 7043, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",anneli.lundkvist@slu.se,,,"Formas in Stockholm; SLU EkoForsk in Uppsala, Sweden","The project was funded by Formas in Stockholm, and SLU EkoForsk in Uppsala, Sweden.

One of the central questions is under which conditions a (rare) invader can establish itself in a landscape dominated by a resident species at carrying capacity. Applying the same question with the roles of the invader and resident reversed leads to the principle that mutual invasibility implies coexistence. A related but different question is how fast a locally introduced invader spreads into a landscape (with or without competing resident), provided it can invade. We explore some aspects of these questions in a deterministic, spatially explicit model for two competing species with discrete non-overlapping generations in a patchy periodic environment. We obtain threshold values for fragmentation levels and dispersal distances that allow for mutual invasion and coexistence even if the non-spatial competition model predicts competitive exclusion. We obtain exact results when dispersal is governed by a Laplace kernel. Using the average dispersal success, we develop a mathematical framework to obtain approximate results that are independent of the exact dispersal patterns, and we show numerically that these approximations are very accurate.","[Samia, Yasmine; Lutscher, Frithjof] Univ Ottawa, Dept Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Lutscher, F (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Math & Stat, 585 King Edward Ave, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",flutsche@uottawa.ca,"Lutscher, Frithjof/C-9484-2012","Lutscher, Frithjof/0000-0001-7380-7647",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); MITACS Network for Biological Invasions and Dispersal Research,YS gratefully acknowledges summer support by the University of Ottawa WISET USRA program.

We studied how predatory fish affect subsurface sediment use by spiny- and smooth-shelled morphs of the mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, on New Zealand's South Island. Spines reduce consumption risk by small benthic fishes (e.g., bullies [Gobiomorphus spp.]). Thus, we predicted that spiny morphs would be more likely to use sediment surfaces with relatively high algal food supplies than the more vulnerable smooth morphs when exposed to fish predators. Epi- and endobenthic samples from 5 streams with fish showed that similar to 80% of snails typically were retrieved from subsurface sediments, whereas only 33% of snails from fishless Jackson's Creek occurred in subsurface sediments. A laboratory experiment revealed that significantly more snails used subsurface sediments when with common bullies (G. cotidianus) than when without. Subsurface sediment use in the presence of bullies was similar between shell morphs, a result suggesting that use of spatial refugia might be a more important predator defense than shell armature for Potamopyrgus. Regardless of fish presence, more spiny than smooth morphs burrowed into sand, but subsurface use did not differ between shell morphs in cobbles and gravel. Fewer snails were active on rock surfaces at night than during the day in a stream run, apparently to reduce encounters with nocturnally hunting bullies and shortfinned eels (Anguilla australis). Our results suggest that if fish predation pressure were reduced, then surface densities of Potamopyrgus would increase significantly. Given the snail's superior competitive abilities, this increase could alter top-down and bottom-up effects in food chains and threaten local biodiversity.","[Holomuzki, Joseph R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Mansfield, OH 44906 USA; [Lowe, Rex L.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Biggs, Barry J.

Intercropping increased DW compared with the sole species and the increase was higher for the cereals and lupin than for cereals and vetch intercropping systems. Above-ground competition for light reduced DW of cereals and lupin while it did not influence the DW of vetch. Processes involved in below-ground competition increased shoot growth of cereals and reduced shoot growth of legumes. N nutrition of cereals was enhanced by below-ground competition with legumes and N nutrition of vetch was enhanced by above-ground competition with cereals. Cereals had a higher competitive ability than legumes as a result of their below-ground competitive ability. The interaction between above- and below-competition is not predictable: negative, positive and no interaction (additivity) between different types of competition were found.

According to Elton's biodiversity and invasibility hypothesis, non-native species must be competitively superior to the resident species in order to successfully invade. An invader that is ecologically similar to a native species may cause intense interspecific competition as they both require the same resource. Furthermore, an increase in the density of an invading competitor may enhance the intensity of the competitive interaction, however, this may be reduced if the inferior competitor has a refuge that reduces the amount of time it is in direct contact with the superior competitor. In laboratory-based competition experiments between the non-native caprellid Caprella mutica and two ecologically similar native caprellids Caprella linearis and Pseudoprotella phasma, C. mutica successfully displaced both species from homogeneous artificial habitat patches after 48 hours. Patches that contained a refuge reduced the number of C. linearis being displaced but only when C. mutica was at a low density. Potentially aggressive interactions between C. mutica and the native C. linearis may have caused C. linearis to be displaced from the patches and could have caused significantly higher mortality of C. linearis compared to the controls. This is the first study to show that the non-native C. mutica has the ability to displace ecologically similar native species when the resource space is limited and when the density of C. mutica was significantly (10 times) lower than the density of C. linearis.","[Shucksmith, Richard; Cook, Elizabeth J.; Hughes, David J.; Burrows, Michael T.] Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland","Shucksmith, R (corresponding author), Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",rshucksmith@gmail.com,"Burrows, Michael/ABF-4844-2020","Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899; Cottier-Cook, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1466-6802",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Esmee Fairbarin Foundation Marine Aliens Programme,We would like to thank the anonymous referees for their comments that helped to improve the manuscript.

Rank reversals in species performance are theoretically important for structuring communities, maintaining diversity and determining the course of forest succession. Species growth ranks can change with ontogeny or in different microenvironments, but interactions between ontogeny and the environment are not well-understood because of the lack of long-term forest competition studies. While early differences in growth among species may reflect intrinsic differences in shade-tolerance and physiology, ontogenetic trends in growth and variation in neighbourhood density and composition may change or even reverse early patterns of growth rankings. 2. We experimentally studied spatial and temporal patterns of species interactions and growth for three northern tree species: Larix laricina, Picea mariana and Pinus strobus. We compared species size and growth rankings over an 11-year period, for different species mixtures planted at four density levels in north-eastern Minnesota, USA. 3. The benefits of different growth strategies changed with ontogeny and density leading to reversals in the size rank of competing species over time and space. High-density stands promoted dominance and resource pre-emption by L. laricina, whereas lower-density stands favoured gradual accumulation of biomass and eventual dominance by P. strobus. In the absence of strong neighbour competition, ontogenetic trends in growth had greater influence on growth patterns. 4. Species interactions affected the productivity of mixed stands vs. monocultures. Species generally grew more in monoculture than when planted with P. strobus at low density, or with L. laricina at high density. Only L. laricina and P. mariana showed potential for greater overall productivity, or over-yielding, when planted together than alone, probably because of improved resource uptake by the highly stratified canopy. 5. Synthesis. Density predictably determined whether size-asymmetric growth or ontogenetic growth trends would drive early establishment and growth patterns. Variation in vertical and horizontal structure that results from early competitive dynamics can influence the successional trajectory or character of the mature forest. This study extends previous efforts to identify the causes of rank reversals in communities and understand the importance of temporal changes beyond the early years of seedling establishment.","[Boyden, Suzanne B.; Reich, Peter B.; Puettmann, Klaus J.; Baker, Timothy R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Boyden, Suzanne B.] Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA; [Puettmann, Klaus J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Baker, Timothy R.] Coll Redwoods, Eureka, CA 95501 USA","Boyden, SB (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",sboyden@clarion.edu,,"Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X","Wilderness Research Foundation; F.

If competition is an important factor that controls the presence and absence of species within intact communities, then a competitive hierarchy, a ranked order from competitive dominant to competitive subordinate, should predict the composition of intact communities. We tested whether a competitive hierarchy derived from pairwise comparisons accurately predicts species abundances within a constructed polyculture community consisting of seven species common to old-field plant communities. We first conducted a pot experiment in field conditions wherein we grew the species in all possible combinations, then created a competitive hierarchy derived from both competitive effect and competitive response for each species. Concurrently, at the same site in native field soil, we constructed polycultures consisting of the same seven species and calculated an abundance hierarchy based on foliar cover, biomass, and an index of species performance. The competitive hierarchy was not concordant with the abundance hierarchy, indicating that simple pairwise comparisons may not account for other factors that influence the abundance of species within relatively complex communities.","[Engel, E.

Here, we test the hypothesis that animals could minimize interference competition by shifting their temporal niches in relation to competitors. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes in order to study agonistic interactions between elephants and other herbivore species. We also used a long-term data set from a yearly survey of waterhole attendance by herbivores to evaluate the influence of the presence of elephants on the use of waterholes by other herbivore species. Our results show that in drier years, waterholes are crowded with elephants early in the afternoon. In general, the species most affected by interference competition with elephants shift their temporal niches at the waterholes, thus maintaining a constant temporal overlaps with elephants. The species less affected by interference competition with elephants show no temporal niche shifts and increase their temporal overlap with elephants at waterholes, as predicted from a noncompetition hypothesis. This study provides evidence that interference competition with a behaviorally dominant large species influences the temporal niches of smaller species, and suggests that the potential costs associated with interference between elephants and other herbivores at waterholes are linked to shifts in diurnal activities rather than interactions and water acquisition itself.","Ctr Etud Biol Chize, CNRS, UPR 1934, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; Integrated Wildlife Management Res Unit, CIRAD EMVT, F-34398 Montpellier, France; Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biomet & Biol Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Valeix, M (corresponding author), Ctr Etud Biol Chize, CNRS, UPR 1934, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France.",mvaleix@yahoo.fr,"Chamaille-Jammes, Simon/B-3833-2009; Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014; Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010","Chamaille-Jammes, Simon/0000-0003-0505-6620; Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661; ",,,,49,84,91,4,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2007,153,3,,,,,739,748,,10.1007/s00442-007-0764-5,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,201DP,WOS:000248812000024,17566783,,,,2021-09-21,

Dominance structures due to competitive hierarchies, with consequences for species richness, have not received as much experimental attention, since their manipulation is a large logistic undertaking. Here the data from a model system based on bryophytes are presented to investigate competition structure in a three-species system. Grown in monocultures, pairwise and three-species mixtures under no and high nitrogen supply, the three moss species responded strongly to treatment conditions. One of them suffered from nitrogen fertilisation and hence performed better in mixtures, where the dominant species provided physical shelter from apparently toxic nitrogen spray. Accordingly, no linear competitive hierarchy emerged and qualitative transitivity remains restricted to the unfertilised treatments. Faciliation also affected other properties of the competition structure. The reciprocity of competition effects could not be observed. Moreover, the performances in three-species mixtures were not well predictable from the knowledge of monocultures and pairwise mixtures because competitive effects were not additive. This had implications for community stability at equilibrium: all two-species systems were stable, both fertilised and unfertilised, while the three-species system was only stable when fertilised. This stability under fertilisation has probably to do with the facilitative effect of the two dominant species on the third. In this experiment, little support for commonly held ideas was found about the way competition in plant communities is structured. On the other hand, this study shows that moss communities are ideal model systems to test predictions of theoretical models concerning properties and consequences of competition in plant communities.","UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Dormann, CF (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",carsten.dormann@ufz.de,,"Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794",,,,79,12,14,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,AUG,2007,191,2,,,,,171,184,,10.1007/s11258-006-9235-z,,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,188PL,WOS:000247931700003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Previous models have shown that the form of this relationship depends on the relative rates of colonization and extinction and the sensitivity of these rates to competition. We use simple models to show that the LSR-RSR relationship also depends on the type of metacommunity structure (Levins-like or mainland-island), and our models generate a wider range of realistic forms than do most previous models. We parameterize and test our models with two independent data sets for Daphnia in rock pools on islands in Finland and Sweden. We find that the Levins-like model with competition correctly predicts the observed LSR-RSR relationship and provides the best fit to the average local species richness per island. Simulations show that our models are robust to relaxing our assumption of identical species properties. Our study is one of the first to make and successfully test quantitative predictions for how a widely studied community pattern, the LSR-RSR relationship, arises from metacommunity dynamics.","Univ Lyon 1, IRD, Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Hugueny, B (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, IRD, Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux, 43 Blvd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",hugueny@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr,,,,,,45,24,25,0,33,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2007,88,7,,,,,1696,1706,,10.1890/06-1884.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,185SN,WOS:000247730800010,17645016,,,,2021-09-21,

The analysis of the competitive response gives no indication of competitive release or amplification with increasing number of neighbouring species. 4 Further analysis with yield-density models reveals that the competition intensity of most multi-species mixtures is well predicted by the effect of pairwise interactions. Hence, for the majority of species combinations, our results indicate additive effects of species competition. 5 Specific species combinations, however, significantly deviate from this result. For combinations of C. canescens with either one of the herbs, the models show a significantly better fit if a non-additivity parameter is included. The important missing factor to describe target plant growth is species-specific biomass of neighbouring plants and here root biomass is the most crucial determinant. The addition of each of these factors as non-additive parameters significantly increases the predictive power of the model. 6 Our work adds to the increasing evidence that interactions in diverse plant communities are not simply a sum of their component species interactions. For a better understanding of the effect of competition on the structure and development of diverse plant communities, future studies need to consider both additive and non-additive effects of competing species.","Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; Univ Bielefeld, Dept Expt & Syst Ecol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany","Weigelt, A (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",alexandra.weigelt@uni-jena.de,,,,,,89,67,69,2,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

How this is achieved remains a mystery. It had been proposed that connections with unshaded (non-overgrown) parts of the thallus may allow transfer of nutrients to the shaded part. From this model, I proposed and tested the hypothesis that shaded patches of the intertidal red alga, Hildenbrandia rubra, would survive overgrowth longer, or better, when connected to unshaded thallus than when experimentally separated from surrounding alga. Experimental treatments were shading (black or transparent 80 mm perspex discs or no cover) and scraping (scraped around the disc to remove contacts, a control for effects of scraping, no treatment). The 9 orthogonal combinations of cover and scraping were applied to 3 independent, random replicates (i.e. 27 plots) in each of four randomly chosen sites. In all 4 sites, over 13 months, shaded H. rubra survived in greater abundance (as % cover) where in contact with surrounding thallus. In one site, there was no effect of shading unless the thallus was isolated. In two sites, shading reduced cover, but was more deleterious where the thallus was isolated. In the fourth site, there were artefacts due to a perspex cover, but still less cover of alga where it was isolated. This encrusting alga can withstand a long period of complete shading, provided there is connection to unshaded thallus. Interpreting or predicting overgrowth interactions in terms of competitive outcomes is therefore dependent on consideration of whether the overgrown species is actually being affected. It also depends on the duration of overgrowth and, as shown here, the extent to which connectivity with unshaded thallus is effective at preventing or reducing any consequences. Observations and experiments that do not ascertain these are difficult to interpret. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A critical reappraisal of current theoretical models is needed because experimental studies both support and refute their predictions. A quantitative meta-analysis of field and common garden studies evaluating the effect of abiotic stress (low vs. high) on the net outcome of plant-plant interactions in arid and semi-arid environments was performed to evaluate the degree of empirical support for these models. We created four separate data sets corresponding to the categories of response variables commonly used to measure plant performance (survival, density, growth and fecundity). The analyses showed that both the selection of the estimator of plant performance and the experimental approach followed have a strong influence on both the net outcome of plant-plant interactions and the effect of abiotic stress on such outcome. The effect of neighbours on the survival and growth of target plants was not significant at either stress level, but that on the density and fecundity of target plants was positive (facilitation) and negative (competition) at the low and high abiotic stress level, respectively. Density data showed that the net effect of neighbours was positive and negative at low and high abiotic stress levels, respectively, whereas other estimators suggested that the net effect of neighbours did not differ with stress level. None of our meta-analyses indicated that the magnitude of the net effect provided by neighbours, whether positive or negative, was higher under high abiotic stress conditions, and facilitation does not therefore appear to increase in importance with abiotic stress. As the predictions of current theoretical models regarding the relationship between the net outcome of a plant-plant interaction and abiotic stress do not hold in arid and semi-arid environments, different models are needed. These should consider different sources of abiotic stress separately, and should be valid for performance measurements, such as survival, that integrate plant responses over time. The incorporation of these features into theoretical models will undoubtedly improve their predictive capabilities.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; CSIC, Ctr Ciencias Medioambientales, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Environm Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Maestre, FT (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Phytotron Bldg,Sci Dr,Box 90340, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",maestre@duke.edu,"Reynolds, James F/G-6364-2010; Maestre, Fernando T./A-6825-2008; Valladares, Fernando/K-9406-2014","Maestre, Fernando T./0000-0002-7434-4856; Valladares, Fernando/0000-0002-5374-4682",,,,86,381,412,4,189,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Contrarily, the monkeys also exhibited nonagonistic behaviors, such as play and grooming. As tufted capuchins predate other mammalian species, and as the subjects were aggressive towards competitor species, showing their belligerent temperament, we believe the lack of predation can be attributed to 2 different ecological contigencies - the absence of coati pups in a period of food shortage, and the cost of dealing with a dangerous adult coati where other rich resources were available - and also, perhaps, to different traditions in capuchin behavior towards coatis, established via intraspecific social learning.","Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Psychol, Dept Expt Psychol, Sao Paulo, Brazil","de Resende, BD (corresponding author), Ave Prof Mello Moraes 1721, BR-15508030 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",briseida@usp.br,"Izar, Patricia/C-3445-2012; Resende, Briseida/F-1898-2013; Ottoni, Eduardo Benedicto/E-4941-2012","Izar, Patricia/0000-0001-6741-0731; Resende, Briseida/0000-0001-5932-0189; Ottoni, Eduardo Benedicto/0000-0003-1288-8345",,,,36,8,8,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0164-0291,1573-8604,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

Field samples revealed that shells of the gastropod Cerithium atratum were the main resource used by both hermit crab species and that Pagurus used eroded or damaged shells in higher frequency than Clibanarius. The exploitative ability of each species was compared between species in the laboratory using dead gastropod (Cerithium) baits to simulate predation events and signalize newly available shells to hermit crabs. Pagurus reached the baits more rapidly than Clibanarius, but this higher exploitative ability did not explain shell utilization patterns in nature. Another experiment evaluated the dominance hierarchy between these two hermit crab species and revealed that Clibanarius was able to outcompete Pagurus for higher quality shells in agonistic encounters. This higher interference competitive ability of Clibanarius in relation to Pagurus may explain field observations. Nevertheless, Pagurus may be responsible to enhance shell availability to other hermit crab species that have lower ability to find and use newly available shells. Differently, the poorer condition of shells used by Pagurus, the higher ability of this species to attend gastropod predation events and its higher consumption rate by shell-breaking crabs (Menippe nodifrons) may increase its predation risks, thus revealing the disadvantages of such an exploitative competitive strategy for hermit crabs.

(Diptera: Culicidae) may affect the resulting adult densities and, hence, the risk of malaria. We investigated the impact of the presence of a fourth-instar larva (An. gambiae Giles s.s. or An. arabiensis Patton), the quantity of food, and the available space on the survival and development of freshly hatched larvae of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis. To analyse the results, two proportional hazard models were constructed. The first estimated the effects of all covariates on mortality rate and the second estimated the effects of the covariates on development rate into the third larval instar (L3). A time-dependent covariate for density, which changed during the experiment as a result of death or development to L3, was included in both models. In the presence of a fourth-instar larva (L4), survival of the experimental larvae was significantly reduced, but no difference was detected between the presence of L4 An. gambiae and L4 An. arabiensis. The observation that the majority of dead larvae were not recovered in trays with an L4 present suggested that cannibalism and predation occurred readily. Limitation in space significantly increased mortality of larvae, whereas a limitation of food reduced larval development rate, but did not cause mortality per se. From this, we concluded that both cannibalism and predation were enhanced as a result of more frequent interactions within smaller environments, but did not occur for reasons of food shortage. This study shows that inter- and intraspecific interactions among larvae of the An. gambiae complex strongly affect survival and development, and that the quantity of food and the available space are important determinants of the outcome of these interactions. Implications of the results are discussed with respect to the population dynamics of both malaria vectors in the field.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands","Koenraadt, CJM (corresponding author), AFRIMS Entomol Lab, 2 Soi 15,Rachdamnoen Rd 1, Kamphaeng Phet 62000, Thailand.",cjmkoenraadt@ucdavis.edu,,"Koenraadt, Constantianus/0000-0001-7861-8781; Hemerik, Lia/0000-0002-6892-2840",,,,47,39,40,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

As ice-loading of nearshore waters (through ice sheet collapses) seems a most likely signal of climate warming, we looked at communities likely to be affected by changing disturbance, i.e. those encrusting boulders in shallow water. The structures of such assemblages at high latitude are highly hierarchical in which if uninterrupted by disturbance (ice-scour) succession would lead to domination by just a single species. However, unless pecking orders from place to place involve the same specific species, with the same competitive rankings, monopolisation will remain only local. To see how pecking orders varied, we examined variability in competitive performance of common species in a high Arctic lithophillic assemblage at several spatial scales. These were sampled 10(1), 10(3) and 10(5) m apart on the west coast of Spitsbergen, and 10(6) m apart, achieved by sampling southern Iceland and the Faeroe islands. We found that higher taxonomic membership was the major factor determining overgrowth performance of species. Overgrowth performance of each study species changed relatively little between samples, the same good competitors being top performers in any samples where they occurred. Overgrowth performance of each study species was also most similar in samples at the smallest spatial scale. Apart from this, the performance of each study species did not, however, become more dissimilar with increasing distance between samples. Most noteworthy was that susceptibility to variation in overgrowth performance at the regional 10(5) M scale altered with competitive ranking, i.e. pioneer and dominant species lost and won nearly all encounters respectively, wherever they were. The performance of mid-ranking species was much more variable. These results suggest that whilst the patterns of succession may differ from place to place, the end results will not. Our study provides data to support the theory that appreciation of scale is crucial to understanding community structure, diversity and potential for response to climate change, If ice-loading (disturbance) in polar waters does decrease, we suggest from our findings that a very small number of encrusting species may monopolise large areas of the shallows. Before this, though, we predict that different mid-ranked species will become more common from site to site, with limited reduction of ice (disturbance) increasing regional diversity.","British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; Univ Courses Svalbard, UNIS, N-9171 Spitsbergen, Norway; Polish Acad Sci, Marine Ecol Dept, Inst Oceanol, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",dkab@bas.ac.uk,,,,,,63,12,12,0,7,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The evolutionarily stable strategy which describes animal distributions across habitat patches is called the ideal free distribution (IFD) strategy. Two mechanisms that lead to the IFD are: (1) direct consumer competition such as interference, and (2) exploitative competition for resources. This article focuses on the second mechanism by assuming that resources undergo population dynamics while consumer abundance is fixed. Two models of resource growth are considered in detail: the exponential and the logistic. The corresponding consumer IFD is derived for each of these two models, assuming that consumers behave adaptively by moving to the patch which provides them with the highest fitness. This derivation does not require that resources are at an equilibrium, and it provides, for each resource density, the corresponding distribution of consumers. The article suggests that adaptive patch choice by consumers decreases between patch heterogeneity in resource levels and weakens the apparent competition between resources. The results for a single consumer population are extended for two competing consumer populations. The corresponding IFD is computed as a function of the two consumer densities. This allows for the analytical description of isolegs which are the boundary lines, in the two consumer density phase space, separating regions where qualitatively different habitat preferences are predicted.

This was investigated in two species of ladybird predators of aphids, Harmonia axyridis and Propylea japonica. H. axyridis is known to be the stronger intraguild predator and P. japonica to be the more frequent intraguild prey in interactions of these two species. These ladybirds share aphid prey on mugworts, hibiscus, and Italian ryegrasses in fields of northern Japan but largely avoid each other on the same plant. Fecal cues of these ladybird predators were found to contribute in their assessment of predation risk from conspecific and heterospecific competitors in common habitats. Gravid females of H. axyridis reduced rates of feeding and oviposition when exposed to feces of conspecifics, but not when exposed to feces of P. japonica. In contrast, gravid females of P. japonica reduced feeding and oviposition when exposed to feces of both H. axyridis and its own species. Females of both ladybird species exhibited similar behavior in response to water extracts of feces. For P. japonica, the influence of heterospecific feces was greater than that of conspecific feces. Our results demonstrate that feces of ladybirds contain odors that have the potential to deter the feeding and oviposition activities of conspecific as well as heterospecific ladybirds. Such deterrence allows these insects to avoid predation risk. Differences in responses of the two predators are discussed.","Tripura Univ, Dept Life Sci, Agartala 799004, Tripura, India; Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan","Agarwala, BK (corresponding author), Tripura Univ, Dept Life Sci, Agartala 799004, Tripura, India.",,,"Agarwala, Basant/0000-0002-7282-8849",,,,49,66,70,0,25,KLUWER ACADEMIC/PLENUM PUBL,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0098-0331,,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

Predation is one factor that can have widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes. Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey. I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior, morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly, selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems, illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes. Thus, it is important that we identify the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of predation, rather than simply observing the outcomes and then inferring which processes are responsible.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea+@pitt.edu,,,,,,65,76,79,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2002,83,7,,,,,1953,1964,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1953:TMFOPH]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,571LD,WOS:000176718100015,,,,,2021-09-21,

A 2-factor laboratory experiment was conducted, where juveniles (0+) and adults (1+) were kept in experimental jars for 2 mo at densities of 2000, 4000 and 8000 ind. m(-2), which corresponds to natural abundances in the Baltic Sea. The amphipods were fed on a mixture of naturally occurring algae at 3 food levels: zero, medium (representing a diatom spring-bloom) and high (representing a 2 x diatom spring-bloom). The level of food added to the experimental jars determined whether food competition occurred, both within and between the 2 age classes. Growth of juveniles was riot density-dependent, at any food level, in the absence of adults, but clearly dependent on presence or absence of fresh algal material. In presence of high adult densities, the growth of juveniles was significantly reduced at food levels that corresponded to a single and twice a diatom spring-bloom, while such reduction was not found in jars without added algae. Growth of adults was both density- and food-dependent. Juveniles did not affect the survival and growth of adults. As high densities of amphipods in jars without added food affected neither growth nor mortality, we conclude that crowding effects such as predation or directly damaging interference are not important regulating mechanisms. The results indicate that exploitative intraspecific competition for food occurs both between and within year classes, but depends on the resource levels and is likely to be most intense under a regime of low to medium input of phytodetritus. The experiment lends support to the hypothesis that intraspecific competition for food acts as an important process causing fluctuations in the Baltic Sea populations of M. affinis.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Wenngren, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.wenngren@zoologi.su.se,"Olafsson, Emil/D-4916-2012",,,,,56,15,15,0,2,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In contrast to many mechanistic models that require extensive parameterization, the Conductance model is able to capture the growth of a broad range of species using a few simplified assumptions regarding plant growth and easily derived species-specific parameter values. Ws examine the assumptions within the Conductance model that total leaf area per plant is proportional to total plant weight, and that an isolated plant has a projected crown zone area that is proportional to the 2/3 power of its weight. Power rather than linear relations were found between weight and leaf area for Brassica oleracea, Daucus carota, Matricaria inodora, Solamum nigrum, Stellaria media, Trifolium repens and Veronica persica. For all seven species, the value of the power was less than unity. All species also exhibited a power relation between crown zone area and weight, with the slope of this relation being less than 2/3 for B. oleracea, D. carota and S. media. Although morphology type accounted for some of the variation in the parameter values relating to light interception, there were considerable differences between species within upright or prostrate foliage species groups. The Conductance model was used to predict yields of B. oleracea, S. nigrum and V. persica grown in both monoculture and binary weed-crop mixtures over a range of temporal and spatial scales. After calibrating the model to non-competing plants, the model was used to predict growth of the weed and crop species in contrasting densities and stand types. In some crop-weed combinations, predicted crop and weed weights were within 17% of observed values, with no systematic deviations. In others, systematic and large deviations occurred.

Predicted and observed weed-free corn yields were in agreement for yields ranging from 8 to 13 Mg ha(-1) but were over- and underpredicted under low-yielding and near-optimal production conditions, respectively. Predicted and observed corn yield loss agreed well across the full range of observed velvetleaf densities for five to nine location years, depending on the performance criterion used. Estimates of T-e calculated from predicted weed-free yield and yield loss relationships were an average of 6% smaller than those calculated from observed data, indicating that the model predicts a conservative value of T-e in most cases.

The latter are common in reef deposits due to biostratinomic feedback, i.e. dense skeletal accumulations provide hard substrates for clonal recruitment, thus facilitating greater frequency of live-dead encounters than in lower biomass level-bottom communities dominated by solitary organisms. Differentiating between these two types in ancient reefs is difficult, often impossible. Most live-live interactions among clones in extant reef communities involve competition for space. Clonal spatial competition is divisible into four types: 1) direct-aggressive: encrusting overgrowth; 2) indirect-passive: depriving neighbors of resources, chiefly sunlight, by growth above them; 3) stand-off: avoidance of competition by organisms adopting positions that avoid or minimize direct polyp/zooid contact; and 4) overwhelming: one clone/ species volumetrically or numerically overwhelms the other, meeting minimal resistance. Despite class-order level differences in taxa, our results indicate that extant analogs, based on the arrangement and distortion of skeletons, are valuable for recognizing live-live interactions in Silurian and Carboniferous reefs and interpreting the types of spatial competition represented. Comparison of overhead (plan) views of live-live coral competition in Polynesian reefs with vertical sections of Silurian and Carboniferous sponge-dominated reefs and biostromes suggests that direct-aggressive competition is more common among extant than among Paleozoic reef-builders. Stand-offs showing clone margin distortion and overwhelming with minor skeletal distortion are most common in our fossil examples and probably relate to the dominance of these reefs by sponges. Success by extant sponges in spatial competition is largely due to allelochemical deterrence which may explain the predominance of stand-off and overwhelming confrontations in fossil sponges rather than tentacle-mesentery based direct aggression among extant corals and bryozoans.","Univ Canterbury, Dept Geol, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; EPHE, CRIOBE, URA CNRS 1453, Moorea, France; Kansas State Univ, Dept Geol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Brunel Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; Sch Sci, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England","Fagerstrom, JA (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Geol, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.",a.fagerstrom@geol.canterbury.ac.nz; rrwest@ksu.edu; Stephen.Kershaw@brunel.ac.uk,"Kershaw, Stephen/A-6497-2011",,,,,128,20,23,2,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0172-9179,1612-4820,,FACIES,Facies,,2000,42,,,,,,1,24,,10.1007/BF02562563,,,24,Geology; Paleontology,Geology; Paleontology,325CW,WOS:000087659600001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Both polyphagous predatory mite species have been previously shown to interact directly through predation on each other. The present study demonstrated that the adult females of T. pyri and K. aberrans are able to discriminate between con- and heterospecific larvae and protonymphs and that they prefer to prey upon heterospecifics when given the choice. Hunger did not reduce the propensity of the females to prefer heterospecifics over conspecifics. For proto-and deutonymphs the trends followed the results obtained with the adult females, but the preference for heterospecifics was not distinct enough to be significant. In competitive situations reciprocal predation may be a crucial mechanism in the interaction of polyphagous phytoseiid species and may contribute significantly to population persistence.

One experiment was conducted during the 1988-89 growing season, the other during the 1989-90 growing season. 2 A four-species yield-density model was constructed using seed yield data from the 1988-89 experiment. Model predictions were tested against seed yield data from the 1989-90 experiment. A systematic bias in predicted seed yields was found. As a consequence, the original model was reparameterized to provide a better fit to the observed yields for the 1989-90 experiment. 3 Analyses were conducted to determine the importance of potential sources of bias in the original model, including (i) mis-specification of density effects at low densities due to the parameterization protocol; (ii) interaction effects among competing species; and (iii) year-to-year variability in competitive interactions. All three sources had a significant effect on at least one of the species in the experiment, although significant sources differed between species. 4 Using two forms of sensitivity analysis, a comparison was made between the original and modified versions of the yield-density model to determine how they differed in predictions of long-term plant community dynamics. Rank order of average densities among species did not differ between models; however, there were several important differences in their predictions with respect to overall community structure. Implications of these results with respect to the use of yield-density models in studying plant community dynamics are discussed. 5 The present study indicates that the effectiveness of the generally employed yield-density model at characterizing competitive interactions under different environmental conditions depends upon the criteria employed in making an assessment.

During the experiment, the seedlings developed natural infestations by Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and powdery mildew. Several weeks after the start of the experiment a condition of diminishing prey availability was created by use of hexythiazox treatments. Without heterospecific competitors, T. pyri attained a higher population level than E. finlandicus or K. aberrans when similar amounts of food (spider mites) were available to each. Population growth of ir: pyri was decisively favoured by the presence of T. urticae. In the single-species systems each predatory species persisted to the end of the experiment in spite of diminishing prey. In two-species systems with T. pyri/E. finlandicus and T. pyri/K. aberrans that were started with the same number of individuals of each species, only T. pyri was left at the end of the experiment. Typhlodromus pyri became more numerous than the other species when prey was abundant (which was in accordance with the results of the single-species groups) and finally displaced E. finlandicus and K. aberrans towards the end of the experiment. The following factors may have contributed to the dominance of T. pyri: (1) the ability of adult females to survive longer without food than those of E. finlandicus and K. aberrans, (2) the ability to complete juvenile development and to sustain reproduction with phytoseiid prey and (3) an advantage in foraging behaviour over K. aberrans and E. finlandicus at low spider mite levels. Euseius finlandicus predominated in the two-species system E. finlandicus/K. aberrans, but both species persisted to the end of the experiment.","Inst Phytomed, Fed Off, A-1226 Vienna, Austria; Inst Phytomed, Agr Res Ctr, A-1226 Vienna, Austria","Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Entomol, 2046 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",,,,32,21,23,0,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Their performance on the host plant can depend on the sink-source relationship they establish with the plant. Because sink-source relationships within a plant are reflected in its architecture, we examined how architectural differences among cottonwoods might influence the success of the galling aphid, Pemphigus berne. Using cloned cottonwoods in common garden studies, we found three major patterns. First, there is a significant clonal or genetic component to tree architecture; cloned trees grown in a common garden maintain the architecture of parental trees. Second, resistant tree genotypes have more natural sinks (i.e., buds) relative to sources (i.e., stem volume) than susceptible trees. Third, these differences in architecture result in greater competition among sinks on aphid-resistant trees than on aphid-susceptible trees. Sink competition within a tree was estimated by the Gini coefficient which quantifies the size inequality of a shoot population (i.e., competition among sinks is low when shoots are nearly equal in size, and great when a few shoots are large and most are small). Aphid death through gall abortion increased significantly (r(2) = 0.65) on garden-grown trees as competition among sinks within a tree increased. Based on these observations we proposed the ''sink competition hypothesis'' to account for the performance of gall formers on their host plants. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally reduced sink densities (i.e., buds) on branches of resistant tree genotypes to resemble the bud densities of susceptible genotypes. By reducing the number of competing sinks, we predicted that aphid survival would increase. As predicted, aphid survival significantly increased. For example, in one removal experiment, aphid survival increased from 20% on control branches to 55% on branches with the highest level of bud removal. Similar bud removals on susceptible trees did not increase aphid survival, indicating that competition is relaxed on susceptible hosts. With the exception of the plant vigor hypothesis, most current hypotheses explaining herbivore distributions in nature focus on the importance to leaf-chewing herbivores of variation in chemistry. We believe that a sink competition model is needed to explain the distributions of the diverse group of herbivores that act as phloem parasites. The sink competition model is more mechanistic than the vigor hypothesis, and may account for apparent contradictions because it more clearly quantifies the resource base and the potential interactions that occur when sinks, either herbivore-induced or natural, compete for sources.","NO ARIZONA UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,FLAGSTAFF,AZ 86011","Larson, KC (corresponding author), UNIV CENT ARKANSAS,DEPT BIOL,CONWAY,AR 72035, USA.",,,,,,,59,144,154,1,41,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,1997,109,4,,,,,575,582,,10.1007/s004420050119,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WM378,WOS:A1997WM37800012,28307342,,,,2021-09-21,

Antibiosis can occur through the release of plant chemicals from the roots into the soil, which malt adversely affect the host-finding behavior of the infective stage nematode, or the presence of these chemicals in the host insect may negatively affect nematode reproduction. In laboratory studies, intra-specific and inter-specific competition reduces nematode fitness, and inter-specific competition can cause local extinction of a nematode species. For example, after concomitant infection of a host, a steinernematid species usually excludes a heterorhabditid species. The mechanism for the steinernematid superiority has been postulated to be a bacteriocin(s) produced by Xenorhabdus, the symbiotic bacterium of the steinernematid which prevents Photorhabdus, the symbiotic bacterium of the heterorhabditid, from multiplying. Inter-specific competition between two steinernematid species shows that both can co-exist in a host, but one species will eventually prevail in the environment. By having different foraging strategies, however, both steinermatid species may co-exist in the same habitat. An important issue is whether the introduction of an exotic entomopathogenic nematode species will competitively displace an indigenous nematode species. Although the environmental risks are small, the recommended policy is that the introduction of exotic nematodes be regulated With other pathogens, entomopathogenic nematodes can out-compete entomopathogenic fungi, but not Bacillus thuringiensis, for the same host individual when both the nematode and entomopathogen are applied simultaneously. The best studied natural enemy is the nemnrophagous fungus, Hirsutella rhossiliensis, which causes higher mortality in Steinernema glaseri compared with Heterorhabditis bacteriorphora. Differential susceptibility to the fungus may be associated with the retention of the second-stage cuticle by H. bacteriophora. Invertebrate predators including mites and collembolans feed on entomopathogenic nematodes. Although a number of studies have been conducted with antagonists, there is a dearth of field data. We suggest that long-term research plots be established where natural populations of entomopathogenic nematodes occur and include antagonists as a component of such studies.",,"Kaya, HK (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT NEMATOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,101,86,88,3,35,CARFAX PUBL CO,ABINGDON,"PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE",0958-3157,,,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

During a study on the great tit at Wytham Wood, Oxfordshire, nest predation by weasels was as high as 50% in some years prior to 1976. In 1976, nest-boxes were made virtually predator proof. 2. The change in nest-box type increased local recruitment rate and total population size of great and blue tits. We examined here the consequences of reduced nest predation on the survival rate of the great tit late in life. 3. Prior to 1976 (during the nest predation period), survival rate after the age of 5 years showed no decline and no relationship to the number of successful breeding attempts in either sex. 4. After 1976 (predator-proof period), both sexes showed increased mortality rates after the age of 5. However, only female survival was related to the number of successful breeding attempts, with a negative correlation. 5. This enhanced mortality late in life is likely to result from an increased cost of reproduction due to the combined effects of increased competition (higher adult density) and increased investment in reproduction (more young to raise because of reduced nest predation). These results fit predictions from life history theory, where increased effort early in life is predicted to trade with survival late in life.","EDWARD GREY INST FIELD ORNITHOL, DEPT ZOOL, OXFORD, ENGLAND",,,,,,,,59,56,58,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The mean position of 40 species of herbaceous plants along standing crop, phosphorus, nitrate, magnesium, potassium, pH, and percent organic content gradients was calculated based on data from 217 quadrats from lake and river shorelines in Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Ontario. Competitive performance was measured in an outdoor experiment in which species were grown together with a common phytometer, Lythrum salicaria (n = 5 replicates per species). The relative ability of each species to suppress the growth of the phytometer was used as a measure of relative competitive performance. This measure of competitive performance was significantly correlated with the mean position of species on the standing crop (r = 0.081; P < 0.0001), percent organic content (r = 0.71; P < 0.0001); phosphorus (r = 0.70; P < 0.0001), nitrate (r = 0.67; P < 0.0001), magnesium (r = 0.66; P < 0.0001), and potassium gradients (r = 0.61; P < 0.0001). When monocotyledons and dicotyledons were considered separately, the relationship between distribution along the macronutrient gradients and competitive performance was much stronger for monocotyledons. It is suggested that this may reflect a differential influence of disturbance on distribution.","UNIV OTTAWA, DEPT BIOL, OTTAWA, ON K1N 6N5, CANADA",,,,,,,,70,143,155,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1995,76,1,,,,,280,291,,10.2307/1940649,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QC872,WOS:A1995QC87200024,,,,,2021-09-21,

Perch, unlike roach and ruffe, undergoes dramatic ontogenetic diet shifts. The decrease in the abundance of perch along the productivity gradient may be due to competition from roach at its plankton-feeding stage and from ruffe at its benthic-macroinvertebrate-feeding stage. Previous studies of these three species have focused on the effects of roach on the other species. To further examine the competitive relationships among these species, we studied the effect of increasing the density of ruffe, while maintaining a relatively high, constant density of roach, on the diet and growth of perch. Food resources were also monitored during this 2-mo experiment, which was conducted in 10 enclosures in a pond in southern Sweden. Based on prior experiments we expected roach, an efficient planktivore, to reduce the biomass of zooplankton in all enclosures. Moreover, we expected that the increased density of benthic-feeding ruffe would force perch to increase its consumption of zooplankton, resulting in reduced growth. We found, as predicted, that the biomass of cladocerans and copepods decreased over time but was not affected by ruffe density. The biomass of the commonly consumed macroinvertebrates Sialis (a megalopteran), trichopterans, and ephemeropterans was lower in enclosures with ruffe than in enclosures without ruffe. Moreover, the biomass of Sialis decreased and that of chironomids and the clam Pisidium increased over time. High ruffe densities were related to an increased proportion of zooplankton in the diet of perch in August, but not in September. The diet of ruffe changed little along the ruffe gradient. Only the proportion of trichopterans (in August) and Pisidium (in September) in the diet of ruffe increased along the ruffe gradient. The growth of both perch and ruffe decreased with increasing ruffe density, whereas the growth of roach was constant. These data suggest that one reason perch decrease in abundance along a productivity gradient may be because they are competitively sandwiched between planktivore and benthivore specialists.",,"BERGMAN, E (corresponding author), LUND UNIV,DEPT ECOL,POB 65,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN.",,"Bergman, Eva/AAR-8368-2021; Bergman, Eva/R-8464-2016","Bergman, Eva/0000-0003-2220-1615; Bergman, Eva/0000-0003-2220-1615",,,,58,94,97,3,28,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1994,75,5,,,,,1233,1245,,10.2307/1937449,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NV662,WOS:A1994NV66200004,,,,,2021-09-21,

At One Tree Reef, in the southern Great Barrier Reef, deposit-feeding cerithiid gastropods, Rhinoclavis aspera (Linnaeus, 1758), R. fasciata (Bruguiere, 1792) and R. vertagus (linnaeus, 1758), are most abundant in an atypical environment, the coarse sandy sediments of a back-reef sandflat. Densities in the finer sediments of the lagoon are several orders of magnitude smaller than on the sandflat. In this study, these three species were enclosed al a range of naturally occurring densities in fine and coarse sediments to investigate their competitive interactions and the influence of sediment on their growth. The type of substratum in experimental enclosures influenced the growth of each species. Growth was greatest in the fine sediments from the lagoon, despite the fact that recruitment of each species had been shown to be greatest into the coarse sediments of the sandflat. Adult R. aspera significantly reduced the growth of juveniles of the three species, but adults of R. fasciata and R. vertagus had no significant effect on the growth of juveniles of R. aspera. These results are probably a function of the large disparity in the densities of the three species: R. aspera occur in densities an order of magnitude greater than the other two species and naturally occurring densities were used in the experiments. Competition for food or other expendable resources was distinguished from direct interference competition for space by including in our experiments treatments with dead shells occupying the same volume as live adults, but not utilizing expendable resources. Direct competition for space between adults and juveniles of R. aspera is unlikely to be important as a factor affecting the growth of juvenile R. aspera. Dead shells had no significant effect on the growth of juveniles in coarse or fine sediment. Direct competition for space may be more important for R. fasciata and R. vertagus because, in some cases, the presence of dead shells reduced the growth of juveniles. These experiments demonstrate how complex competitive interactions among Rhinoclavis spp. are modified by the type of sediment and vary with the particular combination of competitors. Research in rocky intertidal systems has similarly shown how the physical environment may modify the nature of biological interactions such as competition and predation. Our results are consistent with findings from temperate systems in that growth of Rhinoclavis spp. was limited by the availability of food or a related resource such as the availability of suitably sized particles of sediment for ingestion. This system differs, however, because deposit-feeding snails occur in their greatest densities in a habitat where they have the slowest rates of growth. Further work is needed to explain these patterns of distribution and abundance and why they differ from those typical of studies in temperate systems in the northern hemisphere.",,"SKILLETER, GA (corresponding author), UNIV SYDNEY,INST MARINE ECOL,ZOOL BLDG AO8,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.",,"Underwood, A J/B-1299-2008; Skilleter, Greg Alan/F-9250-2010","Skilleter, Greg Alan/0000-0002-4719-0409",,,,70,10,10,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size structure, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored over a 2-mo summer period. Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively during the whole experiment, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates. The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex interactions between the omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone.

A replicated common garden experiment demonstrated a genetic basis to morphological variation and two data sets provided correlative support for the hypothesis of selection by intraspecific competition. First, morphologies inferior in competitive ability were less abundant in two adult, postcompetition, samples than in juvenile, precompetition, samples from the same populations. Second, among eight populations, the relative frequency of different morphologies was correlated with the frequency of intraspecific competition observed in each population. The direction of selection by competition on the morphological variation present in this species conflicts with recent predictions based on surveys across diverse taxa, suggesting limitations to the inference of competition as a past selective agent on the basis of present day correlations among species.",,"YUND, PO (corresponding author), UNIV NEW ORLEANS, DEPT BIOL SCI, NEW ORLEANS, LA 70148 USA.",,,"Yund, Philip/0000-0003-0474-5205",,,,39,21,21,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,NOV,1991,45,7,,,,,1564,1573,,10.2307/2409779,,,10,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,GR184,WOS:A1991GR18400002,28564134,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

In both sized beans, the adult emergences of each species depended on total density of the initial larval densities of the two species and the ratio of the two densities. The emergence of one species was suppressed by the existence of the other species when the initial larval density per bean of the former species was less than that of the latter one. There were many cases in which both C. analis and C. phaseoli emerged from one bean in large beans, but such cases were quite rare in small beans. C. analis performed interference behavior only at late larval stages, whereas C. phaseoli was superior in exploitative competition all through their larval stages. These, combined with the niche segregation inside a bean, are thought to be the major factors of observed density- and frequency-dependent competition results. Based on the above experimental results, long-term competition results between the contest and scramble species were predicted.","UNIV TSUKUBA, INST BIOL SCI, SAKURA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN","TOQUENAGA, Y (corresponding author), UNIV TSUKUBA, GRAD SCH BIOL SCI, SAKURA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN.",,,,,,,21,10,12,0,7,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",0034-5466,,,RES POPUL ECOL,Res.

Both snails and tadpoles feed on periphytic algae and, thus, there should be a large potential for competitive interactions to occur between these two distantly related taxa. In a field experiment we examined the relative strength of competition between two closely related snail species, Lymnaea stagnalis and L. peregra, and between L. stagnalis and tadpoles of the common frog, Rana temporaria. Snail growth and egg production and tadpole size at and time to metamorphosis were determined. Effects on the common food source, periphyton, were monitored with the aid of artificial substrates. Periphyton dry weight was dramatically reduced in the presence of snails and/or tadpoles. There were no competitive effects on growth or egg production of the two snail species when they were coexisting. Mortality of L. peregra was high (95%) after reproduction, but independent of treatment. Growth of L. stagnalis was reduced only at the highest tadpole densities, whereas egg production was reduced both by intraspecific competition and by competition with tadpoles. Differences in egg production were retained after tadpole metamorphosis. Tadpole larval period increased, weight of metamorphosing frogs decreased and growth rate was reduced as a function of increasing tadpole density. However, contrary to expectation, snails had a positive effect on tadpole larval period, weight and growth rate. Further, in experimental containers without snails there was a dense growth of the filamentous green alga Cladophora sp. We suggest that the facilitative effects of snails on tadpoles are due to an indirect mutualistic mechanism, involving competition between food sources of different quality (microalgae and Cladophora sp.) and tadpoles being competitively dominant over snails for the preferred food source (microalgae). In the presence of tadpoles snails will be forced to feed on low-quality Cladophora, increasing nutrient turnover rates, which results in enhanced productivity of microalgae, increasing tadpole food resources. Thus, tadpoles have a negative effect on snails through resource depression, while snails facilitate tadpole growth through an indirect enhancement of food availability.",,"BRONMARK, C (corresponding author), UNIV LUND,DEPT ECOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,78,77,80,1,48,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,87,1,,,,,8,18,,10.1007/BF00323774,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR962,WOS:A1991FR96200002,28313346,,,,2021-09-21,

Livebearers have been used as models for understanding the evolution of life histories due to their wide diversity in these traits. Several different selective pressures, including population density, predation, and resource levels, can shape life-history traits. However, these selective pressures are usually considered independently in livebearers and we lack a clear understanding of how they interact in shaping life-history evolution. Furthermore, selective pressures such as interspecific competition are rarely considered as drivers of life-history evolution in poeciliids. Here we test the simultaneous effects of several potential selective pressures on life-history traits in the livebearing fish Poeciliopsis prolifica. We employ a multi-model inference approach. We focus on four known agents of selection: resource availability, stream velocity, population density, and interspecific competition, and their effect on four life-history traits: reproductive allocation, superfetation, number of embryos, and individual embryo size. We found that models with population density and interspecific competition alone were strongly supported in our data and, hence, indicated that these two factors are the most important selective agents for most life-history traits, except for embryo size. When population density and interspecific competition increase there is an increase in each of the three life-history traits (reproductive allocation, superfetation, and number of embryos). For individual embryo size, we found that all single-agent models were equivalent and it was unclear which selective agent best explained variation. We also found that models that included population density and interspecific competition as direct effects were better supported than those that included them as indirect effects through their influence on resource availability. Our study underscores the importance of interspecific competitive interactions on shaping life-history traits and suggests that these interactions should be considered in future life-history studies.","[Roth-Monzon, Andrea J.; Belk, Mark C.; Johnson, Jerald B.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Labs, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Zuniga-Vega, J.

If interspecific competition is ever important for phytophagous insects, it is likely to be observed in the insect guild that feeds in the phloem of trees. We tested for signals of interspecific competition in co-occurring species of pine sawyer beetles Monochamus Megerle (Coleoptera Cerambycidae), generally the largest phloemophagous insects in pines. We evaluated patterns of body size and its correlation with other life-history traits. By studying pine sawyer beetles in different areas (Northeast USA, Southeast USA and Portugal) we assessed the interaction with climate. As predicted under the hypothesis of interspecific competition, there were always clear size differences among coexisting species. As predicted if competition is asymmetric, smaller species were less abundant and emerged earlier than the larger species. In the larger and numerically dominant species, sexual size dimorphism was more pronounced and the sex ratio was skewed towards females. In the smaller species, males emerged earlier (protandry), whereas the larger species lacked differences in emergence time or displayed protogyny. Effects of climate only seem to have been expressed in the larger dominant species of each area, whereas the effects of competition in smaller species probably overshadow the effects of climate.","[Pimentel, Carla S.] Univ Lisbon, Forest Res Ctr CEF, Sch Agr, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ayres, Matthew P.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Pimentel, CS (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Forest Res Ctr CEF, Sch Agr, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal.",carlapimentel@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Pimentel, Carla S./P-8252-2014","Pimentel, Carla S./0000-0002-8364-8990","Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/AGR-CFL/098869/2008, SFRH/BPD/46995/2008, SFRH/BPD/101667/2014, DL 57/2016/CP1382/CT0009]; Forest Research Centre - FCT [UIDB/00239/2020]; Luso-American Development Foundation (FLAD) [PTDC/AGRCFL/098869/2008]","We are grateful to Janel diRiccari, Raquel Almeida and Alexandra Ricardo for help on laboratory work, and to Erich Vallery for trapping all pine sawyer beetles in Louisiana.

However, across a range of edaphic conditions the interactive effects of these drivers on complex plant communities remain unclear. For example, plant-soil feedback studies focus on soil trained by a single plant species. We developed a method to assess effects of plant-microbial interactions (PMI) on a complex plant community. We established mesocosms with 13 grassland species, grown individually or together, in overgrazed or restored soil, with or without soil microbial inoculum collected from a productive and diverse native grassland. We assessed biomass production as influenced by edaphic conditions, interspecific competition and PMI. Furthermore, we assessed potential influences of interspecific competition and edaphic conditions on strength and direction of PMI. Our results indicate PMI drives negative growth responses for graminoids while forbs experience positive growth responses. Generally, interspecific competition did not alter the magnitude or direction of PMI-mediated growth responses. Edaphic conditions altered the influence of soil microbial communities on individual plant growth while PMI facilitated plant evenness. In plant community mesocosms, PMI-associated benefits were observed in overgrazed soil. However, interspecific competition overwhelmed plant growth benefits associated with soil microbial communities when plant communities were grown in restored soil. In mesocosms containing dominant grass species, interspecific competition had negative effects on species coexistence, but both positive and negative PMI partially counterbalanced this influence on plant species evenness. Understanding these mechanisms may improve our capacity to manage diverse and productive grasslands by enabling prediction of plant community composition following disturbance and subsequent restoration.","[Li, Jiahuan; Guo, Lizhu; Wang, Kun; Deng, Bo] China Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, CN-100193 Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shu] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Wilson, Gail W.

Here we investigated how climatic drought intensity interacts with interspecific and intraspecific competition (or facilitation) in shaping mortality patterns across tree species ranges. To this aim, we used data from five European national forest inventories to perform logistic regression models based on individual tree mortality in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). We computed the relative importance of climatic drought intensity, basal area of conspecific and heterospecific trees (proxy of indirect intra- and interspecific competition or facilitation) and the effects of their interactions on mortality along the entire European latitudinal gradient of both species range. Increase in climatic drought intensity over the study period was associated with higher mortality rates in both species. Climatic drought intensity was the most important driver of beech mortality at almost all latitudes while Scots pine mortality was mainly driven by basal area. High conspecific basal area was associated with high mortality rates in both species while high heterospecific basal area was correlated with mortality rates that were high in Scots pine but low in beech. Overall, beech mortality was directly affected by climatic drought intensity while Scots pine mortality was indirectly affected by climatic drought intensity through interactions with basal area. Despite their different sensitivity to drought and basal area, the highest predicted mortality rates for both species were at the ecotone between the cool temperate and Mediterranean biomes, which can be explained by the combined effect of climatic drought intensity and competition. In the context of global warming, which is expected to be particularly strong in the Mediterranean biome, our results suggest that populations at the southern limit of species ranges may experience increased mortality rates in the near future.","[Archambeau, Juliette; Frejaville, Thibaut; Changenet, Alexandre; Garzon, Marta Benito] Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO INRA UMR 1202, F-33400 Pessac, France; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol, Fis & Quim Inorgan, Escuela Super Ciencias Experimentales & Tecnol, C Tulipan S-N, Mostoles 28933, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Grp Ecol & Restaurac Forestal, Edificio Ciencias,Campus Univ, Madrid 28805, Spain; [Ratcliffe, Sophia] Natl Biodivers Network Trust, Unit F,14-18 St Marys Gate, Nottingham NG1 1PF, England; [Ratcliffe, Sophia] Univ Leipzig, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Munoz Castaneda, Jose M.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Fis Teor Atom & Opt, Valladolid, Spain; [Lehtonen, Aleksi] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00710, Finland; [Dahlgren, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Archambeau, J (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO INRA UMR 1202, F-33400 Pessac, France.",juli.archambeau@orange.fr,"Castaneda, Jose M Munoz/D-8357-2018; , Benito Garzon/E-3622-2013; Zavala, Miguel A./H-3603-2015","Castaneda, Jose M Munoz/0000-0003-4263-0564; Archambeau, Juliette/0000-0003-0155-9538; Ratcliffe, Sophia/0000-0001-9284-7900; , Benito Garzon/0000-0002-3436-123X; Zavala, Miguel A./0000-0003-1456-0132; Lehtonen, Aleksi/0000-0003-1388-0388","Investments for the Future program IdEx Bordeaux [ANR-10-IDEX-03-02]; European UnionEuropean Commission [265171]; project FUNDIVER (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, MINECO, Spain) [CGL2015-69186-C2-2-R]","This study was funded by the Investments for the Future program IdEx Bordeaux (ANR-10-IDEX-03-02) and the FunDivEUROPE project was supported by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 265171.

Determining the nature and strength of these interactions is integral to understanding why some aliens are suppressed and others become highly invasive pests. For introduced terrestrial plants, seed and seedling interactions with native biota are crucial, because most nascent populations start from seed. Herein, we explored interactions between native generalist rodent and bird consumers and seeds of the invasive wild cucumber Echinocystis lobata by conducting seed-offering experiments in Poland. We also evaluated how interspecific competition from native plants and intraspecific competition from clustering of E. lobata seed (clustering resembling consumer seed caching) affected survival of seedlings and young plants. Native consumers interacted strongly with E. lobata seeds, with rodents removing 98% of seeds from ground locations and birds removing 24% of elevated seeds. Camera and live traps indicated that striped field mice Apodemus agrarius were the predominant rodent removing seeds. Camera traps and visual observations indicated that great tits Parus major and European jays Garrulus glandarius were the primary bird species removing elevated seeds. While some level of seed removal was likely attributable to seed predation, as indicated by seed coat remains, we also observed evidence that rodents may cache E. lobata seeds and Garrulus glandarius are known to cache and disperse seeds. Monitoring of seedlings indicated that increasing cover of native plants and clustering of E. lobata seedlings both reduced survival of seedlings and young plants due to inter- and intraspecific competition, respectively. Hence, caching by generalist consumers may disperse E. lobata seeds, which are heavy and lack dispersal adaptations, but such caching may also reduce individual seedling survival rates. Fully understanding invasion success of the E. lobata will require evaluating the net effects of generalist consumers on its recruitment and dispersal.","[Dylewski, Lukasz; Myczko, Lukasz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Dylewski, Lukasz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Dylewski, L (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.; Dylewski, L (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",ldylewski@man.poznan.pl,"Dylewski, Lukasz/AAM-4073-2021","Dylewski, Lukasz/0000-0002-1370-7625; Myczko, Lukasz/0000-0002-9305-2306","National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2018/28/T/NZ8/00264]","We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Our work sought to investigate how Pithecopus nordestinus tadpoles use water bodies at a Caatinga site and quantify how biotic and abiotic variables affects the occurrence of this tadpole species. We developed the study in the Protected Area Monumento Natural Grota do Angico/Sergipe, from December 2009 to November zoio and collected samples (408 plots) using a throw trap. In addition to the tadpoles collected in the plots, we quantified five variables (competitors, percentage of emergent and aquatic vegetation, predators and depth) and acquired variation of some data throughout the year (size, maximum depth and hydroperiod) for each water bodies. Tadpoles were found in lentic water bodies that fit their habits and that were also suitable for mating by their adult relates. Most of the studied environments maintained water throughout the period of the study, with P. nordestinus tadpoles being present from April to October, with abundance peak both in July and May. The absence of P. nordestinus tadpoles from February to March may allow the establishment of other species during this period, minimizing the competition between them. The larvae of P. nordestinus showed an aggregate distribution (I-d > 1) in most of the water bodies throughout the year, which may reduce the predation. This could explain the positive relation that was found between the tadpole abundance and the predator's presence. The aggregations were not intensified by the reduction of water bodies as the drought progressed. Among the ecological variables, the presence of competitors (other tadpoles) and the percentage of emergent and aquatic vegetation did not favor tadpole abundance. Interspecific competition can drastically reduce the amount of resources and damage metamorphosis in periods when there is still water regularity in the environments. Branching and abundant vegetation can damage the habit of P. nordestinus tadpoles, which are nektonic suspension-raspers, requiring that this portion of the space is unoccupied.","[Santos Caldas, Francis Luiz; Faria, Renato Gomes] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Biol, Lab Repteis & Anfibios, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil; [da Silva, Bruno Duarte; De-Carvalho, Crizanto Brito; Almeida Gomes, Fabiola Fonseca; dos Santos, Rafael Alves; Faria, Renato Gomes] Univ Fed Sergipe, Grad Program Ecol & Conservat, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil; [Santana, Daniel Oliveira; de Queiroga Cavalcanti, Lucas Barbosa] Univ Fed Paraiba, Grad Program Biol Sci Zool, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil","Caldas, FLS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Biol, Lab Repteis & Anfibios, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil.",francisluiz_bio@hotmail.com,,,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ecologia e Conservacao (PPEC) of the Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [150827/2018-0]; UFS; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"We thank Mr. Manuel Messias and his family for their support at MNGA.

This displacement has been predominantly linked to competition for resources and shelters. Similarly, P. semilunaris was displaced in many localities after introduction of N. melanostomus but the mechanisms of displacement are still not clear. Within the present study shelter competition laboratory studies were completed with P. semilunaris as resident fish before the introduction of either a sized matched P. semilunaris or N.melanostomus intruder. The fish competed for shelters which resembled a rock or plant. Time in shelter and accounts of direct aggression, indirect aggression and the guarding of shelter were also recorded for each fish. Shelter competitions showed P. semilunaris spent more time in plant shelters but N. melanostomus spent similar time periods in both shelter types. In intraspecific pairings, resident fish spent significantly more time in the shelters and exhibited significantly higher direct aggression and shelter guarding, especially for plant shelters. In interspecific pairings, there was no significant difference in the time spent in shelter by resident P. semilunaris and intruder N. melanostomus in either shelter type at day or night. However, in interspecific pairings, the intruder fish showed significantly higher levels of all aggression types. In intraspecific pairing, the concept of resident wins' was observed. However, in interspecific pairings, N. melanostomus was able to displace the resident fish. The higher aggression of N.melanostomus in shelter competition could account for greater invasive success and the reduction of P. semilunaris observed in the wild.","[Cartwright, Allison] Northern Reg Coll, Union St, Coleraine BT52 1QA, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Gebauer, Radek; Vanina, Tatyana; Stejskal, Vlastimil; Drozd, Borek] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, South Bohemian Res Ctr Aquaculture & Biodivers Hy, Zatisi 728-II, Vodnany 38925, Czech Republic","Cartwright, A (corresponding author), Northern Reg Coll, Union St, Coleraine BT52 1QA, Londonderry, North Ireland.",Allison.Cartwright@nrc.ac.uk,"Gebauer, Radek/G-6749-2015","Gebauer, Tatyana/0000-0002-4943-1923; Gebauer, Radek/0000-0003-0894-0577","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic-Project CENAKVA [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/01.0024]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic-Project CENAKVA II (NPU I program) [LO1205]; GAJU Project [060/2016/Z]","The study was financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic-Projects CENAKVA (No. CZ.1.05/2.1.00/01.0024), CENAKVA II (No. LO1205 under the NPU I program) and GAJU Project (No. 060/2016/Z).

Although this counterintuitive process-termed convergent agonistic character displacement-is supported by recent theoretical and empirical studies, the extent to which it drives spatial patterns of trait evolution at continental scales remains unclear. By modelling the variation in song structure of two ecologically similar species of Hypocnemis antbird across western Amazonia, we show that their territorial signals converge such that trait similarity peaks in the sympatric zone, where intense interspecific territoriality between these taxa has previously been demonstrated. We also use remote sensing data to show that signal convergence is not explained by environmental gradients and is thus unlikely to evolve by sensory drive (i.e. acoustic adaptation to the sound transmission properties of habitats). Our results suggest that agonistic character displacement driven by interspecific competition can generate spatial patterns opposite to those predicted by classic character displacement theory, and highlight the potential role of social selection in shaping geographical variation in signal phenotypes of ecological competitors.","[Kirschel, Alexander N.

However, small predators may also be obliged to avoid potentially agonistic encounters with larger predators due to interspecific competition and intraguild predation. We used occupancy models and indices of temporal overlap to evaluate whether the occurrence of prey species, ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) and top predators (puma Puma concolor and jaguar Panthera onca) influenced the habitat use and activity patterns of the northern tiger cat (Leopardus tigrinus) and jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) in a region of the semi-arid Caatinga biome in Bahia, northeastern Brazil. The occurrence of prey had a positive influence on the use of habitat by the small felids. The northern tiger cat was nocturnal-crepuscular and presented a high degree of temporal overlap with Spix's cavy (Galea spixii) and the rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris). The jaguarundi was diurnal, by contrast and overlapped temporally with the agouti (Dasyprocta nigriclunis). The occurrence of the ocelot did not influence the habitat or daily activity pattern of the jaguarundi, but presented a high degree of temporal overlap with the northern tiger cat, which adopted a strategy of spatial segregation to avoid direct contact with this dominant competitor. The top predators did not influence the spatiotemporal distribution of the small felids, indicating that their niches are segregated by dietary parameters related to differences in body size. Our results indicate that the availability of prey has a more profound influence on the spatiotemporal ecology of the small felids than the occurrence of the top predators, although the presence of the northern tiger cat appeared to be correlated negatively with that of the ocelot. We believe that environmental factors, such as the conservation status, size and isolation of native habitats, may have a fundamental influence on the strategies adopted by the northern tiger cat to mediate its coexistence with the ocelot.","[Dias, D.

Understanding the ecological niches of ticks is central to predicting the risk of tick-borne disease occurrence. Despite considerable advances in describing species distributions over the last two decades, disentangling the differences in habitat preferences from biotic interactions still remains among the main challenges. 2. In boundary areas along the rivers Danube, Morava and Dyje, separating the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, we studied ecological niche segregation between two European sympatric tick species, Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus, the abundances of which exhibited a negative spatial covariation. By applying ANCOVA analysis, we tested the effects of 19 climate, four moisture and two topographical variables derived through GIS on tick abundances. 3. Dermacentor reticulatus preferred warmer and wetter sites with greater diurnal and seasonal variation in temperature but with lower seasonality in precipitation than I. ricinus. 4. By adopting the static regression model based on a modified Lotka-Volterra model for interspecific competition, we examined the relative power of environmental variables to explain the negative relationship between tick log-abundances. We found that nonzero estimates of competition coefficients alpha(12) and alpha(21) were not eliminated even if we included seven principal components derived from considered environmental variables. 5. These results suggest that habitat conditions can shape abundance patterns of the studied ticks but their overall power to explain negative spatial covariation is low. This indicates that other critical variables were not considered in the analysis. An alternative explanation suggests that competitive interaction is not yet supported by direct field evidence obtained for these ticks.","[Tkadlec, Emil; Vaclavik, Tomas] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Tkadlec, Emil] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Vvi, Brno, Czech Republic; [Vaclavik, Tomas] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Kubelova, Michaela; Siroky, Pavel] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci, Fac Vet Hyg & Ecol, Dept Biol & Wildlife Dis, Brno, Czech Republic; [Siroky, Pavel] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci Brno, CEITEC Cent European Inst Technol, Brno, Czech Republic","Tkadlec, E (corresponding author), Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.",emil.tkadlec@upol.cz,"Tkadlec, Emil/A-6230-2014; VACLAVIK, Tomas/N-3163-2019; Vaclavik, Tomas/B-4668-2013","VACLAVIK, Tomas/0000-0002-1113-6320; Vaclavik, Tomas/0000-0002-1113-6320",Czech Health Research Council [16-33934A]; project CEITEC - Central European Institute of Technology from the European Regional Development Fund [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068]; Palacky University Olomouc [IGA_PrF_2017_15]; Brno city municipality,Study was supported by the Czech Health Research Council (project AZV no. 16-33934A).

Interspecific competition affects species fitness, community assemblages and structure, and the geographic distributions of species. Established dominance hierarchies among species mitigate the need for fighting and contribute to the realized niche for subordinate species. This is especially important for apex predators, many of which simultaneous contend with the costs of competition with more dominant species and the costs associated with human hunting and lethal management. Methods. Pumas are a widespread solitary felid heavily regulated through hunting to reduce conflicts with livestock and people. Across their range, pumas overlap with six apex predators (gray wolf, grizzly bear, American black bear, jaguar, coyote, maned wolf), two of which (gray wolf, grizzly bear) are currently expanding in North America following recovery efforts. We conducted a literature search to assess whether pumas were subordinate or dominant with sympatric apex predators, as well as with three felid mesocarnivores with similar ecology (ocelot, bobcat, Canada lynx). We also conducted an analysis of the spatial distributions of pumas and their dominant sympatric competitors to estimate in what part of their range, pumas are dominant versus subordinate. Results. We used 64 sources to assess dominance among pumas and other apex predators, and 13 sources to assess their relationships with felid mesocarnivores. Evidence suggested that wolves, grizzly bears, black bears, and jaguars are dominant over pumas, but that pumas are dominant over coyotes and maned wolves. Evidence suggested that pumas are also dominant over all three felid mesocarnivores with which they share range. More broadly, pumas are subordinate to at least one other apex carnivore in 10,799,252 (47.5%) of their 22,735,268 km(2) range across North and South America. Discussion. Subordinate pumas change their habitat use, suffer displacement at food sources, likely experience increased energetic demands from harassment, exhibit increased starvation, and are sometimes directly killed in competitive interactions with dominant competitors. Nevertheless, we lack research clearly linking the costs of competition to puma fitness. Further, we lack research that assesses the influence of human effects simultaneous with the negative effects of competition with other sympatric carnivores. Until the time that we understand whether competitive effects are additive with human management, or even potentially synergistic, we encourage caution among managers responsible for determining harvest limits for pumas and other subordinate, apex carnivores in areas where they are sympatric with dominant species. This may be especially important information for managers working in regions where wolves and brown bears are recolonizing and recovering, and historic competition scenarios among multiple apex predators are being realized.","[Elbroch, L.

We conducted surveys to determine densities of anole and other lizard species at both sites. We also carried out capture-mark-recapture of anoles to determine survival and frequency of caudal damage. In addition, we used video-recordings of focal anoles to determine rates of intraspecific and interspecific encounters and aggression, with higher rates suggesting greater competition, and determined direct predation when focal anoles were eaten. We found a significantly higher density of A. nebulosus on the island. Rates of intraspecific encounters and aggression were also significantly higher on the island. By comparison, interspecific encounters and aggression with other lizard species, as well as caudal autotomy, were higher on the mainland. We obtained few direct observations of predation, all of which were on the mainland, with no predation observed on the island, and survival was similar between populations. Although we were limited by the fact that we had only one island and one mainland population, our results on lizard density and encounter rates provide evidence for these populations lacking congeneric species that intraspecific competition is stronger on the island than on the mainland, whereas interspecific competition is stronger on the mainland.","[Siliceo-Cantero, Hector H.] Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Recursos Nat, Morelia 58000, Michoacan, Mexico; [Jaime Zuniga-Vega, J.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico; [Renton, Katherine; Garcia, Andres] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estn Biol Chamela, San Patricio 48980, Jalisco, Mexico","Siliceo-Cantero, HH (corresponding author), Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Recursos Nat, Morelia 58000, Michoacan, Mexico.",hehusic@gmail.com,,"Zuniga-Vega, Jose Jaime/0000-0002-9661-1521",,,,59,1,1,0,10,HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION & BIOLOGY,CORVALLIS,"C/O R BRUCE BURY, USGS FOREST & RANGELAND, CORVALLIS, OR 00000 USA",2151-0733,1931-7603,,HERPETOL CONSERV BIO,Herpetol.

Recent advances in animal personality research have established the ecological importance of the multidimensional behavioural volume occupied by individuals and by multispecies communities. Here, we examine the degree to which the multidimensional behavioural volume of a group predicts the outcome of both intra-and interspecific interactions. In particular, we test the hypothesis that a population of conspecifics will experience low intraspecific competition when the population occupies a large volume in behavioural space. We further hypothesize that populations of interacting species will exhibit greater interspecific competition when one or both species occupy large volumes in behavioural space. We evaluate these hypotheses by studying groups of katydids (Scudderia nymphs) and froghoppers (Philaenus spumarius), which compete for food and space on their shared host plant, Solidago canadensis. We found that individuals in single-species groups of katydids positioned themselves closer to one another, suggesting reduced competition, when groups occupied a large behavioural volume. When both species were placed together, we found that the survival of froghoppers was greatest when both froghoppers and katydids occupied a small volume in behavioural space, particularly at high froghopper densities. These results suggest that groups that occupy large behavioural volumes can have low intraspecific competition but high interspecific competition. Thus, behavioural hypervolumes appear to have ecological consequences at both the level of the population and the community and may help to predict the intensity of competition both within and across species.

We studied the spatial co-distribution of two top piscivorous bird species foraging on inland waters outside breeding season. We considered the hypothesis that goosanders, Mergus merganser, and great cormorants, Phalacrocorax carbo, avoid foraging in close proximity to each other. Data collected on five river-reservoir systems in the Western Carpathians (Poland and Slovakia) during two periods (2014-2015 and 2015-2016) showed that goosander numbers reduced significantly and their foraging areas changed when large flocks of cormorants arrived and began foraging. We also found that inter-flock distances were greatest between flocks of goosanders and cormorants, suggesting that the former species avoided the waters occupied by the latter. Distribution of flocks of both species was additionally determined by the location of foraging place in river-reservoir system, weather, and presence of other piscivorous birds (e.g. grebes) and raptors (e.g. eagles). Together with the results of research in adjacent Bohemia, this study suggests that competition between cormorants and goosanders may arise when bodies of water suitable for piscivorous foraging are scattered and limited in number, as in the mountainous areas of Central Europe.","[Kajtoch, Lukasz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland; [Leso, Peter] Tech Univ Zvolen, Dept Appl Zool & Wildlife Management, Fac Forestry, TG Masaryka 20, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; [Matysek, Marcin; Gwiazda, Robert] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, A Mickiewicza 33, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Kata, Miroslaw] Kosciuszki 157A, PL-32087 Bibice, Poland; [Gacek, Stanislaw] Panska 52, PL-43332 Pisarzowice, Poland; [Zontek, Czeslaw] Bielska 23, PL-43332 Pisarzowice, Poland; [Bisztyga, Andrzej] Sloneczna 1b, PL-32400 Myslenice, Poland","Kajtoch, L (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland.",lukasz.kajtoch@gmail.com,"Kajtoch, Lukasz/B-4236-2012","Kajtoch, Lukasz/0000-0001-7345-9400; Gwiazda, Robert/0000-0002-7619-6287","Institute of Systematics and Evolution of Animals, Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Nature Conservation Polish Academy of Sciences","We are grateful for valuable comments of two anonymous reviewers.

Overlapping of resource requirements between sympatric species can create interspecific competitive or facilitative effects on the foraging behaviour of herbivores. Brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are similar in size, morphology, feeding type and occupy the same habitats, but direct evidence of competition for resources between them is lacking. Both species are widespread and simultaneously pests and species of conservation concern in different parts of their range. We investigated dietary overlap of brown hares and European rabbits in pastures in relation to pasture management and hare and rabbit abundance. Grasses were the predominant component in both hare and rabbit diets with high overlap of plant species. Both rabbits and hares showed some selectivity for particular plants with evidence of consistent selection for Phleum spp. and relative avoidance of Poa spp. However, differences in the smaller components of hare and rabbit diet resulted in significant differences in diet overall. There was no evidence that higher relative density of one species led to dietary shifts but pasture management affected the diet of both species. Nutritional composition of diets of both species also differed between cattle and sheep pastures with higher fibre, ash and fat in the former. Our data provide no evidence of competitive exclusion between rabbits and hares on the basis of diet, but suggest that the effects of livestock on their respective diets may influence indirect competition in favour of rabbits over hares.","[Lush, L.; Wheeler, P.] Univ Hull, Ctr Environm & Marine Sci, Scarborough, England; [Ward, A.

Due to the resource allocation to defence, decreased feeding and higher stress, the costs of predator NCEs can be considerable. Therefore, the resistance to NCEs may be crucial for population growth and interspecific competition. We tested the resistance of Ponto-Caspian gammarids Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides to NCEs imposed by their predator, the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus. As D. villosus is often avoided by predators in the presence of alternative food, we hypothesised that it would bear lower behavioural and physiological costs of anti-predator responses. We tested gammarid feeding in short-time experiments (2-4 h) with food (chironomid larvae) located at various distances from the stony shelter (to enforce food searching, Experiment I) or in the direct gammarid proximity (no searching needed, Experiment II). Moreover, we checked the predator effect on gammarid growth in a 2-week Experiment III. Both gammarids exposed to predators reduced feeding efficiency outside the shelter (Experiment I). Contrary to our expectations, the response of D. villosus was stronger. When food was provided in their direct proximity (Experiment II), the feeding of both species was unaffected by predators, indicating that a shelter supplied with food can reduce predator NCEs. The growth of P. robustoides was reduced in the presence of predators (Experiment III), whereas that of D. villosus was unaffected. Although D. villosus has a more effective defence strategy than P. robustoides, it bears similar or even higher behavioural costs of NCEs. However, it exhibits the higher resistance to the long-term predator presence, sustaining its growth rate under such conditions. This may be one of the factors contributing to the great invasion success of D. villosus, currently taking place in European fresh waters.","[Jermacz, Lukasz; Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland","Jermacz, L (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Torun, Poland.",lukasjermacz@gmail.com,"Jermacz, Lukasz/B-8728-2017; Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013","Jermacz, Lukasz/0000-0001-9182-116X; Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240","grant of the National Science Centre, Poland [2016/21/B/NZ8/00418]","Our study was supported by the grant of the National Science Centre, Poland No. 2016/21/B/NZ8/00418.",,64,12,12,4,31,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 3,2017,12,8,,,,,,,e0182481,10.1371/journal.pone.0182481,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,FC5AR,WOS:000406853600120,28771578,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

Difficulties of measuring species' interactions in the field limit our comprehension of competition outcomes along disturbance gradients. Thus, information on how habitat degradation can destabilize food webs is scarce, hindering predictions regarding responses of multispecies systems to environmental changes. Seagrass ecosystems are undergoing degradation. We address effects of Posidonia oceanica coverage reduction on the trophic organization of a macroinvertebrate community in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), hypothesizing increased trophic generalism, niche overlap among species and thus competition and decreased community stability due to degraded conditions. Census data, isotopic analysis, and Bayesian mixing models were used to quantify the trophic niches of three abundant invertebrate species, and intra- and interspecific isotopic and resource-use similarity across locations differing in seagrass coverage. This allowed the computation of (1) competition strength, with respect to each other and remaining less abundant species and (2) habitat carrying capacity. To explore effects of the spatial scale on the interactions, we considered both individual locations and the entire study area (meadow scale). We observed that community stability and habitat carrying capacity decreased as P.oceanica coverage declined, whereas niche width, similarity of resource use and interspecific competition strength between species increased. Competition was stronger, and stability lower, at the meadow scale than at the location scale. Indirect effects of competition and the spatial compartmentalization of species interactions increased stability. Results emphasized the importance of trophic niche modifications for understanding effects of habitat loss on biodiversity persistence. Calculation of competition coefficients based on isotopic distances is a promising tool for describing competitive interactions in real communities, potentially extendible to any subset of ecological niche axes for which specimens' positions and pairwise distances can be obtained.","[Calizza, Edoardo; Costantini, Maria Letizia; Careddu, Giulio; Rossi, Loreto] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Rome, Italy; [Calizza, Edoardo; Costantini, Maria Letizia; Rossi, Loreto] CoNISMa, Rome, Italy","Calizza, E (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Rome, Italy.",edoardo.calizza@uniroma1.it,,"Careddu, Giulio/0000-0002-7553-9161",Sapienza Univerisyt of Rome; PNRA,Sapienza Univerisyt of Rome and PNRA,,79,26,26,2,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Populations of both species declined about 50% from 2010 to 2011 (adults from 47 to 21 for T. a. sinensis; 37 to 20 for T. angustipennis), but T. a. sinensis oviposited 10 oothecae and T. angustipennis only one in 2011. Tenodera a. sinensis was more abundant in the study site in both years, hatched earlier, and matured and oviposited earlier than T. angustipennis. Fewer females of both species survived to maturity in 2011 than in 2010, possibly indicating a reduction in prey or habitat suitability in 2011. We suggest that T. angustipennis will always be at a disadvantage as a result of its smaller body size, because of interspecific predation (and potentially competition) from its congener, lower clutch size, and susceptibility to egg parasitism. Further, environmental variability across field habitats and years profoundly affects populations of both species in successional old fields.","[Gall, Cory A.; Rose, Robert K.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Gall, Cory A.] Washington State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Hurd, Lawrence E.] Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA","Hurd, LE (corresponding author), Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",cgall@vetmed.wsu.edu; brose@odu.edu; hurdl@wlu.edu,,,Old Dominion University Department of Biological Sciences; Washington and Lee University; John T.

Testing multiple hypotheses about sleeping site selection permits examination of the relative strength of distinct ecological factors and expands our ability to understand how selection pressures influence primate sleeping behavior. Here we examine how avoidance of biting insects, thermoregulation, foraging efficiency, tree stability, and interspecific competition influence selection of sleeping sites by proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) in Indonesian Borneo. We collected data on relative insect abundance, temperature, rainfall, food availability, group size, sleeping site location, and presence of other primates for 12 mo. Using formal model comparison and information criteria, we analyzed the relative importance of these ecological factors in determining one aspect of sleeping site location: distance from the river. Our models supported the avoidance of biting insects and the foraging efficiency hypotheses. Proboscis monkeys slept further inland on nights when the abundance of sandflies was high along the river, and when less food was available along the river. Many studies suggest that primates select sleeping trees and locations to reduce predation risk; our study indicates that additional factors may also be important in determining sleeping site selection.","[Feilen, Katie L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Feilen, Katie L.] Disneys Anim Programs, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Program Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Feilen, KL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Feilen, KL (corresponding author), Disneys Anim Programs, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 USA.",katie.l.feilen@disney.com,,,"U.S. Fulbright Student Fellowship; Boren Fellowship; University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System; Davis Department of Anthropology; Primate Conservation, Inc.","We thank the Indonesian government, the State Ministry of Research and Technology (RISTEK), and the mayor of Sungai Tolak for giving us permission to conduct this research.

This review evaluates this question, necessary for a general understanding of the evolution of cooperation. First, we outline three advantages of cooperation relative to noncooperation (acquisition of otherwise inaccessible goods and services, more efficient acquisition of resources, and buffering against variability), and predict when individuals should cooperate with a conspecific versus a heterospecific partner to obtain these advantages. Second, we highlight five axes along which heterospecific and conspecific partners may differ: relatedness and fitness feedbacks, competition and resource use, resource-generation abilities, relative evolutionary rates, and asymmetric strategy sets and outside options. Along all of these axes, certain asymmetries between partners are more common in, but not exclusive to, cooperation between species, especially complementary resource use and production. We conclude that cooperation within and between species share many fundamental qualities, and that differences between the two systems are explained by the various asymmetries between partners. Consideration of the parallels between intra- and interspecific cooperation facilitates application of well-studied topics in one system to the other, such as direct benefits within species and kin-selected cooperation between species, generating promising directions for future research.","[Barker, Jessica L.; Bronstein, Judith L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Barker, Jessica L.] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Friesen, Maren L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jones, Emily I.] Rice Univ, Dept BioSci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Reeve, H.

Since C. novemnotata's decline, the invasive Harmonia axyridis Pallas has become dominant in North America. This study investigated whether H. axyridis has the potential to impede the recovery of C. novemnotata populations. To determine how H. axyridis interacts with C. novemnotata via intraguild predation and competition for prey, we paired first-instar C. novemnotata with first-instar H. axyridis at low and high densities of pea aphid. Coccinella novemnotata survival when paired interspecifically was significantly lower than H. axyridis survival at both aphid densities. Both species had similar weights at eclosion across aphid densities; however, H. axyridis developed faster than C. novemnotata. To examine the effect of larval size on intraguild interactions, we conducted a second experiment where we varied the C. novemnotata and H. axyridis instar in our pairings. Coccinella novemnotata survival and final weight increased when paired with younger H. axyridis larvae. The percentage survival of C. novemnotata in interspecific treatments, at the low aphid density, was lower than for same aged C. novemnotata reared conspecifically, except for pairs initiated with C. novemnotata larvae that were two in-stars more advanced than H. axyridis larvae. These results suggest that intraguild predation and competition for prey by H. axyridis have the potential to affect the recovery of C. novemnotata populations negatively.","[Ducatti, Rafael Dal Bosco] Fed Univ Fronteira UFFS, Dept Agron, Bairro Fronteira, Rod SC 484 Km 02, BR-89801001 Chapec o, SC, Brazil; [Ducatti, Rafael Dal Bosco; Ugine, Todd A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 169 Helios Circle, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Ugine, TA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 169 Helios Circle, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",rafaelducatti1007@gmail.com; tau2@cornell.edu; jel27@cornell.edu,"Dal Bosco Ducatti, Rafael/M-1573-2018","Dal Bosco Ducatti, Rafael/0000-0001-8916-6557",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We would like to thank the Lost Ladybug Project participants for helping us to collect rare species to start our colonies, our undergraduate student assistants for technical assistance, and the National Science Foundation for project and salary support.",,41,5,5,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

Using North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and Audubon Christmas Bird Count (CBC) data, we investigated 4 hypotheses that may explain this decline, including: (1) interspecific competition with native Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) and nonnative European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris); (2) predation by Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii) and Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus); (3) climate change; and (4) changes in forested area within their range. In analyses of both the breeding and overwintering periods, our results indicated a role of increased accipiter populations in driving Red-headed Woodpecker declines through increased predation. We also found evidence for significant effects of warmer winter temperatures and increased forest cover, both directly and indirectly through their effects on enhancing accipiter populations. In contrast, our results failed to support the hypothesis that interspecific competition with either Red-bellied Woodpeckers or European Starlings has played a role in Red-headed Woodpecker declines. Despite considerable evidence for nest-site competition and aggression between Red-headed Woodpeckers and both Red-bellied Woodpeckers and European Starlings, these interactions do not appear to be limiting Red-headed Woodpecker populations.","[Koenig, Walter D.; Rodewald, Paul G.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Koenig, Walter D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Walters, Eric L.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Koenig, WD (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.; Koenig, WD (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",wdk4@cornell.edu,"Walters, Eric L./C-1685-2008","Walters, Eric L./0000-0002-9414-5758","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1455900]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1455900, 1455881] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Support for our work was provided by the National Science Foundation, most recently by grant IOS-1455900.

T. absoluta is an important pest of tomato crops worldwide, and its management could be improved by understanding the competitive interactions and potential coexistence between these two parasitoids. Firstly, a 15-min fixed time laboratory test evaluated the host-searching ability of adult D. phthorimaeae and P. dignus wasps on T. absoluta larvae. Secondly, D. phthorimaeae host discrimination against endoparasitized and non-endoparasitized hosts by P. dignus, at different adult female ages, was experimentally examined. D. phthorimaeae wasps spent significantly more time in general searching in the presence of its competitor than in its absence, but, parasitism was only effective by P. dignus. Older D. phthorimaeae wasps discriminated significantly less than young wasps between T. absoluta larvae parasitized and unparasitized by P. dignus, and an interaction took place by non-concurrent host-feeding. Intra-guild predation of P. dignus larvae by D. phthorimaeae female feeding behaviour might have a minor effect in this system. Results are discussed in the context of literature supporting diverse evidence of coexistence in other parasitoid-host systems, with implications for T. absoluta biological control.","[Savino, V.; Coviella, C.

Although previous experiments have shown that OA can negatively affect the fitness of reef corals, these have not included the long-term effects of competition for space on coral growth rates. Our multispecies year-long study subjected reef-building corals from the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) to competitive interactions under present-day ocean pH (pH 8.1) and predicted end-of-century ocean pH (pH 7.6). Results showed coral growth is significantly impeded by OA under intraspecific competition for five out of six study species. Reduced growth from OA, however, is negligible when growth is already suppressed in the presence of interspecific competition. Using a spatial competition model, our analysis indicates shifts in the competitive hierarchy and a decrease in overall coral cover under lowered pH. Collectively, our case study demonstrates how modified competitive performance under increasing OA will in all likelihood change the composition, structure and functionality of reef coral communities.","[Horwitz, Rael; Fine, Maoz] Bar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Horwitz, Rael; Fine, Maoz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; [Hoogenboom, Mia O.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hoogenboom, Mia O.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Horwitz, R (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.; Horwitz, R (corresponding author), Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, IL-88103 Elat, Israel.",horwitzrael@gmail.com,"Fine, Maoz/S-5582-2019; Hoogenboom, Mia O/D-3664-2012","Fine, Maoz/0000-0003-4911-4562; Hoogenboom, Mia O/0000-0003-3709-6344",Israel Science Foundation GrantIsrael Science Foundation,"We thank Robert van Woesik, Amatzia Genin, John Pandolfi, and Thomas Krueger for comments that improved earlier versions of this manuscript.

Therefore, we investigated the density of the two weevils temporally, spatially, and trophically (plant parts of A. altissima) at Lingwu farm and Haojiaqiao town, Lingwu city, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. No differences were found in temporal Levin's niche breath index values ranging from 3.74 to 3.95 and temporal Pianka's niche overlap values (0.98-0.99).

Despite a rapid expansion in the use of mathematical graph theory to describe trophic relations, network approaches have rarely been used to study interactions within predator assemblages. Assemblages of diurnal raptors are subject to substantial intra- and interspecific competition. Here we used the novel approach of applying analyzes based on network topology to species-specific data on the stable isotopes C-13 and N-15 in feathers to evaluate patterns of relative resource utilization within a guild of diurnal raptors in northern Sweden. Our guild consisted of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), the gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus). We found a modular trophic interaction structure within the guild, but the interactions were less nested than expected by chance. These results suggest low redundancy and hence a strong ecological importance of individual species. Our data also suggested that species were less connected through intra-guild interactions than expected by chance. We interpret our results as a convergence on specific isotope niches, and that body size and different hunting behaviour may mediate competition within these niches. We finally highlight that generalist predators could be ecologically important by linking specialist predator species with disparate dietary niches.","[Dalerum, F.] Univ Oviedo, Res Unit Biodivers UO CSIC PA, Mieres Campus, Mieres 33600, Spain; [Dalerum, F.] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Dalerum, F.; Hellstrom, P.; Nystrom, J.; Ekenstedt, J.; Angerbjorn, A.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hellstrom, P.] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Environm Res & Monitoring, Frescativagen 40, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Miranda, M.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Ctr African Ecol, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Miranda, M.] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo 33203, Spain","Dalerum, F (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Res Unit Biodivers UO CSIC PA, Mieres Campus, Mieres 33600, Spain.; Dalerum, F (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.; Dalerum, F (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",dalerumjohan@uniovi.es,"Dalerum, Fredrik/M-6068-2017; Angerbjorn, Anders/AAX-3670-2021; Angerbjorn, Anders/A-5982-2013","Dalerum, Fredrik/0000-0001-9737-8242; Miranda, Maria/0000-0002-4236-7455; Hellstrom, Peter/0000-0001-5124-2534; Angerbjorn, Anders/0000-0001-5535-9086",,,,65,4,4,0,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2016,182,2,,,,,511,518,,10.1007/s00442-016-3658-6,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DW5FS,WOS:000383669300017,27209296,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

It is known that interspecific interactions influence the biofilm phenotype of bacteria; a phenotype that is central to the fitness of bacteria. However, the underlying role of fundamental ecological factors, specifically coexistence and phylogenetic history, in biofilm formation remains unclear. This study examines how social interactions affect biofilm formation in multi-species co-cultures from five diverse environments. We found prevalence of increased biofilm formation among co-cultured bacteria that have coexisted in their original environment. Conversely, when randomly co-culturing bacteria across these five consortia, we found less biofilm induction and a prevalence of biofilm reduction. Reduction in biofilm formation was even more predominant when co-culturing bacteria from environments where long-term coexistence was unlikely to have occurred. Phylogenetic diversity was not found to be a strong underlying factor but a relation between biofilm induction and phylogenetic history was found. The data indicates that biofilm reduction is typically correlated with an increase in planktonic cell numbers, thus implying a behavioral response rather than mere growth competition. Our findings suggest that an increase in biofilm formation is a common adaptive response to long-term coexistence.","[Madsen, Jonas S.; Roder, Henriette L.; Russel, Jakob; Burmolle, Mette; Sorensen, Soren J.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Sorensen, Helle] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Sorensen, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",sjs@bio.ku.dk,"Russel, Jakob/J-8026-2019; Burmolle, Mette/L-8002-2014; Sorensen, Soren Johannes/N-2120-2019; Sorensen, Soren J/J-5015-2014","Russel, Jakob/0000-0002-0565-3161; Burmolle, Mette/0000-0003-1870-632X; Sorensen, Soren Johannes/0000-0001-6227-9906; Sorensen, Soren J/0000-0001-6227-9906; Madsen, Jonas Stenlokke/0000-0003-4830-1796; Roeder, Henriette Lyng/0000-0002-0965-6837",Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [11106571]; Danish Innovation Consortium [11804520]; Villum Fonden [00010098] Funding Source: researchfish,"We would like to thank Anette Hordum Loth, Karin Vestberg, and Maria Nielsen for excellent assistance with laboratory work.

Through stable isotopes of carbon and a Bayesian mixing model, we analyze time-successive (nearly contemporaneous), late Miocene carnivoran populations from two fossil sites (Batallones-1 and Batallones-3) from central Spain. Stable isotopes of carbon in tooth enamel provide a reliable and direct methodology to track ancient diets. These two carnivoran-dominated fossil sites display differences in the composition and abundance of the carnivoran species, with some species present at both sites and some present only at one site. This disparity has been interpreted as the consequence of habitat differences between Batallones-1, the older site, and Batallones-3, the younger site. However, carbon isotope values of carnivore and herbivore tooth enamel suggest a common habitat of C-3 woodland originally present at both sites. The differences in the carnivoran faunas rather may be the consequence of the dynamics of species entrance and exit from the Madrid Basin during the time elapsed between Batallones-1 and Batallones-3 and changes in population densities due to biotic factors. We infer higher levels of interspecific competition in Batallones-3 than in Batallones-1 because of the larger number of similar-sized, sympatric predators; the clear overlap in their delta C-13 values (except for the amphicyonid Magericyon anceps); and similarity of their preferred prey: the hipparionine horses. Finally, carbon stable isotopic composition of Indarctos arctoides teeth implies that this ursid was a carnivorous omnivore rather than a herbivorous omnivore. This work demonstrates the insights that stable isotopes can provide in characterizing the feeding ecology and trophic interactions of ancient carnivoran taxa.","[Soledad Domingo, M.; Domingo, Laura; Valenciano, Alberto] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Geol, Dept Paleontol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Domingo, Laura; Valenciano, Alberto] UCM, CSIC, Inst Geociencias IGEO, Dept Geol Sedimentaria & Cambio Medioambiental, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Domingo, Laura] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Abella, Juan] Univ Estatal Peninsula Santa Elena, Inst Invest Cient & Desarrollo Tecnol INCYT UPSE, Santa Elena 240210, Ecuador; [Abella, Juan] Inst Catala Paleontol Miquel Crusafont, Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Badgley, Catherine] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Morales, Jorge] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Paleobiol, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Domingo, MS (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Geol, Dept Paleontol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",soldomingo@gmail.com,"Abella, Juan/AAB-1040-2020; Domingo, Laura/J-6549-2012; Domingo, M.

However, intraguild competitive interactions remain largely unexplored in situations where the temporal dynamics of food resources is pronounced, and lynx populations in the south of their distribution may be negatively affected by interspecific competition with other carnivores. In this paper, we used spectral analysis of fur harvest data collected at the state (US) and province (Canada) level to explore the spatial gradient of cyclic dynamics in lynx. Although some patterns were consistent with the 'diet specialization' hypothesis, we found that temporal variance of cycling propensity peaked at mid-latitudes, where transient, non-cyclic periods, coexisted with regular 10-year cycles. In these mid-latitude zones, non-cyclic periods did not coincide with loss of snowshoe hare cycling as demonstrated by historical records, and were not more frequent in recent decades as could be expected under a 'climatic forcing' scenario. Instead, we show that non-cyclic periods tended to coincide with periods of high coyote (Canis latrans) abundance and periods when coyotes apparently tracked snowshoe hare abundance as suggested by significant 10-year cycles lagging one or two years behind hare peaks. We used landscape-scale (trapline) fur harvest returns from five provinces in Canada to further probe the importance of interspecific competition in Canada lynx population dynamics. Accounting for coyote distribution and abundance did not bring additional explanatory and predictive power to models based solely on environmental and autecological predictors, suggesting that competition with coyote is not a force driving population abundance and cyclicity among lynx. We discuss the possible factors behind the apparent lack of consistency across spatial scales and recommend that further studies examine species interactions at a smaller (local) scale.","[Guillaumet, A.; Thornton, D.; Murray, D.

However, demographic comparisons of the effects of these interactions on introduced versus co-occurring, related native species are uncommon. We asked: (1) does plant competition, insect herbivory, or their combination reduce population growth rate, log lambda, of the Eurasian thistle Cirsium vulgare sufficiently to explain its limited invasiveness in western tallgrass prairie; and (2) how do the effects of these interactions compare to those for C. altissimum, its co-occurring, synchronously- flowering native congener? We developed integral projection models (IPMs) to estimate log lambda for both species, using parameter estimates from field experiments. Our models predicted that the growth potential (growth rate at minimal competition and herbivory) for the introduced thistle (log lambda = 3.5 (2.5, 4.6)) was twice as large as for the native thistle (log lambda = 1.6 (0.4, 3.1)); however, a high level of competition and ambient insect herbivory together reduced log k to similar values for both thistle species (C. vulgare: log lambda = -1.3 (-2.4, -0.3) vs C. altissimum: log lambda = -0.9 (-1.4, -0.3)). This suggests that the introduced thistle was more affected by competition and insect herbivory. For the introduced thistle, neither competition nor insect herbivory alone led to negative log k. In contrast, for the native thistle, high competition alone also led to negative population growth (log lambda = -0.8, percentile limits do not overlap with zero). Ambient herbivory alone prevented the spread for both thistle species (percentile limits include zero). Overall, the results show that interspecific competition followed by ambient levels of insect herbivory strongly constrained log k for both thistles, limiting C. vulgare invasiveness and C. altissimum abundance. The outcome highlights the importance of synergy between the two biological interactions in limiting plant population growth. Improved understanding of mechanisms limiting log k for weedy plants enhances our ability to predict when biotic resistance will contribute to invasive plant species management.","[Tenhumberg, Brigitte; Suwa, Tomomi; Russell, F.

We first investigated regional-scale determinants by contrasting allopatric versus sympatric patterns in five distinct habitat types. We next focused on a single habitat used by both species, the coastal sand dunes. Dune quadrats were established along the Moroccan coast and completed by a quadrat in the nearest distinct landscape habitat. Poisson regressions were used to model Galerida counts together with ecological predictors as concerns the climate, topography, vegetation structure and soil granulometry. At the local scale, both species preferred grey dunes over white sand dunes, and both were negatively affected by the abundance of the congeneric species in the dune. However, we found that G. theklae tended to replace G. cristata in more arid sand dunes, even if the transition was not strictly clinal. Instead, the transition occurred when the surrounding landscape changed from coastal wetlands to bathas (grasslands with shrubs), highlighting the importance of habitat composition at the landscape scale. The fact that G. cristata used bathas in allopatry, but not in sympatry, suggested that the competitive environment contributed to determine sand dune occupancy. We suggest that landscape-level effects may be pivotal in explaining species distribution not only at the local scale, by affecting the pool of potential immigrants, but also at the regional scale, by contributing to species' range limit","[Guillaumet, Alban] EPHE, CEFE CNRS UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Guillaumet, Alban] PIPES, Res Off, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Leotard, Guillaume] CEFE CNRS, Dept Interact Ecol & Soc, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Guillaumet, A (corresponding author), EPHE, CEFE CNRS UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",albang@hawaii.edu,,,GDRI BIOM; Roger Prodon,"Roger Prodon and Finn Kjellberg supported the project, which was partly financed by GDRI BIOM, Roger Prodon suggested making the paired landscape quadrat, and Paola Laiolo kindly answered our questions concerning her previous work on ecological aspects of coexistence in Galerida larks.

For example, in North America, grey wolves Canis lupus are known to kill coyotes Canis latrans, and coyotes, in turn, may kill foxes Vulpes spp., but the spatial effects of these competitive interactions at large scales are unknown. Here, we analyse fur return data across eight jurisdictions in North America to test whether the presence or absence of wolves has caused a continent-wide shift in coyote and red fox Vulpes vulpes density. Our results support the existence of a continental scale cascade whereby coyotes outnumber red foxes in areas where wolves have been extirpated by humans, whereas red foxes outnumber coyotes in areas where wolves are present. However, for a distance of up to 200km on the edge of wolf distribution, there is a transition zone where the effects of top-down control are weakened, possibly due to the rapid dispersal and reinvasion capabilities of coyotes into areas where wolves are sporadically distributed or at low densities. Our results have implications for understanding how the restoration of wolf populations across North America could potentially affect co-occurring predators and prey. We conclude that large carnivores may need to occupy large continuous areas to facilitate among-carnivore cascades and that studies of small areas may not be indicative of the effects of top-down mesopredator control.","[Newsome, Thomas M.; Ripple, William J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Newsome, TM (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",tnew5216@uni.sydney.edu.au,"Ripple, William/ABE-9353-2020","Newsome, Thomas/0000-0003-3457-3256",Australian-American Fulbright Commission,"The manuscript was greatly improved after reviews by Taal Levi, Chris Dickman and Aaron Wirsing.

However, invasive species tend to exploit anthropogenic habitats that are inefficiently used by natives such as urban environments. Focusing on the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri), one of the most invasive birds worldwide, we combined observations of interspecific aggressions, species-specific cavity-nest preferences and the spatial distribution of the native cavity-nesting vertebrate community to determine the invasion process as well as its potential impacts on native species in a Mediterranean city. Our results support the competition hypothesis, suggesting that ring-necked parakeets are outcompeting native species sharing nest-site preferences. Parakeets initiated and won most interspecific aggressions, which were directed towards competitors but also towards predators. This behaviour could explain the spatial arrangement of natives, with most bird species breeding close to parakeets possibly to take advantage of their effective antipredatory behaviour. However, temporal and spatial patterns of segregation suggest that a threatened bat species is negatively affected by parakeets. This demonstrates that common species gain benefits and threatened ones (in this study, a bat and possibly a falcon) lose nest sites due to invaders. Therefore, the conservation status of the native species that pay the costs of competition with invaders should be considered. This scenario of winners and losers may, however, shift towards more losers if the ring-necked parakeet population continues to grow, thus requiring close monitoring and control/eradication programs to avoid further impacts.","[Hernandez-Brito, Dailos; Carrete, Martina; Tella, Jose L.] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Carrete, Martina] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Seville, Spain; [Popa-Lisseanu, Ana G.] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Berlin, Germany; [Ibanez, Carlos] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Carrete, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",mcarrete@upo.es,"Ibanez, Carlos/H-7577-2015; Hernandez-Brito, Dailos/AAR-3234-2021; Carrete, Martina/A-6376-2009; Tella, Jose L/I-3707-2015; Carrete, Martina/D-2618-2017","Ibanez, Carlos/0000-0003-1181-7641; Hernandez-Brito, Dailos/0000-0002-5203-3512; Carrete, Martina/0000-0002-0491-2950; Tella, Jose L/0000-0002-3038-7424; Chiaradia, Andre/0000-0002-6178-4211",Fundacion Repsol and Project of Excellence from the Junta de Andalucia [P08-RNM-4014]; COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) action ParrotNet; project EBD-Severo Ochoa [SEV-2012-0262];  [RYC-2009-04860],"MC (RYC-2009-04860) and JLT were supported by Fundacion Repsol and Project of Excellence from the Junta de Andalucia P08-RNM-4014.

We found no difference between habitat use or prey consumption between species in constant depth aquaria, and no effect of intra- or interspecifics on their behaviors. In variable depth aquaria, L. proximus occupied significantly shallower habitat when compared with L. f. rufus; in the former this difference only occurred between conspecific treatments. Field collections confirmed that L. proximus occupied shallower habitats than L. f. rufus. In field mesocosms, L. proximus displayed higher dispersal rates than L. f. rufus. These species also do not appear food limited in the field, suggesting that adult competition for food is unlikely. L. f. rufus and L. proximus exhibit different habitat use and dispersal responses, but this does not seem to be in response to intra- or interspecific competitive interactions.","[Pitcher, K.

Its numbers have declined by 90% since 1999, with their current distribution occupying less than 1% of their former Australian range. Woylies are known to be infected with three different trypanosomes (Trypanosoma vegrandis, Trypanosoma copemani and Trypanosoma sp. H25) and two different strains of T. copemani that vary in virulence. However, the role that these haemoparasites have played during the recent decline of their host is unclear and is part of ongoing investigation. Methods: Woylies were sampled from five locations in southern Western Australia, including two neighbouring indigenous populations, two enclosed (fenced) populations and a captive colony. PCR was used to individually identify the three different trypanosomes from blood and tissues of the host, and to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of trypanosome infections. Results: The spatial pattern of trypanosome infection varied among the five study sites, with a greater proportion of woylies from the Perup indigenous population being infected with T. copemani than from the neighbouring Kingston indigenous population. For an established infection, T. copemani detection was temporally inconsistent. The more virulent strain of T. copemani appeared to regress at a faster rate than the less virulent strain, with the infection possibly transitioning from the acute to chronic phase. Interspecific competition may also exist between T. copemani and T. vegrandis, where an existing T. vegrandis infection may moderate the sequential establishment of the more virulent T. copemani. Conclusion: In this study, we provide a possible temporal connection implicating T. copemani as the disease agent linked with the recent decline of the Kingston indigenous woylie population within the Upper Warren region of Western Australia. The chronic association of trypanosomes with the internal organs of its host may be potentially pathogenic and adversely affect their long term fitness and coordination, making the woylie more susceptible to predation.","[Thompson, Craig K.; Godfrey, Stephanie S.; Thompson, R.

We examined interactions between an omnivorous shrimp and a grazing mayfly, two co-dominant taxa found in Puerto Rican headwater streams, to assess how predator presence may influence mayfly resource use and instantaneous growth in a tropical rainforest ecosystem. We conducted a series of behavioral and growth experiments to determine the effects of the freshwater shrimp, Xiphocaris elongata, on the growth rate and resource selection of mayfly nymphs in the family Leptophlebiidae. For resource choice assessments, we conducted a series of five day laboratory experiments where mayflies were given access to two resource substrate choices (cobble vs. leaves) in the presence or absence of shrimp. To assess for the effects of shrimp on mayfly fitness, we measured mayfly growth in laboratory aquaria after five days using four treatments (cobble, leaves, cobble + leaves, no resource) in the presence or absence of shrimp. In resource choice experiments, mayflies showed preference for cobble over leaf substrata (p<0.05) regardless of the presence of shrimps, however, the preference for cobble was significantly greater when shrimp were present in the leaf habitat. In growth experiments, there were no statistical differences in mayfly growth in the presence or absence of shrimp (p=0.07). However, we measured increased mayfly nymph growth in the absence of predators and when both cobble and leaves were available. Our results suggest that interspecific interactions between these taxa could potentially influence organic matter resource dynamics (e.g., leaf litter processing and export) in Puerto Rican streams.","[Macias, Nicholas A.] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Biol Sci, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Macias, Nicholas A.; Colon-Gaud, Checo; Duggins, Jonathan W.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Duggins, Jonathan W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Math & Stat, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Ramirez, Alonso] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Environm Sci, San Juan, PR 00931 USA","Macias, NA (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Sacramento, Biol Sci, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",nm01510@georgiasouthern.edu; jccolongaud@georgiasouthern.edu; dugginsj@uncw.edu; aramirez@ramirezlab.net,,,"Research Experiences for Undergraduates Summer Internship in Ecology and Evolution (National Science Foundation Division of Biological Infrastructure) [0552567]; Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [NSF DBI-0905345]; Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus; El Verde Field Station in the LUQ LTER; Science Educational Equity Program at California State University Sacramento","This study was in part funded by a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Summer Internship in Ecology and Evolution awarded to N.

Because there have been limited studies to determine how snakes regulate prey populations, and because Kingsnake declines may result in ecosystem impacts, we evaluated the hypothesis that Kingsnakes regulate the abundance of one of their prey, the venomous Copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix). We generated a database of captures of the two species across the southeastern United States and, while controlling for large-scale habitat preferences, identified a negative relationship between the relative abundance of Kingsnakes and the relative abundance of Copperheads. Our results are correlative but consistent with the hypothesis that Copperhead populations experience a release from predation pressure where Kingsnake abundances are low. We suggest that Kingsnake declines, which are occurring for unknown reasons, are having ecological effects in affected ecosystems. We further highlight the potential role that snakes play in influencing the population dynamics of their prey.","[Steen, David A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [McClure, Christopher J.

Theory predicts and empirical data suggest that parapatric range margins are most likely to form along environmental gradients when there is interspecific competition. Here, we study the ecology of the narrow contact zones of two parapatric European land salamanders, Salamandra salamandra and Salamandra atra. Previous research showed that abiotic conditions determine parapatric range margins of these two species. However, in contrast to other parapatric salamander species and theoretical predictions, there is no evidence for competitive interactions in the two Salamandra species. To study whether competition restricts these species' ranges and to understand local syntopic co-occurrence within their contact zones, we used site-occupancy models (1) to assess species-habitat relationships and (2) to test whether there is evidence for competition. We found that the two salamanders show dissimilar species-habitat relationships. The slope of the site positively affected the site-occupancy probability of S.salamandra, while none of the habitat characteristics explained the occupancy probability of S.atra. The local presence of one species had no effect on the occupancy probability of the other, suggesting that there is no effect of competition on local occurrence or that competition does not lead to spatial segregation. To fully understand the mechanisms that determine the parapatric range margins between the salamander species and to unravel the role of interspecific interactions, it is necessary to further study species' functional traits.","[Werner, P.; Loetters, S.] Univ Trier, Dept Biogeog, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Werner, P.; Schmidt, B.

Using the model system of the post-Pleistocene radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes, we used a comparative field study to examine variation in density, age structure, tertiary (adult) sex ratio, habitat use, as well as adult feeding and social behaviors in relation to environmental features including predation risk, interspecific competition, productivity (e.g. chlorophyll a, zooplankton density), and abiotic factors (e.g. salinity, surface diameter). The primary environmental factor associated with ecological differentiation in G. hubbsi was the presence of piscivorous fish. Gambusia hubbsi populations coexisting with predatory fish were less dense, comprised of a smaller proportion of juveniles, and were more concentrated in shallow, near-shore regions of blue holes. In addition to predation risk, the presence of a competitor fish species was associated with G. hubbsi habitat use, and productivity covaried with both age structure and habitat use. Feeding and social behaviors differed considerably between sexes, and both sexes showed behavioral differences between predator regimes by exhibiting more foraging behaviors in the absence of predators and more sexual behaviors in their presence. Males additionally exhibited more aggressive behaviors toward females in the absence of predators, but were more aggressive toward other males in the presence of predators. These results largely matched a priori predictions, and several findings are similar to trends in other related systems. Variation in predation risk appears to represent the primary driver of ecological differentiation in this system, but other previously underappreciated factors (interspecific competition, resource availability) are notable contributors as well. This study highlights the utility of simultaneously evaluating multiple environmental factors and multiple population characteristics within a natural system to pinpoint environmental drivers of ecological differentiation.","[Heinen, Justa L.; Coco, Matthew W.; Marcuard, Maurice S.; Martin, Ryan A.; Langerhans, R.

The stress gradient hypothesis predicts a linear increase in the intensity of facilitation as environmental conditions become increasingly stressful, whereas other theoretical models predict a maximum at intermediate environmental stress. We tested how competition and facilitation between herbivores change over a manipulated gradient of nutrient availability. We studied the effect of grazing by pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as bulk grazers on aquatic caterpillars (Acentria ephemerella Denis and Schiffermuller) as small specialist grazers along an experimental gradient of environmental nutrient concentration. Higher nutrient levels increased overall total plant biomass but induced a shift toward dominance of filamentous algae at the expense of macrophytes. Facilitation of caterpillars by snail presence peaked at intermediate nutrient levels. Both caterpillar biomass and caterpillar grazing on macrophytes were highest at intermediate nutrient levels. Snails facilitated caterpillars possibly by removing filamentous algae and increasing access to the macrophyte resource, whereas they did not affect macrophyte biomass or C:nutrient ratios, a measure of food quality. We conclude that competition and facilitation in herbivore communities change along nutrient availability gradients that affect plant biomass and community composition. Understanding how interspecific interactions may change in strength and direction along environmental gradients is important to predict how the diversity and structure of communities may respond to the introduction or removal of herbivore species in ecosystems.","[Bakker, Elisabeth S.; Dobrescu, Ioana] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dobrescu, Ioana; Holmgren, Milena] Wageningen Univ, Resource Ecol Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Straile, Dietmar] Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, D-78464 Constance, Germany","Bakker, ES (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, Droevendaalsesteeg 10, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",l.bakker@nioo.knaw.nl,"Bakker, Elisabeth S/B-7185-2008; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Bakker, Elisabeth S/0000-0002-5900-9136; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Netherlands Organisation of Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [863.07.006],Nils Scholzel transported the caterpillars; Nico Helmsing conducted the chemical analysis for nutrient concentrations in water and plant samples.

However, the possibility of early piscivory is assumed to depend on the hatch timing of the prey and predator. Two species, bream (2006) and roach (2007), were tested as the prey fish. The bream (hatching 12days after perch) were preyed upon by the perch, leading to the predicted development of two sizes of cohorts as well as to cannibalism. With roach (hatching simultaneously with perch), however, no piscivory or cannibalism occurred and the perch population was unimodally distributed. The results of this experimental pond study underpin recent theoretical findings that size differences between predator and prey, determined through differences in the timing of hatching as well as differences in juvenile growth rates, foster the occurrence of early piscivory in YOY perch that may lead to bimodality and finally to intra-cohort cannibalism.","[Heermann, L.; Borcherding, J.] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-46459 Rees Grietherbusch, Germany","Heermann, L (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Gen Ecol & Limnol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-46459 Rees Grietherbusch, Germany.",lisa.heermann@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG BO 1507/5-1, DFG BO 1507/5-2]","Our thanks go to all helping hands in the field and to three anonymous referees for their suggestions that helped to improve the manuscript substantially.

A spatially explicit, quantitative genetic, two-species competition model was used to manipulate the strengths of competition, gene flow and local adaptation along environmental gradients. This allowed us to assess the long-term persistence of each species and whether the ranges they inhabited had boundaries in space or were unlimited. We found that a species boundary arises along less steep environmental gradients when the strength of stabilizing selection and diversifying selection are similar. We also found that a species boundary may arise along shallow environmental gradients if interspecific competition is more intense than intraspecific, which relaxes previous requirements for steep gradients for generating range limits. We determined an analytical form for the critical environmental gradient as a function of ecological and genetic parameters at which a species boundary is expected to arise by competition. Results suggest an alternative to resource competition as an explanation for phenotypic divergence between sympatric competitors. Competitors sharing a trait that is under stabilizing selection along an environmental gradient may segregate spatially and evolve in different regions, with phenotypic sympatric divergence reflecting the resulting clines. Along various types of environmental gradients, variation in stabilizing selection intensities could lead to contrasting patterns in the distribution of species. For stabilizing selection strengths in accord with field data estimates, this study predicts that the level of sympatric character divergence would be limited along environmental gradients.","[Garcia-Ramos, Gisela] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Huang, Yunxin] Hubei Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China","Garcia-Ramos, G (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, 101 Morgan Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",ggarc0@uky.edu,,, [NSF DEB-0415339],"We are very grateful to Phil Crowley for insightful comments which greatly improved the manuscript.

Interspecific competition is considered key in structuring local ant communities, and it has been described as the hallmark of ant ecology. The goal of this literature review is to summarize the evidence supporting the importance of competition in structuring ant communities: First, we describe ant dominance hierarchies, paying special attention to species ranked at the highest level, i.e., dominants. We also establish criteria to standardize the definition of species dominance at both global and local scales, in order to allow comparisons among studies conducted in different regions and at different spatial scales. In particular, we discuss the factors that affect competition, such as trade-offs between dominance and thermal tolerance, as well as between dominance and food discovery, habitat complexity, disturbance, parasitism, and predation. Then, we analyse the relationship between patterns of local and global species richness and the degree of dominance present in communities. Finally, we present the different methodologies, both traditional and modern, used by ant ecologists to test for the effects of competition in ant communities and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each. The current review supports, to some degree, the reigning paradigm that competition is the predominant structuring force in ant communities. However, it also lays out clear evidence that competition might be less important than has previously been assumed. We suggest that a complex network of interactions involving different abiotic and biotic factors drives the structure of ant communities. We call for more studies to analyse the relative importance of the different factors that structure ant communities, an effort which would improve ant ecological theory.","[Cerda, Xim] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Arnan, Xavier; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, Fac Biociencies, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalunya, Spain; [Arnan, Xavier] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Fac Biol, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Biociencies, Unitat Ecol, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalunya, Spain","Cerda, X (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Avda Amer Vespucio S-N, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",xim@ebd.esic.es,"Arnan, Xavier/N-7829-2013; Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014; Retana, Javier/L-1214-2014","Arnan, Xavier/0000-0002-9904-274X; Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471; Retana, Javier/0000-0002-7505-9467","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government [CSD 2008-00040, CGL2009-09690]","This study was partly funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (project Consolider MONTES, CSD 2008-00040 to J.R. and project CGL2009-09690 / BOS and FEDER to X.C.).

Competition in natural grasslands largely occurs belowground, but information regarding root interactions is limited, as molecular methods quantifying species abundance belowground have only recently become available. Principal Findings: In monoculture, the grass Festuca rubra had higher root densities and a faster rate of soil nitrate depletion than Plantago lanceolata, projecting the first as a better competitor for nutrients. However, Festuca lost in competition with Plantago. Plantago not only replaced the lower root mass of its competitor, but strongly overproduced roots: with only half of the plants in mixture than in monoculture, Plantago root densities in mixture were similar or higher than those in its monocultures. These responses occurred equally in a nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soil layer, and commenced immediately at the start of the experiment when root densities were still low and soil nutrient concentrations high. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that species may achieve competitive superiority for nutrients by root growth stimulation prior to nutrient depletion, induced by the presence of a competitor species, rather than by a better ability to compete for nutrients per se. The root overproduction by which interspecific neighbors are suppressed independent of nutrient acquisition is consistent with predictions from game theory. Our results emphasize that root competition may be driven by other mechanisms than is currently assumed. The long-term consequences of these mechanisms for community dynamics are discussed.","[Padilla, Francisco M.; Mommer, Liesje; de Caluwe, Hannie; Smit-Tiekstra, Annemiek E.; Wagemaker, Cornelis A.

In long-lived plants, however, lifetime patterns and mechanisms of density dependence are difficult to study. Here, we examine effects of intraspecific and community density on the lifetime fecundity of two long-lived shrub species from South African Fynbos: Protea repens (animal-pollinated, hermaphroditic) and Leucadendron rubrum (wind-pollinated, dioecious). Both species are serotinous, retaining seeds in cones until fire kills the mother plant. We measured lifetime fecundity as the product of cone number, proportion of cones that are not damaged by predation and seed set (fertile seeds per intact cone). Intraspecific and community densities were quantified by counting individuals of target species and all Proteaceae in small- and large-scale neighbourhoods (10 m and 50 m radius) around each focal individual. Additionally, we determined the age and size of focal individuals. We found that lifetime fecundity of the wind-pollinated L rubrum is density independent. In contrast, the lifetime fecundity of the animal-pollinated P. repens increases with large-scale intraspecific density and shows a hump-shaped relationship to large-scale community density. Community density has a hump-shaped effect on seed set (probably through partial absence of generalized pollinators at low and competition for pollinators at high densities) and negatively affects cone number per individual. For both species, plant age decreases seed set while increasing lifetime fecundity. The qualitative differences in the density dependence of lifetime fecundity may arise from differences between animal and wind pollination. In particular, interactions with generalized animal pollinators may cause community-level Allee effects with profound consequences for the future dynamics of long-lived plant populations and communities.

Nevertheless, most evidence supporting ecomorphological correspondence in birds comes from studies of communities and not from local assemblages and, moreover, from temperate latitudes. To increase our understanding of ecomorphological correspondence in Neotropical assemblages, we used three multivariate approaches to evaluate correspondence between morphological and foraging behavior data in a tyrant-flycatcher assemblage (N= 12 species) in the Santa Marta Mountains in Colombia. Principal components analyses revealed similar species ordinations when using morphological measurements (beak size and shape, tarsus length, wing length, and tail length) or behavioral data (behavioral types of searching for prey and prey capture) separately. Discriminant function analyses tested the ability of morphological traits to predict foraging behavior, showing that more than 90% of all measured individuals (N= 267) were correctly classified in previously defined categories of search and attack behavior. Finally, Canonical correlation analyses revealed a significant correlation between morphological data and two independent datasets of search and attack behavior. Our results demonstrate that morphology can accurately predict ecology in an assemblage of Neotropical tyrannids, and similar results have been reported in previous studies of temperate Tyrant-flycatchers. Our results also show that bill size and shape, wing length, and tarsus length are the best predictors of foraging behavior in this assemblage. Testing for ecomorphological correspondence in other Neotropical taxa would help identify subsets of phenotypic traits that could be used for a practical, but reliable, determination of ecological relationships within different assemblages.","[Botero-Delgadillo, Esteban; Bayly, Nicholas J.] SELVA Invest Conservac Neotrop, Bogota, Colombia","Botero-Delgadillo, E (corresponding author), SELVA Invest Conservac Neotrop, Calle 41 26B-58, Bogota, Colombia.",esteban.botero@selva.org.co,"Botero-Delgadillo, Esteban/AAC-7069-2020","Botero-Delgadillo, Esteban/0000-0003-4653-7551; Bayly, Nicholas/0000-0001-9326-1936",,,,52,8,10,1,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0273-8570,1557-9263,,J FIELD ORNITHOL,J.

Understanding the community-level effects of ecological interactions, such as intra-and interspecifc competition, predation, and cannibalism, is therefore central to ecological theory and ecosystem management. Here, we investigate the community-level consequences of cannibalism in populations with density-dependent maturation and reproduction. We model a stage-structured consumer population with an ontogenetic diet shift to analyze how cannibalism alters the conditions for the invasion and persistence of stage-specific predators and competitors. Our results demonstrate that cannibalistic interactions can facilitate coexistence with other species at both trophic levels. This effect of cannibalism critically depends on the food dependence of the demographic processes. The underlying mechanism is a cannibalism-induced shift in the biomass distribution between the consumer life stages. These findings suggest that cannibalism may alter the structure of ecological communities through its effects on species coexistence.","[Ohlberger, Jan; Langangen, Oystein; Stenseth, Nils C.; Vollestad, L.

In many freshwater systems, competition for shelter plays an important role in determining the persistence of both native and alien species. The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, is currently invading the native habitat of the signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, in southern Oregon, and interspecific competition for shelter may be driving the species replacement in this region. 2. We designed a 2 X 3 factorial mesocosm experiment, with shelter density and species combination as factors, to investigate shelter occupancy and resource competition. Contrary to our predictions, the two crayfish species are equal competitors for shelter. Further, the invasive P. clarkii modified its shelter occupancy behaviour in the presence of the native P. leniusculus and has broader microhabitat preferences. 3. Specifically, we found that P. clarkii alters shelter occupancy and space use patterns when the two species occurred together, such that shelter use was identical between P. clarkii and P. leniusculus in mixed-species treatments. In such treatments, both species increased their use of shelters when shelter density increased. When P. clarkii was alone, however, individuals did not alter shelter use as a function of shelter density, whereas P. leniusculus exhibited similar density-dependent behaviour in both mixed- and single-species treatments. 4. In a complementary field survey, we employed an epicentre-based design to sample two field sites. We observed patterns of microhabitat use and breadth for each species similar to those in our mesocosm experiment: the invasive P. clarkii was more abundant across different habitats and used a broader range of microhabitats than the native P. leniusculus. As such, we found that P. clarkii was more abundant across both field sites than the P. leniusculus, occupying microhabitats within and beyond the preferred range of P. leniusculus. Both field sites were affected by urban development and agriculture. 5. The use of microhabitats by both species was similar in the laboratory and the field. This study confirms that P. clarkii individuals can, and do, successfully occupy microhabitats preferred by P. leniusculus in the Willamette Valley. The results from our study may be relevant to other freshwater systems inhabited by P. clarkii and contribute to the understanding of niche opportunity, a concept which defines the environmental conditions that promote biological invasions.","[Hanshew, Brett A.; Garcia, Tiffany S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA","Hanshew, BA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",bahanshew@gmail.com,,,,,,42,22,23,1,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Although food availability differs between habitats or seasons, these differences had never been considered in previous studies. We conducted year-round field surveys throughout a stream to compare the food habits of an introduced salmonid, brown trout Salmo trutta, and a native salmonid, masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou. Masu salmon did not constitute a large proportion of the diet of brown trout and vice versa. Thus, predation will likely not affect the population level of either species. The dietary overlap between brown trout and masu salmon varied depending on the presence of Gammaridae and terrestrial invertebrates; i.e., the intensity of interspecific competition for food resources may differ according to food conditions.","[Hasegawa, Koh; Ohkuma, Kazumasa] Fisheries Res Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan; [Yamazaki, Chitose] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Ohta, Tamihisa] Hokkaido Univ, Takaoka, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan","Hasegawa, K (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan.",hasekoh@affrc.go.jp; yamyama@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp; tami-hisa@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp; ohkuma@affrc.go.jp,"Hasegawa, Koh/H-9926-2019","Ohta, Tamihsia/0000-0001-7040-9926","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24780196, 12J07244] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank the staff of the National Salmon Resource Center for their support during this study.

Plant material provides the nutritional base for numerous aquatic systems, yet the consequences of diversity of plant material have not been studied in aquatic container systems important for the production of mosquitoes. To address how diversity in leaf detritus affects container-inhabiting mosquitoes, we examined how leaf species affect competition between two container inhabiting mosquito larvae, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, that co-occur in many parts of the world. We tested the hypotheses that leaf species changes the outcome of intra- and interspecific competition between these mosquito species, and that combinations of leaf species affect competition in a manner not predictable based upon the response to each leaf species alone (i.e. the response to leaf combinations is non-additive). We find support for our first hypothesis that leaf species can affect competition, evidence that, in general, leaf combination alters competitive interactions, and no support that leaf combination impacts interspecific competition differently than intraspecific competition. We conclude that combinations of leaves increase mosquito production non-additively such that combinations of leaves act synergistically, in general, and result in higher total yield of adult mosquitoes in most cases, although certain leaf combinations for A. albopictus are antagonistic. We also conclude that leaf diversity does not have a different effect on interspecific competition between A. aegypti and A. albopictus, relative to intraspecific competition for each mosquito.","[Reiskind, M.

They are also good biological models to investigate interspecific competition between sympatric species and predation; two processes which structure ecological communities. Odonata are also numerous, diverse, mobile and can play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as prey for herons and ibis. A relationship between prey size and bird predator has been observed in Numidia wetlands (NE Algeria) after analyzing food boluses regurgitated by six species of birds (Purple Heron, Black-crowned Night Heron, Glossy Ibis, Little Egret, Squacco Heron and Cattle Egret) during the breeding period, which also shows a temporal gradient for the six species. Both the Levins index and preliminary multivariate analysis of the Odonata as prey fed to nestling herons and ibis, indicated a high degree of resource overlap. However, a distinction of prey based on taxonomy (suborder and family) and developmental stage (larvae or adults) reveals a clear size dichotomy with large-sized predators (Purple Heron, Black-crowned Night Heron and Glossy Ibis) preying on large preys like Aeshnids and Libellulids and small-sized predators feeding mainly on small prey like Zygoptera. Overall, the resource utilization suggests a pattern of resource segregation by coexisting nesting herons and ibis based on the timing of reproduction, prey types, prey size and foraging microhabitats.

Advantages for the protected species are usually manifested in terms of higher reproductive success than conspecifics nesting remote to the protector species. Whether the protector species also accrues any benefit remains untested, and the species-specific behavioral traits underlying enhanced reproductive output in mixed-species associations remain poorly documented. We studied associations between lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) and jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nesting in rural buildings in the Gela Plain (Italy). We tested for interspecific interactions of jackdaws and lesser kestrels by comparing single- and mixed-species colonies in terms of: 1) vigilance, nest attendance, and intra- and interspecific interference and 2) defensive responses shown by each species when confronted with potential predators or competitors. In both species, nesting in mixed associations was accompanied by decreased vigilance. Diminished vigilance, however, was associated with decreased defensive effort for lesser kestrels, whereas jackdaws increased alarm calling, but only in small colonies. Our results reveal a reciprocal influence on behavior of lesser kestrels and jackdaws nesting within the same colony, whereby both species experience decreased energetic expenditures associated with vigilance, but only lesser kestrels appear to benefit via reduced nest defense effort. We discuss our results in light of the possible asymmetrical information transfer triggered by a common set of nest predators that favors the exchange of interspecific information regarding predator detection and defense.","[Campobello, Daniela; Sara, Maurizio] Univ Palermo, Dept Environm Biol & Biodivers, I-90123 Palermo, Italy; [Hare, James F.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Campobello, D (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Environm Biol & Biodivers, Via Archirafi 18, I-90123 Palermo, Italy.",danielacampobello@hotmail.com,"Sara, Maurizio/H-2662-2012","Sara, Maurizio/0000-0003-4274-422X; Campobello, Daniela/0000-0003-4094-9395",University of Palermo; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [154271],"Funding was provided by the University of Palermo with a Scientific Research Grant (ex-quota 60%, year 2007) and with a 2008 CoRI grant Human mobility and International Scientific Cooperation'' to M.S., and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (#154271) to J.F.H.",,65,23,24,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

However, by no means all models consider the effects of interspecific competition on species' distributions. In this study, we explore the contribution of both environmental factors and the presence of another ungulate species on the distribution of two sympatric deer species: roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus). To assess the importance of both biotic and abiotic factors, we constructed models for each species incorporating environmental predictors and an index of abundance of the other species. High density of shrubs and distance to roads had a positive affect on roe deer occurrence while spatial heterogeneity, namely mean shape index, and the presence of red deer had a negative effect. In contrast, the percentage of shrub cover, landscape heterogeneity and the presence of roe deer all positively affected red deer occurrence. Our results suggest that interspecific competition between these species might occur with asymmetric effects and underlines the need to explore the nature of these interactions in greater detail in southern ecosystems.

This 'individual specialisation' is a widespread phenomenon in natural populations, but until recently few studies quantified the magnitude of individual specialisation and how this magnitude varies among populations or contexts. Such quantitative approaches are necessary for us to understand how ecological interactions influence the amount of among-individual variation, and how the amount of variation might affect ecological dynamics. Herein, we review recent studies of individual specialisation, emphasising the novel insights arising from quantitative measures of diet variation. Experimental and comparative studies have confirmed long-standing theoretical expectations that the magnitude of among-individual diet variation depends on the level of intra and interspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. In contrast, there is little empirical information as to how individual specialisation affects community dynamics. We discuss some emerging methodological issues as guidelines for researchers studying individual specialisation, and make specific recommendations regarding avenues for future research.","[Araujo, Marcio S.; Layman, Craig A.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Araujo, MS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Ecol, BR-199 Rio Claro, Brazil.",msaraujo@rc.unesp.br,"Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015; Araujo, Marcio Silva/G-9485-2011","Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296; Araujo, Marcio Silva/0000-0003-3533-744X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.

Consequently, interspecific variations in drifting behaviour could lead to differences in predation pressure between coexisting prey species. Predation being an important factor determining the success of invaders, differences in drift patterns could advantage either native or exotic invertebrates through differential predation by native fish predators. The exotic freshwater amphipod (Gammarus roeseli) has now largely colonized Western Europe where it is often found in sympatry with a native species (Gammarus pulex). Here we documented interspecific differences in drifting behaviour that might have favored the invader's success through differential predation. Benthic and drifting amphipods were sampled three times at the same site to compare the proportion of each species within and between sample types (benthos or drift) across time. Compared with the benthos, where the invader (G. roeseli) was significantly less abundant than the native (G. pulex), G. roeseli was proportionally overrepresented in the drift but displayed a very different drifting pattern. While G. pulex drift rates remained roughly constant over a 24 h period, G. roeseli showed a marked diel periodicity with low diurnal and high nocturnal drift rates. Such drifting behaviour could procure this species with a competitive advantage regarding predation as most drift feeding fish are diurnal. As a result, the native appears more disadvantaged with respect to drift. This may partly explain the ability of G. roeseli to coexist with G. pulex in a habitat more suitable to the native.","[Lagrue, Clement; Kaldonski, Nicolas; Motreuil, Sebastien; Lefevre, Thierry; Blatter, Olivier; Giraud, Philippe; Bollache, Loic] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, Lab Biogeosci, Equipe Ecol Evolut,UMR 5561, F-21000 Dijon, France","Bollache, L (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, Lab Biogeosci, Equipe Ecol Evolut,UMR 5561, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.",bollache@u-bourgogne.fr,"Lefevre, Thierry/E-2157-2011","Lefevre, Thierry/0000-0002-9736-6142; Lagrue, Clement/0000-0003-3347-6497; BOLLACHE, Loic/0000-0003-0316-6746",Conseil Regional de BourgogneRegion Bourgogne-Franche-Comte,This study was funded by a grant from the Conseil Regional de Bourgogne.

We studied spatial and temporal interactions between an obligate predator, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx (L., 1758)), and a facultative scavenger, the wolverine (Gulo gulo (L., 1758)). Wolverines are known to utilize lynx-killed reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus (L., 1758)) and may benefit from being sympatric with lynx if interference competition is low. We used individual location data from 9 lynx and 17 wolverines to analyse interaction between inter- and intra-specific dyads (n = 195). We found no spatial segregation between lynx and wolverines and we observed no attraction or avoidance between individuals of the two species, independent of proportion of home-range overlap. This opposed our prediction that wolverines will show direct or delayed attraction to lynx. Wolverines may still benefit by scavenging lynx-killed reindeer while avoiding direct encounters with the lynx. Within species, we found attraction between males and females, increasing with proportion of overlap for lynx. Attraction was also found between consexual lynx, while consexual wolverines showed little home-range overlap (7%-9%) and neutral temporal interaction, indicating territoriality. Individual space use may be more influenced by conspecific interactions than by other species.","[Mattisson, Jenny; Persson, Jens; Andren, Henrik; Segerstrom, Peter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden","Mattisson, J (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",jenny.mattisson@slu.se,"Mattisson, Jenny/X-4750-2019; Andren, Henrik/C-8995-2015","Mattisson, Jenny/0000-0001-6032-5307; Andren, Henrik/0000-0002-5616-2426; Persson, Jens/0000-0003-1405-7561","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; World Wide Fund for Nature (Sweden); Olle and Signhild Engkvists Stiftelser; Marie-Claire Cronstedt Stiftelse; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas","We thank Hakan Sand, Gustaf Samelius, John Linnell, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

In this non-native environment, the species has flourished and has become the dominant apex predator on many reefs. In the present study, a comparison of non-native populations of C. argus in the MHI with native populations in Moorea showed that mean total length (32.0 vs. 26.9 cm), mass (722 vs. 326 g), growth, and body condition were each significantly elevated in the MHI. In addition, while an ontogenetic shift towards larger prey occurred in both locations, it was faster and more consistent in Moorea than in the MHI. As a result, while small C. argus of comparable size in the 2 locations consumed similar-sized prey, large C. argus in Moorea consumed significantly longer and deeper-bodied prey than their counterparts in the MHI. This pattern was unrelated to the size distributions of available prey and may thus reflect stronger intra-and interspecific competition for small prey in Moorea. Although ecological release in a broader sense (i.e. a combination of predator release, parasite release, and competitive release) may play a role, the most direct explanation for the observed differences between C. argus in native habitats in Moorea (with many competing grouper species) and non-native habitats in the MHI (few competitors) would be competitive release (here used in the sense of benefits resulting from the reduction of interspecific competition).","[Meyer, Amanda L.; Dierking, Jan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Dierking, J (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Marine Sci IFM GEOMAR, Evolutionary Ecol Marine Fishes Grp, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",jdierking@ifm-geomar.de,"Dierking, Jan/C-5170-2014","Dierking, Jan/0000-0002-4660-6919",Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l'Environnement (CRIOBE); National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA05NOS4261157]; University of Hawaii Arts and Sciences Advisory Council; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Fulbright Program,"We are grateful to C.

We also compared our results to historical data from 1932. During 2006-2008, lake trout diet consisted mainly of alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), whereas burbot utilized a much wider prey base including round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), rainbow smelt, alewives, and sculpins. Using the Schoener's diet overlap index, we found a higher potential for interspecific competition in 1932 than in 2006-2008, though diet overlap was not significant in either time period. No evidence of cannibalism by lake trout or lake trout predation on burbot was found in either time period. In 2006-2008, however, lake trout composed 5.4% (by weight) of burbot diet. To determine whether this predation could be having an impact on lake trout rehabilitation efforts in northern Lake Michigan, we developed a bioenergetic-based consumption estimate for burbot on Boulder Reef (a representative reef within the Northern Refuge) and found that burbot alone can consume a considerable proportion of the yearling lake trout stocked annually, depending on burbot density. Overall, we conclude that predation, rather than competition, is the more important ecological interaction between burbot and lake trout, and burbot predation may be contributing to the failed lake trout rehabilitation efforts in Lake Michigan.

We tested this hypothesis by studying a small teleost (nine-spined stickleback, Pungitius pungitius) from four marine and five lake (diverse fish community) and nine pond (impoverished fish community) populations. In line with theory, pond fish tended to be larger than their marine or lake conspecifics, sometimes reaching giant sizes. In two geographically independent cases when predatory fish had been introduced into ponds, fish were smaller than those in nearby ponds lacking predators. Pond fish were also smaller when found in sympatry with three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) than those in ponds lacking competitors. Size-at-age analyses demonstrated that larger size in ponds was achieved by both increased growth rates and extended longevity of pond fish. Results from a common garden experiment indicate that the growth differences had a genetic basis: pond fish developed two to three times higher body mass than marine fish during 36 weeks of growth under similar conditions. Hence, reduced risk of predation and interspecific competition appear to be chief forces driving insular body size evolution toward gigantism.","[Herczeg, Gabor; Gonda, Abigel; Merila, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Herczeg, G (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",gabor.herczeg@helsinki.fi; abigel.gonda@helsinki.fi; juha.merila@helsinki.fi,"Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Herczeg, Gabor/AAF-9978-2020","Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Ministry of Education and Centre for International Mobility (CIMO),"We thank Victor Berger, Goran Englund, Tuomas Leinonen, Daniel Lussetti, and Pirkko Siikamaki for their help in obtaining the samples.

We tested the hypothesis that site-specific heterogeneity in the physico-chemical environment alters the dominance of two competing amphipods: Gammarus fasciatus, the dominant native species in the upper St. Lawrence River, and Echinogammarus ischnus, a euryhaline Ponto-Caspian species that invaded the river in the late 1990s. E. ischnus has replaced G. fasciatus as the dominant amphipod at some sites, while remaining inferior at other sites-even several years after invasion. We tested the effect of water chemistry (conductivity) on the outcome of interactions between these two species in the laboratory and in the river in 2006 and 2007. Field experiments involved transplanting both species to different sites along a gradient of conductivity within the river, whereas the laboratory experiments examined interspecific predation in water collected from these sites. The laboratory experiments revealed that these species are mutual predators and their rate of predation on each other varies with conductivity; E. ischnus is the dominant predator at higher conductivity, while G. fasciatus dominates at lower conductivity. The field experiments showed interannual variation, but supported the lab results at high conductivity in 2006 and at low conductivity in 2007. E. ischnus was more sensitive than G. fasciatus to variation in conductivity, which apparently mediates this invader's ability to replace or dominate the native species in a heterogeneous environment.","[Kestrup, Asa M.; Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Ricciardi, A (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",asa.kestrup@mcgill.ca; tony.ricciardi@mcgill.ca,"Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054",,,,43,40,40,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

In this study, we explore the metapopulation dynamics of competitive interactions. Rather than simply evaluating the outcome of interspecific competition in the traditional manner, we focus on both the local population dynamic effects and the regional metapopulation processes affecting species co-existence. We develop a theoretical model of regional co-existence to generate a set of predictions on the patterns of colonization necessary for co-existence and the regional processes that can lead to competitive exclusion. We empirically test these predictions using metacommunity microcosms of the interaction between two bruchid beetles (Callosobruchus chinensis, Callosobruchus maculatus). Using well-replicated time series of the interaction between the bruchids and statistical methods of model fitting, we show how the qualitative and quantitative pattern of interspecific competition between the bruchid beetles is shaped by the structure of the metacommunity. In unlimited dispersal metacommunities, the global exclusion of the inferior competitor is shown to be influenced more by the processes associated with extinction rather than low colonization ability. In restricted dispersal metacommunities, we show how the co-existence of competitors in a spatially heterogeneous habitat (patches connected through limited dispersal) is affected by Allee effects and life-history [colonization (dispersal) - competition] trade-offs.","[Hunt, Julia J.

It is harder to predict what happens when both processes operate simultaneously. We describe an experiment that attempted to explore how shared natural enemies and resource competition structured a simple experimental insect community. Replicated communities were assembled in population cages consisting of the aphid species Acyrthosiphon pisum and Megoura viciae either alone or competing for a resource, their shared host plant Vicia faba. Each combination was set up with and without the parasitoid Praon dorsale which attacked both species of aphid. Population dynamic data show that interspecific resource competition was the dominant process structuring the community. Though juvenile parasitoids could develop successfully inside hosts of both species, they failed to suppress either aphid below their carrying capacities and were unable to persist on one species. We suggest that intense resource competition may reduce the value of individual aphids as hosts for parasitoids such that their population growth rate is less than zero and discuss whether this phenomenon occurs in natural and agricultural communities.","[Jones, Thomas S.; Godfray, H.

The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway. 2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species' selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area. 3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1.5% could hold all four large carnivores together. 4. Synthesis and applications. A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.","[May, Roel; van Dijk, Jiska; Swenson, Jon E.; Linnell, John D.

To study niche relationships and interspecific interactions in Antiguan lizard communities, we used five offshore islands with varying combinations of three diurnal lizards: Ameiva griswoldi, Anolis leachii, and Anolis wattsi. We collected data on perch height, substrate, thermal microhabitat, body size, head length, daily activity, and abundance to characterize the ecological niche of each species. Ameiva griswoldi was more similar to A. leachii in size and daily activity, but more similar to A. wattsi in perch height, and A. leachii and A. wattsi were more similar in thermal microhabitat. This pattern of niche differentiation was consistent with niche complementarity, where species are similar on some niche axes but differ on others. Using the same niche characteristics as in species comparisons, we tested for a niche shift among islands for A. wattsi. In the absence of A. griswoldi, A. wattsi used lower perches, sunnier microhabitats, and was found more often on the ground. In contrast, with A. leachii absent, A. wattsi perched higher, more often in the shade, and on trunks. Furthermore, A. wattsi was most abundant when with A. leachii only, but least abundant when alone with A. griswoldi. These results suggest interspecific interactions, most likely due to competition and intraguild predation, are important for structuring Antiguan lizard communities.","[Kolbe, Jason J.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Colbert, Paul L.; Smith, Brian E.] Black Hills State Univ, Dept Biol, Spearfish, SD 57799 USA","Kolbe, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, 3101 Valley Life Sci Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kolbe@berkeley.edu,,"Colbert, Paul/0000-0002-0729-3964",,,,44,14,18,1,21,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,JUN 4,2008,,2,,,,,261,272,,10.1643/CE-07-011,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,311DD,WOS:000256579500001,,,,,2021-09-21,

The significance of top-down regulation by carnivores is receiving increasing global recognition. As a consequence, key objectives in many programmes that seek to maintain ecosystem function now include conserving carnivores and understanding their interactions. This study examined overlap in resource use (space and diet) of introduced eutherian carnivores and an endangered marsupial carnivore, the spotted-tailed quoll Dasyurus maculatus, in eastern Australia. We also investigated mechanisms of niche partitioning and evidence for interspecific aggression. 2. Dietary overlap between quolls, red foxes Vulpes vulpes and wild dogs Canis lupus ssp. was assessed by analysis of scats. Trapping, radio-tracking and direct observations were used to quantify spatial overlap between quolls, foxes, wild dogs and feral cats Felis catus. 3. Dietary overlap among the carnivores was extensive. Medium-sized mammals were the most important prey for all three predators, indicating potential for exploitative interactions. However, hunting of different size classes of secondary prey and consumption by quolls of more arboreal prey than their counterparts may assist coexistence. Remains of quoll were found in two dog scats, and cat hair in another, possibly indicating intraguild predation. 4. We observed extensive spatial overlap between quolls and eutherian carnivores. However, we inferred from dietary data that quolls foraged primarily in forested habitat, while canids foraged mainly in cleared habitat. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate strong potential for competition between spotted-tailed quolls and eutherian carnivores, and thus a situation where control of introduced predators may be desirable, not only for the conservation of prey species but also for the protection of native carnivores. Concern over potential non-target mortality of quolls has hindered efforts to control foxes in eastern Australia using poison baits. We contend that, rather than harming quoll populations, baiting for foxes should aid the conservation of quolls and should be implemented in areas of sympatry where fox numbers are high.","[Glen, A.

In contrast to other nonnative salmonids, the role of nonnative brown trout in native cutthroat trout decline is poorly understood. Specifically, the level of ecological similarity that occurs between these species and the importance of other trophic mechanisms (e.g., predation) in their interactions are key uncertainties. We evaluated the trophic relationships of brown trout and cutthroat trout in a northern Utah river using a combination of diet and stable isotope analyses. We compared the dietary habits of these two species using multiple and complementary measures. Based on both stomach contents and delta C-13 signatures, we found that these species consumed a similar and opportunistic diet (i.e., they were nonselective in their foraging patterns). However, at most sizes, brown trout ingested larger prey-including fishes-and occupied a higher relative trophic position (i.e., delta N-15) than cutthroat trout. Overall, these results demonstrate a high degree of dietary similarity and therefore strengthen earlier conclusions regarding interspecific competition between these two species. Our study, when considered alongside the work of others, suggests there is potential for predatory interactions between these species (i.e., brown trout preying on small cutthroat trout). We believe that future research on brown trout-cutthroat trout interactions should consider predatory effects in greater detail.","Utah State Univ, USGS Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept AWER, Coll Nat Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA","McHugh, P (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, USGS Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept AWER, Coll Nat Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.a.mchugh@gmail.com,"Budy, Phaedra/B-2415-2012","Budy, Phaedra/0000-0002-9918-1678",,,,57,21,22,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

In contrast, the growth of K. tibialis stagnated in winter and turned high again in spring when they molted to the final instar. Skwala pusilla consumed a higher proportion of algae than did K. tibialis, and a randomisation test indicated significant difference between the two species in the degree of carnivory. However, S. pusilla did not enhance the degree of carnivory in winter when the growth of K. tibialis stagnated. These results suggest that the relatively low degree of carnivory in S. pusilla is not due to interspecific competition for prey resources.","[Otsuki, Akiko] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Iwakuma, Toshio] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Sect Environm Biosci, Grp Conservat Ecol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","Otsuki, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",otsuki@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,,,,,,35,2,2,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0165-0424,,,AQUAT INSECT,Aquat.

This assumption does not allow for differential responses due to interspecific competition or other mechanisms, and therefore does not allow community composition to be predicted. As body size is relevant to area requirements and interspecific dominance, a natural experiment was conducted to quantify the differential responses of avian species abundance to variability in remnant area, isolation and forest cover based on average species body mass. Location Deciduous forest remnants of varying area and isolation throughout the State of Delaware, USA. Methods Forest remnants within stratified area and isolation classes were randomly selected for breeding bird surveys; total forest cover (ha) within 2 km of each survey point was subsequently determined as a covariate. Surveys were conducted within 100-150 m from the edge of each remnant and detected bird species were divided into five classes based on a log(2)-transformation of body mass (very small, small, medium, large and very large). Assuming a negative binomial distribution, the abundance of detected individuals in each mass class was analysed using generalized linear models with remnant area, isolation, local forest cover and two-way interactions specified as independent variables. The same analyses were conducted for individual species where sample size allowed. Results Very small, small and very large bodied species decreased in abundance with decreasing local forest cover and remnant area and with increasing remnant isolation, while large species increased in abundance. Medium-sized species decreased in abundance with increasing forest cover, did not respond to remnant isolation and showed a concave, curvilinear response to increasing remnant area. Large and medium-sized species were the most abundant birds in small, isolated remnants despite occurring in the largest remnants with the more abundant very small and small species, suggesting that communities are not randomly organized. Main conclusions Regardless of presumed habitat associations, large and medium-sized species are of the appropriate size to be dominant competitors when forest resources are limiting, and thus may be considered 'generalists'. The smallest species may be excluded entirely from small, isolated remnants even though such remnants meet their ecological needs; the needs of very large species are not met in small remnants. The applicability of biodiversity theories to community composition, species abundance and, by extension, to conservation, can be improved by incorporating differential responses based on body mass into their assumptions.","Univ Delaware, Dept Entomol & Wildlife Ecol, Newark, DE 19716 USA","Brown, WP (corresponding author), Kutztown State Univ, Dept Biol, Kutztown, PA 19530 USA.",wpbrown23@yahoo.com,,,,,,95,15,15,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

In this study, I examined patterns of species co-occurrence among eastern Plethodon salamanders and determined whether they were consistent with predictions from a guild model of competition-based community assembly. Using a database of 45 species and 4540 geographic sites, I found that patterns. of co-occurrence were significantly nonrandom at both a regional and continental scale, and species of different size guilds were distributed more evenly in sites than was expected by chance. Sites with the highest species richness had consistent patterns of community composition, and with few exceptions, the same five species were present at all sites. Taken together, these results imply that larger Plethodon communities are assembled from simpler communities in a manner consistent with what is predicted through competitive mechanisms and suggest that stable species combinations are possible to achieve at various levels of species richness. These results also provide strong evidence consistent with the hypothesis that competitive-based community assembly is a general phenomenon in Plethodon and that interspecific competition is prevalent among the eastern species of this group.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Adams, DC (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dcadams@iastate.edu,,"Dean, Adams/0000-0001-9172-7894",,,,56,57,59,0,17,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2007,88,5,,,,,1292,1299,,10.1890/06-0697,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,166HN,WOS:000246369900023,17536414,,,,2021-09-21,

In particular, we asked whether foraging behaviour differed between both species, which factors determined individual success at foraging-flocks, and how did our findings compare with previous studies of Atlantic populations in North America (temperate), and Caribbean (tropical). Location: Ponta das Contendas (38 degrees 39'N, 27 degrees 05'W), Terceira Island, Azores. Methods: Foraging-flocks were characterized and compared in terms of species (single- or mixed-species), size (no. of individuals), type of habitat (inshore, exposed coast, deep blue water), and presence-absence of biotic effects. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) approach to study the effect of selected factors (species, habitat, biotic effect, cloud cover, wind speed, and their interactions) on individual foraging parameters at these flocks (number of dives min(-1), number of aborted dives min(-1), number of prey caught min(-1)). Results: Both tern species were most often observed in mixed-flocks in the exposed coast habitat, but roseate terns were also prone to feed in mono-specific flocks over blue water. Only one quarter of the total number of flocks recorded was in the presence of biotic effects, a situation where common terns, but not roseate terns, were twice more numerous. The GLM results suggested that species and habitat alone were good predictors of prey caught min(-1): common terns achieved the highest success in inshore bays (1.2 fish min(-1)) while roseate terns maximized their success on exposed coasts (0.8 fish min(-1)). In the presence of biotic effects, both species dove at a higher frequency, and aborted fewer dives per min, but there was no marked effect on capture rates. Increasing wind speed negatively affected the rate at which both species aborted dives, but again, there was no effect on capture success. Conclusions: Foraging success did not increase in the presence of biotic associations that should normally facilitate prey capture. This suggests that interspecies competition may arise at mixed-flocks, as found in North American studies. Overall, our results paralleled previous findings that the common tern is adapted to feed in calm, inshore bays. Because this latter habitat was scarce in the study area, we hypothesized that this contributes towards explaining why common terns do not breed in high numbers at this colony site (ten percent of the Azores population). Conversely, the large area occupied by the marine coastal (exposed coast) and oceanic (blue water) environments in the study area may, at least in part, justify the large number of roseate terns found there (one quarter of the Azores population) in 2001.","Fac Univ Sci Agron Gembloux, Lab Foresterie Trop & Subtrop, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; Univ Coimbra, Dept Zool, IMAR, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal; Direccao Serv Conservacao Nat, Direccao Reg Ambiente, P-9930210 Lajes Do Pico, Azores, Portugal","Monticelli, D (corresponding author), Fac Univ Sci Agron Gembloux, Lab Foresterie Trop & Subtrop, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",david.monticelli@sciencesnaturelles.be,"Ramos, Jaime A./B-6616-2018","Ramos, Jaime A./0000-0002-9533-987X; Monticelli, David/0000-0002-6566-7346",,,,38,6,8,0,17,SOCIEDAD ESPANOLA ORNITOLGIA,MADRID,"MELQUIADAS BIENCINTO 34, E-28053 MADRID, SPAIN",0570-7358,,,ARDEOLA,Ardeola,DEC,2006,53,2,,,,,293,306,,,,,14,Ornithology,Zoology,147DS,WOS:000244984200007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Such comparison can be insightful if covariation with external factors known to influence the occurrence, density, or persistence of each species over space and time can be controlled. We used systematically-distributed DNA hair-trap stations to sample the occurrence of black bears Ursus americanus and grizzly bears U arctos across 5496 km(2) in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. We describe interspecific landscape partitioning according to terrain, vegetation and landcover variables at 2 spatial scales. We developed multivariate models to predict the potential distribution of each species. At sampling site-session combinations that detected either species, we then investigated whether the expected or actual occurrence of each influenced the likelihood of detecting the other while controlling for human influence and inherent landscape quality. Black bears were more likely than grizzly bears to occur in gentle, valley bottom terrain with lower proportions of open habitats. Each species also was detected less frequently with the other species than predicted by their respective models; however, the strength of this relationship decreased as landscapes became more characteristic of black bear habitat. As landscapes showed higher inherent potential to support grizzly bears, black bears occurred more than model prediction in areas with higher human access and proximity to major highways but less in national parks. As potential to support black bears increased, grizzly bears occurred more than model prediction only in national parks and less with increasing human access and proximity to major highways. Results suggest that competition is occurring between the species, and that the differential response of each species to human disturbance or excessive mortality may influence the outcome and hence landscape partitioning. Moreover, black bears are more likely to benefit from human encroachment into landscapes of high inherent value for grizzly bears than vice versa. Conservation implications relate to potential mediating effects of habitat and human influence on competitive interactions between the species.","Univ Calgary, Respurces & Environm Program, Calgary, AB T2N 4H9, Canada; British Columbia Minist Forests, Revelstoke, BC V0E 3K0, Canada; Revelstoke & Glacier Natl Pk, Revelstoke, BC V0E 2S0, Canada","Apps, CD (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Respurces & Environm Program, 2708 Cochrance Rd NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4H9, Canada.",clayton.apps@telus.net,,,,,,60,25,27,2,39,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,AUG,2006,29,4,,,,,561,572,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2006.04564.x,,,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,087HN,WOS:000240733600011,,,,,2021-09-21,

The American mink Mustela vison is a riparian mustelid and an invasive species in several countries. Mink have been introduced to England in the early decades of the last century and have been expanding their range until the mid-eighties. Since then, however, the number of sites occupied by mink has been declining. We investigated three possible causes of such a decline: (1) A downtrend of the fur farming industry; (2) An increase of European polecats Mustela putorius; (3) An increase of Eurasian otters Lutra lutra. Mink trends were derived from data collected by the National Otter Survey, a large-scale long-term survey of the whole of England from 1977 to 2002. We discuss how the observed decline in the number of sites occupied by mink may be due to a combination of an actual decrease in the distribution and density of mink and to a change in the focus of mink activities away from water, rather than to a change in their marking behaviour. Taken together, our results suggest that the decline of mink is related to an increase in the native otter population through interspecific competition, although at a local level also other factors may be important. As the otter population is still increasing, it is likely that the number of sites occupied by mink will continue to decline, a process that may be beneficial to aquatic and semi-aquatic species suffering from mink predation.

While immature individuals and large-sized adults of H. tridens occurred over the intertidal areas, the young adults of H. tridens were found only in the upper part of the intertidal area. This difference in the pattern of distribution between the young adults and the immature individuals of H. tridens seemed to be derived from interspecific competition or intraguild predation between H. tridens and H. japonica and/or intraspecific interactions within each species. These two species have the same of detritivore and carnivore food habits, and conspecific predation within and/or intraguild reciprocal predation between them were frequently observed in the field. In the present study, we performed field caging experiments to examine the dependence of predation ability on size between the two species. When individuals were <= 7.0 mm carapace width (CW), H. japonica had a higher ability to prey on members of H. tridens of the same size than H. tridens had on those of H. japonica. When individuals were >= 8.0 mm CW, there was no difference between the two species in terms of predatory ability, and the predation rate itself decreased. Therefore, H. japonica can exclude H. tridens from the lower habitats. However, the large sized individuals of H. tridens may intrude into the lower part of the intertidal area from the upper part. They can be against H. japonica, and can prey on the small sized individuals of H. japonica. However, thick sediment set in the cages increased the survival rate of the small individuals of H. japonica, because burrows dug in the sediment could be refuges for those of H. japonica from the intraguild predation by the large sized individuals of H. tridens. These refuges for the small individuals of H. japonica can be refuges also for those of H. tridens. However, burrows cannot be refuges from intraguild predation between similar-sized individuals of two species of the genus Helice. We can conclude that intraguild predation by H. japonica excluded the immature individuals of H. tridens in the lower habitat and restricted the young adults of H. tridens to the upper habitats in the estuary.","Ehime Univ, Ctr Marine Environm Studies, Matsuyama, Ehime 790, Japan","Omori, K (corresponding author), Ehime Univ, Ctr Marine Environm Studies, 2-5 Bunkyo Cho, Matsuyama, Ehime 790, Japan.",ohmori@mserv.sci.ehime-u.ac.jp,,,,,,37,3,4,0,5,CRUSTACEAN SOC,SAN ANTONIO,"840 EAST MULBERRY, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78212 USA",0278-0372,,,J CRUSTACEAN BIOL,J.

Such relationships may exhibit a positive, a negative, or a random pattern. In the conceptual model here proposed, short-term oscillations among these patterns were attributed to small-scale biological processes, such as competition, predation, and intraguild predation, acting in conjunction with water turbulence. A negative relationship between zooplankton and ichthyoplankton abundance may be caused both by predation on fish eggs and larvae, and by detrimental competition and intraguild predation interactions for fish larvae. In contrast, positive relationships emerge from the absence or low abundance of major predators on the ichthyoplankton, and from food availability for fish larvae and competing species. The random pattern may appear as a gradual transitional stage between the negative and positive patterns, or be promoted by strong water turbulence - which generates random movements of individuals. The size of zooplankters greatly influences these small-scale phenomena. Hence, their role in the trophic web, the success in competition interactions and vulnerability to water turbulence depends on their size. Intra- and interspecific competition may be reduced by variability in body size within or among fish larvae populations. Owing to a strong interaction among phenomena at different scales, these small-scale processes are also influenced by larger scale features, such as seasonal changes in zooplankton biomass, water currents, or spawning periods of fish. At the space level, some theoretical studies have emphasized the role of water currents as a vector for fish larvae to reach the nursery grounds (migration triangle hypothesis), or to allow them to remain within their own population's distributional area (member/vagrant hypothesis). At the temporal level, the match/mismatch theory insists in a synchrony between reproductive strategies of fish and cyclical changes in abundance and size spectrum of potential prey items for their larvae. In any case, a coincidence between favorable abiotic and biotic features during the whole life-cycle of fish would assure a success in survival of larvae and their subsequent recruitment to adult population.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Sanvicente-Anorve, L (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar, Apdo Postal 70-305, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",sanvi@mar.icmyl.unam.mx,,"Flores Coto, Cesar/0000-0003-3426-439X; Sanvicente Anorve, Laura Elena/0000-0002-0951-4564; ESPINOSA, MARIA DE LA LUZ/0000-0001-5721-880X",,,,56,22,22,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,APR,2006,559,,,,,,11,22,,10.1007/s10750-005-1323-x,,,12,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,009UM,WOS:000235138900002,,,,,2021-09-21,

In Kabylia (Algeria), competition may occur between the golden jackal (Canis aureus), which is a habitat-opportunistic species, and the common genet (Genetta genetta), which favours woodland environments. We tested the hypothesis of interspecific competition in disturbed habitats by comparing the diets of the jackal and genet in different environmental settings. Index values of interspecific food overlap were constantly high, Opportunistic behaviour prevailed in both species and was reflected by the alternation between two dominant prey items (mammals and insects) and other resources, such as poultry and highenergy plants. It is thought that greater availability of resources in the latter categories particularly benefits the jackal because of its broad niche spectrum.","Univ Tizi Ouzou, Fac Sci Biol & Agron, Tizi Ouzou 15000, Algeria; Univ Franche Comte, Dept Environm Biol, F-25030 Besancon, France; Ctr Biol & Gest Popoulat, F-34988 St Gely Fesc, France","Amroun, M (corresponding author), Univ Tizi Ouzou, Fac Sci Biol & Agron, Tizi Ouzou 15000, Algeria.",man_amroun@yahoo.fr,"Giraudoux, Patrick/B-9274-2011","Giraudoux, Patrick/0000-0003-2376-0136",,,,49,11,12,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0025-1461,1864-1547,,MAMMALIA,Mammalia,,2006,70,3-4,,,,,247,254,,10.1515/MAMM.2006.040,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,185TI,WOS:000247732900006,,,,,2021-09-21,

The work was carried out in a montane mixed forest of central Spain with four Parus species, the long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) and the nuthatch (Sitta europaea). Experimental feeders, that varied in their risk of predation, were used to control the effect of natural variations in food availability and quality on the habitat use patterns of different species. Tree gleaning passerines avoided feeding on dark inner forest places far from edges, distant from protective cover, outside the inner tree canopy and near the ground; they preferred deciduous, relatively clear forest plots. These effects remained invariable across years and weather conditions. There was a common pattern of selection of foraging locations by the four Parus species: proximity to cover and height above ground and over the lowest branches of the tree canopy positively influenced the use of feeding places. According to these patterns, the vigilance proportion of species was significantly higher when feeding far from cover than when birds were feeding near pine foliage. This pattern was also common for the four studied Parus species. Nevertheless, the interspecific dominance hierarchy of the species was positively correlated with the use of the safest feeders (feeders farther the ground and nearer from protective cover within tree canopy), being the converse with the most exposed ones. Therefore, the results of this paper demonstrate that the selection of feeding locations within habitat follows a pattern minimizing predation risk. Interspecific dominance hierarchies can lead to the exploitation of unfavourable risky patches by subordinate species.","CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, ES-28006 Madrid, Spain","Carrascal, LM (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, ES-28006 Madrid, Spain.",mcnc152@mncn.csic.es,"Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016; Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008","Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531",,,,69,41,43,2,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2006,112,1,,,,,51,62,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.13787.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,003HG,WOS:000234671800006,,,,,2021-09-21,

We investigated this phenomenon with two competing container-dwelling mosquitoes. We tested the hypothesis that habitat drying alters the outcome of interspecific competition, predicting that the competitive impact of Aedes albopictus on Aedes aegypti would be severe in wetter environments, but greatly reduced in drier environments. We tested these predictions in a laboratory experiment within cages, with aquatic larvae residing in water-filled cups within the cage, and adults emerging within the cage and ovipositing on the cups. We raised each species alone or with the competitor. Environmental treatments were fluctuating (water in cups evaporated to 50% of the original volume and then cups were refilled), and drying (water in cups evaporated completely and cups remained dry for two weeks before refilling). There was a significant interaction between treatment and species combination for adult populations of both species. Interspecific competition was highly asymmetrical. In the wetter fluctuating environment, interspecific competition had a large negative effect on A. aegypti, but in the drying environment, interspecific competition had a large negative effect on A. albopictus, and relatively little impact on A. aegypti. The main cause of the shift in competitive advantage appeared to be a greater increase in egg mortality for A. albopictus under dry conditions, compared to A. aegypti. Thus, mortality impinging on noncompeting life-cycle stages call alter the population level impact of interspecific competition. The hypothesis that dry conditions shift competitive advantage away from A. albopictus is supported in this experiment.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Costanzo, KS (corresponding author), Univ Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",ksc6@buffalo.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793-06, R01 AI044793] Funding Source: Medline",,,43,85,85,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2005,86,12,,,,,3289,3295,,10.1890/05-0583,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,994YI,WOS:000234066700020,17450188,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

Two experiments were conducted on Mantidactylus bicalearatus and M. punctatus, two sympatric frog species from Madagascar that live and breed in rain-forest plants (Pandanus spp.), to test for interspecific competition. The first experiment examined larval growth rates and survivorship with and without conspecifics. While survivorship did not differ among treatments, mean growth rates for M. bicalearatus were significantly reduced in the presence of M. punctatus larvae. The second experiment manipulated the presence and density of adults in Pandanus plants. Emigration from and immigration to experimental plants tended to be higher and lower, respectively, for M. bicalcaratus in the presence of M, punctatus, but these differences were not significant. These results demonstrate asymmetric competition (at least as larvae) and indicate that M. punctatus is the superior competitor. Field data showed that M. bicalcaratus was found significantly more frequently in the absence of M. punctatus. Also, M. bicalearatus populations were significantly more likely to go locally extinct in the presence of M. punctatus. These data suggest that asymmetric competitive interactions are important influences on the dynamics of these populations.","Univ Michigan, Zool Museum, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lehtinen, RM (corresponding author), Coll Wooster, Dept Biol, 931 Coll Mall, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.",rlehtinen@wooster.edu,,,,,,32,5,6,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

Theoretical models predict that once siblicide between parasitoid wasps has evolved, it can only be lost under stringent conditions, making the transition from solitary to gregarious development exiguous. Phylogenetic studies indicate, however, that gregariousness has independently arisen on numerous occasions. New theoretical models have demonstrated that if gregarious development involves reductions in larval mobility, rather than a lack of fighting ability (as in the older models), the evolution of gregariousness is much more likely. We tested the predictions of the older tolerance models (gregariousness based on non-fighting larval phenotypes) and the reduced mobility models (gregariousness based on non-searching larval phenotypes) by observing larval movement and the outcome of interspecific competition between Aphaereta genevensis (solitary) and A. pallipes (gregarious) under multiparasitism. Differences in larval mobility matched the prediction of the reduced mobility model of gregarious development, with the solitary A. genevensis having larvae that are much more mobile. The proportion of hosts producing the solitary species significantly declined after subsequent exposure to females of the gregarious species. This contradicts the prediction of the older models (fighting vs non-fighting phenotypes), under which any competitive interactions between solitary and gregarious larvae will result in a highly asymmetrical outcome, as the solitary species should be competitively superior. The observed outcome of interspecific competition offers evidence, with respect to this subfamily, in favour of the new models (searching vs non-searching phenotypes).","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Mayhew, PJ (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",pjm19@york.ac.uk,"Mayhew, Peter J/I-6363-2012; Mayhew, Peter/B-1370-2008","Mayhew, Peter J/0000-0002-7346-6560; ",,,,77,30,30,3,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2004,141,1,,,,,179,190,,10.1007/s00442-004-1659-3,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,849SC,WOS:000223560000021,15258849,,,,2021-09-21,

Although ecological and behavioral interactions among species of salamanders have been well studied, little is known about the interactions between territorial P. cinereus and other ecologically similar species, such as large predatory invertebrates. Our field data indicate that P. cinereus and a large syntopic centipede, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus, exhibit negative spatial associations in natural habitats, possibly indicating interspecific territoriality. Only seven instances of salamander/centipede co-occurrence were recorded from a field sample of 247 occupied cover objects. Cover object size was positively correlated with salamander SVL (tip of the snout to the anterior end of the cloaca), but there was no correlation of cover object size to centipede length. Data on the ability of P. cinereus to differentiate among chemicals on the substrate suggest that visual cues are not necessary to elicit a territorial response from intruding salamanders. Although in laboratory trials salamanders behaved similarly toward intruders of both species, biting was directed only toward centipedes. Salamanders spent significantly more time approaching centipedes than they did approaching other salamanders. Approach behavior was often associated with nose tapping and may be an investigative, rather than aggressive, behavior. We suggest that territorial P. cinereus respond similarly to intruding salamanders and centipedes, but that they escalate more readily to biting centipedes because S. sexspinosus is sightless and thus unable to respond to visual signals.","John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Univ Hts, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,"Hickerson, Cari-Ann/A-8013-2008",,,,,52,26,28,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Predictions about how species will respond to climate warming are based commonly on eco-physiological models or niche models. One critique of this practice is that it ignores interspecific interactions. 2. We examined how resource competition affects the responses of two ciliate species, Colpidium striatum Stein and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn, to warming in laboratory microcosms. 3. We found that warming had a negative effect on Colpidium abundance and a negligible effect on Paramecium abundance in the absence of interspecific competition. When Colpidium and Paramecium competed, however, Paramecium coexisted with Colpidium at low and high temperatures, and was competitively excluded at intermediate temperatures. 4. Temperature-dependent strength of the interaction between Colpidium and Paramecium may explain the unexpected responses of Paramecium, which were inconsistent with its response to temperature in the absence of Colpidium. 5. Our results provide further support for the important role of species interactions in understanding how species respond to environmental warming, and suggest that the complex interplay between species interactions and climate may make it extremely difficult to predict accurately how species embedded in complex communities will respond to climate warming.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Jiang, L (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",ljiang@imcs.rutgers.edu,,,,,,33,84,85,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Based on anticipated changes in the relative intensity of positive and competitive interactions we predicted a unimodal density association between Parus and Fringilla: at low and intermediate densities the two groups are positively associated (positive interaction), whereas high densities promote interspecific competition. In central Europe where densities are high, densities were unimodally related to each other. In northern and southern Europe linear and positive associations appeared. Experimental studies provided consistent support for positive interspecific interactions in the north. The results suggest that species interactions may indeed vary in relation to the density of potential competitor and switch from positive to negative along environmental gradients.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland","Monkkonen, M (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",mikko.monkkonen@oulu.fi,"Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012; Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,47,19,19,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2004,27,1,,,,,112,118,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03705.x,,,7,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,775DP,WOS:000189025700011,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus) patch use did not vary with treatment type. Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) used areas of natural woody vegetation more than patches with artificial perches and patches with no perches. Patch use by Loggerhead Shrikes was also influenced by the presence of complex woody vegetation and interspecific interactions, whereas American Kestrel use was limited by landscape matrix and ground cover density.

To improve our understanding of the ecological factors involved in the evolution of sympatric stickleback species pairs (Gasterosteus aculeatus), I examined whether lakes in the same region with only a solitary population of sticklebacks had unique features not shared with lakes containing stickleback species pairs. Sixteen lakes with a solitary population of sticklebacks were identified as potential candidates for two invasions of marine ancestors. Several physical and chemical characteristics of these candidate lakes were found to be not significantly different from those of lakes with sympatric species pairs. However, when the community of other fish species was considered, a striking pattern emerged: all but one of the 16 candidate lakes contained other fish species in addition to cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki), whereas sympatric species pairs were found only in lakes with cutthroat trout and no other fish species. The two other fish species most often encountered, prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), are potential competitors and predators of threespine sticklebacks. The results of this survey suggest that our understanding of the role of ecology in diversification and speciation will be furthered by a consideration of interactions other than interspecific competition between focal populations.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Ctr Biodivers Res, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Vamosi, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr 1 NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",,"Vamosi, Steven/C-8126-2009","Vamosi, Steven/0000-0003-3903-5000",,,,51,58,61,0,29,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

Depth-habitat use, availability of edible algae and zooplankton densities were recorded to examine seasonal changes in intensity of competition between Daphnia and the other herbivores in the lake. Early in July, the exephippial generation of Daphnia aggregated near the surface, independently of body-size. In late July, when fish planktivory was expected to increase, the daphnids moved down during the day. In August, as intraspecific competition for food intensified, small and large Daphnia partitioned the water column, with larger individuals staying deeper. In September, Daphnia became dominated by large individuals, edible phytoplankton reached the seasonal minimum, and the vertical distribution of Daphnia gradually stretched out towards the surface. The observations on food availability and zooplankton densities suggest that interspecific competition intensified by the end of July. Species and stages that were most exposed to exploitative and interference competition by Daphnia were those staying deeper, because their vertical distribution overlapped more with the larger, competitively superior daphnids.

Giving-up densities (GUD) of seeds were used to measure the foraging activity of the three most common small mammals at the site: degu (Octodon degus), Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), and the olivaceous field mouse (Akodon olivaceus), under shrubs (cover) and in the open on predator-excluded and competitor-excluded (Octodon) plots. Experiments were conducted during both new and full moons. Monthly small-mammal censuses using standard mark-recapture techniques provided data on movement, reproduction, and long-term fluctuations in density between 1989 and 1994. Diurnal Octodon foraged more (had lower GUD-) in the absence of predators (although this was confounded by a numerical, increase resulting from predator exclusion), and foraged more under shrubs than, in the open. However, the lack of a significant cover x predator exclusion interaction and thermoregulation studies suggest that physiological constraints play,a greater role than predation risk in determining micro-habitat selection by Octodon. Predation risk, as influenced by lunar light levels and predator exclusion, had only weak effects on micro-habitat selection by Phyllotis. The strong tendency of Octodon to forage under cover could depress food availability, forcing Phyllotis to feed more in the open. Concomitantly, Phyllotis exhibits several morphological characters that would favor detection and avoidance of predators. There is extensive evidence that interspecific competition is the primary constraint on Akodon foraging; predation risk appears to be relatively unimportant. Akodon is also a less efficient forager than the two other species, having significantly higher GUD, on average. This is partially offset by differences in reproductive biology; Akodon exhibits extremely rapid. demographic responses to favorable changes in the environment. A fourth species, Abrothrix longipilis, may coexist in the system because of its opportunistic nature, but no data are available on its foraging efficiency. These behavioral and biotic interactions occur within a background of periodic El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO), which may ultimately contribute to species coexistence.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Sci Biol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile","Yunger, JA (corresponding author), Governors State Univ, Environm Biol Program, University Pk, IL 60466 USA.",J-Yunger@govst.edu,,,,,,73,49,49,1,80,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

We have developed a new and highly tractable optimal foraging model for drift-feeding fishes that is based on the profitability of occupying varying focal-point velocities in a stream. The basic model can be written as: I-x = (E-x * P-x) = {(D * A * V) * [1/(1 + e((b + cV)))]} - S-x where: (1) I-x is the net energy intake at velocity x; (2) E is prey encounter rate; (3) P is prey capture success rate which can be modelled as 1/(1 + e((b + cV))) where b and c are fitting constants from the prey capture success curve; (4) D is the energy content of prey (J/m(3)) in the drift; (5) A is the visual reactive area of the fish; (6) V is velocity (cm/s); and (7) S is the cost of maintaining position (J/s). Given that D, A and S can be considered constant over the range of velocities occupied by these fishes, the model reduces to e((b + cV)) = 1/(cV - 1) which we solved iteratively to yield an optimal focal-point velocity for species in each sample. We tested the model by comparing its predictions to the mean focal-point velocities (i.e. microhabitats) occupied by four species of drift-feeding minnows in two sites in a stream in North Carolina, USA. The model successfully predicted focal-point velocities occupied by these species (11 out of 14 cases) in three seasonal samples collected over 2 years at two sites. The unsuccessful predictions still were within 2 cm/s of the 95% confidence intervals of mean velocities occupied by fishes, whereas the overall mean deviation between optimal velocities and mean fish velocities was small (range = 0.9 and 3.3 cm/s for the warpaint shiner and the Tennessee shiner, respectively). Available focal-point velocities ranged from 0-76 to 0-128 cm/s depending on site and season. Our findings represent one of the more rigorous field tests of an optimal foraging/habitat selection model for aquatic organisms because they encompass multiple species and years, and for one species, multiple sites. Because of the ease of parameterization of our model, it should be readily testable in a range of lotic habitats. If validated in other systems, the model should provide critical habitat information that will aid in the management of riverine systems and improve the performance of a variety of currently used management models (e.g. instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM) and total maximum daily load calculations (TMDL)).","Univ Georgia, DB Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Grossman, GD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, DB Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,36,60,60,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

In recent years the population of fur seals has increased, whereas that of macaroni penguins has declined. Both species feed on krill of similar size ranges, dive to similar depths and are restricted in their foraging range at least while provisioning their offspring. In this study we test the hypothesis that the increased fur seal population at South Georgia may have resulted in greater competition for the prey of macaroni penguins, leading to the decline in their population. We used: (1) satellite-tracking data to investigate the spatial separation of the Bird Island populations of these two species whilst at sea during the breeding seasons of 1999 and 2000 and (2) diet data to assess potential changes in their trophic niches between 1989 and 2000. Foraging ranges of the two species showed considerable overlap in both years, but the concentrations of foraging activity were significantly segregated spatially. The size of krill taken by both species was very similar, but over the last 12 years the prevalence of krill in their diets has diverged, with nowadays less krill in the diet of macaroni penguins than in that of Antarctic fur seals. Despite a significant degree of segregation in spatial resource use by the study populations, it is likely that the South Georgia populations of Antarctic fur seal and macaroni penguin exploit the same krill population during their breeding season. For explaining the opposing population trends of the two species, the relative contributions of independent differential response to interannual variation in krill availability and of interspecies competition cannot be resolved with available evidence. The likely competitive advantage of Antarctic fur seals will be enhanced as their population continues to increase, particularly in years of krill scarcity.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Croxall, JP (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",,"Brierley, Andrew S/G-8019-2011; Staniland, Iain/I-4725-2012","Brierley, Andrew S/0000-0002-6438-6892; Staniland, Iain/0000-0003-2736-9134",,,,60,81,85,2,42,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Juvenile C. maenas utilize rocks, shell, and other cover, and their arrival on the west coast places them in potential competition for these resources with an abundant native grapsid, H. oregonensis, Similarly, H, sanguineus use intertidal shelter on the east coast, thus placing C. maenas in possible competition with grapsids both as an invader on the west coast and as 'resident' on the east coast, having been established there for more than 150 yr. Field sampling and laboratory experiments testing competition for space between C. maenas and Hemigrapsus spp. of equal carapace width were conducted on both coasts, as were videotaped feeding trials to examine and quantify agonistic interactions between species. When competing for food (a single damaged, anchored bivalve), C. maenas dominated over H. oregonensis, while H. sanguineus were overwhelmingly dominant over C. maenas. Within-quadrat, stratified sampling of rocks and sand revealed striking differences in habitat utilization by C. maenas living in the presence or absence of Hemigrapsus, Only similar to20% of juvenile C. maenas occurred under rocks in areas occupied by either Hemigrapsus species, while north of the present distribution of H. sanguineus (in Maine) >97% of the C. maenas were found beneath rocks. This pattern was reflected in laboratory trials as well, where both species of Hemigrapsus consistently dominated in contests for shelter. Given the importance of intertidal cover for small crabs, such competitive interactions will likely affect patterns of habitat use by C. maenas on the east coast and may have important implications for the ultimate distribution and impact of this species in the northeastern Pacific.","Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Jensen, GC (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",gjensen@u.washington.edu,,,,,,77,125,130,1,99,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

They share the same limited phloem resource and often coexist within the same host trees. We tested whether phloem resources are partitioned in time and space by measuring spatial and seasonal colonization of logs. Differences among species in flight phenology, development time, voltinism, and spatial colonization patterns within logs reduce, but do not eliminate, species overlap. The bark beetle species share predation by Thanasimus dubius (Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Histeridae), which exploit pheromone signals for prey location. We employed pheromone traps to test for chemical communication among, bark beetle species. Heterospecific signals tend to be deterrents when they are added to conspecific signals but attractants when they are alone, indicating that the communication system can both reduce and increase species overlap in resource use depending upon relative abundance of the species. Deterrence by heterospecific signals is probably a result of selection for minimizing interspecific competition. However, individuals may sometimes benefit from joining aggregations of other species because of (1) predator swamping, (2) improved success in attacking live trees, and (3) location of suitable, recently dead, trees. These benefits should be greatest for males (which locate and colonize host trees before signalling females) and indeed males tended to be more attracted than females by heterospecific signals. Shared resources, shared predators, and heterospecific pheromone communication all contribute to species interactions in this guild of bark beetles, but predicting whether the removal of one species will tend to increase or decrease the abundance of remaining species remains difficult. Species interactions are likely conditional and coexistence is probably promoted by benefits to rare species of multispecies associations.","Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Great Lakes Inst Pine Ecosyst Res, Colfax, WI 54730 USA; Minnesota Dept Agr, Plant Pest Survey Biocontrol Program, St Paul, MN 55107 USA; SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Ayres, MP (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",matthew.p.ayres@dartmouth.edu,"Ayres, Matthew/AAI-6873-2020","Ayres, Matthew/0000-0001-6120-9068",,,,83,72,73,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2001,128,3,,,,,443,453,,10.1007/s004420100665,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,463WC,WOS:000170499400016,24549914,,,,2021-09-21,

Although this pattern is well known. the underlying mechanism of displacement remains unclear. Previous work has suggested that interactions with bullfrogs may contribute to the population decline of native red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) in Oregon, USA. Interactions between these species appear to be strongly context dependent and potentially influenced by habitat modification. To gain a more detailed understanding of this displacement, we studied the effects of food-resource distribution, a factor that can be influenced by human habitat alteration, on competitive interactions between larval red-legged frogs and larval bullfrogs. The presence of bullfrog larvae had strong negative effects on the performance of red-legged frog larvae. However, this effect was dependent on whether food resources were clumped or scattered. Survivorship to metamorphosis and mass at metamorphosis were reduced when red-legged frog tadpoles were exposed to bullfrogs in clumped-resource ponds. In contrast, the presence of bullfrogs had a negligible effect on larval performance of red-legged frogs in scattered-resource ponds. Behavioral observations indicate that a passive interference mechanism is likely to be responsible for the outcome of interactions between bullfrogs and red-legged frogs. Our results suggest that clumped resources can intensify interspecific competition, and this may influence the success of exotics when human-induced habitat alteration affects resource distribution, Understanding the context-dependent nature of interactions will be necessary if we are to predict invasion success and control the impact of exotics on natives.","Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Alexion Pharmaceut Inc, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Kiesecker, JM (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,50,125,140,0,64,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2001,82,7,,,,,1964,1970,,10.2307/2680061,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,457FC,WOS:000170125600014,,,,,2021-09-21,

Blue tit (Parus caeruleus) song varies geographically in the proportion of song types that contain a trill (i.e. a series of identical notes repeated in sequence at a very rapid rate produced at the end of a song). In order to determine the environmental factors influencing geographic variation in the proportion of blue tit songs with a trill, we conducted a comparative study. At macrogeographic and regional scales we examined the effect of three factors that could influence geographic variation in blue tit song: dominant vegetation type, intraspecific competition and interspecific competition with great tits (Par ns major). Interspecific competition may result in song convergence or song divergence thereafter called character shift). The results we obtained are consistent with predictions of the character shift hypothesis: the proportion of songs presenting a different syntax to great tit songs (songs with a trill) increases significantly with relative great tit density. Results do not support predictions of hypotheses concerning song convergence or intraspecific competition.

Regression analysis suggested that salmon and dace densities were affected by water temperature (negative for salmon, positive for dace) and structural habitat factors (woody debris for salmon, pools for dace). Salmon density was higher in forest reaches than in grassland reaches, whereas dace density was higher in grassland reaches, suggesting that the removal of riparian forest had raised water temperature and allowed upstream invasions by dace. In contrast to salmon and dace, neither the density of leach nor sculpin differed between the forest and grassland reaches. For their densities, a negative effect of each on the other was most important, suggesting a strong effect of interspecific competition between leach and sculpin on their distributions. However, regression models also suggested that substrate heterogeneity mediated the outcome of their interspecific competition. On the basis of the results, a scenario is predicted for a fish-assemblage change with a typical land-development process in Hokkaido, and the importance of leaving or restoring riparian buffer for conservation and restoration of stream habitat is emphasized.","Ehime Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol & Earth Sci, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Inoue, M (corresponding author), Ehime Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol & Earth Sci, Bunkyo Cho 2-5, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan.",inom@sci.ehime-u.ac.jp,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,44,24,24,1,10,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

This explains the often-observed tendency for interspecific differentiation in the timing of flowering between coexisting plants.

Stem diameter increased and height : diameter ratio decreased when birch density was reduced from 2500 to 50 stems ha(-1), but there were no further benefits to spruce growth when the entire birch overstory was removed. Spruce growth did not improve where birch was thinned to 1000 stems ha(-1),but its potential for release may have been confounded by the higher density of taller conifers in that treatment. Interspecific competition between spruce and paper birch appeared to be primarily for light because spruce responded to dramatic reductions in overstory density but not to reductions in understory sprout density. Spruce survival was unaffected by thinning treatments, indicating that birch density of 2500 stems ha(-1) was too low to induce mortality. Armillaria root disease was the main cause of mortality, and spruce leader weevil and Cooley's spruce gall adelgid were important damaging agents, but the behaviour of these organisms was unaffected by treatment. Stand structure was dramatically changed from a mixed coniferous-deciduous to a predominantly coniferous overstory when birch was thinned to 50 or 0 stems ha(-1), which may have negative implications for wildlife. If balancing maximum spruce growth with biodiversity is the primary objective, then between 50 and 1000 stems ha(-1) birch should be retained on sites similar to the one used in our experiment.

However, the onset of competition should vary with the species of competitor due to interspecific differences in timing of emergence and plant growth form. The fitness benefits of elongation may therefore depend on the timing of this plastic response. Phenotypic selection analyses and path analysis were used to evaluate selection acting on stem elongation at early and late life-history stages and the combination of germination timing and elongation in an annual plant. Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) were raised in one of three environments experienced by natural populations (cornfields; soybean fields; and disturbed, weedy sites). Due to the rapid growth rate and high density of plants in disturbed areas, selection to increase seedling-stage elongation was expected in weedy sites. Due to the wide spacing of crop plants, competition for light is initially low in cultivated fields, but intensifies as the season progresses. Selection for increased elongation at later nodes was expected in soybean fields because velvetleaf can often overtop soy and thereby increase leaf exposure. In contrast, selection against late elongation was expected in cornfields because velvetleaf are incapable of overtopping corn. Individuals that elongate would experience the carbon cost of allocating to structural tissue, but fail to experience a carbon return through increased Light interception. The phenotypic selection analyses were consistent with these predictions and therefore support the role of stem elongation as an adaptation to interspecific competition. Selection also acted on the combination of germination timing and elongation. In the weedy environment, early emergence in conjunction with enhanced stem elongation conveyed the highest fitness. Reduced elongation was favored among individuals that emerged late, potentially because these individuals were unable to overtop neighbors. The results of this study demonstrate that the timing of stem elongation strongly affects competitive success. Environments that differ in the timing of competition for light select for elongation at different life-history stages, and this selection depends on the timing of emergence.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Weinig, C (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Box G-W, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",cweinig@brown.edu,"Langerhans, R.

An apparent correlate of this biological invasion has been a sudden decline in the population numbers of Cochliomyia macellaria, a native species of the Americas. In this study, we investigated predation rates on third instar larvae of C. macellaria, C. putoria and C. megacephala by third instar larvae of C. albiceps in no-choice, two-choice and three-choice situations. Most attacks by C. albiceps larvae occurred within the first hour of observation and the highest predation rate occurred on C. macellaria larvae, suggesting that C. albiceps was more dangerous to C. macellaria than to C. megacephala and C. putoria under these experimental conditions. The rates of larvae killed as a result of the predation, as well as its implications to population dynamics of introduced and native species are discussed.","Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Parasitol, IB, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; Univ Estadual Paulista, IB, Dept Bioestat, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil","Godoy, WAC (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Parasitol, IB, Rubiao Jr, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",,"Godoy, Wesley AC/B-9787-2012; Trinca, Luzia/C-7849-2012; Del Bianco Faria, Lucas/I-1832-2013","Trinca, Luzia/0000-0003-1106-8505; Del Bianco Faria, Lucas/0000-0002-7230-800X",,,,53,74,77,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Previously published literature on the population dynamics of a common arable weed, Chenopodium album, and its interactions with an arable crop, sugar beet, is reviewed with a view to (i) assessing the degree of variability in life-history traits, and (ii) parameterizing simple models of population dynamics to explore the factors determining weed abundance. 2. Comparison of previously published data sets indicates that (i) the yield-density responses of C. album in monoculture are remarkably consistent across sites and years; (ii) the per plant interspecific competitive effect of sugar beet on C. album is roughly the same as the per plant intraspecific effect of C. album; (iii) the allometric relationship between the seed production of C. album and plant biomass is invariant: and (iv) there is considerable variation in published estimates of rates of seed emergence, mortality and seedbank decay. 3. These data are used to parameterize a simple analytical model for the population dynamics of C. album in a rotation containing sugar beet. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the key parameters in determining changes in population size are the rates of emergence and mortality of seeds, as well as the rate of mortality of plants through control. 4. Using inferred levels of variability to compare deterministic and stochastic implementations of the model indicates that population sizes, and variability in population sizes, will be dominated by environmentally driven variations in the rate of seed germination and the rate of control. 5. From a practical perspective, these results indicate that (i) further information on the effects of control on plant numbers, and (ii) monitoring and prediction of emergence rates is likely to be the most successful approach to predicting weed numbers and levels of infestation. 6. The modelling shows how it is possible to use existing published data to parameterize simple analytical models, as well as to use information on scales of parameter variability with sensitivity analysis of such models to explore population dynamics. This provides an effective basis for exploring the impact of changing management on weed numbers in variable environments.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Freckleton, RP (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",r.freckleton@uea.ac.uk,"Watkinson, Andrew R/N-1649-2013; Freckleton, Rob P/B-6455-2013","Freckleton, Robert/0000-0002-8338-864X",,,,82,51,51,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Among these are the neighborhood radius, the number of years of growth that are integrated, and tree age. We have evaluated the importance of these factors when relating growth and competition in a forest stand with contrasted densities of the dominant tree species (Pinus nigra) and understory shrub species (Adenocarpus decorticans). Previous to this evaluation we performed a randomization test to assess the relationship between tree growth and neighbors. By using Daniels index of competition we found that the use of a fixed neighborhood radius underestimated the importance of tree competition. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) of the relationship between tree growth and Daniels index increased asymptotically with the number of years considered. Five years of growth gave high r(2) independently of the density of trees and shrubs. The intensity of competition was weakly affected by the characteristics of the plot (tree and shrub,densities), and did not change with time. In contrast, the potential growth at equal competition - as represented by constant a in the allometric model - changed with time suggesting a gradual decrease in potential tree growth in the plots with higher tree density, and a gradual increase in those plots with high density of shrubs. These results may reflect tree canopy closure and the senescence of Adenocarpus decorticans. A method is suggested to select optimum neighborhood radius and growing period for the calculation of competition indices. By applying this method we were able to explain as much as 79-84% of the variability in tree growth of this stand.","Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, E-03080 Alicante, Spain","De Luis, M (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, Aptdo Correos 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",,"de Luis, Martin/F-2559-2010; Abad, Juan F Bellot/H-7525-2015; Cortina-Segarra, Jordi/L-9024-2014","de Luis, Martin/0000-0002-7585-3636; Abad, Juan F Bellot/0000-0002-2066-8265; Cortina-Segarra, Jordi/0000-0002-8231-3793; Raventos, Jose/0000-0002-5693-510X",,,,43,21,21,0,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,,,NEW FOREST,New For.,MAY,1998,15,3,,,,,223,242,,10.1023/A:1006507017646,,,20,Forestry,Forestry,ZQ462,WOS:000073864500002,,,,,2021-09-21,

One factor determining optimal intrinsic growth rates is the pattern of resource availability. Organisms that experience chronically low resource levels tend to have slow intrinsic growth rates. However this does not necessarily hold if resource levels change as an organism grows. We present a theoretical model showing that rapid growth is favored when resource levels for small size classes are low relative to resource levels for large size classes. We call such a growth strategy optimistic because rapid growth is based on an expectation that resources will improve once a minimum size is reached. We provide empirical support for this hypothesis by examining the intrinsic growth rates of pumpkinseed sunfish derived from three populations sympatric with bluegill sunfish (an important competitor with small size classes) to three populations allopatric with bluegill sunfish raised under common conditions.

I tested predictions from the shelter bottleneck hypothesis, which proposes that shelter (or refuge) limitation can control population size structure and density by acting strongly on only one size class. I manipulated shelter for stone crabs in four haphazardly chosen bays in the northeast Gulf of Mexico to examine the shelter bottleneck hypothesis in a mixed-model design. I also examined four biotic factors (habitat structure, food, predation, and interspecific competition) that may contribute to population-level differences among bays. I found differences among bays in stone crab size structure and density and in crab responses to size-specific shelter supplementation. These differences in stone crabs among bays included: (1) natural median crab size differed by 5.5-fold, (2) size at maturity changed by 33%, (3) adult density varied 10-fold, (4) the density response of molting individuals and gravid females to supplemental shelter differed by more than 7-fold, and (5) the shelter preferred by crabs changed from 25 to 100 mm diameter pipes. The shelter bottleneck hypothesis and differences in habitat structure best account for these differences in stone crabs among bays. There appeared to be bottlenecks in three of the four bays, and the location of the bottleneck was predictable from measures of habitat structure. There were demographic consequences of shelter limitation on stone crab growth and fecundity at the individual level, and these effects appeared to explain population-level differences among bays. However, the bottleneck effects may be mediated by differences in food quantity and competition among bays. The experiments suggest that shelter bottlenecks have important effects on stone crabs across a wide region in the northeast Gulf of Mexico, and illustrate the benefits of using random factors in experimental designs to examine the generality of ecological effects.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA",,,"Beck, Michael W./AAB-2844-2019","Beck, Michael W./0000-0002-5107-9973",,,,107,59,59,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1997,78,8,,,,,2487,2503,,,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YK726,WOS:A1997YK72600017,,,,,2021-09-21,

Forty percent of BPF belongs to Poland, and 60% to the Belarus Republic. Polish and Belarussian game departments inventories of ungulate numbers (1946-1993) and archival data on censuses and hunting statistics (1798-1940) are presented. The recorded ranges of densities of native wild ungulates were: European bison 0-1.5 inds/km(2), elk 0-0.6, red deer 0-5.4, roe deer 0.6-4.8, and wild boar 0.2-3.8 inds/km(2). Fallow deer were introduced in 1890 (maximum density reached in 1914 was 1.2 inds/km(2)) and were eradicated by 1920. Cattle were traditionally pastured in the Forest, and its grazing impact was heaviest in 1880-1914 (maximum recorded density 6.7 inds/km(2)). In 1798-1993, the community of wild ungulates consisted of three to six species, with total densities varying from < 2 to 14.4 inds/km(2) (65 to 1180 kg of crude biomass per 1 km(2)). Roe deer, wild boar, and red deer were usually the dominants. However, in 1860-1971, cattle constituted from 15% to 80% by numbers and from 37% to 87% by biomass of all ungulates in Bialowieza Forest. Data on population trends within a five-species assemblage of native wild ungulates were subject to multiple regression analysis to determine the roles of predation (by wolves Canis lupus and lynxes Lynx lynx), competition, food, weather variables, and humans in shaping population densities and increase rates of ungulates. Growth of the mean annual temperature had positive effect on densities of all ungulates, probably through improving food supply and feeding conditions. Bison and elk were shaped by intra-and interspecific competition for food. Bison numbers have been significantly limited by humans, due to both uncontrolled exploitation in years of political instability and deliberate culling in years of protection. Red deer and roe deer were primarily shaped by predation from wolves and lynx, respectively. Competition for food influenced red and roe deer when they had erupted after predator extermination. Wild boar was influenced predominantly by food availability, especially the highly variable crops of oak seeds.","Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; State Natl Pk Belovezhskaya Pushcha, Kamenec Raion 225063, Kamenyuki, BELARUS; Bialowieza Natl Pk, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland","Jedrzejewska, B (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland.",wlodek@bison.zbs.bialowieza.pl,,"Jedrzejewska, Bogumila/0000-0002-9652-0953",,,,108,139,146,4,84,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0001-7051,2190-3743,,ACTA THERIOL,Acta Theriol.,DEC,1997,42,4,,,,,399,451,,,,,53,Zoology,Zoology,YT965,WOS:000071665500003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Temporary ponds are excellent arenas for the study of food webs because they are discrete communities that can be mimicked in containers that approach the realism of natural habitats. Artificial ponds permit repeatable initial conditions and sufficient replication of independent experimental units in complex experiments to test hypotheses about the control of structure and function in natural communities. I used a combination of observations of natural ponds, ''experimental natural history'' of artificial ponds in my study area, and controlled experiments in an array of 144 replicate ponds to develop, then test, hypotheses about how the structures of food webs are regulated. Understanding food webs begins with population biology. Amphibians use the aquatic larval stage of their biphasic life cycle to exploit ephemeral opportunities for growth and development in temporary ponds. The regulation of population density and the fitness of individuals are determined by complex interactions among competition, predation, and uncertainty in the length of the time ponds retain water. Exponential models of density-dependent recruitment relate the number of metamorphs to the input of eggs into ponds without predators. Extensions of these models include interspecific competition and predation. The addition of predation to these systems has three effects. (1) Predators can reduce, even eliminate, prey. There are species-specific differences among co-occurring prey in their risks of predation, and these risks change with relative body sizes of predator and prey. (2) individuals may evoke an inducible defense that reduces their risk by either decreasing active foraging or developing morphological adaptations, such as changes in the coloration and shape of tails. These defenses may entail costs in body size and timing of metamorphosis. (3) Finally, mortality due to predators may reduce competition, thereby benefiting the population of the prey by permitting individuals that escape predation to grow rapidly enough to escape drying ponds. The order of arrival of species at breeding ponds has an impact on their own success as well as having a lasting impact on the success of species that arrive later. Such priority effects may result from size-specific changes in trophic connections or indirect effects between species mediated through the food web. Anurans can have strong effects on the partitioning of the flow of nutrients through the phytoplankton vs. the periphyton. This effect on partitioning of production can then have strong effects on zooplankton and insects. Salamanders can play the role of keystone, or critical, predators by affecting the structure of the assemblages of zooplankton and anurans that determine much of the dynamics of nutrient flows within food webs in temporary ponds.","UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT BIOL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA","Wilbur, HM (corresponding author), UNIV VIRGINIA, MT LAKE BIOL STN, GILMER HALL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA.",,,,,,,172,332,344,7,179,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1997,78,8,,,,,2279,2302,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2279:EEOFWC]2.0.CO;2,,,24,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YK726,WOS:A1997YK72600001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Niche theory predicts that the stable coexistence of species within a guild should be associated, if resources are limited, with a mechanism of resource partitioning. Using extensive data on diets, the present study attempts: (i) to test the hypothesis that, in sympatry, the interspecific overlap between the trophic niches of the sibling bat species Myotis myotis and M. blythii-which coexist intimately in their roosts-is effectively lower than the two intraspecific overlaps; (ii) to assess the role played by interspecific competition in resource partitioning through the study of trophic niche displacement between several sympatric and allopatric populations. 2. Diets were determined by the analysis of faecal samples collected in the field from individual bats captured in various geographical areas. Trophic niche overlaps were calculated monthly for all possible intraspecific and interspecific pairs of individuals from sympatric populations. Niche breadth was estimated from: (i) every faecal sample; (ii) all the faecal samples collected per month in a given population (geographical area). 3. In every population, the bulk of the diets of M. myotis and M. blythii consisted of, respectively, terrestrial (e.g. carabid beetles) and grass-dwelling (mostly bush crickets) prey. All intraspecific trophic niche overlaps were significantly greater than the interspecific one, except in Switzerland in May when both species exploited mass concentrations of cockchafers, a non-limiting food source. This clearcut partitioning of resources may allow the stable, intimate coexistence observed under sympatric conditions. 4. Relative proportions of ground-and grass-dwelling prey, as well as niche breadths (either individual or population), did not differ significantly between sympatry and allopatry, showing that, under allopatric conditions, niche expansion does not take place. This suggests that active interspecific competition is not the underlying mechanism responsible for the niche partitioning which is currently observed between M. myotis and M. blythii.","UNIV LAUSANNE, INST ZOOL & ANIM ECOL, CH-1015 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",,,"Arlettaz, Raphael/O-2182-2016","Arlettaz, Raphael/0000-0001-6360-5339",,,,77,101,112,0,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Three predatory chironomid species constituted numerically 8.8% (+/- 95% CL 2.2) of the macro-and meiobenthic community at the sediment surface and in the hyporheic zone of Oberer Seebach, a gravel stream in Lower Austria. Larvae of Thienemannimyia geijskesi (Goetghebuer) and Nilotanypus dubius (Meigen) occurred in higher densities in sediment depths between 10) and 40 cm, whereas Conchapelopia pallidula (Meigen) achieved higher densities at the sediment surface. The three species completed one generation in a year. 2. A total of ninety-seven prey species and instars were identified by gut analyses, of which forty-one benthic rotifer species constituted 69.5% of individuals and twenty-three chironomid species and their instars, 22.9%. The three tanypod species showed shifts from mainly rotifer species in early instars to chironomids and diverse other meio- and macrofaunal taxa in later instars. Rather than shifting towards larger prey sizes, growing predators expanded their upper size thresholds and continued to include smaller prey species in their diet. The extent to which tanypod instars fed on similar prey size classes declined with increasing larval size. Predation by tanypods amounted to 2.2% (+/- 95% CL 0.1) of the combined prey densities and prey consumption averaged 1.32 (bootstrap 95% CL 1.26-1.39) individuals per predator individual. 3. Preferences for microhabitat flow differed between predator species and in the prey assemblage. Prey densities and densities of T. geijskesi and C. pallidula were highest in pool areas, whereas N. dubius achieved high densities in riffle sites. 4. Tanypod larvae fed non-selectively among prey types. To test the significance of observed size(instar)-specific spatial and dietary overlap values amongst tanypod species, simulations were generated from random models for pairs of intra-and interspecific associations of individuals and groups of prey and predator species. Groups and individuals of tanypod instars fed near randomly on groups of prey types and a high proportion (P > 0.60) of prey individuals are quasi-randomly chosen by tanypods in those patches. Tanypod instar-pairs did not show a sustained trophic resource partitioning in time, thus reducing the degree of competitive interactions for food in this predator guild. Spatially segregated and non-segregated tanypod instars formed random aggregations independent of each other at different flow microhabitats. 5. Species-rich prey assemblages such as benthic rotifers and larval chironomids increased the probability of non-selective feeding upon a wide spectrum of prey species by tanypods. Prey choice was governed by prey availability and tanypod individuals fed on many species at rather even proportions independent of each other.",,"Schmid, PE (corresponding author), AUSTRIAN ACAD SCI, INST LIMNOL, BIOL STN LUNZ, SEEHOF 4, A-3293 LUNZ AM SEE, AUSTRIA.",,,,,,,58,49,51,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if the predominantly polyphagous moth community utilizing this ephemeral, patchily distributed, yet high quality, resource, showed evidence of exploitative intraspecific and interspecific competition. The galls were found to be extensively utilized with over 93% of galls occupied and between 50-80% of gall tissue consumed. Fewer than 0.6% of the larvae were parasitized. Significant, positive intra- and interspecific aggregation occurred in the galls and the mean number of species per gall was consistently greater than one. A threshold density of 13 individuals, representing a total moth biomass of 12.74 mg, was found above which body mass compensation occurred. Resources are therefore limited in the community. The species were positively associated as a result of a common habitat affinity. Species abundances also covaried positively in a common response to resource conditions.

The spatial distribution of two wild ungulates, impala and kudu, and of domestic cattle, was monitored across seasons in a 9400 ha ranch of the 'highveld' of Zimbabwe. Habitat use, preference, selectivity and overlap were estimated. Predation was negligible and the study concentrated on interspecific competition. 2. Cattle were contained in paddocks, and were moved regularly, while wild ungulates moved freely. Wild ungulate habitat use, preference and selectivity between paddocks with and without cattle were compared, as was the variation in broad diet, group size and densities. 3. All herbivores were selective, with a marked preference for the nutrient-rich Acacia/Dichrostachys vegetation type. Terminalia communities were almost completely avoided. Selectivity increased as the dry season progressed. Habitat overlap was always high. 4. Interspecific competition occurred between cattle and impala, especially during the wet season and the hot dry season. Impala showed a switch in habitat preference and an increase in selectivity and started to concentrate on 'refuge habitat'. Some also switched in their diet composition. During the hot dry season, when resources were at their lowest, most impala stopped using paddocks with cattle. 5. Kudu seemed relatively unaffected by the presence of cattle: the variations observed in kudu spatial behaviour may have been caused by competition with impala.","ECOLE NORMALE SUPER, CNRS, URA 258, ECOL LAB, F-75230 PARIS 05, FRANCE","Fritz, H (corresponding author), CIRAD, EMVT, POB 1378, HARARE, ZIMBABWE.",,"de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/AAI-1550-2019; Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014","de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/0000-0002-5438-1473; Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661",,,,62,91,92,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Recently it was found that Leptopilina heterotoma, an endoparasitoid that attacks Drosophila larvae, avoids one type of patches (decaying stinkhorn mushrooms) when parasitoids of another species (L. clavipes) are present on these patches. L. heterotoma is able to smell the presence oft. clavipes from a distance (Fig. 1). In this paper we investigate the source of the odour that induces avoidance behaviour, by varying the host species and parasitoid species present on stinkhorn mushrooms, and by using another type of patch (sap-fluxes of wounded trees). L. heterotoma was found to avoid stinkhorn patches with conspecific as well as heterospecific parasitoids (Fig. 2). Hosts had to be present in the patch to elicit avoidance, but avoidance behaviour was also found with another host species present in the patch (Pig. 3). No avoidance behaviour was found with sap-flux patches with hosts and parasitoids on them (Pig. 4). Avoidance of stinkhorn patches only occurred when the parasitoids present on the patch were able to contact hosts (Figs. 5 and 6). The exact source of the odour that elicits avoidance is still unclear, so that one can only speculate on the function of the signal. However, there is a clear benefit to the receiver, because it is able to avoid superior competitors. Avoidance can lead to non-aggregated parasitoid distributions. The importance of avoidance behaviour for population dynamics and stability of parasitoid-host systems is discussed.","LEIDEN UNIV,DEPT POPULAT BIOL,2300 RA LEIDEN,NETHERLANDS","JANSSEN, A (corresponding author), UNIV AMSTERDAM,DEPT PURE & APPL ECOL,KRUISLAAN 320,1098 SM AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.",,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,27,43,44,1,16,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

In St. Joseph Bay, FL, USA, pen shells [Atrina rigida (Sol.)] are preyed on by horse conchs [Pleuroploca gigantea (Kiener)]. The shells of dead Atrina are subsequently used as shelters and/or nest sites by a suite of benthic species, including crabs, octopi, and fish. By influencing the rate of new shelter availability, horse conchs may indirectly affect the distribution or reproduction of shell-occupant species. Feeding observations and an exclosure experiment indicate that Atrina are the primary prey of large horse conchs. The abundance of occupant species is strongly correlated to Atrina shell abundance, suggesting that shelter availability may influence population distributions. Experimental additions of new shelters mimicking freshly-killed pen shells caused an increase in the abundance of occupant species. Among these species, the blennies Hypsoblennius hentzi (Leseuer) and Chasmodes saburrae J. & G. and the clingfish Gobiesox strumosus Cope showed an increase in both abundance and frequency of egg-guarding, suggesting an important indirect effect of horse conchs on the distribution and reproductive output of these fish. Because the addition of new shells affected blennies and clingfish more strongly than other occupant species, community composition is influenced by shelter availability. In habitats where biogenic structures are prominent, such as mollusc shells in soft-sediment marine communities, this type of nontrophic indirect effect may be an important component of population and community regulation.",,"KUHLMANN, ML (corresponding author), FLORIDA STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI B142,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32306, USA.",,,,,,,47,13,13,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

We also investigated whether this aggressive behavior is better characterized as interference competition or attempted predation. During staged encounters in laboratory chambers, both male and female resident A. maculatum responded aggressively toward introduced P. cinereus. Direct observations and analysis of videotaped encounters showed that A. maculatum used behavior patterns more similar to those used during predation attempts than to those used in intraspecific interference competition. This aggressive biting by A. maculatum resulted in the consumption of over 9% of the P. cinereus intruders, although most (62%) of the P. cinereus escaped following these strikes.

However, predation is a strong mortality factor for members of the tit guild and predation risk may restrict the selection of foraging sites and organisation of the mixed-species tit flock. We evaluated pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) predation on North European tits and goldcrests. A literature analysis of six areas showed clearly that pygmy owls feed more heavily on those species that forage on exterior tree parts (coal tit P. ater and goldcrest Regulus regulus). These species are also subdominant in mixed-species flocks. The dominant species, crested tit (P. cristatus) and willow tit (P. montanus) were killed less frequently by pygmy owls. These two species forage on the inner parts of trees. The predation or competition hypothesis cannot alone explain the foraging site selection by the dominant species. There is more arthropod food on the outer parts ot branches and predation pressure is also higher on the outer parts of the tree. The most dominant species. crested tit, forages in the middle part of branches. We suggest that in the Parus guild there is a trade-off between predation risk and interspecific competition for food.

This reduction occurs although no mortal injuries to workers can occur (conspecifics are separated by mesh), and despite ad libitum food availability. Thus, decreased brood biomass is a consequence of behavioural decision(s) rather than food limitations or reduced numbers of brood tenders.

We modeled two kinds of competition: mortality of juveniles that found nests near established colonies and competition between established colonies through local crowding. The results of the model indicated that spatial arrangement is affected by the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition as well as by colony birth and date rates. Thus regular spatial arrangement of colonies cannot be used as a test of any type of competitive effects, since other spatial arrangements can also result from strong competition between colonies. Regular intraspecific spatial arrangement is most readily produced by increased mortality of young colonies that settle near established conspecifics (no competition between species). In these model communities, spacing is increasingly regular as density increases (density-dependent spacing). Where competition occurs only between established colonies, nest spacing is random, and the spatial statistics are not related to nest density. Persistence was defined as the length of time that all species in a simulation coexisted. Where competition was intense, intra- and interspecifically, persistence in generations was increased by low colony death rates and by large absolute numbers of colonies. The adult-adult component of interspecific competition is relatively less important to species persistence than are adult-juvenile effects.","UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, DEPT BIOL, C-016, LA JOLLA, CA 92093 USA",,,,,,,,50,69,70,0,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Because wrens did not consume the egg contents, the behavior is not predation. Wrens attacked nests only within their own territories but often in vegetation not used as nesting substrate. Hence, the behavior probably does not represent attempts at cuckoldry or mate displacement, or competition for nest sites. Nest destruction may represent intraspecific or interspecific competition for (1) food or (2) predator-free nesting space. Evidence supporting these nonexclusive hypotheses are that food limits reproductive success in this population of wrens, and nest predation was density dependent in this population (natural nests surrounded by experimental nests showed higher predation rates than controls). Major predators included snakes, especially whipsnakes (Masticophis spp.), which are able to access Cactus Wren nests despite cholla (Opuntia spp.) spines.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA",,,"simons, Lee/AAR-6686-2020",,,,,22,10,12,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,NOV,1990,92,4,,,,,855,860,,10.2307/1368721,,,6,Ornithology,Zoology,EP836,WOS:A1990EP83600005,,,,,2021-09-21,

We integrated both qualitative scores and new quantitative measures to compare predatory scarring left by killer whales on the three species. We found statistically significant interspecies differences in incidence, location, and accumulation rates of scarring. Gray whales showed a higher incidence of predatory scarring compared to the other two species. Humpback and gray whales bore most of their rake marks on the trailing edge of the tail fluke, while blue whales showed more evidence of predatory scarring on the leading edge of the fluke, potentially consistent with previously hypothesized theories of flee versus fight responses to killer whales for different mysticete species. Of whales with scarring, blue whales were twice as likely to suffer from fluke mutilation compared to humpback and gray whales. Humpback and gray whales were also significantly more likely to accumulate new rake marks over the years compared to blue whales. We examine how these differences provide insight into the prey-specific hunting behavior of killer whales.","[Corsi, Enrico; Calambokidis, John; Flynn, Kiirsten R.; Steiger, Gretchen H.] Cascadia Res Collect, 218 1-2 W 4th Ave, Olympia, WA 89501 USA","Calambokidis, J (corresponding author), Cascadia Res Collect, 218 1-2 W 4th Ave, Olympia, WA 89501 USA.",calambokidis@cascadiaresearch.org,,,NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"We would like to dedicate this publication to the loving memory of our coauthor Gretchen H.

Body size is a fundamental trait that impacts many aspects of species biology and ecology. It is, in turn, influenced by a suite of environmental factors, and often decreases with warming. Although environmental conditions can also impact body shape, which is another functional trait that influences locomotion, resource acquisition and potentially physiological processes, such responses are poorly understood and rarely quantified. 2. We experimentally tested the independent and combined effects of environmental temperature, resource level and interspecific competition on the body shape and size responses of two model protist species. We also tested the degree to which these individual--level phenotypic responses are associated with population densities and species coexistence. 3. Body shape was strongly influenced by resource competition, whereas body size changes were mainly driven by environmental temperature. In both species, lower resource levels resulted in body shape elongation, suggesting that relatively more elongate individuals with potentially higher swimming speed were advantaged in the resource scarce environment. However, competition had contrasting influence on the body shape of the two species. Competition decreased the population densities of Blepharisma japonicum, which exhibited relative body shape elongation, similar to the response at low resource levels. In contrast, competition increased the population densities of Paramecium aurelia, which exhibited reduced elongation similar to body shape response at high resource levels. Hence, body shape responses could be indicative of changes in resource availability, aiding our understanding of competitive hierarchies and species interactions. 4. Coexistence was observed in all treatment combinations, likely because body size of both species decreased similarly under warming, potentially maintaining constant per capita competitive intensity. These findings, along with recent research on phytoplankton, diverse pelagic invertebrates, and birds highlight the importance of body shape and morphology across different taxonomic groups. Hence, we call for body size and shape to be considered in concert when investigating ecological consequences of climate warming.","[Tan, Hanrong; Kratina, Pavel] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Hirst, Andrew G.] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell, England; [Hirst, Andrew G.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, Lyngby, Denmark; [Atkinson, David] Univ Liverpool, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Kratina, P (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England.",p.kratina@qmul.ac.uk,"; Atkinson, David/D-4664-2009","Tan, Hanrong/0000-0002-0365-1592; Atkinson, David/0000-0002-9956-2454; Hirst, Andrew/0000-0001-9132-1886",Principal's Postgraduate Research Studentship,Principal's Postgraduate Research Studentship,,62,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Ecologically similar species are expected to exclude one another from suitable habitat, so the coexistence of two mouse lemur species in an assemblage of several closely related cheirogaleid primates in the central Menabe region of Madagascar requires explanation. We assessed the occurrence of Madame Berthe's mouse lemurs (Microcebus berthae) and Gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), and of two larger cheirogaleids, Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) and the western fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), by nocturnal line transect walks between 2003 and 2007. We explored interspecific interactions for four different scenarios with varying resource availability (degraded and non-degraded habitat in the wet and dry season), both on the regional spatial scale and on a finer local (transect) scale. We tested whether the interspecific distribution of mouse lemur individuals indicates interspecific competition and whether their regional coexistence might be stabilized by interactions with M. coquereli or C. medius. We developed the Inter-Species Index of Attraction (ISIA) to quantify the observed interspecific interactions within transects and determined if these were significantly different from a null model generated by a combination of randomization and bootstrapping to control for intraspecific aggregation. For the two mouse lemurs, interspecific spatial exclusion was most pronounced during the resource-poor dry season, consistent with the hypothesis of feeding competition. Seasonally varying distribution patterns indicated resource tracking in a spatio-temporally heterogeneous environment. The interspecific distribution of individuals suggested that the larger cheirogaleids benefit M. berthae at the expense of the more abundant M. murinus: spatial associations of both, M. coquereli and C. medius, with M. murinus were negative in most scenarios and across spatial scales, but neutral or even positive with M. berthae. Thus, our study revealed that coexistence among ecologically similar heterospecifics can rely on complex density-mediated interspecific processes varying with habitat quality and season. With regard to the stability of animal assemblages, this insight has major implications for biodiversity conservation.","[Schaeffler, Livia] Leibniz Inst Anim Biodivers, Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Ctr Biodivers Monitoring, Conservat Ecol Sect, Bonn, Germany; [Schaeffler, Livia; Kappeler, Peter M.] Leibniz Inst Primate Res, German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany; [Halley, John M.] Univ Ioannina, Dept Biol Applicat & Technol, Ioannina, Greece","Schaffler, L (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Anim Biodivers, Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Ctr Biodivers Monitoring, Conservat Ecol Sect, Bonn, Germany.; Schaffler, L (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Primate Res, German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany.",l.schaeffler@leibniz-zfmk.de,,,German Primate Center (DPZ); Primate Conservation Incorporated (PCI) [359]; Conservation International (CI); Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT); Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig (ZFMK),"This study was completed with financial support from the German Primate Center (DPZ), Primate Conservation Incorporated (PCI Grant #359), Conservation International (CI), Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT) and with authorization by the CAFF/CORE committee, and the National Association for the Management of Protected Areas (ANGAP).

To evaluate the effect of occupied territory on wood decay rate and competitive outcome, we set up a pairing competition experiment using beech wood blocks colonised by three brown-rot and three white-rot basidiomycetes. All white-brown combinations (totalling nine), and five ratios of wood volume (4:0, 3:1, 2:2,1:3, 0:4) were performed. Pairings were incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C for 3 months, and then competition outcome and wood weight loss were determined. Mycelia occupying larger territory were more competitive than mycelia occupying smaller territory. There were negative relationships between wood volume and percentage wood weight loss. Wood decay was slower at the competition front than at the rear of the wood blocks in some cases. These results suggest that wood volume (territory size) affects both competition outcome and wood decay rate in basidiomycete communities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

Here the competition relationships are assumed to be of the Beddington-DeAngelis type. In particular, we consider a situation where first species disperses by a combination of random walk and directed movement along with the population distribution of the second species which disperse randomly within the habitat. We obtain a set of results regarding the qualitative properties of this advective competition system. First of all, we show that this system is globally well-posed and its solutions are classical and uniformly bounded in time. Then we study its steady states in a one-dimensional interval by examining the combined effects of diffusion and advection on the existence and stability of nonconstant positive steady states of the strongly coupled elliptic system. Our stability result of these nontrivial steady states provides a selection mechanism for stable wavemodes of the time-dependent system. Moreover, in the limit of diffusion rates, the steady states of this fully elliptic system can be approximated by nonconstant positive solutions of a shadow system that admits boundary spikes and layers. Furthermore, for the fully elliptic system, we construct solutions with a single boundary spike or an inverted boundary spike, i.e., the first species concentrates on a boundary point while the second species dominates the remaining habitat. These spatial structures model the spatial segregation phenomenon through interspecific competitions. Finally, we perform some numerical simulations to illustrate and support our theoretical findings.","[Wang, Qi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Math, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Jin, Ling] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Math, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Zhang, Zengyan] Univ South Carolina, Dept Math, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Wang, Q (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Math, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",qwang@swufe.edu.cn; jin@ou.edu; zengyan@email.sc.edu,,"Zhang, Zengyan/0000-0002-4139-0012; Wang, Qi/0000-0003-2612-8224","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JBK2002002, JBK1805001]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11501460]",QW acknowledges the support the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. JBK2002002 and No. JBK1805001) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11501460).,,55,0,0,3,4,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",1078-0947,1553-5231,,DISCRETE CONT DYN-A,Discret.

However, exactly how the subordinate species coexists with superior species is unknown. In the forests west of Beijing City, intense asymmetrical interactions of food competition exist among granivorous rodents (e.g. Apodemus peninsulae, Niviventer confucianus, Sciurotamias davidianus and Tscherskia triton) that have broadly overlapping habitats and diets but have varied body size (range 15-300 g), hoarding habits (scatter vs larder) and/or daily rhythm (diurnal vs nocturnal). The smallest rodent, A. peninsulae, which typically faces high competitive pressure from larger rodents, is an ideal model to explore how subordinate species coexist with superior species. Under semi-natural enclosure conditions, we tested responses of seed-hoarding behavior in A. peninsulae to intraspecific and interspecific competitors in the situations of pre-competition (without competitor), competition (with competitor) and post-competition (competitor removed). The results showed that for A. peninsulae, the intensity of larder-hoarding increased and the intensity of scatter-hoarding declined in the presence of intraspecifics and S. davidianus, whereas A. peninsulae ceased foraging and hoarding in the presence of N. confucianus and T. triton. A. peninsulae reduced intensity of hoarding outside the nest and moved more seeds into the nest for larder-hoarding under competition from intraspecific individuals and S. davidianus. In most cases, the experimental animals could recover to their original state of pre-competition when competitors were removed. These results suggest that subordinate species contextually regulate their food-hoarding strategies according to different competitors, promoting species coexistence among sympatric animals that have asymmetrical food competition.","[Niu, Hongyu; Zhang, Jie; Wang, Zhiyong; Huang, Guangchuan; Peng, Chao; Zhang, Hongmao] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",zhanghm@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31772471]; self-determined research funds of CCNU from the colleges' basic research and operation of MOE [CCNU17A02017],"We thank F.

In austral temporary wetlands, arid-area adapted specialist copepods are key predators for much of the hydroperiod. Limited autoecological information relating to species interactions negates understandings of trophic dynamics in these systems. In the present study, we examined multiple predator effects of two key predatory paradiaptomid copepods which often coexist in austral temporary wetlands, Lovenula raynerae Suarez-Morales, Wasserman and Dalu 2015 and Paradiaptomus lamellatus Sars, 1985. Predation rates towards larval mosquito prey across different water depths were quantified. Using a comparative functional response approach, individual L. raynerae exhibited significantly higher feeding rates than P. lamellatus, characterised by higher attack rates, shorter handling times and higher maximum feeding rates. Increasing water depth tended to negatively affect prey consumption, particularly for L. raynerae. Interspecific multiple predator consumption combined additively, and thus prey risks were well-predicted from consumption rates by individual paradiaptomid copepod species, irrespective of water depth. Our results suggest that increasing copepod predator diversity in austral temporary wetland ecosystems additively heightens prey risk across different water volumes, and may help to regulate disease vector mosquito populations. Therefore, the numerical extent, phenology and diversity of predator hatching events during the hydroperiod may substantially mediate interaction strengths in these ecosystems.","[Cuthbert, Ross N.; Dick, Jaimie T.

Our results demonstrate that access to anthropogenic foods can alter a top predator's diet. Namely, dingoes showed a preference for eating the desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor) in areas where food waste was restricted, whereas dingo diets did not reflect ambient prey availability at areas where food waste was constantly available. Reduced availability of food waste also affected interactions between dingoes, with cannibalism decreasing where food waste was removed, and it may have increased consumption of a subordinate mesopredator, the feral cat (Felis catus). By implication, efforts to manage food waste could reestablish or strengthen interactions between predators and their wild prey with possible cascading consequences for ecosystems.","[Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Howden, Chris] Univ Sydney, Sydney Informat Hub, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Wirsing, Aaron J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Newsome, TM (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",thomas.newsome@sydney.edu.au,,"Newsome, Thomas/0000-0003-3457-3256",Newmont Tanami Operations; Central Land Council,"This project was funded and supported by Newmont Tanami Operations and the Central Land Council.

Understanding the factors underlying the abundance and distribution of species requires the consideration of a complex suite of interacting biotic and abiotic factors operating on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Larval mosquitoes inhabiting small human-constructed ponds represent a unique opportunity to investigate the relative importance of these structuring mechanisms while simultaneously generating applied knowledge on mosquito control. 2. A multi-year field survey of 32 stormwater ponds was conducted in central Illinois (Champaign County). From each pond, data were collected on pond structure type and hydroperiod, the presence/absence of cattails (Typha spp.), and measures of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon, and chlorophyll a. The communities of crustacean zooplankton and aquatic insects were characterised, and these taxa were assigned into two main groups: predators and competitors of larval mosquitoes. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the direct and indirect effects of these biotic and abiotic factors on larval density for three species of culicine mosquitoes (Culex pipiens, Culex restuans, and Aedes vexans). 3. Hydroperiod had an indirect negative effect on C. pipiens density. However, this effect was mediated by predator density; more permanent ponds had more predators, which therefore reduced the density of C. pipiens larvae. Aedes vexans density was positively correlated with predator density. No predictor variables were found that explained variation in C. restuans density. 4. This study show that the relative importance of these biotic and abiotic factors varies among species of culicine mosquitoes inhabiting stormwater ponds.","[Holmes, Christopher J.; Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Holmes, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave,515 Morrill Hall,MC-122, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cholmes@life.illinois.edu,,"Holmes, Christopher/0000-0003-3981-0759","United States National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1754115]; University of Illinois Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment; Department of Animal Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; School of Integrative Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","We first thank Andrew J.

Within northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) offshore habitats, higher abundance of tropically associated lane snapper Lutjanus synagris is correlated with rising temperatures. Increased presence of juvenile and adult lane snapper could result in important competitive interactions with nGOM reef fishes, such as economically important red snapper L. campechanus, at multiple life stages and cause shifts in resource utilization and species composition of offshore fish assemblages. We investigated interactions between adult and juvenile lane and red snapper within experimental mesocosms. Although no significant effects on prey consumption were observed, interspecific competition between adults and juveniles was strongest, as adult lane snapper utilized habitats at higher rates than single juvenile red snapper in interaction trials. Additionally, adult red snapper most strongly displaced single juvenile lane snapper and increased their swimming activities in the presence of heterospecific juveniles. Adult red snapper also aggressively chased juvenile lane snapper and displaced them from habitats. However, less pronounced effects were observed for grouped juveniles in the presence of adults, especially juvenile red snapper, while adult lane snapper swam less in the presence of grouped juvenile lane and red snapper. Additionally, single juvenile red snapper swimming activities and prey consumption in the presence of adult snappers did not significantly differ from control values. Therefore, at small scales adult lane snapper may partially displace single juvenile red snapper, but clusters of red and lane snapper juveniles may be resilient to competitive effects of adult lane snapper and exert partial competitive pressures on them. As expected, we found that elevated aggressiveness by larger individuals resulted in dominance in space occupancy in one-on-one interactions. These findings suggest that prior occupation of preferred hard bottom habitat may be a determining factor for grouped juvenile red snapper competing against similar sized or larger individuals. Overall, our results indicate varying competitive vulnerabilities of red snapper to climate-related range expansions of tropical congeners.","[Marshak, Anthony R.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Marshak, Anthony R.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Marshak, Anthony R.] ECS Fed LLC, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Sci & Technol, 1315 East West Highway,F-ST7, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","Marshak, AR (corresponding author), Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA.; Marshak, AR (corresponding author), Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA.; Marshak, AR (corresponding author), ECS Fed LLC, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Sci & Technol, 1315 East West Highway,F-ST7, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",tony.marshak@noaa.gov,,,Richard C.

As it stands, we know little of what causes this variation. Classic competition theory predicts that competition will increase with niche overlap and population density. And classic hypotheses of herbivorous insect diversification predict that diet specialists will be superior competitors to generalists. Here, we test these predictions using phylogenetic meta-analysis. We estimate the effects of diet breadth, population density and proxies of niche overlap: phylogenetic relatedness, physical proximity and feeding-guild membership. As predicted, we find that competition between herbivorous insects increases with population density as well as phylogenetic and physical proximity. Contrary to predictions, competition tends to be stronger between than within feeding guilds and affects specialists as much as generalists. This is the first statistical evidence that niche overlap increases competition between herbivorous insects. However, niche overlap is not everything; complex feeding guild effects indicate important indirect interactions.","[Bird, Gwendolyn; Kaczvinsky, Chloe; Hardy, Nate B.] Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Wilson, Alan E.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Bird, G (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",gmb0032@auburn.edu,,"Kaczvinsky, Chloe/0000-0003-2802-2976; Bird, Gwendolyn/0000-0002-6642-3845","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1744552]; Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture","We thank three anonymous reviewers as well as John Beckman, Jay Rosenheim and Jeff Stauch for comments on a draft of the manuscript, Ramona Cox for assisting with data collection, and Todd Steury, Ash Abebe and Ryan Weaver for assistance with statistical models.

Our objectives were to evaluate the interaction between the effects of elevated temperatures and competitor identity on growth and habitat selection behavior of semi-aquatic salamanders in stream mesocosms. We observed interference competition between small and large species. Elevated temperatures had a negative effect on the larger species and a neutral effect on the smaller species. At elevated temperatures, the strength of interference competition declined, and the smaller species co-occupied the same aquatic cover objects as the larger species more frequently. Disruptions in competitive interactions in this community may affect habitat use patterns and decrease selection for character displacement among species.

This study was conducted with the Project Good Management data (Embrapa/CIFOR/ITTO) - Sustainable management of production forests on a commercial scale in the Brazilian Amazon, developed by Embrapa Amazonia Oriental in the arca of Jari Florcstal SA, in the municipality of Vitoria do Jari. State of Amapa. Three permanent plots were used of one hectare each (100 x 100 m), on which were measured all trees with DBH >= 20 cm. The following IIDs were compared: G (basal area/ha), BAL (Basal Area of Larger Trees), Glover and Hool and Stage. The competition indices were evaluated by analysis of linear correlation coefficients between each index and the PAI DBH (cm(-1)) variable. The significance of the correlation coefficients was evaluated by p value (alpha = 0.05). All variations of indexes tested resulted in correlations of up to 20%, considered to be very weak. This indicates that IIDs can represent only partially the competition in tropical natural forests. However, among the indexes, the BAL index is the IID that presented the highest correlation with the PAI DBH (r = -0.212 and p = 0.000) in plots of 50 mx 50 m and, therefore, even if it has a low correlation, it is the indicated for competition studies on diametric growth in natural tropical forests. A spatial relationship of the IIDs was detected, where the correlation decreases with the increase of the plot size. Additional research is recommended to evaluate the effects of competition on tree growth, as well to increase understanding of intraspecific and interspecific competition in order to improve knowledge of the competition dynamics in tropical forests.","[Vatraz, Silvana] Univ Fed Rural Amazonia, Inst Ciencias Agr, Av Perimetral 2501, BR-66077530 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Macedo Silva, Jose Natalino] Univ Fed Rural Amazonia, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Florestais, Av Perimetral 2501, BR-66077530 Belem, Para, Brazil","Vatraz, S (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Amazonia, Inst Ciencias Agr, Av Perimetral 2501, BR-66077530 Belem, Para, Brazil.",vatraz@yahoo.com.br; silvanatalino734@gmail.com; post@denisalder.com,,"Silva, Jose/0000-0003-4068-2432",,,,44,3,3,0,1,"CENTRO PESQUISAS FLORESTAIS, UFSM",SANTA MARIA,"DEPT CIENCIAS FLORESTAIS, CAMPUS UNIV, CAIXA POSTAL 5096, SANTA MARIA, RS 00000, BRAZIL",0103-9954,1980-5098,,CIENC FLOREST,Cienc.

Incorporating interspecific interactions in predictive models is common in ecology, yet most methods do not adequately account for indirect interactions (where an interaction between two species is masked by their shared interactions with a third) and assume interactions do not vary along environmental gradients. Markov random fields (MRF) overcome these limitations by estimating interspecific interactions, while controlling for indirect interactions, from multispecies occurrence data. We illustrate the utility of MRFs for ecologists interested in interspecific interactions, and demonstrate how covariates can be included (a set of models known as Conditional Random Fields, CRF) to infer how interactions vary along environmental gradients. We apply CRFs to two data sets of presence-absence data. The first illustrates how blood parasite (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and nematode microfilaria spp.) co-infection probabilities covary with relative abundance of their avian hosts. The second shows that co-occurrences between mosquito larvae and predatory insects vary along water temperature gradients. Other applications are discussed, including the potential to identify replacement or shifting impacts of highly connected species along climate or land-use gradients.

However, recent theoretical work has challenged this view, arguing that a biased OSR does not necessarily result in greater monopolisation of mates and therefore stronger sexual selection in the mate-limited sex. Hence, the role of the OSR for shaping animal mating systems remains a conundrum in sexual selection research. Here we took a meta-analytic approach to test whether OSR explains interspecific variation in sexual selection metrics across a broad range of animal taxa. Our results demonstrate that the OSR predicts the opportunity for sexual selection in males and the direction of sexual selection in terms of sex differences in both the opportunity for sexual selection and the Bateman gradient (i.e. the selection differential of mating success), as predicted by classic theory.","[Janicke, Tim; Morrow, Edward H.] Univ Sussex, Ecol Behav & Environm Grp, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Janicke, Tim] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonctionnelle & Evolut, UMR 5175,Ecole Prat Hautes Etudes, Montpellier, France","Janicke, T (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonctionnelle & Evolut, UMR 5175,Ecole Prat Hautes Etudes, Montpellier, France.; Janicke, T (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Evolut Behav & Environm Grp, Sch Life Sci, John Maynard Smith Bldg, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",janicke.tim@gmail.com,"Morrow, Edward/C-2358-2011; Janicke, Tim/B-8912-2008; Morrow, Edward H/Q-6730-2019","Morrow, Edward/0000-0002-1853-7469; Janicke, Tim/0000-0002-1453-6813; Morrow, Edward H/0000-0002-1853-7469",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PA00P3-145375/1]; Royal Society University Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London,"We are grateful to Nils Anthes and Ines K.

We tested the hypothesis that potential intraspecific abundance is a more powerful predictor of detection of a novel food source than interspecific abundance and predation risk. The hypothesis was tested using latency of Great Tits Parus major to find bird-feeders in relation to the abundance of Great Tit and other birds, as well as cats recorded close to novel feeders in urban and rural habitats. Data were collected during winter 2013/2014 in eight cities and nearby rural areas across Poland. Generalized linear models, multimodel inference and hierarchical partitioning showed that the probability that Great Tits used a novel birdfeeder was positively correlated both with the number of Great Tits and all other tits combined in the vicinity of feeders. Latency in feeder usage was negatively related to the number of conspecifics, and it was less strongly negatively related to the number of other fits and the abundance of all other species. The effect of the number of other tits interacted with the environment; the number of tits positively correlated with latency in rural areas, while this relationship was negative in urban areas. Latency until arrival at a feeder was shorter for males than for females. The effect of cats at feeders on bird behaviour was statistically non-significant. Thus, latency until arrival at novel birdfeeders was predicted by local population size and abundance of other bird species, but not mammalian predators, and this relationship may be altered by the environment.","[Tryjanowski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Skorka, Piotr] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Mickiewicza 33, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, AgroParisTech,Ecol Syst Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France","Tryjanowski, P (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.",piotrtryjanowski@gmail.com,"Moller, Anders/O-6665-2016","Moller, Anders/0000-0003-3739-4675; Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797; Skorka, Piotr/0000-0002-3221-296X","grant Sonata Bis from the National Science Centre, Poland [4 - 2014/14/E/NZ8/00165]","We thank A.

A recent study suggested that the invasive apple snail, Pomacea maculata, was considerably more vulnerable to crayfish predators than the native Florida apple snail, P. paludosa. The difference was hypothesized to be caused by the relatively small hatchling size of P. maculata. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of feeding assays designed to quantify maximum feeding rates and selective foraging of crayfish on apple snails. The rate at which crayfish killed individual P. maculata (i.e., kill rates) decreased with snail size, and kill rates on both species increased with crayfish size. Kill rates on juvenile P. maculata were higher than kill rates on size-matched hatchling P. paludosa, and crayfish fed selectively on P. maculata when offered mixed groups of size-matched snails. Further analyses revealed that hatchling P. paludosa possess shells 1.8x heavier than size-matched P. maculata suggesting differences in vulnerability to crayfish were consistent with interspecific differences in shell defenses. Differences in hatchling size and defensive traits in combination make crayfish kill rates on hatchling P. maculata approximately 15.4x faster than on hatchling P. paludosa, but the relative contribution of hatchling size to differences in apple snail vulnerability was > 3x greater than the contribution of defensive traits.","[Davidson, Andrew T.; Dorn, Nathan J.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA","Davidson, AT (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA.",davidsona2014@fau.edu,,,,,,53,1,1,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,1573-5125,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

Nature contains many different types of biotic interactions (notably mutualism, commensalism, predation, amensalism, and competition), and it is difficult to compare the effects of multiple interaction types on species' distributions. To resolve this problem, we analyze a general, flexible model of pairwise biotic interactions that can describe all interaction types. In the absence of strong positive feedback, a species' ability to be present depends on its ability to increase in numbers when it is rare and the species it is interacting with is at equilibrium. This insight leads to counterintuitive conclusions. Notably, we often predict the same range limit when the focal species experiences competition, predation, or amensalism. Similarly, we often predict the same range margin or when the species experiences mutualism, commensalism, or benefits from prey. In the presence of strong positive density-dependent feedback, different species interactions produce different range limits in our model. In all cases, the abiotic environment can indirectly influence the impact of biotic interactions on range limits. We illustrate the implications of this observation by analyzing a stress gradient where biotic interactions are harmful in benign environments but beneficial in stressful environments. Our results emphasize the need to consider the effects of all biotic interactions on species' range limits and provide a systematic comparison of when biotic interactions affect distributions.","[Godsoe, William] Ctr Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res, Ellesmere Junct Rd,Springs Rd,POB 85084, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand; [Holland, Nathaniel J.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Sci & Res 2, Room 369,4800 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Cosner, Chris] Univ Miami, Dept Math, 1365 Mem Dr,Ungar 417, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Kendall, Bruce E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Brett, Angela] Hagley Community Coll, POB 3084, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Jankowski, Jill] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Holt, Robert D.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Godsoe, W (corresponding author), Ctr Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res, Ellesmere Junct Rd,Springs Rd,POB 85084, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand.",William.Godsoe@lincoln.ac.nz,"Godsoe, William/L-7987-2013; Kendall, Bruce/C-1871-2008","Godsoe, William/0000-0003-1697-6916; Kendall, Bruce/0000-0003-1782-8106","Biotic Interactions Working Group at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Homeland SecurityUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS); US Department of Agriculture through NSF Award [EF-0832858, DBI-1300426]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1300426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by the Biotic Interactions Working Group at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the US Department of Homeland Security, and the US Department of Agriculture through NSF Award Nos.

Niche partitioning, though, is contingent upon resource heterogeneity, and recent landscape homogenization may limit the abilities of carnivores to partition niche space. The negative fitness consequences associated with niche overlap may be particularly problematic for repatriating carnivores, and could delay the recovery of rare or endangered species. American martens (Martes americana) and fishers (Pekania pennanti) are the most commonly translocated carnivores in North America and both were reintroduced to a highly modified landscape in Wisconsin, United States. To date, fishers have flourished while martens remain endangered. To assess the role of competition in marten recovery, we used a combination of occupancy modeling, point pattern analyses, and stable isotope analyses to assess 5 coexistence mechanisms: spatial segregation, dietary segregation, temporal avoidance, and differential use of habitat and snow features. Over 7 years, we observed consistently high fisher occupancy and consistently low marten occupancy. Moreover, martens and fishers overlapped in their use of space and time, and neither exhibited habitat preferences. Isotopic analyses revealed complete dietary overlap, with martens falling entirely within the isotopic niche of fishers. Deep, uncompressed snow, however, had a negative effect on fisher activity. We propose that extensive landscape homogenization has resulted in niche compression and that marten recovery has been limited by increased competition with fishers. Restoration programs often overlook competitive interactions, but our results emphasize the importance of interspecific competition for recovering carnivore populations and highlight the challenge of reconstructing carnivore communities in increasingly homogenized landscapes.","[Manlick, Philip J.; Zuckerberg, Benjamin; Pauli, Jonathan N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Woodford, James E.] Bur Nat Heritage Conservat, Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, 107 Sutliff Ave, Rhinelander, WI 54501 USA","Manlick, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",pmanlick@wisc.edu,,"Manlick, Philip/0000-0001-9143-9446","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project [229713]; USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project (229713).

Full sunlight conditions in open clear-cuts may limit he activity of ants as soil surface temperatures reach lethal levels. Therefore, differences may be expected between the diurnal and nocturnal activity of ants, and in the interactions between ant species. These predictions, however, have been poorly investigated so far. 2. The circadian activity of ants in clear-cuts in managed forests in Poland was investigated. Repeated counts of ants were performed during the day and the following night at the clear-cut edge and in the clear-cut interior. Interspecific interactions and the effect of plant coverage were also considered. 3. Abundances of Formica fusca Linnaeus and red wood ants were higher during the day, whereas Myrmica were more common at night. Formica fusca, Lasius and red wood ants were more common at the clear-cut edge than in the interior. Mvrtnica showed the opposite pattern, but at night, its numbers increased at the edge. Plant coverage positively affected F.fusca and red wood ants. 4. Red wood ants tended to be negatively associated with Lasius, whereas they were neutral for Efusca. The negative association of red wood ants and was stronger during the day compared to night. 5. The time of day was a strong driver of ant activity in the clear-cuts, whereas the distribution of red wood ants was of lesser importance. It is concluded that circadian activity may substantially contribute to niche separation between coexisting species, therefore, studies performed exclusively during the day cannot reflect the real structure of the community.","[Zmihorski, Michal] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Zmihorski, Michal; Slipinski, Piotr] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Warsaw, Poland","Zmihorski, M (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",michal.zmihorski@gmail.com,,", Michal/0000-0002-2951-3462; Zmihorski, Michal/0000-0001-5137-1635; Slipinski, Piotr/0000-0002-7336-4134",Iuventus Plus - Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland [IP2011 064771],"This research was funded by a grant from Iuventus Plus (IP2011 064771) funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland.

We predicted that the negative interactions between the two fleas will result in smaller blood meals and shorter survival time in mixed- versus single-species infestations. We also predicted that the negative effect of mixed-species infestation on feeding performance would be less pronounced when fleas exploited their characteristic host rather than a non-characteristic host. When exploiting a characteristic host, P. chephrenis took larger blood meals in single- than in mixed-species groups, whereas the blood meal size in X. ramesis did not differ between treatments. When exploiting a non-characteristic host, no effect of group composition was found in either flea species. Survival time after a single blood meal was not affected by co-infestation or host species in either flea. Our results suggest context-dependence of the negative effect of co-infestation on feeding performance in fleas with the manifestation of this effect varying in dependence of flea and host species identities.","[Khokhlova, Irina S.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, French Associates Inst Agr & Biotechnol Drylands, Wyler Dept Dryland Agr, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Dlugosz, Elizabeth M.; Krasnov, Boris R.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Swiss Inst Dryland Environm & Energy Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Dlugosz, Elizabeth M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Plant Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Krasnov, B (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Swiss Inst Dryland Environm & Energy Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",krasnov@bgu.ac.il,"Krasnov, Boris R./F-2234-2012; Khokhlova, Irina/F-2235-2012","Krasnov, Boris R./0000-0002-0382-3331; Khokhlova, Irina/0000-0003-0169-7770",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [26/12]; Blaustein Center for Scientific Cooperation; Kreitman School of Advanced Graduate Studies; Swiss Institute for Dryland Environmental and Energy Research (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev),"This study was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 26/12 to BRK and ISK).

Large carnivores are of particular importance in shaping community structure since they are at the top of the food chain, and many efforts are made to conserve such keystone species. Despite this, the mechanisms of carnivore interactions are far from understood, yet they are key to enabling or hindering their coexistence and hence are highly relevant for their conservation. The goal of this review is thus to provide detailed information on the extents of competition and facilitation between large carnivores and their impact in shaping their life histories. Here, we use the example of spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and lions (Panthera leo) and provide a comprehensive knowledge of their interactions based on meta-analyses from available literature (148 publications). Despite their strong potential for both exploitation and interference competition (range and diet overlap, intraguild predation and kleptoparasitism), we underline some mechanisms facilitating their coexistence (different prey-age selection and scavenging opportunities). We stress the fact that prey abundance is key to their coexistence and that hyaenas forming very large groups in rich ecosystems could have a negative impact on lions. We show that the coexistence of spotted hyaenas and lions is a complex balance between competition and facilitation, and that prey availability within the ecosystem determines which predator is dominant. However, there are still many gaps in our knowledge such as the spatio-temporal dynamics of their interactions. As both species' survival becomes increasingly dependent on protected areas, where their densities can be high, it is critical to understand their interactions to inform both reintroduction programs and protected area management.","[Periquet, Stephanie; Fritz, Herve] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, LBBE, UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Revilla, Eloy] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain","Periquet, S (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, LBBE, UMR 5558, Batiment Gregor Mendel 43,Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",stephanie.periquet@gmail.com,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014; Revilla, Eloy/B-5100-2008; Periquet, Stephanie/J-9979-2019","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661; Revilla, Eloy/0000-0001-5534-5581; Periquet, Stephanie/0000-0001-8901-3729","CNRS INEE [Institut Ecologie et Environnement]; CNRS [Zones Ateliers programme]; CNRS [Agence National de la Recherche FEAR project] [ANR-08-BLAN-0022]; ENS of Lyon; UCBL Lyon 1; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation - FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2009-07301/BOS, CGL2012-35931/BOS]","This study was conducted in the framework of the HERD program (Hwange Environmental Research Development), funded by the CNRS INEE [Institut Ecologie et Environnement, Zones Ateliers programme, the Agence National de la Recherche FEAR project (ANR-08-BLAN-0022)].

We made use of a recent colonisation of Ural Owls (Strix uralensis) in southern Poland to compare habitat preferences of Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) allopatry and sympatry with Ural Owls. We investigated spatial niche segregation of Ural Owl and the Tawny Owl in sympatry and compared habitat preferences of Tawny Owls breeding in allopatry and sympatry. Tawny Owls breeding in sympatry with Ural Owls occupied forests with higher canopy compactness, sites located closer to forest border and to built-up areas, as well as stands with a higher share of fir and spruce and a lower share of beech as compared to sites occupied by Ural Owls. Allopatric Tawny Owls occupied sites with lower canopy compactness and bred at sites located further from forest borders and in stands with lower share of fir and spruce and a higher share of deciduous as compared to sympatric Tawny Owls. As Ural owls are dominant in relation to Tawny Owls, this indicates that the presence of Ural Owls prevents Tawny Owls from occupying deciduous-dominated and old stands located in forest interior areas, far from buildings and forest edges. The results support habitat displacement between the two species when breeding in sympatry. We also show that protection of large forest patches is crucial for the Ural Owl, a species still rare in central Europe, while small patches are occupied by the abundant Tawny Owl.","[Kajtoch, Lukasz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland; [Zmihorski, Michal] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Wieczorek, Pawel] Reg Directorate Environm Protect Krakow, PL-30107 Krakow, Poland","Kajtoch, L (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland.",lukasz.kajtoch@gmail.com,"Kajtoch, Lukasz/B-4236-2012","Kajtoch, Lukasz/0000-0001-7345-9400; , Michal/0000-0002-2951-3462; Zmihorski, Michal/0000-0001-5137-1635","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [9007/IP1/2014/72]","We are grateful to Krzysztof Kus and Piotr Skucha for providing information about some owls territories.

Third instars of the invasive blow fly Chrysomya rufifacies are facultative predators on larvae of the native blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria. 2. The effects of priority arrival time on the survivorship and fitness of C. rufifacies and C. macellaria were investigated in laboratory experiments. 3. Cochliomyia macellaria colonising a resource within 1-2 days after C. rufifacies resulted in a 20-70% reduction in survivorship, pupal weight and fecundity compared with those colonising a resource more than 2 days before or after C. rufifacies. Inversely, C. rufifacies exhibited a 50% increase in survivorship and fecundity when closely (approximate to 2 days) associated temporally on the resource with C. macellaria and was negatively affected by disparate arrival. 4. These results demonstrate that arrival sequence significantly affects the fitness of both C. rufifacies and C. macellaria. Early colonisation may allow C. macellaria to persist in a community, while there are fitness benefits for C. rufifacies colonising after C. macellaria. 5. The 60% reduction in C. macellaria survivorship when in close temporal association with C. rufifacies may act as an agent of selection for C. macellaria to colonise a resource early and develop quickly to avoid predation on resources colonised by C. rufifacies. 6. Selection for such traits may explain how C. macellaria is able to persist despite intraguild predation by this invasive species. In contrast, the 50% increase in survivorship and fecundity exhibited by C. rufifacies when arriving after C. macellaria may select for C. rufifacies to delay colonisation.","[Brundage, Adrienne; Tomberlin, Jeffery K.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Benbow, Mark Eric] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Benbow, Mark Eric] Michigan State Univ, Dept Osteopath Med, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Tomberlin, JK (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77845 USA.",jktomberlin@tamu.edu,"Benbow, Mark/V-5895-2019",,"AgriLife Research; National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice [2010-DN-BX-K243]","J.K.T. would like to thank AgriLife Research for providing funds to conduct this research.

In this study, we evaluated rates of injury as a proxy for conspecific aggression using a depletion survey of predatory coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) in a tributary of the South Fork Eel River, California. We tested a range of hypotheses including a suite of environmental and biotic factors for the rate of injury in a population by using an AIC model-selection approach that examined the weight of evidence for individual models. We examined both the probability of a given individual being injured, and the proportion of individuals within a given study pool being injured. We found strong support for models including salamander size, density of young-of-the-year steelhead, and density of the largest size-class of salamander as factors positively influencing the rate of injury at both the individual and habitat levels. We also found that density of older steelhead (1+ steelhead) had a strong, but highly variable positive impact on frequency of injury. This study shows that both conspecific and heterospecific factors influence intraspecific aggression for the dominant salamander throughout coastal Pacific Northwest streams. Our methodology demonstrates a non-manipulative approach to identifying correlates of natural injury in a cryptic species of amphibian. More work is needed to determine how these factors directly and indirectly influence the spatial distribution, individual fitness, and dynamics of salamander populations within streams.","[Munshaw, Robin G.; Atlas, W.

Here, we introduce a game theoretic, physiologically based community model of height-structured competition between late-successional tree species. Species are constrained by an increasing, but saturating, relationship between photosynthesis and leaf N per unit leaf area. Higher saturating rates carry higher fixed costs. For a given whole-crown N content, a C gain-maximizing compromise exists between d and LAI. With greater whole-crown N, both d and LAI increase within species. However, a shift in community composition caused by reduced understory light at high soil N availability (which competitively favors species with low leaf costs and consequent low optimal d) counteracts the within-species response, such that community-level d changes little with soil N availability. These model predictions provide a new explanation for the changes in leaf N per mass observed in data from three dominant broadleaf species in temperate deciduous forests of New England. Attempts to understand large-scale patterns in vegetation often omit competitive interactions and intraspecific plasticity, but here both are essential to an understanding of ecosystem-level patterns.","[Dybzinski, Ray; Farrior, Caroline E.; Pacala, Stephen W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ollinger, Scott] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Dybzinski, R (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rdybzins@princeton.edu,"Ollinger, Scott V/N-3380-2014","Ollinger, Scott V/0000-0001-6226-1431; Dybzinski, Ray/0000-0002-1712-1875; Farrior, Caroline/0000-0001-8999-4264",Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1114804] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,,,61,14,14,1,196,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,OCT,2013,200,1,,,,,112,121,,10.1111/nph.12353,,,10,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,205WH,WOS:000323475000014,23738827,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Recently, the importance of allelopathy for competitive interactions has been recognized. In spite of such interest in allelopathy, we have few theories for understanding how the allelopathy influences the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of competing species. Here, I study the coevolutionary dynamics of two competing species with allelopathy in an interspecific competition system, and show that adaptive trait dynamics can cause cyclic coexistence. In addition, very fast adaptation such as phenotypic plasticity is likely to stabilize the population cycles. The results suggest that adaptive changes in allelopathy can lead to cyclic coexistence of plant species even when their ecological characters are very similar and interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition, which should destroy competitive coexistence in the absence of adaptation.","Ryukoku Univ, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan","Mougi, A (corresponding author), Ryukoku Univ, I-5 Yokoya,Seta Oe Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan.",mougi@bio-math10.biology.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Research Fellowship for Young ScientistsMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20*01655]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25840164] Funding Source: KAKEN",I am very grateful to P.

Sexual selection theory predicts that traits that enhance success in intrasexual competition (particularly male-male competition) should be favored. In vertebrates, this often includes body size and aggression, with larger and/or more aggressive males outcompeting smaller or less aggressive conspecifics. The majority of studies consider aggression as a flexible trait which responds to local social or environmental conditions. However, aggression frequently shows considerable within-individual consistency (i.e., individuals have identifiable aggressive behavioral types). Little is known about how such consistency in aggression may influence competition outcomes. We integrated a detailed field study with a laboratory experiment to examine how a male's aggressive phenotype and his size influence competitive interactions in Egernia whitii, a social lizard species which exhibits strong competition over resources (limited permanent shelter sites and basking sites). Individual aggression and size did not predict competition outcome in the laboratory nor did they predict home range size, overlap, or reproductive success in the field. However, winners of laboratory trial contests maintained consistent aggressive phenotypes while consistency in aggression was lost in losers. We suggest that aggression may be important in other functional contexts, such as parental care, and that alternative traits, such as fighting experience, may be important in determining competition outcome in this species.","[McEvoy, Jo; While, Geoffrey M.; Sinn, David L.; Wapstra, Erik] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [While, Geoffrey M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Sinn, David L.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","McEvoy, J (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Private Bag 05, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",jmcevoy@utas.edu.au,"While, Geoffrey M/O-6306-2017; Wapstra, Erik/J-7482-2014; McEvoy, Joanne/J-7205-2014; McEvoy, Jo/M-7204-2015","While, Geoffrey M/0000-0001-8122-9322; Wapstra, Erik/0000-0002-2050-8026; McEvoy, Jo/0000-0001-9591-1824",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Holsworth Wildlife Research Fund; Winifred Violet Scott Estate; Ecological Society of Australia; Bookend Trust; FP7 (Marie Curie Fellowship) [275252],"The authors thank the BEER Group for help with lizard capture and maintenance and to Adam Stephens and Richard Holmes with camera setup.

We collected leaves from different combinations at 3, 6 and 12 months and we established a 2-month microcosm experiment. We measured K-pot and different leaf and litter traits in order to test the hypothetical relationships between these traits and litter decomposability among the target species. Leaf nitrogen concentration was higher in plants growing under N-supply treatments but this supply only affected decomposition rates in the cases of P. pinea and P. lentiscus when grown alone. For P. pinea and C. salvifolius decay rate was higher in the fertilized treatment when growing alone. Leaf dry matter content was the leaf trait best related to litter decomposability.

It is well known that the positive constant steady state of the system is globally asymptotically stable if the interspecies competition is weaker than the intraspecies one and is unstable if the interspecies competition dominates over the intraspecies one. If the latter holds, then we show that Hopf bifurcation can occur as the parameters (delays) in the system cross some critical values. In particular, we prove that these Hopf bifurcations are all spatially homogeneous if the diffusive rates are suitably large, which has the same properties as Hopf bifurcation of the corresponding delayed system without diffusion. However, if the diffusive rates are suitably small, then the system generates the spatially nonhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, we derive conditions for determining the direction of spatially nonhomogeneous Hopf bifurcations and the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. These results indicate that the diffusion plays an important role for deriving the complex spatiotemporal dynamics.","[Zhang, Jia-Fang; Li, Wan-Tong] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jia-Fang] Henan Univ, Sch Math & Informat Sci, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Yan, Xiang-Ping] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Dept Math, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China","Li, WT (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",wtli@lzu.edu.cn,"Li, Wan-Tong/A-3644-2009",,"Fundamental Research Fund of Henan University [B2011088]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11031003, 10961017]; FRFCU [lzujbky-2011-k27]; QingLan Talent Program of Lanzhou Jiaotong University [QL-05-20A]",The first author was supported by the Fundamental Research Fund of Henan University (B2011088).

We investigated whether the signal from such a struggle was evident in a community of phytophagous gall insects on Melaleuca quinquenervia meeting these conditions. Specifically, we examined plant-mediated interactions among three species galling vegetative tips with varying degrees of temporal overlap. The abundance of early gallers (Sphaerococcus ferrugineus Froggatt and Fergusonina turneri Taylor) did not influence resource availability for the late galler (Lophodiplosis indendata Gagn,), suggesting the absence of temporally separated exploitative competition. However, the abundance of S. ferrugineus was positively correlated with the abundance of L. indentata, which suggests facilitation or similar responses to the prevailing conditions. Examination of the reciprocal impacts of the late galler on early gallers paradoxically revealed that though galling by L. indentata may be reducing the resource availability for early gallers, the abundance of L. indentata was positively influenced by the abundance of early gallers (an effect that is stronger for S. ferrugineus than F. turneri) suggesting facilitation. The strong influence of site on the interactions among the different cecidogenic species indicated that any role for competition/facilitation may be spatially constrained. We explore potential processes that may be driving the patterns that we detected and also the implications for the use of these species as biological control agents for M. quinquenervia.","[Raghu, S.; Brown, B.; Purcell, M.

Enclosures contained 8 (low density) or 16 individuals (high density) and had O. peruncus only (control) or both species (interspecific treatment). Juvenile O. peruncus were able to survive and grow in portions of their former range, implicating biotic versus abiotic factors in the displacement of O. peruncus. Survival rates of O. peruncus did not differ among treatments at either site. Orconectes peruncus showed significant growth in all treatments and interspecific effects were not greater than intraspecific effects on O. peruncus growth rates. High-density treatments showed significantly reduced O. peruncus growth rates compared to low-density treatments, except in Carver Creek interspecific treatments. When considered in the context of previous studies examining the effects of O. hylas on O. peruncus, results suggest that neither direct competition between juvenile males of the two species or abiotic change are responsible for the decreased range of O. peruncus. Additional research is required to determine the mechanism(s) driving the displacement of O. peruncus.","[Westhoff, Jacob T.] Univ Missouri, Missouri Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Distefano, Robert J.] Resource Sci Ctr, Missouri Dept Conservat, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [Magoulick, Daniel D.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Westhoff, JT (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Missouri Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 302 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",jtw7a1@mail.missouri.edu,"Magoulick, Daniel/AAG-1556-2020","Magoulick, Daniel/0000-0001-9665-5957; Westhoff, Jacob/0000-0002-2347-5098",Missouri Department of Conservation; Missouri Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Arkansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit,"This research was supported by the Missouri Department of Conservation, the Missouri Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, and the Arkansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit.

In particular, much attention has been drawn to the fact that population divergence in mate choice and in the male traits subject to choice directly can lead to assortative mating. However, male contest competition over mates also constitutes an important mechanism of sexual selection. We review recent empirical studies and argue that sexual selection through male contest competition can affect speciation in ways other than mate choice. For example, biases in aggression towards similar competitors can lead to disruptive and negative frequency-dependent selection on the traits used in contest competition in a similar way as competition for other types of limited resources. Moreover, male contest abilities often trade-off against other abilities such as parasite resistance, protection against predators and general stress tolerance. Populations experiencing different ecological conditions should therefore quickly diverge non-randomly in a number of traits including male contest abilities. In resource based breeding systems, a feedback loop between competitive ability and habitat use may lead to further population divergence. We discuss how population divergence in traits used in male contest competition can lead to the build up of reproductive isolation through a number of different pathways. Our main conclusion is that the role of male contest competition in speciation remains largely scientifically unexplored [Current Zoology 58 (3): 493-509, 2012].","[Qvarnstrom, Anna; Vallin, Niclas; Rudh, Andreas] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Genet, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Qvarnstrom, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Genet, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",anna.qvarnstrom@ebc.uu.se,,"Qvarnstrom, Anna/0000-0002-1178-4053",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; European Research FoundationEuropean Science Foundation (ESF),"We would like to thank M.

We tested the hypothesis that priority resource access by an invasive biocontrol weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus, intensifies and alters the outcome of competition with native floral herbivores over flower head resources of the non-target, native host plant Cirsium canescens, specifically with the predominant, synchronous tephritid fly Paracantha culta. Four main results emerged. First, we documented strong, asymmetric competition, with R. conicus out-competing P. culta. Second, weevil priority access to floral resources accelerated competitive suppression of P. culta. Evidence for competitive suppression with increased weevil priority included decreases in both the numbers and the total biomass of native flies, plus decreases in individual P. culta fly mass and, so, potential fitness. Third, we found evidence for three concurrent mechanisms underlying the competitive suppression of P. culta by R. conicus. Prior use of a flower head by R. conicus interfered with P. culta pre-oviposition behavior. Once oviposition occurred, the weevil also reduced fly post-oviposition performance. Preemptive resource exploitation occurred, shown by the significant effect of flower head size on the total number of insects developing and in the magnitude of R. conicus effects on P. culta. Interference also occurred, shown by a spatial shift of surviving P. culta individuals away from the preferred receptacle resources as R. conicus priority increased. Finally, fourth, using an individual-based model (IBM), we found that the competitive interactions documented have the potential for imposing demographic consequences, causing a reduction in P. culta population sizes. Thus, priority resource access by an invasive insect increased competitive impact on the predominant native insect in the invaded floral guild. This study also provides the first experimental evidence for non-target effects of a weed biological control agent on an associated native insect herbivore.","[Rand, T.

The barred owl (Strix varia), a species historically restricted to eastern North America, has recently expanded its range to completely overlap that of the northern spotted owl. Recent evidence suggests that barred owls may compete with northern spotted owls and may be one cause for recent declines in some northern spotted owl populations. Our focus was to examine whether barred owls have the potential to competitively exclude northern spotted owls from their territories through interference competition. We used a playback experiment to quantify aggressive vocal and physical behavior of barred and northern spotted owls during territorial defense. Experimental trials consisted of displaying northern spotted or barred owl taxidermy mounts, and broadcasting recorded vocalizations of the corresponding species, in both barred and northern spotted owl territories. The frequency of interspecific interactions was lower compared to intraspecific interactions between northern spotted owls alone. However, barred owls responded with higher levels of vocal and physical aggression than did northern spotted owls when agonistic interspecific interactions occurred. Our results suggest that barred owls are likely to assume the dominant role during interspecific interactions with northern spotted owls. Thus, interference competition is a plausible mechanism by which barred owls could contribute to observed population declines of northern spotted owls in areas where the species co-occur.

Passerine birds represent an intriguing case because differing theories yield the possibility of an antagonistic interaction between nest predation risk and food delivery rates on evolution of growth rates. We test this possibility among 64 Passerine species studied on three continents, including tropical and north and south temperate latitudes. Growth rates increased strongly with nestling predation rates within, but not between, sites. The importance of nest predation was further emphasized by revealing hidden allometric scaling effects. Nestling predation risk also was associated with reduced total feeding rates and per-nestling feeding rates within each site. Consequently, faster growth rates were associated with decreased per-nestling food delivery rates across species, both within and among regions. These relationships suggest that Passerines can evolve growth strategies in response to predation risk whereby food resources are not the primary limit on growth rate differences among species. In contrast, reaction norms of growth rate relative to brood size suggest that food may limit growth rates within species in temperate, but not tropical, regions. Results here provide new insight into evolution of growth strategies relative to predation risk and food within and among species.","[Martin, Thomas E.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Lloyd, Penn] Univ Cape Town, Percy Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Bosque, Carlos] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Biol Organismos, Caracas, Venezuela","Martin, TE (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",tom.martin@umontana.edu; penn.lloyd@gmail.com; carlosb@usb.ve; daniel.barton@umontana.edu; luis.biancucci@gmail.com; yirucheng@gmail.com; zvoneb@libero.it,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011; Bosque, Carlos/AAX-6038-2020","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867; ","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [INT-9906030, DEB-9981527, DEB-0543178, DEB-0841764]; United States Geological Survey Climate Change Research ProgramUnited States Geological Survey; National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-02817]; FONACIT [DM/0000237]; INPARQUES [PA-INP-005-2004]; Ministerio del Ambiente [01-03-03-1147]","We thank R.

Interspecific larval competition studies have shown Ae. albopictus to be a superior competitor over many species. A laboratory experiment was conducted in artificial containers to evaluate the effects of malathion on larval interactions between Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus. The survivorship of Ae. albopictus increased with increasing Ae. atropalpus densities in control but decreased with increasing Ae. atropalpus densities in the presence of malathion. Alternatively, Ae. atropalpus survivorship did not differ between control and malathion treatments. Developmental times were not affected by interspecific competition in both treatments for either species. These results show that malathion could facilitate coexistence between Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus. This demonstrates how sublethal concentrations of malathion (and perhaps other pesticides with similar modes of action) can enable an inferior competitor to coexist in the same habitat with a superior competitor. This is the first report of synergistic survival of a weaker mosquito competitor in the presence of a pesticide due to condition-specific competition.","[Kesavaraju, Banugopan; Brey, Christopher W.; Farajollahi, Ary; Evans, Heather L.; Gaugler, Randy] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Vector Biol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Brey, Christopher W.] Marywood Univ, Dept Sci, Scranton, PA 18505 USA; [Farajollahi, Ary] Mercer Cty Mosquito Control, W Trenton, NJ 08628 USA","Kesavaraju, B (corresponding author), Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District, 2020 N Redwood Rd, Salt Lake City, UT 84116 USA.",banu@slcmad.org,"Gaugler, Randy/K-3898-2013",,New Jersey Agriculture Experiment Station [D-08-08193-03-11],"Many thanks to Linda McCuiston for supplying Ae. albopictus and Ae. atropalpus eggs and Kavitha Damal and Richard Marin for technical assistance.

In the Iberian Peninsula, the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans, and other exotic freshwater turtles have been introduced, competing and displacing the native endangered terrapins (the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, and the Spanish terrapin, Mauremys leprosa). Although the nature of competitive interactions remains unclear, direct competition for food is likely to occur. Both native and invasive freshwater turtles are common predators of amphibian tadpoles. Naive amphibian tadpoles are known to recognize and respond to local predators with no prior experience, but tadpoles might not recognize new predatory species, since they have not shared a long evolutionary history with them. We examined the ability of four species of Iberian anuran tadpoles to recognize and respond to chemical cues from invasive and native freshwater predatory turtles. Three of the four tadpole species tested reduced their swimming activity when cues from native turtles were present in water, but not when cues belonged to exotic turtles. This inability of tadpole prey to respond innately to chemicals from introduced predatory turtles might be one of the causes that explains the displacement of native populations of Iberian terrapins by invasive exotic turtles, and may help clarify why alien predators sometimes prosper better in new habitats than locally adapted predators.

Even so, whitefish introductions into Arctic charr lakes have resulted in serious decline and possibly local extinction of Arctic charr. In this article, we analyze the habitat use and diet of the two species in five Norwegian lakes differing in basin shape and environmental conditions. In two of the lakes, both species are native, and appear to live in a relatively stable coexistence. Here, whitefish mainly occupy the littoral and upper pelagic zone, while Arctic charr live in the deeper habitats. Diets are generally quite different in terms of the zooplankton species eaten. In the three other lakes, either whitefish or both species have been introduced. In the shallowest lake, habitat segregation is similar to that seen in the pristine lakes, although Arctic charr appears to be on the brink of extinction. In the remaining two lakes, however, Arctic charr dominates, and occurs in higher numbers than whitefish in all the habitats. Our observations indicate that coexistence of the two species in oligotrophic and relatively pristine lakes requires an extensive profundal zone to serve as a refugium for Arctic charr. If the littoral zone is rendered inaccessible or unprofitable for whitefish due to dominance of a third competitor or predator, or as a result of lake regulation, then Arctic charr may be the dominant species.","[Sandlund, Odd Terje; Naesje, Tor F.; Saksgard, Randi; Hesthagen, Trygve] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Museth, Jon] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-2624 Fakkelgarden, Lillehammer, Norway; [Rognerud, Sigurd] Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, N-2312 Ottestad, Norway; [Borgstrom, Reidar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway","Sandlund, OT (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",odd.t.sandlund@nina.no,,,,,,46,22,25,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,AUG,2010,650,1,,,,,27,41,,10.1007/s10750-009-0075-4,,,15,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,612XH,WOS:000278938600004,,,,,2021-09-21,

Many flexible foraging behaviours suggested by theory have received very little empirical attention, and empirical techniques used to compare the magnitudes of behavioural and non-behavioural responses to predation are likely to have overestimated the behavioural components. 4. Adaptively flexible foraging in theory causes significant changes in the forms of consumer functional responses and generates a variety of indirect interactions. These can alter fundamental ecological processes, such as co-existence of competitors, and top-down or bottom-up effects in food webs. 5. Many aspects of flexible foraging are still largely unknown, including the issues of how to represent the dynamics of such phenotypically plastic traits, how flexible traits in multiple species interact, what types of adaptive movements occur in metacommunities, and how adaptive behaviours influence evolutionary change. 6. Population dynamics in large food webs may be less dependent on behavioural flexibility than in small webs because species replacement may preempt some potential types of behavioural change within species.","Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, St Toronto, ON, Canada","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, St Toronto, ON, Canada.",peter.abrams@utoronto.ca,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"I thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for financial support.

We tested whether a subsidy of allochthonous prey enhanced an asymmetric competition between invasive bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and two native cyprinid fish, that is, stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva) and tamoroko (Gnathopogon elongatus elongatus). A field experiment was conducted using enclosures wherein the strength of interspecific competition and the presence/absence of allochthonous prey were manipulated. The experiment revealed that allochthonous prey alleviated the limitation of fish growths caused by a severe competition for aquatic prey resources. However, the importance of allochthonous prey differed considerably between invasive bluegill and the two native cyprinids. Individual bluegills grew faster when the allochthonous prey was supplied, whereas no difference in growth was observed in the two cyprinids whether or not allochthonous prey was supplied. Interestingly, the importance of allochthonous prey on the total amount of bluegill growth varied depending on the numerical abundance of native cyprinid competitors, and this importance increased when the native cyprinids were abundant. These findings indicated that allochthonous prey provides an asymmetric growth benefit to invasive bluegills over the two native cyprinids by alleviating asymmetrically the competition strength in a Japanese pond, especially under the conditions of severe interspecific resource competition and a limitation in the utilization of in situ prey resources.","[Yonekura, Ryuji] Gifu Prefectural Res Inst Freshwater Fish & Aquat, Gifu 5016021, Japan; [Yonekura, Ryuji; Yamanaka, Hiroki; Ushimaru, Atushi; Matsui, Kazuaki; Uchii, Kimiko; Maruyama, Atsushi] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Yonekura, R (corresponding author), Gifu Prefectural Res Inst Freshwater Fish & Aquat, Gifu 5016021, Japan.",yonekura@fish.rd.pref.gifu.jp,"Yamanaka, Hiroki/D-4221-2012; Uchii, Kimiko/J-8236-2019; Ushimaru, Atushi/D-7036-2013; Matsui, Kazuaki/S-1473-2019","Uchii, Kimiko/0000-0002-1375-3875; Ushimaru, Atushi/0000-0002-2051-1233; Matsui, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1563-3308",Nippon Life Insurance FoundationNippon Life Insurance Foundation,"We express our thanks to I.

The propensity of the newly-established mosquito Aedes japonicus to inhabit rock pools throughout the eastern United States provides a natural setting for interspecific larval competition with the native Aedes atropalpus. A laboratory experiment conducted in simulated rock pools to evaluate larval interactions between and within these two species suggested that the performance of both species was more significantly impacted by intraspecific conditions than interspecific conditions of the same mosquito density. Aedes atropalpus was apparently more sensitive to larval densities than Ae. japonicus because it reproduces autogenously, requiring a lengthened period of larval development to obtain nutrient reserves for egg development, which may ultimately put Ae. atropalpus at a disadvantage under larval conditions of competition and limited resources. Excessively stressful experimental conditions, as evidenced by reduced body size, and thus fecundity and estimated finite rate of increase, may have obscured the effects of larval competition between these species. The impact of larval competition between these species in rock pool communities warrants further investigation under more ecologically realistic experimental conditions.

To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a literature review, focusing on studies that tested the behavioural and demographic impact of intraguild predation on individuals, populations, and assemblages of diurnal and nocturnal raptorial species. Overall, data were available for 39 empirical and experimental studies on 63 populations belonging to 11 killer species and 15 victim species. An overview of these studies suggested that intraguild predation was a widespread, size-based phenomenon. Results from multiple studies on the same species at different locations were usually consistent across wide geographical areas. Individual-level demographic impacts included reduced site-occupancy, breeding success and survival. Individuals of the prey species responded to predation pressure through direct spatial avoidance, risk-sensitive habitat selection, short-term behavioural avoidance (e.g. reduced vocal activity and escape to refugia after predator detection) and, possibly, temporal segregation. Population-level effects were common but mainly examined as spatio-temporal correlations between the abundance of killer and victim species. Correlative evidence also suggested that intraguild predation may have the potential to structure whole raptor assemblages. More studies on other species and different geographic areas are needed to increase our understanding of the causes and consequences of this widespread interaction. From a conservation point of view, intraguild predation may limit the success of raptor preservation programmes and could be used as a management tool through its effect on mesopredator release and its potentially positive, indirect effects on game species.","[Sergio, Fabrizio; Hiraldo, Fernando] Estac Biol Donana, Dept Appl Biol, E-41013 Seville, Spain","Sergio, F (corresponding author), Estac Biol Donana, Dept Appl Biol, E-41013 Seville, Spain.",fsergio@ebd.csic.es,"Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019; Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015","Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773",,,,99,99,109,1,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,AUG,2008,150,,,1,,,132,145,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00786.x,,,14,Ornithology,Zoology,346ZS,WOS:000259108700012,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

From 1990 to 2004, densities of Cackling Geese Branta hutchinsii minima more than doubled and were c. 2-5x greater than densities of Emperor Geese, which were relatively constant over time. Body mass of prefledging Emperor Geese was strongly related (negatively) to interspecific densities of geese (combined density of Cackling and Emperor Geese) and positively related to measures of food availability (grazing lawn extent and net above-ground primary productivity (NAPP)). Grazing by geese resulted in consumption of >= 90% of the NAPP that occurred in grazing lawns during the brood-rearing period, suggesting that density-dependent interspecific competition was from exploitation of common food resources. Efforts to increase the population size of Emperor Geese would benefit from considering competitive interactions among goose species and with forage plants.","[Lake, Bryce C.; Lindberg, Mark S.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Lake, Bryce C.; Lindberg, Mark S.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Schmutz, Joel A.; Ely, Craig R.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; [Eldridge, William D.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; [Lake, Bryce C.; Broerman, Fred J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Bethel, AK 99559 USA","Lake, BC (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, 311 Irving Bldg, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",bryce_lake@fws.gov,,,,,,74,18,19,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,JUL,2008,150,3,,,,,527,540,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00814.x,,,14,Ornithology,Zoology,327DQ,WOS:000257710200008,,,,,2021-09-21,

We studied imperiled populations of swift foxes (Vulpes velox) in Canada and kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) in Mexico to determine potential differences in survival or predator-avoidance strategies. Survival rates were significantly lower in Canada than in Mexico because of mortality caused by coyotes (Canis latrans) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and the potential for population recovery is likely higher for the Mexican fox population. Differences in body size between coyotes and foxes, diet, group sizes, intraspecific home-range overlap, home-range sizes of coyotes, and movements of coyotes relative to foxes were similar among study areas. However, Canadian foxes had home ranges that were approximately 3 times larger than those in Mexico, and Canadian foxes were most frequently killed on their home-range peripheries. Home ranges of kit foxes decreased in size as the availability of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies increased and associated refuge holes, which foxes could use to escape predation, were significantly more abundant in Mexico than in Canada. Small home ranges of foxes probably reduced encounters with coyotes in Mexico, and a high availability of refuges likely allowed foxes to elude predators when such encounters did occur. Differences in survival of foxes relative to mortality caused by coyotes demonstrate that interactions between carnivores can vary greatly between populations and that, in some situations, vulnerable species may be able to coexist with dominant carnivores despite a lack of large-scale habitat partitioning.","Calgary Zool Soc, Ctr Conservat Res, Calgary, AB T2E 7V6, Canada; Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Inst, Tubney OX13 5QL, England; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Moehrenschlager, A (corresponding author), Calgary Zool Soc, Ctr Conservat Res, 1300 Zoo Rd, Calgary, AB T2E 7V6, Canada.",axelm@calgaryzoo.ab.ca,,,,,,65,40,41,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

We hypothesised that interactions among a suite of shoreline plant species shift across a hydrodynamic-exposure gradient, leading to generation of apparently distinct habitat types (e.g. bare cobble beaches, vegetated cobble beaches, fringing marshes and salt marshes). We examined hydrodynamic forcing and found that it was strongly correlated with shoreline habitat type. A transplant experiment revealed that all plants were rapidly crushed and abraded in bare cobble areas with high hydrodynamic energy and were out-competed by grasses in the low-energy salt marshes. Vegetated cobble beaches are inhabited by the largest amount of plant species under intermediate conditions, where hydrodynamic energy is sufficiently low to allow the establishment of the ecosystem engineer Spartina and sufficiently high to prevent the monopolisation of space by competitively dominant, but stress intolerant grasses. Experimentally reducing physical and biotic stresses (hydrodynamics and interspecific competition) on bare cobble beaches and salt marshes, respectively, enabled forbs to persist across the whole gradient. These results demonstrate that the outcome of interspecific interactions at landscape scales is driven by background physical conditions, and that this can result in the development of what are considered distinct habitats.","[Crain, Caitlin M.; Altieri, Andrew H.; Bertness, Mark D.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [van Wesenbeeck, Bregje K.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Estuarine & Marine Ecol, NIOO KNAW, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands","van Wesenbeeck, BK (corresponding author), WL Delft Hydraul, POB 140, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands.",bregje.vanwesenbeeck@wldelft.nl,"Altieri, Andrew H/P-1738-2017","van Wesenbeeck, Bregje/0000-0002-0308-9552",,,,34,15,15,0,28,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Prey availability strongly reduced cannibalism within individuals of the same a-e and others of different ages. Complex habitat structure provides shelter for mantid individuals although it could not prevent cannibalism. High density of mantid nymphs or adults increased cannibalism. Rates of cannibalism increased as the mantid ages increased. First, second and third instar nymphs did not have any cannibal's activity. On the other hand, adult females had the greatest cannibals' activity. Mantid individuals could not cannibals upon higher-age individuals; inversely the later instar nymphs and the adults could not eat (cannibals) the earlier nymphs probably as a result of difficulties of catching behavior. Mantid cannibalism occurred in the presence or absence of preys, through a simple or complex habitat structure and low or high predator's density.

We also conducted a field competition experiment with treatments consisting of (1) 3 O. eupunctus, (2) 6 O. eupunctus, and (3) 3 O. eupunctus and 3 O. neglectus chaenodactylus at a site where both species occur. In the first experiment, O. eupunctus gained significantly more weight at the downstream site than the upstream site during 2003, but not during 2002. At the upstream site, O. eupunctus showed significantly greater growth rates than O. neglectus chaenodactylus during 2002, but not during 2003. In the competition experiment, O. neglectus chaenodactylus did not significantly reduce the growth or survival of O. eupunctus. These results suggest that O. eupunctus have been displaced from their former range by biotic interactions, but interspecific competition between adult male O. eupunctus and O. neglectus chaenodactylus does not appear to be the mechanism responsible for this displacement. Further study is needed to investigate the disappearance of O. eupunctus.","Univ Arkansas, US Geol Survey, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Magoulick, DD (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, US Geol Survey, Arkansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",danmag@uark.edu,"Magoulick, Daniel/AAG-1556-2020","Magoulick, Daniel/0000-0001-9665-5957",,,,48,13,13,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

The growth conditions simulated natural forest conditions as closely as possible. Simulations were performed by growing interacting seedling canopies for one season in temperature-regulated closed-top chambers (CTCs). Eight CTCs were used in a factorial design with replicate treatments of [CO2] x temperature x PPFD x competition design. [CO2] tracked ambient levels or was 360 mu mol -mol(-1) higher. Temperature tracked ambient levels or was 2.8 degrees C higher. PPFD on two plant tables inside each CTC was 16% and 5% of open-field levels, respectively, representative of typical light flux levels in a natural forest gap. in several of the competition designs, climate change made the ash seedlings grow taller than the beech seedlings and, at the same time, attain a larger leaf area and a larger total biomass. Advantages of this type for ash were found particularly at lower PPFD. There was a positive synergistic interaction of elevated temperature x [CO2] for both species, but more so for ash. There are many uncertainties when a study of chambered seedlings is to be projected to real changes in natural forests. Nevertheless, this study supports a possible future shift towards ash in north European, unmanaged, mixed ash-beech forests in response to the predicted climate change.","Environm Assessment Inst, DK-1361 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Lancaster, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","Saxe, H (corresponding author), Environm Assessment Inst, Linnesgade 181, DK-1361 Copenhagen, Denmark.",hsa@imv.dk,"Kerstiens, Gerhard/B-4728-2008","Kerstiens, Gerhard/0000-0001-8767-7791",,,,42,11,11,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1435-8603,1438-8677,,PLANT BIOLOGY,Plant Biol.,JUL,2005,7,4,,,,,375,386,,10.1055/s-2005-865639,,,12,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,950QI,WOS:000230871700006,16025410,,,,2021-09-21,

Bumblebees, the predominant pollinator of these species. preferred P caerulea in early- to middle-snowmelt plots but P aleutica in late-snowmelt plots. This switching of preference reflected the changes in the relative floral densities of these species along the snowmelt gradients. The frequency of bumblebee movements from P aleutica to P caerulea flowers increased at late-snowmelt plots, whereas that from P caerulea to P. aleutica flowers decreased at late-snowmelt plots. Thus, the risk of heterospecific pollen receipt increased in P caerulea but decreased in P aleutica from early- to late-snowmelt habitats. Phyllodoce caerulea showed similar seed-set rates among conspecific, heterospecific and species-mixed pollination treatments throughout the plots, indicating that there is no mechanism to avoid hybridization at P aleutica pollen. On the other hand, P aleutica pollinated with P. caerulea pollen showed a very low seed set in comparison with that pollinated with conspecific pollen in early- and middle-snowmelt plots. However, the seed set of P aleutica did not differ among the treatments at late-snowmelt plots. Therefore, P aleutica showed heterospecific incompatibility with P caerulea pollen only in the early-to middle-snowmelt populations. Changes in interspecific bumblebee movements might be responsible for the variation in heterospecific incompatibility among the P aleutica populations.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan","Kasagi, T (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",kasagi@kenroku.kanazawa-u.ac.jp,"Kudo, Gaku/A-2733-2015","Kudo, Gaku/0000-0002-6488-818X",,,,45,10,10,0,9,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

Here we show that a mutualism between an anemonefish (Amphiprion) and its sea anemone host mediates the effect of asymmetrical competition for space between the anemonefish and another damselfish (Dascyllus) in a manner that fosters their coexistence. Amphiprion stimulates increases in host area, the shared resource, but social interactions cap the number of anemonefish to two adults per host. Space generated by the mutualism becomes differentially available to Dascyllus because the effectiveness of an anemonefish in excluding its competitor declines with increases in the area it defends. This alters Amphiprion's ratio of per capita intra- to interspecific effects and thus facilitates coexistence of the fishes. This mechanism may be prevalent in nature, adding another major pathway by which mutualism can enhance diversity.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coastal Res Ctr, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA","Schmitt, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coastal Res Ctr, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",,,,,,,31,67,69,46,257,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We report interactions between white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) and other species. We present comparative data for 11 groups from 3 sites in Costa Rica that are ecologically similar and geographically close, thus reducing the likelihood that differences are due solely to genetic or ecological differences. Our aim is to document both the range of variation and common elements across sites and situations. We also consider factors that contribute to the variation or consistency or both, including social learning, local ecology, and temperament. We consider 4 categories of allospecifics: (1) vertebrate prey, (2) potential predators, (3) feeding competitors, and (4) neutral species. Although we cannot rule out local differences in ecology, our data suggest that social learning may account for at least some cross-site differences in behavior toward allospecifics. Our strongest finding is that boldness, aggression and pugnacity are displayed consistently across sites, groups and circumstances, even in interactions with neutral species, which reflects a critical aspect of species-specific temperament in Cebus capucinus that has been evolutionarily developed and reinforced through highly opportunistic foraging, strong predator defense, and active hunting. We suggest directions for future research, particularly in regard to primate temperament as an evolved trait with consequences for fitness.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Anthropol, Vancouver, BC V6Y 1Z1, Canada; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Anthropol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Behav Evolut & Culture, Los Angeles, CA USA; Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Leipzig, Germany; George Washington Univ, Dept Anthropol, Washington, DC USA; Appalachian State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol, Bloomington, IN USA; St Louis Univ, Dept Sociol & Criminal Justice, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Rose, LM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Anthropol, 6303 NW Marine Dr, Vancouver, BC V6Y 1Z1, Canada.",lrose@interchange.ubc.ca,"MacKinnon, Katherine/H-1115-2011","Gros-Louis, Julie/0000-0002-4822-7197; Rose-Wiles, Lisa/0000-0001-6716-7866",,,,81,51,55,0,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0164-0291,1573-8604,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

Examinations of these dens have been used in surveys of the breeding and population status of the arctic fox in Fennoscandia. In this study, dens all over north Norway and in some parts of south Norway were surveyed (n = 214), and several aspects of den characteristics, localisation and use were recorded. Red fox Vulpes vulpes dens were also recorded whenever found, including red fox use of arctic fox dens (total n = 211). Most of the arctic fox dens were of the classic type dug out in sandy soil (n = 2 10). The average number (+/-1 SD) of open entrances (at least half open) was 27.4+/-19.0, and the average size was 363.1+/-288.7 m(2). Regional variation was found in both these measurements, as well as in two variables classifying the vegetation at the den. However, no consistent south-north gradient was found, although the most southern and the most northern regions were extremes in several respects. A positive correlation was found between den size and the number of entrances, as well as between these two variables and the two vegetation variables. For each arctic fox den, height above the tree line, distance to the tree line, distance between arctic fox dens, distance to the nearest red fox den, distance to a main road and distance to other human activity were estimated. Regional variation was found in all these variables, but no consistent south-north gradient. Again, the most southern region deviated most. There were large differences in the proportion of dens used by arctic foxes between the nine regions, with one region outstanding in its production of arctic fox litters and paucity of red foxes. The proportion sum of arctic fox entrances to sum of red fox entrances reliably, but not perfectly, identified the best arctic fox regions. Arctic fox dens that were known to have produced litters at least once during 1980-2001 had about twice as many entrances as dens without pups, were 32% larger and had a more lush vegetation. They were also situated further from a red fox den. Distance to red fox dens and height above the tree line were the most important factors regarding arctic fox use of dens. Thus, the red fox was identified as a threat to the arctic fox population. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We tested this hypothesis using rates of extra-pair paternity and brood parasitism, as well as the degree of hatching asynchrony, as indices of sibling competition in a comparative analysis of 70 species of bird. We found mixed support for the influence of sibling competition on prenatal development. Brood parasitism was negatively correlated with the length of incubation, and hatching asynchrony was positively correlated with the length of incubation, but both correlations disappeared when phylogeny was controlled for. Extra-pair paternity, however, was negatively correlated with incubation length even when phylogeny was controlled for. The latter could represent support for the influence of sibling competition on prenatal development or indirect effects of correlated selection on both traits by adult mortality. The existence of these correlations demonstrates that life-history strategies include linkages among a larger suite of traits than previously recognized.","Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Montana, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Lloyd, JD (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",jlloyd@selway.umt.edu,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867; Lloyd, John/0000-0002-9143-3789",,,,51,21,22,1,16,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2945,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

They should simultaneously search for adequate food for themselves and their offspring and in the meantime avoid becoming food for other organisms. This behaviour is of great ecological interest in conditions of low prey availability. We examined by means of an olfactometer, how volatile chemicals from prey patches with conspecific or heterospecific predators might contribute to shaping the structure of predator guilds. To test this, we used the exotic predatory mites Typhlodromalus manihoti and T. aripo, and the native predatory mite Euseius fustis, with Mononychellus tanajoa as the common prey species for the three predatory mite species. We used as odour sources M. tanajoa-infested cassava leaves or apices with or without predators. T. manihoti avoided patches inhabited by the heterospecifics T. aripo and E. fustis or by conspecifics when tested against a patch without predators. Similarly, both T. aripo and E. fustis females avoided patches with con- or heterospecifics when tested against a patch without predators. When one patch contained T. aripo and the other T. manihoti, females of the latter preferred the patch with T. aripo. Thus, T. manihoti is able to discriminate between odours from patches with con- and heterospecifics. Our results show that the three predatory mite species are able to assess prey patch profitability using volatiles. Under natural conditions, particularly when their food sources are scarce, the three predatory mite species might be involved in interspecific and/or intraspecific interactions that can substantially affect population dynamics of the predators and their prey.","Int Inst Trop Agr, Biol Control Ctr Africa, Cotonou, Benin; Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands","Hanna, R (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr, Biol Control Ctr Africa, BP 08-0932, Cotonou, Benin.",r.hanna@cgiar.org,"Dicke, Marcel/B-2300-2010","Dicke, Marcel/0000-0001-8565-8896",,,,46,22,24,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2003,135,1,,,,,84,90,,10.1007/s00442-002-1120-4,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,672AB,WOS:000182497200010,12647107,,,,2021-09-21,

This is evident even when comparing species within some coccinellid genera. Resource limitation and competition are suggested as of greatest importance in the evolution of coccinellid habitat preferences. Dietary and habitat specialization has probably occurred in some lineages within broader preferences possessed by generalist ancestors, to avoid the costs associated with migration between habitats and prey switching. Feeding in atypical habitats, on alternative food, when optimal prey are scarce, is likely to have been of great importance in facilitating evolutionary shifts to novel diets and habitats. The broad host ranges of many coccinellid parasitoids and observed interspecific differences in parasitoid prevalence resulting form physiological differences between coccinellid species argue that enemy free space has been of limited importance in habitat and prey shifts in this group. Rapid change may occur in coccinellid foraging patterns, perhaps due to conditioning, and coccinellids may swiftly adapt to new habitats through selection acting on the expression pre-existing traits. Diet, as a determinant of coccinellid migration and gene flow, is likely to affect probable modes of speciation in different coccinellid groups. Parapatric speciation and possibly sympatric speciation are suggested as of possible importance in the genesis of new coccinellid species through prey and habitat shifts.

The distributions of the two species are sometimes defined with a small overlapping zone (called a 'sympatric area') which generally shifts. Exclusion is necessary to explain the persistence and shift of such a spatial pattern. Field studies are carried out to identify the type of interaction that leads to the required exclusion. This is usually achieved by estimating competition and predation parameters to define the type of interaction strong enough to imply exclusion. But interaction parameters are estimated by quantitative methods which require prolonged observation (5-10 years). These estimations are thus difficult to obtain and are open to criticism because of the spatial and temporal variations in the biotic context. Now the study of these variations requires estimation of several other interaction parameters (for different times and sites); therefore, we are unable to discuss these criticisms from a study of realistic duration. We have, therefore, developed a faster study method using the spatial properties of the sympatric: area (width and velocity). We used a between-species competition and a predation model, spatially extended with coupled map lattice formalism (CML), to generate substitution waves corresponding to the 'moving sympatric area' and to study their spatial properties (asymptotic width and velocity). The relationships between the asymptotic width and the interaction level had different shapes with competition and predation parameters. We used this difference to define a rapid study method that does not use quantitative estimations of the interaction parameters. This method is more reliable than the usual method with respect to the above criticisms. These findings may have considerable consequences for field studies of parapatry.

The introduced North American crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus Dana, is expanding its range in Europe and locally often replaces two native crayfish species, Astacus astacus L. and Austropotamobius pallipes Lereboullet. Pacifastacus leniusculus is also expected to invade the habitat of a third native crayfish, the endangered Austropotamobius torrentium Schrank. Interspecific aggressive interactions and competition for shelter were experimentally studied in the laboratory to assess the potential impact of P. leniusculus on A. torrentium. 2. Neither species was inherently dominant in aggressive interactions, but dominance was strongly size-dependent, favouring P. leniusculus. 3. Access to limited shelter was generally determined by aggressive dominance, although species-specific preference also influenced the outcome of competition for shelter. Austropotamobius torrentium had a higher preference for experimental shelters and often defended these even against larger P. leniusculus. 4. In accordance with theoretical models of animal conflicts, agonistic interactions between equally sized contestants were more severe than between animals of different size. 5. The P. leniusculus used in the present experiment were infected with the crayfish plague, Aphanomyces astaci, to which the animals are resistant. The crayfish transmitted the disease to non-resistant A. torrentium which died approximate to 2 weeks after contact with P. leniusculus.","Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Zool Museum, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Vorburger, C (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",chrisvor@zool.unizh.ch,"Vorburger, Christoph/A-1650-2008","Vorburger, Christoph/0000-0002-3627-0841",,,,40,106,110,3,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

On Guam, the sponge Dysidea sp. overgrows the sponge Cacospongia sp. and causes necrosis. Using field assays, we tested the effects of crude organic extracts and a major sesquiterpene isolated from Dysidea, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane, on Cacospongia and on the production of the major terpenoid metabolites scalaradial and desacetylscalaradial by Cacospongia. We also tested whether the amounts of organic compounds produced by Dysidea differed in the presence or absence of Cacospongia. To determine whether 7-deacetoxyolepupuane had another ecological function, we tested the compound as a predator deterrent. In field experiments, crude extracts of Dysidea and pure 7-deacetoxyolepupuane both caused necrosis in Cacospongia when they were incorporated into agar strips and placed in contact with Cacospongia for 7 d. Organic extract, scalaradial, and desacetylscalaradial concentrations in Cacospongia were not affected by the overgrowth of Dysidea. However, a greater quantity of organic extract (but not scalaradial or desacetylscalaradial) was found in portions of Cacospongia covered by agar strips containing Dysidea organic extracts than in portions of Cacospongia covered by control agar strips. The production of 7-deacetoxyolepupuane by Dysidea occurring on rock substrates and on Cacospongia did not differ; thus, the production of this compound is not induced by the presence of competitors. In addition to its role in competition, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane deterred predation by a spongivorous fish, illustrating the multiple ecological roles that a single secondary metabolite may play.","Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA","Paul, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA.",,"Becerro, Mikel/A-5325-2008","Thacker, Robert/0000-0002-9654-0073",,,,78,81,92,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1998,79,5,,,,,1740,1750,,,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101CX,WOS:000074853000023,,,,,2021-09-21,

In experiment I, combinations of six densities of each species formed the treatment matrix of addition series. In experiment 2, each species was tested at four densities and three rectangularities (RE) of winter wheat. In monocultures, crop density (plants per square meter) explained 82 to 85% of the total variation in the per-plant biomass of winter wheat in experiment 1. In mixtures of crop and weed, initial wheat density (N-1) and initial ryegrass density (N-2) and interaction of N-1 and N-2 explained 74 to 80% of the total variation in the per-plant biomass of winter wheat and 68 to 79% of Italian ryegrass in experiment 1. Intraspecific competition was apparent between 15 and 90 days after emergence (DAE) in winter wheat and between 90 and 170 DAE in Italian ryegrass. In mixtures, RE influenced plant size of Italian ryegrass up to 50 DAE only. Maximum winter wheat intraspecific competition occurred at 170 DAE, but maximum interspecific competition occurred during reproductive stages in mixtures. High RE increased seed yield, seed size, and harvest index of winter wheat and reduced biomass of Italian ryegrass. Grain yield of winter wheat was reduced up to 92% by competition from ryegrass. Even nine ryegrass plants in 100 winter wheat plants m(-2) reduced winter wheat grain yield by 33%. However, the extent of loss in winter wheat grain yield was less in RE IG (wider spacing) than in RE 1 (square planting) or 4 (close row spacing). Winter wheat was the stronger competitor during vegetative stages, but Italian ryegrass became the stronger competitor during the reproductive stages of development. Winter wheat leaves dominated at the top canopy during the vegetative stage, but ryegrass dominated at the top canopy during the reproductive stages. In the top canopy of mixtures at 200 DAE, the leaf area indices (LAI) of ryegrass was 6.6 times greater than winter wheat at RE 1 compared to only 1.6 times at RE 16. Greater LAI of Italian ryegrass in the top canopy reduced photosynthetically active radiation available to winter wheat by 68% at booting stage.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Radosevich, SR (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Peavy Hall 154, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,"Hashem, Abul/AAQ-4763-2020; HASHEM, ABUL/AAO-4337-2020",,,,,37,52,53,0,21,WEED SCI SOC AMER,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0043-1745,,,WEED SCI,Weed Sci.,MAR-APR,1998,46,2,,,,,181,190,,10.1017/S0043174500090391,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,ZK867,WOS:000073371800007,,,,,2021-09-21,

The community consisted of 17 hoverfly species feeding on 20 aphid species occurring on 14 species of dominant herbaceous plants. In terms of larval prey preference, the dominant eight species of hoverfly were categorized into three groups: a polyphagous 'generalist' group consisting of four species, Episyrphus balteatus, Betasyrphus serarius, Syrphus vitripennis and Sphaerophoria sp.; an oligophagous 'specialist' group consisting of three species, Metasyrphus hakiensis, Dideoides latus and Paragus hemorrhous and Leucopis puncticornis, which showed a preference for two aphid species on the plant Torilis scabra. The prey aphids of the second group have behavioral or morphological defense mechanisms that are effective for preventing attacks by generalist hoverflies; two prey aphids are aggressive toward generalist predators and the others are protected by ant-attendance. The specialist hoverflies seem to be adapted to overcome these defense mechanisms. The prey ranges overlapped little between the generalist and the specialist groups, while those within the generalist group overlapped greatly.","Nagoya Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Lab Appl Entomol, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 46401, Japan","Itioka, T (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Lab Appl Entomol, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 46401, Japan.",,,,,,,33,21,22,0,24,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Further, some attempts to reintroduce other cervids to range now occupied by deer have failed. However, moose have been observed to persist on range sympatric with deer, there is evidence that at least one moose population introduced to range with deer is growing, and other events (such as habitat change) are confounded with the presumed effects of meningeal worms. Thus, it is still not clear whether the mortality of individual cervids attributed to meningeal worms necessarily has the effects on population dynamics ascribed to it. Using conventional host-macroparasite models, we describe the population dynamics of deer, moose, intermediate gastropod hosts, and the parasite to determine conditions under which the meningeal worm might be implicated in widespread declines of moose populations. The analysis resulted in three general scenarios depending on(l) the magnitude of parameters that affect transmission rates between different phases of the parasite life cycle, (2) the parasite-induced mortality rate of moose, and (3) the difference in competitive ability between deer and moose. First, when larval transmission to intermediate hosts, consumption of intermediate hosts by definitive hosts, and parasite-induced mortality of moose were all small; and the competitive difference between definitive hosts was large, moose excluded deer. Second, moose and deer could coexist at either a stable or unstable equilibrium. Stable coexistence occurred when transmission rates, mortality rates, and competitive differences were all large; then deer outnumbered moose. Unstable coexistence at equilibrium occurred under the opposite conditions; moose then were more abundant than deer. Finally, deer could competitively exclude moose. To determine which of these cases was most plausible, we substituted available estimates for some parameters from published literature, solved the equations numerically, and conducted a sensitivity analysis. Overall, model solutions were most sensitive to the magnitude of the competitive effect of moose on deer, the parasite-induced mortality rate of moose, and the intrinsic rate of increase of the intermediate host-all parameters for which there is little empirical information. We conclude that, with the available empirical information, meningeal worm cannot be ruled out as a factor contributing to declines of moose populations. However, our analyses suggest that moose populations sympatric with deer, in many cases, should not become extinct. This implies that reintroductions of moose (and perhaps other cervids) to range now occupied by deer need not be presumed to fail necessarily. Moose may be able to coexist with deer, albeit at lower densities, even in the absence of habitat refuges from the disease.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT ZOOL, ECOL GRP, VANCOUVER VGT 1Z4, BC, CANADA; UNIV GUELPH, DEPT ZOOL, GUELPH N1G 2W1, ON, CANADA",,,,,,,,48,51,55,0,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We investigated whether predation by chain pickerel (Esox niger) caused adult eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to alter their habitat use and whether pickerel predation influenced survival of adult and neonate mosquitofish. The number of adult mosquitofish using the riskier of three habitats was lowest when two predators occupied the risky habitat, intermediate in the treatment with one predator, and highest when no predators occurred there. More mosquitofish neonates survived high predation treatments than treatments lacking pickerel. We conclude that pickerel predation causes adult mosquitofish to shift to refuge habitats. The pattern of neonate survival suggests that adult habitat use may create a refuge from cannibalism for neonate mosquitofish, resulting in higher neonate survival in treatments with more pickerel. Hence, pickerel predation has a direct effect on adult mosquitofish behavior and a strong indirect effect on neonate survival. Both interspecific and intraspecific predation can effect prey populations and can interact to produce important indirect effects.","UNIV GEORGIA,SAVANAH RIVER ECOL LAB,ATHENS,GA 30602","WINKELMAN, DL (corresponding author), UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT ZOOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Interactions between competition and resources are thought to dictate foraging strategies (e.g. specialization vs. generalization), but classical paradigms such as optimal foraging and niche theory offer contrasting predictions for individual consumers. Furthermore, both paradigms assume that individual foraging strategies maximize fitness, yet this prediction is rarely tested. We used repeated stable isotope measurements (delta C-13, delta N-15; N = 3,509) and 6 years of capture-mark-recapture data to quantify the relationship between environmental variation, individual foraging and consumer fitness among four species of desert rodents. We tested the relative effects of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, resource abundance and resource diversity on the foraging strategies of 349 individual animals, and then quantified apparent survival as function of individual foraging strategies. Consistent with niche theory, individuals contracted their trophic niches and increased foraging specialization in response to both intraspecific and interspecific competition, but this effect was offset by resource availability and individuals generalized when plant biomass was high. Nevertheless, individual specialists obtained no apparent fitness benefit from trophic niche contractions as the most specialized individuals exhibited a 10% reduction in monthly survival compared to the most generalized individuals. Ultimately, this resulted in annual survival probabilities nearly 4x higher for generalists compared to specialists. These results indicate that competition is the proximate driver of individual foraging strategies, and that diet-mediated fitness variation regulates population and community dynamics in stochastic resource environments. Furthermore, our findings show dietary generalism is a fitness maximizing strategy, suggesting that plastic foraging strategies may play a key role in species' ability to cope with environmental change.","[Manlick, Philip J.; Newsome, Seth D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Maldonado, Karin] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Artes Liberales, Dept Ciencias, Penalolen, Chile","Manlick, PJ (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",pmanlick@unm.edu,,"Manlick, Philip/0000-0001-9143-9446",Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB--0217774]; Division of Biological InfrastructureNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DBI--2010712],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DEB--0217774; Division of Biological Infrastructure, Grant/Award Number: DBI--2010712",,103,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Interactions between the invasive American mink Neovison vison and native European polecat Mustela putorius have been studied in several countries, but the mink's impact on polecat populations at a large spatiotemporal scale remains unclear. In the years 1995-2018, we live-trapped mink and polecats at 60 study sites in Poland, and we analysed hunting bags of mink and polecats from the years 2009-2018. During 13,766 trap-nights, we captured 905 individuals. Mink comprised 91.2% and polecats 8.8% of trapped animals. The mean mink and polecat trappability was 6 and 0.6 individuals per 100 trap-nights, respectively. At rivers, polecat and mink trappability were negatively correlated, whereas at lakes, they were not correlated. The sex ratio of trapped polecats was more skewed toward males than that of mink. Mink comprised 63.6% and polecats 36.4% of 59,831 animals killed by hunters. Over 10 years, the numbers of mink shot annually increased slightly, whereas the numbers of polecat decreased slightly. There was a positive correlation between numbers of mink and polecats shot annually. We found weak evidence that at a large spatiotemporal scale, the invasion of mink has led to a decline in polecat numbers. Although the datasets we analysed were based on large samples, they were insufficient to show evidence of competitive interactions between these two mustelids.","[Brzezinski, Marcin; Zarzycka, Aleksandra; Diserens, Tom A.] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Ul Miecznikowa 1, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland; [Diserens, Tom A.; Zalewski, Andrzej] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Ul Stoczek 1, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland","Brzezinski, M (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Ul Miecznikowa 1, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland.",marcinb@biol.uw.edu.pl; a.zarzycka@biol.uw.edu.pl; tdiserens@ibs.bialowieza.pl; zalewski@ibs.bialowieza.pl,,"Zalewski, Andrzej/0000-0003-4518-2787; Brzezinski, Marcin/0000-0002-6300-0425","National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2013/09/B/NZ8/03339]","Partial financial support was received from the National Science Centre, Poland (Grant No: 2013/09/B/NZ8/03339).",,74,0,0,3,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

To mitigate the impact of R. japonica on ecosystems and properly manage affected areas, understanding the mechanisms behind this plant's invasive success is imperative. This study aimed to comprehensively analyse plant communities invaded by R. japonica, taking into account species traits, habitat conditions and seasonal variability, and to determine the ecological profile of species that withstand the invader's pressure. The study was performed in fallow and riparian areas in southern Poland. Pairs of adjacent plots were established at 25 sites with no obvious signs of recent human disturbance. One plot contained R. japonica, and the other contained only resident vegetation. For each plot, botanical data were collected and soil physicochemical properties were determined. Twelve sites were surveyed four times, in two springs and two summers, to capture seasonal variability. The presence of R. japonica was strongly associated with reduced resident plant species diversity and/or abundance. In addition to the ability to quickly grow and form a dense canopy that shades the ground, the success of the invader likely resulted from the production of large amounts of hard-to-decompose litter. The indirect impact of R. japonica by controlling the availability of nutrients in the soil might also play a role. A few species coexisted with R. japonica. They can be classified into three groups: (i) spring ephemerals - geophytic forbs with a mixed life history strategy, (ii) lianas with a competitive strategy and (iii) hemicryptophytic forbs with a competitive strategy. Species from the first two groups likely avoided competition for light by temporal or spatial niche separation (they grew earlier than or above the invasive plant), whereas the high competitive abilities of species from the third group likely enabled them to survive in R. japonica patches.","[Woch, Marcin W.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Inst Biol, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Kapusta, Pawel; Stanek, Malgorzata; Stefanowicz, Anna M.] Polish Acad Sci, Wladyslaw Szafer Inst Bot, Lubicz 46, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland; [Zubek, Szymon] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Bot, Fac Biol, Gronostajowa 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland","Woch, MW (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Inst Biol, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",jurania@umk.pl,,,"National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [UMO-2016/23/B/NZ8/00564]; W.

To support incorporation of climate effects in the Mixedwood Growth Model (MGM), we developed climate-sensitive mixed effects models for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and examined how tree size, intro- and interspecific competition and climate will influence individual-tree diameter growth. Remeasurement data from permanent growth and yield sample plots from across the western Canadian boreal forest were used for this study. Based on the model that we developed, tree size, competition and climate had varying effects on growth, among tree species. Although intraspecific competition had a stronger negative effect on growth for deciduous and white spruce trees, interspecific competition had a stronger negative effect on the growth of pine. Deciduous trees growing in stands having longer frost-free period experienced an increase in growth but a negative effect of frost-free period was observed for conifers. In addition, higher moisture was found to increase tree growth, but the influence of available moisture on growth was dependent on competition. Overall, these results suggest that, under climate warming, between-species differences in growth responses will contribute to our understanding of the stand dynamics in the western boreal region of Canada. Climate sensitive growth models developed in this study will be useful in the recalibration of MGM and other individual-tree models, and predictions will contribute to better-informed decisions about silvicultural treatments for these economically important boreal tree spacies.","[Oboite, Felix O.; Comeau, Philip G.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Oboite, FO (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",oboite@ualberta.ca,,,"Mitacs Elevate, Canadian Forest Products LtdNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; West Fraser Mills Ltd; Weyerhaeuser (Canada); Canadian Forest Products LtdNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service","This project was funded by Mitacs Elevate, Canadian Forest Products Ltd, West Fraser Mills Ltd (Alberta Plywood) and Weyerhaeuser (Canada).

We used block count data and autoregressive linear models to investigate variation in birth rate, kid survival, female survival, and male survival in a population of Alpine chamois Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra monitored over 27 years within the Stelvio National Park, Central Italian Alps, as function of climatic variables, density dependence, and interspecific competition with red deer Cervus elaphus. We also used path analysis to assess the indirect effect of deer abundance on chamois growth rate mediated by each demographic parameter. Based on previous findings, we predicted that birth rate at [t] would negatively relate to red deer abundance at year [t - 1]; survival rates between [t] and [t + 1] would negatively relate to red deer abundance at year [t - 1] and to the interactive effect of winter precipitation at [t + 1] and chamois density at [t]. Our results showed that birth rate was positively related to spring-summer precipitation in the previous year, but this effect was hampered by increasing red deer abundance. Kid and female survival rates were negatively related to the combined effect of chamois abundance and winter precipitation. Male and female survival rates were negatively related to lagged red deer abundance. The path analysis supported a negative indirect effect of red deer abundance on chamois growth rate mediated by birth rate and female survival. Our results suggest that chamois population dynamics was largely explained by the synergistic effect of density dependence and winter harshness, as well as by interspecific competition with red deer, whose effects were seemingly stronger on the kid-female segment of the population.","[Donini, Valerio; Pedrotti, Luca] Stelvio Natl Pk, Sustainable Dev & Protected Areas Serv, Cogolo Di Pejo, Autonomous Prov, Italy; [Donini, Valerio; Pedrotti, Luca; Corlatti, Luca] Stelvio Natl Pk, Bormio, Italy; [Ferretti, Francesco] Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Siena, Italy; [Corlatti, Luca] Univ Freiburg, Chair Wildlife Ecol & Management, Freiburg, Germany","Corlatti, L (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Wildlife Ecol & Management, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",luca.corlatti@wildlife.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,102,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Recent evidence from South Africa shows that cheetahs avoid dominant predators at scent-marking sites, which may delay or inhibit intraspecific communication in cheetahs. However, little is known on whether this pattern of avoidance occurs elsewhere in the cheetah's range. We analysed a 9-year camera trap data set from north-central Namibia to explore interspecific use of marking sites by cheetahs and leopards. We documented frequent sharing of marking sites, which was likely facilitated through temporal segregation and by availability of alternative sites that were species-specific. We did not identify a stronger avoidance response of cheetahs to leopards than to conspecifics, suggesting that delayed communication by cheetahs resulting from predator avoidance may be limited in our study area. Seasonality affected patterns of marking site visitation, which may be attributed to behavioural changes in relation to reproduction or resource availability, or to differential detectability of olfactory cues among seasons. We recommend further research to better understand carnivore scent-marking, including behavioural responses to olfactory cues and environmental conditions, as well as intra- and interpopulation differences.","[Verschueren, Stijn; Briers-Louw, Willem D.; Cristescu, Bogdan; Nghikembua, Matti; Torres-Uribe, Carolina; Walker, Eli H.; Marker, Laurie] Cheetah Conservat Fund, Otjiwarongo, Namibia; [Verschueren, Stijn] Univ Antwerp, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Briers-Louw, Willem D.] Zambeze Delta Conservat, Marromeu, Mozambique; [Fabiano, Ezequiel] Univ Namibia, Dept Wildlife Management & Ecotourism, Katima Mulilo, Namibia","Verschueren, S (corresponding author), Cheetah Conservat Fund, Otjiwarongo, Namibia.",stijn@cheetah.org,,"Torres-Uribe, Carolina/0000-0001-9058-1133; Marker, Laurie/0000-0002-1636-2191; Verschueren, Stijn/0000-0003-1420-7689; WALKER, Eli/0000-0003-4946-7122",Cheetah Conservation Fund,Cheetah Conservation Fund,,59,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6707,1365-2028,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

However, a marked reduction in the environmental integrity of streams may lead to modifications of the natural dynamics of these communities, including co-occurrence patterns and body size. In the Amazon, the replacement of forests by production systems is one of the leading causes of alterations to riverine ecosystem. The insects of the order Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are predators known to compete for environmental resources but are also sensitive to environmental changes such as those caused by shifts in land use. In this scenario, the present study evaluated species co-occurrence and body size patterns in adult odonates found at preserved and altered Amazonian streams, to determine whether there are morphological differences among the species that enable their coexistence. During the study, 98 streams in the eastern Amazon region were sampled, and a habitat integrity index (HII) was used to evaluate the integrity of each stream (based on variables such as the condition of the riparian vegetation and channel, and land use). Ten male individuals were selected from each species, and nine morphometric measurements were taken from each individual. A total of 3588 specimens were collected and distributed in nine families, 49 genera and 134 species. We found a non-random pattern of co-occurrence in the species of the odonate suborder Zygoptera and a random pattern in the suborder Anisoptera, in both preserved and altered streams. We found morphological divergence between pairs of zygopteran species, in the whole sample and both categories of stream integrity separately. No such morphological divergence was found in the pairs of anisopteran species. The distribution patterns of odonate species are limited by specific environmental processes, especially in preserved environments and in specialists, such as most zygopterans. Zygopteran species have more specific microhabitat requirements, which could explain this pattern, whereas anisopterans prefer open environments, which usually have a greater supply of resources, although there tends to be less microhabitat heterogeneity, which leads to reduced competition. Given this, future studies should use limiting similarity (e.g. morphological attributes) in addition to environmental and spatial factors to better understand the factors structuring these communities. Among these mechanisms, the effects of common ancestry (phylogenetic inertia) and biogeography are important factors that should also be considered in future studies.","[Oliveira-Junior, Jose Max B.] Fed Univ Western Para, Inst Water Sci & Technol, Postgrad Program Soc Environm & Qual Life, Unidade Tapajos, BR-68040255 Santarem, Para, Brazil; [Oliveira-Junior, Jose Max B.] Fed Univ Western Para, Inst Water Sci & Technol, Postgrad Program Biodivers, Unidade Tapajos, BR-68040255 Santarem, Para, Brazil; [Oliveira-Junior, Jose Max B.] Fed Univ Western Para, Inst Water Sci & Technol, Postgrad Program Soc Nat & Dev, Unidade Tapajos, BR-68040255 Santarem, Para, Brazil; [Oliveira-Junior, Jose Max B.; Teodosio, Maria Alexandra] Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Oliveira-Junior, Jose Max B.; Juen, Leandro] Fed Univ Para, Inst Biol Sci, Postgrad Program Ecol, Ecol & Conservat Lab, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil","Oliveira, JMB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Western Para, Inst Water Sci & Technol, Postgrad Program Soc Environm & Qual Life, Unidade Tapajos, BR-68040255 Santarem, Para, Brazil.; Oliveira, JMB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Western Para, Inst Water Sci & Technol, Postgrad Program Biodivers, Unidade Tapajos, BR-68040255 Santarem, Para, Brazil.; Oliveira, JMB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Western Para, Inst Water Sci & Technol, Postgrad Program Soc Nat & Dev, Unidade Tapajos, BR-68040255 Santarem, Para, Brazil.; Oliveira, JMB (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.; Oliveira, JMB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Para, Inst Biol Sci, Postgrad Program Ecol, Ecol & Conservat Lab, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil.",jose.mbo@ufopa.edu.br,"Oliveira-Junior, Jose Max Barbosa/D-4459-2014; Teodosio, Maria/B-5077-2013","Oliveira-Junior, Jose Max Barbosa/0000-0002-0689-205X; Juen, Leandro/0000-0002-6188-4386; Teodosio, Maria/0000-0002-0939-9885","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); UFPA/MPEG Graduate Program in Zoology; National Institute of Science and Technology, Biodiversity and Land Use in the Amazon (Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia Biodiversidade e Uso da Terra na Amazonia) [CNPq 574008/2008-0]; Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria - Embrapa) [SEG: 02.08.06.005.00]; Darwin Initiative of the Government of the United Kingdom [17-023]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/F01614X/1, NE/G000816/1]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [304710/2019-9]; CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), through PROCAD-AMAZONIA/CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88881.474457/2020-01]; FundacAo para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) - Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/Multi/04326/2019]; Pro-Reitoria de Pesquisa e Pos-GraduacAo (PROPESP)/Universidade Federal do Para (UFPA)","We are grateful to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq) and the UFPA/MPEG Graduate Program in Zoology for a doctoral scholarship.

Specifically, longer and more pronounced waterlogged conditions are predicted after rain spells as well as more frequent droughts, especially in Central Europe. Such hydrological changes can severely affect species performance and alter the function of ecosystems, as well as favor plant invasions. Competition with native communities may change depending on water stress. Bunias orientalis is an invasive plant that may benefit from disturbance or precipitation changes. We conducted a 3-year mesocosm experiment in a common garden to investigate how invasion success of B. orientalis in native German grassland communities is affected by varying hydrological conditions (from very dry to waterlogged). We measured the establishment and growth of B. orientalis in varying water table depths in bare soil (simulating disturbance) vs. in the community. Establishment and biomass of B. orientalis was generally highest under non-stress conditions. The species was also highly tolerant to dry conditions, but only when growing in bare soil. However, performance of B. orientalis was generally low, whereby interspecific competition in communities greatly limited invasion success. This might be due to the low competitive ability of the species in conditions of hydrological stress and the near-natural grassland communities with an extensive mowing regime used in our experiment. Our results suggest that invasion success of B. orientalis in grasslands will not increase if precipitation patterns change toward more extreme events. However, disturbance that creates bare soil patches might favor B. orientalis under drought conditions.","[Corli, Anna] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Pavia, Italy; [Walter, Julia] Landwirtschaftl Technol Zentrum Augustenb, Pflanzenprod, Rheinstetten, Germany; [Sheppard, Christine S.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Stuttgart, Germany","Sheppard, CS (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Stuttgart, Germany.",christine.sheppard@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Sheppard, Christine S./0000-0002-7847-2310","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [WA 3442/2-1, SH 924/1-1]","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG, WA 3442/2-1 and SH 924/1-1).",,46,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

When ecological interactions come into play different types of models can be found, e.g. for consumer-resource systems the generalized Lotka-Volterra equation is widely used to model direct competition or predator-prey systems, and for mutualistic systems a functional response that limits the unbounded growth due to the mutual benefit is needed (usually Holling's type II). Based on a recent general model of population dynamics with intraspecific interactions we present a factored general logistic model of population dynamics with interand intraspecific interactions. A major advantage of this model is that it can be used for any type of interspecific ecological interaction and also for beneficial or detrimental intraspecific interaction, and always in a bounded way. In this study we write a general logistic model in a factored way to obtain the stationary solutions by a system of simple linear equations and we formulate the analytical expression for the Jacobian matrix of all the stationary solutions for an arbitrary number of populations. We also show that this simple model can be used to represent complex ecological systems; as an illustration we study some examples such as a stable direct competition with intraspecific cooperation, a predator-prey system with cooperative preys, a mutualism with harmful intraspecific interactions and a real bacterial system with 4 populations.","[Pastor, Juan Manuel; Galeano, Javier] Univ Politecn Madrid, Complex Syst Grp ETSIAAB, Madrid, Spain; [Stucchi, Luciano] Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru","Pastor, JM (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Complex Syst Grp ETSIAAB, Madrid, Spain.",juanmanuel.pastor@upm.es,"; Pastor, Juan Manuel/H-1359-2015","Stucchi, Luciano/0000-0002-2823-0778; Pastor, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-1067-3642","Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sport of Spain [PGC2018093854-B-100]","We thanks the anonymous reviewer and Christopher Moore for their useful comments that enriched the manuscript.

Predators should adapt their activity to that of prey, whereas predator avoidance would be expected to influence activity patterns and space use of prey and smaller competitors. We evaluated interspecific spatiotemporal relationships in a prey-rich community including an apex predator (the wolf), three wild ungulates and several smaller herbivores/mesocarnivores, through camera trapping. All considered species (i.e. wolves and potential prey/smaller competitors: wild boar, fallow deer, roe deer, crested porcupine, red fox and European badger) were active especially at night and/or twilight. Among wild ungulates, the wolf showed the greatest temporal overlap with the wild boar and the lowest one with the least abundant and used of them, i.e. the roe deer. The main prey (i.e. the fallow deer) showed more diurnal activity and a lower temporal overlap with the predator in sites with high wolf activity than in low-activity ones. Among mesocarnivores, the red fox showed extensive temporal overlap with the wolf: the overlap between the two canids was greater in sites intensively used by this apex predator than in sites with low wolf activity, supporting a concurrent study which suggested a potential for facilitative-rather than competitive-interactions. Spatiotemporal relationships suggest complex interactions between the apex predator, prey and smaller carnivores, for which a substantial temporal or spatial association was often supported.Significance statementThere is a growing interest in the influence of apex predators on ecosystems through their effects on the behaviour of prey and smaller carnivores, especially in the light of the ongoing recovery of large carnivores in temperate areas. Predators should synchronise their activity to that of prey; conversely, prey and smaller carnivores would be expected to avoid predators. In a rich community including the wolf, three wild ungulates and several mesomammals, we detected (i) a substantial temporal overlap between wolves and wild boar, porcupines and mesocarnivores; (ii) a negative temporal association between the predator and its main prey (i.e. the fallow deer) and (iii) a great temporal overlap between the wolf and the red fox. We provide a baseline to evaluate temporal changes of predator-prey-mesocarnivore behavioural interactions along with variations of carnivore-prey densities.","[Rossa, Mariana; Lovari, Sandro; Ferretti, Francesco] Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Res Unit Behav Ecol, Ethol & Wildlife Management, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Rossa, Mariana] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, CESAM, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Lovari, Sandro] Maremma Nat Hist Museum, Str Corsini 5, I-58100 Grosseto, Italy; [Ferretti, Francesco] Maremma Reg Pk Agcy, Via Bersagliere 7-9, I-58100 Alberese, Grosseto, Italy","Ferretti, F (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Res Unit Behav Ecol, Ethol & Wildlife Management, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.; Ferretti, F (corresponding author), Maremma Reg Pk Agcy, Via Bersagliere 7-9, I-58100 Alberese, Grosseto, Italy.",francesco.ferretti@unisi.it,,"Rossa, Mariana/0000-0003-1041-8227; LOVARI, Sandro/0000-0002-9945-0268",Universita degli Studi di Siena; Maremma Regional Park Agency; German Society for Mammalian Biology,Open Access funding provided by Universita degli Studi di Siena.

Tick-borne pathogens can provide a useful model system, because larvae become infected only when feeding on a competent host during their first blood meal. For tick-borne diseases, competence has been studied best for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), which causes Lyme borreliosis. Major reservoirs include several small mammal species, but birds might play an under-recognized role in human risk given their ability to disperse infected ticks across large spatial scales. Here, we provide a global synthesis of the ecological and evolutionary factors that determine the ability of bird species to infect larval ticks with Bbsl. Location; Global. Time period: 1983-2019. Major taxa studied: Birds. Methods: We compiled a dataset of Bbsl competence across 183 bird species and applied meta-analysis, phylogenetic factorization and boosted regression trees to describe spatial and temporal patterns in competence, characterize its phylogenetic distribution across birds, reconstruct its evolution and evaluate the trait profiles associated with competent avian species. Results: Half of the sampled bird species show evidence of competence for Bbsl. Competence displays moderate phylogenetic signal, has evolved multiple times across bird species and is pronounced in the genus Turdus. Trait-based analyses distinguished competent birds with 80% accuracy and showed that such species have low baseline corticosterone, exist on both ends of the pace-of-life continuum, breed and winter at high latitudes and have broad migratory movements into their breeding range. We used these trait profiles to predict various likely but unsampled competent species, including novel concentrations of avian reservoirs within the Neotropics. Main conclusion: Our results can generate new hypotheses for how birds contribute to the dynamics of tick-borne pathogens and help to prioritize surveillance of likely but unsampled competent birds. Our findings also emphasize that birds display under-recognized variation in their contributions to enzootic cycles of Bbsl and the broader need to consider competence in ecological and predictive studies of multi-host pathogens.","[Becker, Daniel J.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 East Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Becker, Daniel J.] Univ Georgia, Ctr Ecol Infect Dis, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Han, Barbara A.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY USA","Becker, DJ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 East Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",danbeck@iu.edu,"Becker, Daniel/A-6466-2014; Han, Barbara/H-9363-2015","Becker, Daniel/0000-0003-4315-8628; Han, Barbara/0000-0002-9948-3078","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1619072, DEB-1717282]; Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1619072 and DEB-1717282; Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program",,115,2,2,6,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

We assessed the potential for facilitative/competitive interactions between the two most widespread carnivores in the world, the wolf and the red fox, in a prey-rich area recently recolonized by the apex predator. One could expect that the superior competitor would ecologically suppress the inferior one, leading to avoidance of the former by the latter. In a Mediterranean coastal area (2017-2018), we assessed spatiotemporal and dietary interspecific overlap and investigated whether the recovery of wolves affected food habits of foxes. Spatiotemporal overlap was extensive (0.84-0.89). Wild ungulates were the staple of the wolf diet (similar to 88-90%); foxes used mainly invertebrates and fruits (similar to 78%), with ungulates being a substantial food category (13% of diet; 66% of occurrences among vertebrate prey). Interspecific dietary overlap was low (0.23), but extensive (0.89) for vertebrate prey. In comparison to a preceding wolf-free period, the volume and occurrence of large mammals in the diet of foxes showed a 2.8- to 3.5-fold increase. Apparently, foxes did not avoid wolves, which provided additional food to the foxes as prey leftovers. In a rich community, the presence of wolves may increase the food spectrum of foxes. Temporal variation of facilitation vs. competition should be assessed in relationship to spatiotemporal changes of predator-prey numbers.","[Ferretti, Francesco; Pacini, Giada; Belardi, Irene; Ten Cate, Bouke; Sensi, Marco; Oliveira, Raquel; Rossa, Mariana; Burrini, Lucia; Lovari, Sandro] Univ Siena, Res Unit Behav Ecol Ethol & Wildlife Management, Dept Life Sci, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Rossa, Mariana] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Lovari, Sandro] Maremma Nat Hist Museum, Str Corsini 5, I-58100 Grosseto, Italy","Ferretti, F (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Res Unit Behav Ecol Ethol & Wildlife Management, Dept Life Sci, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",francesco.ferretti@unisi.it,,"Rossa, Mariana/0000-0003-1041-8227; LOVARI, Sandro/0000-0002-9945-0268",Maremma Regional Park Agency; German Society for Mammalian Biology,"We are deeply indebted to L.

AGB of population were predicted for the same species and other species through using 2/3 of the measured data, and the optimal predictive equation was linear in terms of determination coefficient. The other 1/3 of the data, which was measured from no grazing paddocks or rotational grazing paddocks, was substituted into the predictive equations for validation. Results showed that PC of one dominant species could be used to predict AGB of the same species or other species well. The predicted and measured values were significantly correlative, and most of the predictive accuracy was above 80%, and not affected by managements of grassland, including rotational grazing or no grazing. A combination of 3 to 6 representative species was used to predict AGB of the community, and the predictive equations with PC of six species as an independent variable were the most optimal because explaining 83.5% variation of AGB.

A key challenge is to understand variation in species interactions along environmental gradients. Thestress gradient hypothesisposits that positive interactions increase and competitive interactions decrease with increasing consumer pressure or environmental stress. This hypothesis has received extensive attention in plant community ecology, but only a handful of tests in animals. Furthermore, few empirical studies have examined multiple co-occurring stressors. Here we test predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis using the occurrence of mixed-species groups in six common grazing ungulate species within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. We use mixed-species groups as a proxy for potential positive interactions because they may enhance protection from predators or increase access to high-quality forage. Alternatively, competition for resources may limit the formation of mixed-species groups. Using more than 115,000 camera trap observations collected over 5 yr, we found that mixed-species groups were more likely to occur in risky areas (i.e., areas closer to lion vantage points and in woodland habitat where lions hunt preferentially) and during time periods when resource levels were high. These results are consistent with the interpretation that stress from high predation risk may contribute to the formation of mixed-species groups, but that competition for resources may prevent their formation when food availability is low. Our results are consistent with support for the stress gradient hypothesis in animals along a consumer pressure gradient while identifying the potential influence of a co-occurring stressor, thus providing a link between research in plant community ecology on the stress gradient hypothesis, and research in animal ecology on trade-offs between foraging and risk in landscapes of fear.","[Beaudrot, Lydia] Rice Univ, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, BioSci Dept, W100 George R Brown Hall,6100 Main St,MS-140, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Palmer, Meredith S.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Anderson, T.

Among other predators,Bdellovibrioand like organism (BALOs) have received recently a great attention due to the high potential applications such as biocontrol agent in medicine, agriculture, aquaculture and water treatment. Despite the increasing interest in this predatory bacterium, its complex lifestyle and growth conditions hamper the full exploitation of their biotechnological properties. In order to overcome these important shortcomings, we provide here the first genome-scale model of a predator bacterium constructed so far. By using the model as a computational testbed, we provide solid evidences of the metabolic autonomy of this interesting bacterium in terms of growth, as well as its dynamic metabolism powering the predatory biphasic life style. We found a low metabolic robustness thus suggesting that Bdellovibrio is more niche-specific than previously thought and that the environmental conditions governing predation may be relatively uniform. Overall, we provide here a valuable computational tool largely facilitating rational design of novel and controlled predator-based biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications. In this study we analyze the growth-phase dependent metabolic states ofBdellovibrio bacteriovorusby constructing a fully compartmented, mass and charge-balanced genome-scale metabolic model of this predatory bacterium (iCH457). Considering the differences between life cycle phases driving the growth of this predator, growth-phase condition-specific models have been generated allowing the systematic study of its metabolic capabilities. Using these computational tools, we have been able to analyze, from a system level, the dynamic metabolism of the predatory bacteria as the life cycle progresses. We provide computational evidences supporting potential axenic growth ofB.bacteriovorus's in a rich medium based on its encoded metabolic capabilities. Our systems-level analysis confirms the presence of energy-saving mechanisms in this predator as well as an abrupt metabolic shift between the attack and intraperiplasmic growth phases. Our results strongly suggest that predatory bacteria's metabolic networks have low robustness, likely hampering their ability to tackle drastic environmental fluctuations, thus being confined to stable and predictable habitats. Overall, we present here a valuable computational testbed based on predatory bacteria activity for rational design of novel and controlled biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications.","[Herencias, Cristina; Salgado-Briegas, Sergio; Prieto, Maria A.] CSIC, Microbial & Plant Biotechnol Dept, Biol Res Ctr, Madrid, Spain; [Salgado-Briegas, Sergio; Prieto, Maria A.; Nogales, Juan] Spanish Natl Res Council SusPlast CSIC, Interdisciplinary Platform Sustainable Plast Circ, Madrid, Spain; [Nogales, Juan] CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Syst Biol, Madrid, Spain; [Herencias, Cristina] Hosp Univ Ramon y Cajal, Inst Ramon y Cajal Invest Sanitaria IRYCIS, Dept Microbiol, Madrid, Spain","Nogales, J (corresponding author), Spanish Natl Res Council SusPlast CSIC, Interdisciplinary Platform Sustainable Plast Circ, Madrid, Spain.; Nogales, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Syst Biol, Madrid, Spain.",j.nogales@csic.es,"Herencias, Cristina/AAB-3021-2021","Herencias, Cristina/0000-0002-1384-3109; Prieto Jimenez, M.

In this study, we use four decades of data on cod and flounder distributions covering the southern and central Baltic Sea to: (1) model and map the changes in the distributions of the two species using generalized additive models; (2) quantify the temporal changes in the potential competitive and predator-prey interactions between them using spatial overlap indices; (3) relate these changes in overlap to the known dynamics of the different cod and flounder populations in the Baltic Sea. Competition overlap has continuously increased for cod, from the beginning of the time-series. This is a possible cause of the observed decline in feeding levels and body condition of small and intermediate sized cod. Flounder overlap with large cod instead has decreased substantially, suggesting a predation release of flounder, potentially triggering its increase in abundance and distribution range observed in the last decades.","[Orio, Alessandro; Casini, Michele] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Inst Marine Res, Turistgatan 5, Lysekil 45330, Sweden; [Bergstrom, Ulf; Florin, Ann-Britt] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Inst Coastal Res, Skolgatan 6, Oregrund 74242, Sweden; [Sics, Ivo] Inst Food Safety Anim Hlth & Environm BIOR, Dept Fish Resources, Lejupes St 3, Riga 1076, Latvia","Orio, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Inst Marine Res, Turistgatan 5, Lysekil 45330, Sweden.",alessandro.orio@slu.se,"Orio, Alessandro/O-4136-2019","Orio, Alessandro/0000-0002-5566-6139; Florin, Ann-Britt/0000-0002-7531-2231; Bergstrom, Ulf/0000-0002-5478-0634; Casini, Michele/0000-0003-4910-5236",BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS (Art. 185); EUEuropean Commission; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; State Education Development Agency (Latvia),"We thank Andreas Lehmann for providing us with the environmental data used in the modeling.

The co-existence of multiple carnivores in an ecosystem could be restricted by their similarity in ecological niches (e.g. dietary overlap); however, high prey abundances could facilitate their co-existence. Although the development of small, enclosed reserves (<400 km(2)) in South Africa has reduced human-carnivore conflict, these systems may increase the likelihood of carnivore intra-guild competition due to the clumping of competing carnivores into these restricted spaces. Using carnivore scat and kill site analyses, we determined the dietary preferences and overlap of sympatric large carnivores in a small, enclosed reserve, Selati Game Reserve (Selati). Large carnivores in Selati (lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and leopards (Panthera pardus)) preferentially selected for varying combinations of prey size classes. Lions selected for large prey, leopards selected for small prey and spotted hyaenas did not prefer any particular prey size. Additionally, lions had the largest dietary breadth and the diet of leopards and spotted hyaenas overlapped considerably. Coupled with high prey densities in Selati, the predation strategies of the large carnivores could be facilitating their co-existence. On the other hand, the high degree of dietary overlap among large carnivores suggests that there is strong potential for exploitation competition, particularly between spotted hyaenas and leopards as their diet overlapped extensively (91% and 93% for prey species and size class, respectively). Although spotted hyaenas are potentially outcompeting leopards in Selati, lions were the most dominant large carnivore. Our study reiterates the complexity of carnivore guild interactions and emphasizes how these interactions are subject to variation due to site-specific circumstances (e.g. composition of prey and carnivore populations). We therefore encourage site-specific, multi-carnivore research throughout protected areas in southern Africa.","[Comley, J.; Mgqatsa, N.; Parker, D.

Larval amphibians are concurrently exposed to biological stressors, such as competition and predation, as they often co-occur in diverse, multi-species assemblages. Thus, to accurately predict species' response to climate change, we empirically tested the interaction between a biotic and abiotic driver. We focused on three amphibian species that overlap in distribution and phenology across high elevations of the Cascade Mountain Range of the U.S. Pacific Northwest: the Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla), Cascades frog (Rana cascadae), and Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas). Amphibians in this region are threatened by drought-induced habitat loss resulting from the shortened hydroperiod and, in some areas, complete elimination of seasonal wetlands. We conducted a fully factorial experiment to determine the interactive effects of competition and drying on amphibian growth, development, and survival. We found that the impact of drying on each species was largely dependent upon interspecific competition dynamics. Competitive interactions, particularly in the three-species competition treatment, exacerbated the effects of drying, with both competition- and context-dependent responses to these stressors. Through an analysis of species-level effects, as well as an examination of secondary productivity (i.e., total biomass across treatments), we determined that Cascades frogs are the dominant competitor in this system owing to their larger body size and relative ability to withstand the stress of a rapidly drying hydroperiod. Our results suggest that ignoring biotic interactions in predictions of species response to climate change factors may be misleading.","[Thurman, Lindsey L.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, 2327 Univ Way 2, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Thurman, Lindsey L.; Garcia, Tiffany S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97300 USA","Thurman, LL (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, 2327 Univ Way 2, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.; Thurman, LL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97300 USA.",lthurman@usgs.gov,"Thurman, Lindsey/AAF-7056-2020",,Department of the Interior Northwest Climate Science Center Graduate Fellowship,"We would like to thank S.

Mesic environments favor the action of parasites and predators on gall communities, while the factors that determine the structure of gall communities in xeric environments remain unknown. We evaluated the structure of gall communities along an environmental gradient defined by intrinsic plant characteristics, soil fertility, and aridity, and investigated the role of competition as a structuring force of gall communities in xeric environments. We created null models to compare observed and simulated patterns of co-occurrence of galls and used the C-score index to assess community aggregation or segregation. We used the NES C-score (standardized C-score) to compare patterns of co-occurrence with parameters of environmental quality. Xeric environments had poorer and more arid soils and more sclerophyllous plants than mesic environments, which was reflected in the distribution patterns of gall communities. Values of the C-score index revealed a segregated distribution of gall morphospecies in xeric environments, but a random distribution in mesic environments. The low availability of resources for oviposition and the high density of gallers in xeric environments reinforce interspecific competition as an important structuring force for gall communities in these environments.","[Ramos, Leticia F.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Programa Pos Grad Ecol Manejo & Conservacao Vida, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Ramos, Leticia F.; Santos, Henrique T.; Fagundes, Marcilio] Univ Estadual Montes Claros, Programa Pos Grad Biodiversidade & Uso Recursos N, Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Solar, Ricardo R.

At the same time the retreat of native pedunculate oak (Q. robur L.) has been observed. We aimed to recognize the extent of natural regeneration and recruitment of pedunculate (PO) and red oak (RO) in managed forests (central Poland) on sites typical of oak-pine mixed forest, as well as to identify habitat conditions which favour the occurrence of native oak and spread of the alien oak. The abundance and heights of juveniles of both oaks, as well as the impacts of the canopy, nurse and burial effects, on distribution and occurrence of oak specimens were studied on 1000 study plots (1 m 2 each), in two transects crossing the Scots pine-pedunculate oak forest (POF) and the Scots pine-northern red oak forest (ROF). We revealed an advantage of introduced RO over native PO in natural regeneration, recruitment and spread. However, we did not find direct (interspecific) competition between PO and RO recruits. RO predominance over PO resulted from more effective colonization of empty niches by the alien oak in POF (suitable for both species), and the abundant establishment of RO seedlings and saplings within ROF. In contrast, PO was not able to recolonize ROF. The regeneration of RO was microsite-limited in ROF gaps in the regeneration phase (probably due to site moisture deficiency) and under closed RO canopy in the recruitment phase (due to low light availability), and microsite-favoured under mature tree crowns due to the burial effect of the litter layer (and higher light availability under heterogeneous canopy). In POF, RO regeneration was microsite-favoured due to the burial effect of a dense moss layer and the nurse effect of shrubs, including conspecifics. PO regeneration was also microsite-favoured due to the burial effect of the moss layer, but its recruitment was herbivore-limited there (due to browsing). The co-occurrence of PO and RO specimens, both in POF and ROF, resulted from forest community structure, oak ecology and behaviour of acorn dispersers. Because the native PO is at a disadvantage in its native range caused by a lower share of mature trees in forested areas, strong impacts of fungal pathogens and high pressure by insects and large herbivores (also noted in our study), the introduced oak is able to become a serious competitor.","[Woziwoda, Beata; Kobus, Sylwia] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Geobot & Plant Ecol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Dyderski, Marcin K.; Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Parzych, Agnieszka] Pomeranian Univ Slupsk, Inst Biol & Environm Protect, Arciszewskiego 22b, PL-76200 Slupsk, Poland","Woziwoda, B (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Geobot & Plant Ecol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",beata.woziwoda@biol.uni.lodz.pl; marcin.dyderski@gmail.com; agnieszka.parzych@apsl.edu.pl; amj@man.poznan.pl,"Woziwoda, Beata/ABA-6375-2020; Dyderski, Marcin K/J-9022-2019; Jagodzinski, Andrzej M./AAA-2537-2021","Dyderski, Marcin K/0000-0003-4453-2781; Jagodzinski, Andrzej M./0000-0001-6899-0985; Woziwoda, Beata/0000-0003-2270-2508",University of Lodz,"This study was financially supported by the University of Lodz in the 2nd edition of the Student Research Grants 2018 (granted: Sylwia Kobus, student of MSc study in biology, under supervision of Beata Woziwoda).",,103,7,7,6,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

We analyzed field-collected videos of open-field tests to assess potential differences in innate behaviors between the two species. Collared lemmings were less active and exhibited less exploratory behavior than did brown lemmings, which were more active under cover than in the open. Similar behaviors scaling along axes of activity and curiosity were revealed by principal components analysis. Each axis defined different aspects of brown lemming personality, but repeated testing of the same individuals yielded a striking dependence of their behavioral response on open-field treatments. Even so, the differences between species in behavior correlate well with their habitat preferences that resolve competition and govern their coexistence.","[Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Dupuch, Angelique] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Moses, MaryJane] Ontario Minist Environm Conservat & Pk, Thunder Bay, ON P7E 6S7, Canada; [Busniuk, Kaylee] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Cognit & Behav Ecol Grad Program, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Otterman, Helen] Lakehead Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Busniuk, Kaylee/0000-0002-5336-8576",Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP)Natural Resources Canada,"We thank our Arctic co-adventurers, N.

Game-theoretic models predict that selection will maintain offspring-size variation when large offspring are superior competitors (i.e., competition is asymmetric), but small offspring are superior colonizers. Empirical tests are equivocal, however, and typically rely on interspecific comparisons, whereas explicit intraspecific tests are rare. In a field study, we test whether offspring size affects competitive asymmetries using the sessile marine invertebrate, Bugula neritina. Surprisingly, we show that offspring size determines whether interactions are competitive or facilitative-large neighbors strongly facilitated small offspring, but also strongly competed with large offspring. These findings contradict the assumptions of classic theory-that is, large offspring were not superior competitors. Instead, smaller offspring actually benefit from interactions with large offspring-suggesting that asymmetric facilitation, rather than asymmetric competition, operates in our system. We argue that facilitation of small offspring may be more widespread than currently appreciated, and may maintain variation in offspring size via negative frequency-dependent selection. Offspring size theory has classically viewed offspring interactions through the lens of competition alone, yet our results and those of others suggest that theory should accommodate positive interactions in explorations of offspring-size variation.","[Cameron, Hayley; Marshall, Dustin J.] Monash Univ, Ctr Geometr Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Cameron, H (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Ctr Geometr Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",Hayley.cameron@monash.edu,,,,,,65,3,3,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,AUG,2019,73,8,,,,,1663,1671,,10.1111/evo.13790,,JUL 2019,9,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,IS3ZJ,WOS:000476336000001,31313289,,,,2021-09-21,

The insecticidal efficiency of EPNs is modulated by food web dynamics. EPNs can reproduce in freeze-killed insect larvae, even in competition with free-living bacterivorous nematodes (FLBNs) in the genus Oscheius. The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of EPNs as scavengers when competing with free-living saprophagous nematodes and fungi, and to determine the possible impact on subsequent EPN offspring fitness. Live and freeze-killed larvae of Galleria mellonella were used to evaluate the reproduction rate and progeny fitness of two EPN species, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema feltiae, applied individually or combined with the FLBN species Oscheius onirici or Pristionchus maupasi, or Aspergillus flavus, an opportunistic saprophytic fungus. We hypothesized that (1) EPN scavenging behaviors previously observed (for H. megidis and S. kraussei) apply to other EPN species, (2) infective juveniles (IJs) emerging from freeze-killed larvae will display reduced pathogenicity and reproduction, and (3) fitness reduction will be amplified by exposure to other organisms competing for the resources. The reproduction rate of S. feltiae was lower in freeze-killed larvae than in larvae infected and killed by the nematode, whereas H. bacteriophora failed to reproduce as a scavenger. The S. feltiae Fl IJs that emerged from freeze-killed larvae exhibited lower pathogenicity rates than Us resulting from entomopathogenic activity, and also lower reproductive rates if they experienced high FLBN competitive pressure during development. This study illustrates that scavenging is a suboptimal alternative pathway for EPNs, especially in the face of scavenger competition, even though it provides a means for some EPN species to complete their life-cycle.","[Blanco-Perez, Ruben; Bueno-Pallero, Francisco Angel; Campos-Herrera, Raquel] Univ Algarve, Ctr Mediterranean Bioresources & Food, MeditBio, Campus Gambelas, P-8005 Faro, Portugal; [Blanco-Perez, Ruben; Vicente-Diez, Ignacio; Campos-Herrera, Raquel] Univ La Rioja, CSIC, Inst Ciencias Vid & Vino, Gobiemo La Rioja, Logrono 26007, Spain; [Santiago Marco-Mancebon, Vicente; Perez-Moreno, Ignacio] Univ La Rioja, Dept Agr & Alimentac, Logrono 26006, Spain","Campos-Herrera, R (corresponding author), Univ La Rioja, CSIC, Inst Ciencias Vid & Vino, Gobiemo La Rioja, Logrono 26007, Spain.",raquel.campos@icvv.es,"Marco-Mancebon, Vicente S./K-9365-2014; Campos-Herrera, Raquel/Z-2427-2019","Marco-Mancebon, Vicente S./0000-0002-2484-4238; Campos-Herrera, Raquel/0000-0003-0852-5269; Blanco-Perez, Ruben/0000-0002-6875-7822","Government of Portugal (FCT) [IF/00552/2014/CP1234/CT0007]; Investigator Programme contract (FCT, Portugal) [IF/00552/2014]; Universidade do Algarve, Portugal [UAlg-2016/004, UAlg-2016/003]; Government of Spain; Ramon y Cajal contractSpanish Government [RYC-2016-19939]; Government of La Rioja (Spain) [CAR-2018]","The authors thank Dr. Xoaquin Moreira (Mision Miologica de Galicia, CSIC, Spain) for his help with the statistical analysis, and to Dr. Larry W.

We used generalized linear mixed models to estimate long-term trends in adult loon counts and chick survival and examined environmental variables associated with loon abundance. Adult common loon counts increased in all five subregions by 0.6-3.6% annually, whereas Pacific loons decreased 3% in the Anchorage subregion, but otherwise had trends not distinguishable from zero. Lake area was positively associated with common loon abundance and negatively associated with Pacific loon abundance. We also noted an inverse relationship between common loon and Pacific loon presence, consistent with the premise of interspecific competition. We did not find strong relationships between loon presence and predictor variables indicative of human disturbance or lakeshore development. Estimates of chick survival over time also revealed no clear pattern, although common loon chicks showed a decline in survival over the study period in one subregion. Citizen science programs provide agencies with a cost-effective tool to collect data over large spatial and temporal extents, which may not be feasible otherwise. However, there are ramifications of common data deficiencies associated with casual or unstructured observations, which can violate the assumptions required for rigorous statistical analysis. The implementation of a carefully predefined sampling protocol can avoid sampling bias, eliminate stringent assumptions, and ensure higher information content of citizen science data.","[McDuffie, Laura A.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Migratory Bird Management, 1011 East Tudor Rd,MS 201, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; [Hagelin, Julie C.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Threatened Endangered & Divers Program, 1300 Coll Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [Snively, Marian L.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Threatened Endangered & Divers Program, 333 Raspberry Rd, Anchorage, AK 99518 USA; [Pendleton, Grey W.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Wildlife Conservat, POB 115526, Juneau, AK 99811 USA; [Taylor, Audrey R.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA","McDuffie, LA (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Migratory Bird Management, 1011 East Tudor Rd,MS 201, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA.",laura_mcduffie@fws.gov,,,"Alaska Loon and Grebe Watch Program; ADF&G, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service; Alaska Zoo, U.S. Forest Service; Alaska Natural Heritage Program; Department of Defense (JBER); State Wildlife grant","Alaska Loon and Grebe Watch Program include AD We thank the hundreds of citizen scientist volunteers who submitted observational data over the duration of the Alaska Loon (and Grebe) Watch program.

In some cases, this mixed introduction can induce an increase in the predation rates of the pest and even of the parasitoid. To explain this phenomenon, it has been hypothesized that the presence of parasitoids (revealed by their mobility or related products) and interspecific competition (parasitoid vs predator) could influence such rates of predation. Therefore, in the present study we tested the effect of parasitoid mobility, host hemolymph (produced by parasitoid host-feeding) and parasitoid species (competing vs. non-competing species of the predator) on the number of prey consumed by the predator. Additionally, to add weight to the results of the bioassays, we determined whether the gender of the predators and parasitoids induced an effect on prey consumption by the predator by performing three bioassays under randomized block designs. Our results showed that neither parasitoid mobility nor host hemolymph presence modified the number of whitefly nymphs preyed upon by the predator. However, the number of whitefly nymphs consumed was significantly higher when the predator was introduced together with the competing parasitoid species relative to treatments with the non-competing parasitoid. In addition, we found that the predator preyed upon more mobile than immobile parasitoids and more competing than noncompeting parasitoids. As for predator gender, we found that female predators consumed more whitefly nymphs relative to male predators and wasp gender did not affect predation. Overall, our results suggest that interspecific competition may be a more important factor regulating predator consumption than parasitoid mobility or the presence of the host hemolymph.","[Izascum Perez-Valencia, Laura; Camorlinga-Cortes, Paulina; Carolina Carrillo-Arambula, Lucia; Andrea Palmeros-Suarez, Paola; Ramirez-Romero, Ricardo] Univ Guadalajara, Biol Control Lab, Dept Agron, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico","Ramirez-Romero, R (corresponding author), Univ Guadalajara, Biol Control Lab, Dept Agron, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico.",rramirez@cucba.udg.mx,"Perez, Laura/AAD-5814-2020","Ramirez-Romero, Ricardo/0000-0003-1310-0484",CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [157259]; UC-Mexus-Conacyt ProgramConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CN12608],"We thank Luis Enrique Chavarin-Gomez and Pedro Torres Enciso (BCL-UdG) for their technical assistance.

However, individuals are embedded in complex networks of ecological interactions with other members of the community, allowing for a range of direct and indirect effects that depend on the trophic structure of the community. Here we show that effects of warming (i.e. increase in mean temperature) on a given species can strongly depend on the community context and trophic complexity of the system. Specifically, we manipulated the presence/ absence of two competing tadpole species and their dragonfly predators to simulate different food webs of increasing complexity that were exposed to ambient or warmed conditions. We found that warming dramatically reduced herbivore (tadpole) survival in the absence of strong interspecific competition and predation, but it had no measureable effect on demographic rates on the dominant competitor in more complex communities where it was exposed to interspecific competition and predation. Conversely, our results also indicate that warming reduced the strength of interspecific competition and predation in our system. These results suggest that trophic complexity could potentially buffer climate change effects on populations and emphasize that we often cannot predict the effects of changes in abiotic conditions on a given population without accounting for the community context.","[Rudolf, Volker H.

Uncertainty over the causes of such non-additivity among multiple stressors confounds forecasts of their net ecological impact. Although stressors can interact directly within the environment to mediate their combined effects on communities, species interactions likely also play key roles. Here, we use a simulation model to explore how species interactions cause community responses (changes in species richness and total biomass) to paired stressors to differ from what we would expect based on the individual effects of each stressor (the additive effect). We demonstrate how interspecific interactions cause communities to respond non-additively to stressors, and how this depends on whether these interactions are negative or positive and whether the stressors have positive or negative impacts on the community property of interest. When pairwise species interactions involve at least one negative interaction (i.e., competition or predation), stressors combine to have greater than expected negative impacts (e.g., species or biomass loss) and less than expected positive impacts (e.g., biomass increases). In contrast, reciprocally positive interactions between species (i.e., facilitation) generally cause stressors to have additive, or slightly less than additive, net effects on species richness and community biomass. While species interactions determine the nature of the combined impact of multiple stressors (i.e., greater than or less than expected), species co-tolerance and stressor timing (i.e., sequential vs simultaneous application) only modify the magnitude of this effect. These findings highlight how interactions among species can contribute to non-additive responses by communities to environmental change, in addition to those caused by interactions among stressors themselves.","[Thompson, Patrick L.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [MacLennan, Megan M.; Vinebrooke, Rolf D.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Thompson, PL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",patrick.thompson@zoology.ubc.ca,"Thompson, Patrick L/B-6213-2012","Thompson, Patrick L/0000-0002-5278-9045; MacLennan, Megan/0000-0001-6518-0290",Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),PLT is supported by a Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada Discovery grant awarded to RDV.,,47,12,12,6,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,NOV,2018,9,11,,,,,,,e02518,10.1002/ecs2.2518,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HD6DA,WOS:000452621900003,,gold,,,2021-09-21,

Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) simultaneously model the species-environment relationships of multiple species and the residual correlation between these species. These residual correlations are assumed to depict whether species co-occur less or more often than expected by the modelled species-environment relationships, which could ultimately be attributed to species interactions, or hidden environmental information. Here, we propose to specifically test the capacity of JSDMs to detect species interactions from co-occurrence data, at different scales of data aggregation. Using a recently published point-process model, we simulated equilibrium co-occurrence patterns of species pairs by varying the strength and type of interactions (e.g. competition, predator-prey, mutualism) as well as the prevalence of the interacting species in homogeneous environments (assuming the environment does not influence the species responses and co-occurrence). Then, we fitted JSDMs without environmental predictors, and compared the estimated residual correlations against the known interaction coefficients. JSDMs detected competition and mutualism well, but failed with predator-prey interactions. For the latter, JSDMs predicted both negative and positive residual correlations for these kinds of interactions, depending on the prevalence of the interacting species. Interestingly, the estimated residual correlation was strongly influenced by species' prevalence and can thus not be translated to interaction strength. At increasingly coarser data resolution, the signals of negative and positive interactions became indiscernible by JSDMs, but - reassuringly - were rarely confounded. The underlying point-process model simulates the consequences rather than the mechanisms of interspecific interactions, and thus is better at corroborating rather than discrediting JSDMs. Nevertheless, our simple theoretical exercise pinpoints important limitations of JSDMs. In conclusion, we caution against interpreting residual correlations from JSDMs as interaction strength and against comparing these across different species and communities.","[Zurell, Damaris] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Dept Landscape Dynam, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Zurell, Damaris] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Pollock, Laura J.; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, Grenoble, France","Zurell, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Dept Landscape Dynam, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.; Zurell, D (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany.",damaris.zurell@hu-berlin.de,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Zurell, Damaris/E-2439-2012","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Zurell, Damaris/0000-0002-4628-3558","People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under REA [624958, 659422]; Swiss National Science Foundation SNSFSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PZ00P3_168136/1]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-2011-StG-281422-TEEMBIO]","DZ acknowledges funding from the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under REA grant agreement no. 624958, and from the Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF (grant: PZ00P3_168136/1).

We measured the extent to which the diets of barn owls (Tyto alba) and long-eared owls (Asio otus) in Israel overlap and examined whether yearly differences in diet overlap correlate with barn owl breeding success. Pianka's index of niche overlap was positively related to barn owl population size but not to its breeding success. The number of breeding barn owls was higher when long-eared owls consumed more rodents, suggesting that diet overlap most likely increased when rodents became more abundant. Therefore, in Israel, when these two owl species prey more often on rodents, their diets are more similar and interspecific competition is reduced. Unlike sympatric populations in Europe, in years when rodents are less abundant in Israel long-eared owls switch to hunting alternative prey (e.g., birds), perhaps to avoid competition with barn owls.","[Charter, Motti] Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, IL-1290000 Katzrin, Israel; [Izhaki, Ido] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Roulin, Alexandre] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, IL-1290000 Katzrin, Israel.",chartermotti@gmail.com,"Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019; Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021","Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683; Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356",Israel Hoopoe Foundation; Society for the Protection of Nature Israel; Israel Ministry of Agriculture; Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection; Addax and Oryx Foundation; University of Haifa; Minerva Center for Movement Ecology; Israel Meteorological Center for weather data,"We thank Maria Novoslov, Yuval Cohen, Tomer Chen, Inbal Segev, Hadas Sela for pellet cleaning, Kobi Meyrom for field assistance and Simon Birrer and Andrew Wolfenden for comments on the paper.

Unlike interactions between smaller cyprinid and percid fishes, the resource use by coexisting predatory asp (Leuciscus aspius) and pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) is relatively unknown. Here, gut content and stable isotope analyses were used to study ontogenetic dietary shifts and interspecific trophic niche overlap between asp and pikeperch coexisting in two reservoirs. The hypothesis that both species show an ontogenetic dietary shift from small invertebrates to large fish prey, but at the same time use different prey resources to reduce potential competitive interactions, was validated. The isotopic niches of the two predators showed no, or only a moderate, degree of overlap (0%-65%). The ontogenetic changes in the degree of interspecific isotopic niche overlap were different in the two reservoirs, suggesting that trophic segregation can be dynamic and variable among systems. Gut contents revealed that small (<100mm standard length) asp consumed mostly terrestrial invertebrates and emerged aquatic insects, whereas small pikeperch foraged on zooplankton, larval and pupal stages of aquatic insects and fish. Larger individuals (>100mm) of both species were predominantly piscivorous, with asp consuming more cyprinid prey and pikeperch more percid prey. Coexisting asp and pikeperch populations are able to utilise different prey resources, thereby reducing potential negative competitive interactions.","[Vasek, Mojmir; Vejrikova, Ivana; Blabolil, Petr; Riha, Milan; Juza, Tomas; Smejkal, Marek; Matena, Josef; Kubecka, Jan; Peterka, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Biol Ctr, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Eloranta, Antti P.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, Norway","Vasek, M (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Biol Ctr, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",mojmir.vasek@seznam.cz,"Blabolil, Petr/N-8719-2019; Vasek, Mojmir/C-5839-2014; Smejkal, Marek/E-1269-2017; Blabolil, Petr/K-9548-2015; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011; Eloranta, Antti Pekka/AAA-1426-2020; Juza, Tomas/G-3159-2014; Riha, Milan/AAF-9819-2019; Peterka, Jiri/C-7218-2014; Riha, Milan/G-1065-2014; Vejrikova, Ivana/E-1624-2017","Blabolil, Petr/0000-0003-1344-9627; Vasek, Mojmir/0000-0001-6386-4015; Smejkal, Marek/0000-0002-7887-6411; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854; Riha, Milan/0000-0002-3930-420X; Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135; Vejrikova, Ivana/0000-0001-9113-2815",Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2009-2014 [7F14316]; Grantova agentura Ceske republikyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-01625S]; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [677039]; Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk,"Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2009-2014, Grant/Award Number: 7F14316; Grantova agentura Ceske republiky, Grant/Award Number: 15-01625S; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 677039; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research",,57,8,8,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

What controls the distribution and abundance of organisms? This question, at the heart of the dynamics of ecological communities, would have been familiar to the earliest ecologists. Having lain effectively abandoned for many years, community dynamics today is a vibrant research topic of great conceptual interest with practical import for conservation, ecological management, ecosystem services and the responses of ecological communities to climate change. 2.We describe how modern coexistence theory can be used to predict community dynamics through the use of demography. We explore the challenges that limit the deployment of this demographic framework, and the tools from phylogenetic and functional ecology that have been used to surmount them. 3. Finding existing tools not altogether sufficient, we propose the use of hard functional traits and physiological tolerances of environmental conditions and low resource availability to extend the demographic framework so that the dynamics of a broader range of ecological communities can be accurately predicted. 4. We illustrate these new approaches with two case studies.

Salmonid species are typical examples of native invaders whose abundance is increased after stocking with hatchery fish. This study evaluated the effects of hatchery chum salmon fry on sympatric wild masu salmon fry, benthic invertebrate prey, and algae, after a single stocking event in Mamachi stream, Hokkaido, northern Japan. The results suggested that the stocked hatchery chum salmon fry decreased the foraging efficiency and growth of the wild masu salmon fry through interspecific competition, and depressed the abundance of Ephemerellidae and total grazer invertebrates (Glossosomatidae, Heptageniidae, and Baetidae) through predation. Also, the hatchery chum salmon fry may increase algal biomass through depression of grazer abundance by predation (top-down effect). These results suggested that a single release of hatchery chum salmon fry into a stream may influence the recipient stream ecosystem.","[Hasegawa, Koh; Takahashi, Satoru] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan; [Ohta, Tamihisa] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038047, Japan","Hasegawa, K (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan.",hasekoh@affrc.go.jp,"Hasegawa, Koh/H-9926-2019",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP16K07857]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K07857] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank the staff of the Hokkaido National Fisheries Research Institute for helping with the field work, and Dr Yoshikazu Takashima for sorting and identifying benthic invertebrates.

The fitness outcome of such activities depends largely on their interspecific interactions; the temporal overlap with other species determines when they should be active in order to maximize their encounters with food and to minimize their encounters with predators, competitors and parasites. To cope with the constantly changing, but predictable structure of the environment, organisms have evolved internal biological clocks, which are synchronized mainly by light, the most predictable and reliable environmental cue ( but which can be masked by other variables), which enable them to anticipate and prepare for predicted changes in the timing of the species they interact with, on top of responding to them directly. Here, we review examples where the internal timing system is used to predict interspecific interactions, and how these interactions affect the internal timing system and activity patterns. We then ask how plastic these mechanisms are, how this plasticity differs between and within species and how this variability in plasticity affects interspecific interactions in a changing world, in which light, the major synchronizer of the biological clock, is no longer a reliable cue owing to the rapidly changing climate, the use of artificial light and urbanization.

Previous work on metacommunity dynamics of competing species has shown that sorting by habitat patch type and spatial patterning can be affected by disturbances. Microcosms offer a useful model system to test the effect of multi-trophic interactions and disturbance on metacommunity dynamics. Here, we investigated the potential role of predators in enhancing or disrupting sorting and spatial pattern among prey in experimental landscapes. We exposed multi-trophic protist microcosm landscapes with one predator, two competing prey, two patch resource types, and localized dispersal to three disturbance regimes (none, low, and high). Then, we used variation partitioning and spatial clustering analysis to analyse the results. In contrast with previous experiments that did not manipulate predators, we found that patch type did not structure prey communities very well. Instead, we found that it was the distribution of the predator that most strongly predicted the composition of the prey community. The predator impacted species sorting by (1) preferentially consuming one prey, thereby acting as a strong local environmental driver, and by (2) indirectly magnifying the impact of patch food resources on the less preferred prey. The predator also enhanced spatial signal in the prey community because of its limited dispersal. Our results indicate that predators can strongly influence prey species sorting and spatial patterning in metacommunities in ways that would otherwise be attributed to stochastic effects, such as dispersal limitation or demographic drift. Therefore, whenever possible, predators should be explicitly included as separate explanatory factors in variation partitioning analyses.","[Livingston, George; Fukumori, Kayoko; Kawachi, Masanobu; Takamura, Noriko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosystem Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Provete, Diogo B.] Univ Fed Goias, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, Dept Ecol, Inst Biol Sci, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Leibold, Mathew A.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Integrat Biol, 1 Univ Stn C0930, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Livingston, George] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Livingston, G (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosystem Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.; Livingston, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",glivingston@utexas.edu,"Provete, Diogo B./B-3704-2008","Provete, Diogo B./0000-0002-0097-0651","CAPES-DSCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CAPES-PDSECoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [18641-12-1]; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2016/13949-7]; NSF EAPSI FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSF DDIG (DEB) [1311032]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan [S-9]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16J40021] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Lin Jiang and T.

Shifts that result in range overlap between previously allopatric congeneric species may have consequences for biodiversity through interspecific competition, hybridization, and genetic introgression. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and spotted seals (Phoca largha) are parapatric sibling species and areas of co-occurrence at the edges of their range, such as Bristol Bay, Alaska, offer a unique opportunity to explore ecological separation and discuss potential consequences of increased range overlap resulting from retreating sea ice. Using telemetry and genetic data from 14 harbor seals and six spotted seals, we explored the ecological and genetic separation of the two species by comparing their utilization distributions, distance from haul-out, dive behavior (e.g., depth, duration, focus), and evidence of hybridization. Firstly, we show that harbor and spotted seals, which cannot be visually distinguished definitively in all cases, haul-out together side by side in Bristol Bay from late summer to early winter. Secondly, we observed subtle rather than pronounced differences in ranging patterns and dive behavior during this period. Thirdly, most spotted seals in this study remained close to shore in contrast to what is known of the species in more northern areas, and lastly, we did not find any evidence of hybridization. The lack of distinct ecological separation in this area of sympatry suggests that interspecific competition could play an important role in the persistence of these species, particularly if range overlap will increase as a result of climate-induced range shifts and loss of spotted seal pagophilic breeding habitat. Our results also highlight the added complexities in monitoring these species in areas of suspected overlap, as they cannot easily be distinguished without genetic analysis. Predicted climate-induced environmental change will likely influence the spatial and temporal extent of overlap in these two sibling species. Ultimately, this may alter the balance between current isolating mechanisms with consequences for species integrity and fitness.","[Cordes, Line S.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Coll Nat Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales; [O'Corry-Crowe, Gregory] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL USA; [Small, Robert J.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Wildlife Conservat, Juneau, AK USA","Cordes, LS (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Coll Nat Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales.",l.cordes@bangor.ac.uk,,,,,,64,3,3,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Although mixedwoods have been shown to have greater resource use efficiency relative to pure stands, considerable uncertainty remains with respect to the underlying ecological processes. We explored species interactions in Scots pine/European beech mixedwoods with the process-based model FORECAST Climate. The model was calibrated for two contrasting forests in the southwestern Pyrenees (northern Spain): a wet Mediterranean site at 625m.a.s.l. and a subalpine site at 1335m.a.s.l. Predicted mixedwood yield was higher than that for beech stands but lower than pine stands. When simulating climate change, mixedwood yield was reduced at the Mediterranean site (-33%) but increased at the subalpine site (+11%). Interaction effects were enhanced as stands developed. Complementarity dominated the Mediterranean stand but neutral or net competition dominated the subalpine stand, which had higher stand density and water availability. Reduced water demand and consumption, increased canopy interception, and improved water-use efficiency in mixtures compared to beech stands, suggest a release of beech intraspecific competition. Beech also facilitated pine growth through better litter quality, nonsymbiotic nitrogen fixation, and above- and belowground stratification, leading to higher foliar nitrogen content and deeper canopies in pines. In conclusion, mixtures may improve water availability and use efficiency for beech and light interception for pine, the main limiting factors for each species, respectively. Encouraging pine-beech mixtures could be an effective adaptation to climate change in drought-prone sites in the Mediterranean region.","[Gonzalez de Andres, Ester; Blanco, Juan A.; Bosco Imbert, J.; Lo, Yueh-Hsin; Castillo, Federico J.] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Ciencias Medio Nat, Navarra 31006, Spain; [Seely, Brad] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resource Management, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Blanco, JA (corresponding author), Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Ciencias Medio Nat, Navarra 31006, Spain.",juan.blanco@unavarra.es,"de Andres, Ester Gonzalez/AAH-3710-2019; Blanco, Juan A./A-4554-2009; Lo, Yueh Hsin/D-2582-2010","Blanco, Juan A./0000-0002-6524-4335; Lo, Yueh Hsin/0000-0001-6444-0273; Gonzalez de Andres, Ester/0000-0001-7951-5426",Ramon y Cajal contractSpanish Government [RYC-2011-08082]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2012-33465];  [EEBB-I-15-09220];  [BES-2013-066705],"Ramon y Cajal contract, Grant/Award Number: RYC-2011-08082; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: AGL2012-33465; mobility aid, Grant/Award Number: EEBB-I-15-09220; Spanish Predoctoral Research Grant, Grant/Award Number: BES-2013-066705",,57,28,28,5,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,MAR,2017,10,2,,,SI,,,,e1810,10.1002/eco.1810,,,14,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,EM9KT,WOS:000395631100006,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

Here we tested for evidence of competition for perch space. At Amakhala Private Game Reserve, Eastern Cape, South Africa we monitored the occurrence and perch use of both species along transects. The birds do co-occur locally but there is evidence of small-scale spatial separation possibly a result of interspecific territoriality. Perch selection differed in respect of perch type but not perch height. Both species perched prominently in the majority of observations. Southern Fiscals make greater use of Searsia and Gymnosporia trees, whereas the Fiscal Flycatcher makes near-equal use of Vachellia karroo, Searsia and Gymnosporia trees. This may be an example of niche partitioning, though it remains unclear whether the birds actively compete for perch space, or if the separation is a product of different perch preferences, territoriality and the local plant community.","[Daniels, Ryan J.; Hulley, Patrick E.; Craig, Adrian J.

The population structures of all species were bimodally distributed, with young trees (DBH <1 cm) more abundant than older trees. The population structures of Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata was bimodal and rather continuous. However, Pinus tabuliformis and Pinus armandii were discontinuously bimodal, with distinct size deficiencies. Q. aliena var. acuteserrata trees were clumped throughout the plot, although those of P. tabuliformis and P. armandii were clumped at small scales. Notable negative spatial associations between Q. aliena var. acuteserrata and P. tabuliformis were found at almost scales. P. armandii and Q. aliena var. acuteserrata were negatively spatially associated at small scales but positively associated at large scales.

Here, we investigated the acute (12 d) and chronic (64 d) toxicities of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) and bulk particles (0-200 mg/L) to three ciliated protist species (Loxocephalus sp., Paramecium aurelia, and Tetrahymena pyriformis) in single-, bi-, and multispecies microcosms. The results show that CeO2 NPs strongly affected the interactions between ciliated protozoan species. When exposed to the highest CeO2 NPs (200 mg/L), the intrinsic growth rates of Loxocephalus and Paramecium were significantly decreased by 18.87% and 88.27%, respectively, while their carrying capacities declined by more than 90%. However, CeO2 NP exposure made it difficult to predict outcomes of interspecific competition between species. At higher NP exposure (100 and 200 mg/L), competition led to the extinction of both species in the Loxocephalus and Paramecium microcosms that survived in the absence of competitors or CeO2 NPs. Further, the presence of potential competitors improved the survival of Loxocephalus to hundreds of individuals per milliliter in microcosms with Tetrahymena where Loxocephalus would otherwise not be able to tolerate high levels of NP exposure. This result could be attributed to weakened NP adsorption on the cell surface due to competitor-caused reduction of NP surface charge (from 18.52 to 25.17 mV) and intensified NP aggregation via phagocytosis of NPs by ciliate cells. Our results emphasize the need to explicitly consider species interactions for a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological consequences of NP exposure.","[Peng, Cheng] Donghua Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Peng, Cheng; Chen, Ying; Tong, Xin; Chen, Yongsheng] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Peng, Cheng] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Peng, Cheng; Chen, Ying; Pu, Zhichao; Zhao, Qing; Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Chen, Ying] Sichuan Univ, Coll Architecture & Environm, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Chen, YS (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.; Jiang, L (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",yongsheng.chen@ce.gatech.edu; lin.jiang@biology.gatech.edu,"Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019; Chen, Yongsheng/B-1541-2010","Chen, Yongsheng/0000-0002-9519-2302; Tong, Xin/0000-0002-2849-7683","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1235166, DEB-1257858, DEB-1342754]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31361123001]; China Scholarship Council GrantChina Scholarship Council [201406320074]","This study was supported by the US National Science Foundation Grant CBET-1235166, DEB-1257858, and DEB-1342754, National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant 31361123001, and China Scholarship Council Grant 201406320074.",,45,5,5,1,51,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1743-5390,1743-5404,,NANOTOXICOLOGY,Nanotoxicology,,2017,11,5,,,,,625,636,,10.1080/17435390.2017.1340527,,,12,Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Toxicology,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Toxicology,FC1XZ,WOS:000406632700003,28594294,,,,2021-09-21,

Host competence can be used to predict how an invasive species will affect community disease dynamics; the addition of a highly competent, invasive host is predicted to increase disease. However, densities of invasive and native species can also influence the impacts of invasive species on community disease dynamics. We examined whether information on host competence alone could be used to accurately predict the effects of an invasive host on disease in native hosts. We first characterized the relative competence of an invasive species and a native host species to a native parasite. Next, we manipulated species composition in mesocosms and found that host competence results did not accurately predict community dynamics. While the invasive host was more competent than the native, the presence of the native (lower competence) host increased disease in the invasive (higher competence) host. To identify potential mechanisms driving these patterns, we analyzed a two-host, one-parasite model parameterized for our system. Our results demonstrate that patterns of disease were primarily driven by relative population densities, mediated by asymmetry in intra-and interspecific competition. Thus, information on host competence alone may not accurately predict how an invasive species will influence disease in native species.","[Searle, Catherine L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Searle, Catherine L.; Hunsberger, Katherine K.; Grippi, Dylan C.; Oleksy, Isabella A.; Shaw, Clara L.; de la Serna, Solanus B.; Lash, Chloe L.; Dhir, Kailash L.; Duffy, Meghan A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cortez, Michael H.] Utah State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Oleksy, Isabella A.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resources Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Lash, Chloe L.] Valparaiso Univ, Dept Biol, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA","Searle, CL (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Searle, CL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",searlec@purdue.edu,"Oleksy, Isabella/AAD-2249-2021","Oleksy, Isabella/0000-0003-2572-5457; Lash, Chloe/0000-0002-1676-6575; Searle, Catherine/0000-0002-6607-2299; Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1305836]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1305836] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We would like to thank R.

Our study determines multi-dimensional differentiation of two sympatric top-predators, long-legged buzzards (LLB) and short-toed eagles (STE), which recently became sympatric during their breeding season in the Judean Foothills, Israel. By combining information from comprehensive diet and movement analyses we found four dimensions of differentiation: (1) Geographic foraging area: LLB tended to forage relatively close to their nests (2.35 +/- 0.62 km), while STE forage far from their nest (13.03 +/- 2.20 km); (2) Foraging-habitat type: LLBs forage at low natural vegetation, avoiding cultivated fields, whereas STEs forage in cultivated fields, avoiding low natural vegetation; (3) Diurnal dynamics of foraging: LLBs are uniformly active during daytime, whereas STEs activity peaks in the early afternoon; and (4) Food-niche: while both species largely rely on reptiles (47.8% and 76.3% for LLB and STE, respectively), LLB had a more diverse diet and consumed significantly higher percentages of lizards, while STE consumed significantly higher percentages of snakes. Our results suggest that this multidimensional differentiation allows the spatial coexistence of these two dense populations in the study area.","[Friedemann, Guilad; Leshem, Yossi; Kerem, Lior] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shacham, Boaz] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Natl Nat Hist Collect, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Bar-Massada, Avi] Univ Haifa, Dept Biol & Environm, Qiryat Tivon, Israel; [McClain, Krystaal M.; Bohrer, Gil] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Izhaki, Ido] Univ Haifa, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel","Friedemann, G (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",Gilad.fridman@gmail.com,"Bohrer, Gil/A-9731-2008; Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Bohrer, Gil/0000-0002-9209-9540; Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF); Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel); Smaller-Winnikow Foundation; Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA); Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI); Rieger Foundation (USA); Raptor Research Foundation (RFF); International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel); Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel); NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX11AP61G]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1145952]; Jacob and Lena Joels Memorial Foundation Visiting Professor Award,"This research was supported by the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael (KKL-JNF), the Ministry of Science and Technology (Israel), Smaller-Winnikow Foundation, Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), Hoopoe Foundation (SPNI), Rieger Foundation (USA), Raptor Research Foundation (RFF), the International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun (Israel) and Kfar-Etzion field school (Israel).

Although intraguild prey are hypothesized to exhibit faster growth rates than intraguild predators and, therefore, outgrow predation risk through time, intraguild predation also is associated with significant increases in predator growth rates that are hypothesized to increase the potential for future predation. Given these conflicting hypotheses, how predation among amphibian larvae early in development should influence size disparities and ontogenetic shifts in predation risk is unclear. To clarify the effects of intraguild predation on predator and prey growth, we quantified size variation among larval salamanders (Ambystomatidae) in forested ephemeral ponds while concurrently monitoring seasonal patterns of intraguild predation through gut content analyses. Intraguild predation had no discernible effect on either interspecific size disparities between intraguild predators and prey, or intraspecific size variation within predator populations, and factors of larval density, tadpole density, and pond area were more important than larval size variation in predicting IGP. Our results do not support previous assertions regarding the consequences of intraguild predation for predator-prey size disparities, because top predators not actively engaging in IGP appeared to maintain growth rates equivalent to successful conspecific IG predators, and the frequency of intraguild predation did not significantly change during larval ontogeny. The lack of consistent increases or decreases in predator-prey size disparities suggests that intraguild prey may not experience predictable ontogenetic shifts in intraguild predation risk.","[Mott, Cy L.; Sparling, Donald W.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Mott, Cy L.] Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA","Mott, CL (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.; Mott, CL (corresponding author), Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA.",clmott@valdosta.edu,,,Delyte and Dorothy Morris Fellowship,"We thank S.

Furthermore, species may respond differently to drought when other influences, such as herbivory, are considered. To explore this relationship, we conducted a greenhouse experiment measuring responses to inter- and intraspecific competition for two grasses, Schedonorus arundinaceus and Paspalum dilatatum, while varying water availability and simulating herbivory via clipping. We then parameterized population growth models to examine the long-term outcome of competition under these conditions. Under drought, S. arundinaceus was less water stressed than P. dilatatum, which exhibited severe water stress; clipping alleviated this stress, increasing the competitive ability of P. dilatatum relative to S. arundinaceus. Although P. dilatatum competed weakly under drought, clipping reduced water stress in P. dilatatum, thereby enhancing its ability to compete with S. arundinaceus under drought. Supporting these observations, population growth models predicted that P. dilatatum would exclude S. arundinaceus when clipped under drought, while S. arundinaceus would exclude P. dilatatum when unclipped under drought. When the modeled environment varied temporally, environmental variation promoted niche differences that, though insufficient to maintain stable coexistence, prevented unconditional competitive exclusion by promoting priority effects. Our results suggest that it is important to consider how species respond not just to stable, but also to variable, environments. When species differ in their responses to drought, competition, and simulated herbivory, stable environments may promote competitive exclusion, while fluctuating environments may promote coexistence. These interactions are critical to understanding how species will respond to global change.","[Napier, Joseph D.; Mordecai, Erin A.; Heckman, Robert W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Napier, Joseph D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Mordecai, Erin A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Napier, JD (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.; Napier, JD (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jnapier2@illinois.edu,"Heckman, Robert/AAC-1302-2020; Heckman, Robert W/J-2640-2015; Heckman, Robert W./L-4824-2019","Heckman, Robert/0000-0002-2281-3091; Heckman, Robert W/0000-0002-2281-3091; Mordecai, Erin/0000-0002-4402-5547","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1202892, DEB-1311289]","This work was supported by a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology (DBI-1202892) to E.

The results obtained do not support any of these relationships. The results also indicate that H. vulnerata can achieve flight at 8 degrees C less than H. americana. The present study further investigates whether the species differ in their latitudinal and geographical distribution, and respond differently to bioclimatic variables. The results obtained provide support for this particular hypothesis, showing that H. vulnerata inhabits higher altitudes, and is able to tolerate colder environments compared with H. americana.

Potential mechanisms were tested for juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, by analysing published and unpublished information from long-term investigations (1986-present). Growth variability did occur and could be explained by differences induced by environmental variability (water temperature), and by non-genetic irreversible adaptation and sex. Dynamic Energy Budget analysis indicated that especially sexually-dimorphic growth in combination with variability in sex ratio could explain most of the variability in growth and the increase in the range of the size of individuals within the population over time. Summer growth reduction was not only observed among 0-group plaice in the intertidal, but also in the subtidal and tidal gullies as well as among I- and II-group plaice. Intraspecific competition for food was not detected but some support for interspecific competition with other predators was found. Also resource competition (due to crowding) with the other abundant epibenthic species (0-, I- and II-group flounder Platichthys flesus; the brown shrimp Crangon crangon; the shore crab Carcinus maenas; the goby species Pomatoschistus minutus and Pomatoschistus microps) could not explain the summer growth reduction. The observed growth reduction coincided with a decrease in stomach content, especially of regenerating body parts of benthic prey items. It is hypothesised that macrozoobenthos becomes less active after the spring phytoplankton bloom, reducing prey availability for juvenile plaice in summer, causing a reduction in food intake and hence in growth.

Satyrization is a form of mating interference in which males of one species mate with females of another species, significantly decreasing their fitness and not generating hybrids. Satyrization has been established to be the probable cause of competitive displacements of resident mosquitoes by invasive species, especially of Aedes aegypti by Aedes albopictus, two important vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Mathematical models predict that even low levels of asymmetric mating interference are capable of producing competitive displacements or reductions. Couplings of virgin Ae. aegypti females with Ae. albopictus males effectively sterilize these females through the monogamizing actions of male accessory gland products, but the converse interspecific mating does not impact the future reproduction of Ae. albopictus females. Populations of Ae. aegypti exposed to satyrization quickly evolve resistance to interspecific mating, which is believed to ameliorate reproductive interference from, and promote co-existence with, Ae. albopictus. The evolution of satyrization resistance among Ae. aegypti in laboratory cages is accompanied by fitness costs, such as reduced fecundity and slower receptivity to conspecific males. Cage experiments and field observations indicate that Ae. albopictus males are capable of satyrizing females of other species of the Stegomyia subgenus, potentially leading to competitive displacements, and possible extinctions, especially of endemic species on islands. Examination of other examples of reproductive interference in insects reveals few parallels to the mechanism and outcomes of satyrization by Ae. albopictus. We conclude by posing the hypothesis that satyrization may favor the ecological success of Ae. albopictus, and suggest many lines for future research on this phenomenon.","[Bargielowski, Irka Ewa; Lounibos, Leon Philip] Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, 200 9th St SW, Vero Beach, FL USA","Bargielowski, IE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, 200 9th St SW, Vero Beach, FL USA.",irka@ufl.edu,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R21AI095780] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R21 AI095780] Funding Source: Medline,,,109,33,33,2,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1672-9609,1744-7917,,INSECT SCI,Insect Sci.,APR,2016,23,2,,,,,162,174,,10.1111/1744-7917.12291,,,13,Entomology,Entomology,DH7YO,WOS:000373010300001,26542083,,,,2021-09-21,

In winter, resource density is low for most species and an increased number of active consumers during this season may produce heightened competitive pressure. In Western France, the aphid parasitoid species Aphidius avenae Haliday has been known to adopt a winter diapausing strategy adjacent to newly sown cereal crops, until recent reports of active winter populations in cereal crops. We investigate how the addition of this species to the winter guild of parasitoids may change the structure of the aphid-parasitoid food web and the host-exploitation strategies of previously occurring parasitoids. We showed that in winter, Aphidius avenae was mostly associated with two aphid species, Sitobion avenae Fabricius and Metopolophium dirhodum Walker, while the generalist species Aphidius rhopalosiphi was restricted to the aphid species Rhopalosiphum padi L. in the presence of Aphidius avenae. Due to this new competition, winter food webs present a higher degree of compartmentalization and lower proportional similarity index values than spring ones. Parasitoid and aphid abundances responded significantly to changes in daily high temperatures, suggesting that the host-parasitoid community structure can be partly predicted by climate. This study demonstrates how a change in the winter strategy of one species of a guild can modify complex interspecific relationships in host-parasitoid systems.","[Andrade, Thiago Oliveira; van Baaren, Joan] Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS ECOBIO 6553, Rennes, France; [Andrade, Thiago Oliveira; Krespi, Liliane] Univ Rennes 1, UMR INRA IGEPP 1349, Rennes, France; [Andrade, Thiago Oliveira; Krespi, Liliane; Bonnardot, Valerie; van Baaren, Joan; Outreman, Yannick] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Rennes, France; [Bonnardot, Valerie] Univ Rennes 2, UMR CNRS LETG Rennes 6554, F-35043 Rennes, France; [Outreman, Yannick] Agrocampus Ouest, UMR INRA IGEPP 1349, Rennes, France","van Baaren, J (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS ECOBIO 6553, Rennes, France.; van Baaren, J (corresponding author), Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Rennes, France.",joan.van-baaren@univ-rennes1.fr,"Yannick, OUTREMAN/B-9309-2012","Yannick, OUTREMAN/0000-0002-7337-3049",French National Research Agency (ANR) Landscaphid programFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-STRA-05]; Region BretagneRegion Bretagne,"This study was funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR) Landscaphid program (ANR-09-STRA-05) and by the Region Bretagne.

We used nocturnal light traps to investigate the assemblage structuration of two moth families: Sphingidae (23 species) and Saturniidae (13 species). Because competition for food among adults potentially occurs only among sphingids, only for this family did we expect less overlap of diel activity patterns than expected by chance and also a greater temporal niche width compared to saturniids. Moreover, we expected a greater number of sphingid species pairs to differ in activity timing compared to saturniid pairs. We also hypothesized that in the case of a lack of temporal structuration, sphingids would be morphologically structured in relation to proboscis length. Contrary to what we expected, both families overlapped their activity patterns more than expected by chance alone and sphingid moths were not morphologically structured. Nevertheless, there were 173 significant pairwise differences in temporal activity between sphingids, contrasting with no interspecific differences between saturniids. Sphingid species also showed a wider temporal niche width than saturniids, as expected. Predation risk and abiotic factors may have caused the overall similarities in activity patterns for both families. The temporal niche seemed not to be determinant for the assemblage structuration of moths as a whole for either of the studied families, but segregation along the temporal niche axis of some potentially competing species pairs can be a relevant factor for the coexistence of nectar-feeding species.","[de Camargo, Nicholas F.] Univ Brasilia, Posgrad Ecol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Camargo, Nicholas F.; Vieira, Emerson M.] Univ Brasilia, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol Vertebrados, CP 04457, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Camargo, Willian R.

Most demonstrations of the impacts of size variation in trophic systems have focused on size variation in predator species, and the consequences of size variation in prey species are less well understood. We investigated how prey size structure shapes intra- and interspecific interactions in experiments with a gape-limited predator (larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus) and its heterospecific prey (frog tadpoles, Rana pirica). We found that large and small tadpole size groups each increased mortality in the other group by intensifying salamander predation; this type of indirect interactions is called apparent competition. The antagonistic impacts on the prey size groups were caused by different size-specific mechanisms. By consuming small tadpoles, the salamanders grew large enough to consume large tadpoles. The activity of large tadpoles, by increasing the activity of the small tadpoles, may increase the number of encounters with the predator and thus small tadpole mortality. These results suggest that the magnitude of a predator's ecological role, such as whether a top-down trophic cascade is initiated, depends on size variation in its heterospecific prey.","[Yamaguchi, Aya] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Aya; Kishida, Osamu] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan","Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.; Yamaguchi, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan.",cryamaguchi.514@gmail.com,"Kishida, Osamu/B-7970-2011",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24370004]","We are very grateful to Noboru Katayama, Kunio Takatsu, Megumi Nosaka, Tomoko Sato and Natsuko Sakai for outstanding support during our experiments.

For this purpose, experiments of interspecific predation, competition and aggregation were performed. Results show that neither Dermestes maculatus adults nor larvae interact with Lucilia sericata larvae (maggots): they were not attracted to a place where L. sericata larvae were present and they did not eat them either. However, without other food source available (no meat), starved D. haemorrhoidalis larvae did eat pupae of Lucilia sericata, which means they might be able to remove evidences of flies development. In the second part of the study, experiments failed to explain why only a single species of Dermestidae is generally observed on human corpses. Indeed, we did not observe segregation between Dermestes maculatus and Dermestes haemorrhoidalis: these 2 species were able to aggregate on the same spot.

Ecological theory attempts to predict how impacts for native species arise from biological invasions. A fundamental question centres on the feeding interactions of invasive and native species: whether invasion will result in increased interspecific competition, which would result in negative consequences for the competing species, or trophic niche divergence, which would facilitate the invader's integration into the community and their coexistence with native species. 2. Here, the feeding interactions of a highly invasive fish, topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, with three native and functionally similar fishes were studied to determine whether patterns of either niche overlap or divergence detected in mesocosm experiments were apparent between the species at larger spatial scales. Using stable isotope analysis, their feeding relationships were assessed initially in the mesocosms (1000 L) and then in small ponds (< 400 m(2)) and large ponds (> 600 m(2)). 3. In the mesocosms, a consistent pattern of trophic niche divergence was evident between the sympatric fishes, with niches shifting further apart in isotopic space than suggested in allopatry, revealing that sharing of food resources was limited. Sympatric P. parva also had a smaller niche than their allopatric populations. 4. In eight small ponds where P. parva had coexisted for several years with at least one of the fish species used in the mesocosms, strong patterns of niche differentiation were also apparent, with P. parva always at a lower trophic position than the other fishes, as also occurred in the mesocosms. Where these fishes were sympatric within more complex fish communities in the large ponds, similar patterns were also apparent, with strong evidence of trophic niche differentiation. 5. Aspects of the ecological impacts of P. parva invasion for native communities in larger ponds were consistent with those in the mesocosm experiments. Their invasion resulted in divergence in trophic niches, partly due to their reduced niche widths when in sympatry with other species, facilitating their coexistence in invaded ecosystems. Our study highlights the utility of controlled mesocosm studies for predicting the trophic relationships that can develop from introductions of non-native species into more complex ecosystems and at larger spatial scales.","[Thi Nhat Quyen Tran; Jackson, Michelle C.; Sheath, Danny; Britton, J.

By contrast, the relevance of environmental stressors for the spread of resistance during pesticide exposure has not been studied. Moreover, the consequences of interactions between different stressors have not been considered. Here we show that stress through intraspecific competition accelerates microevolution, because it enhances fitness differences between adapted and non-adapted individuals. By contrast, stress through interspecific competition or predation reduces intraspecific competition and thereby delays microevolution. This was demonstrated in mosquito populations (Culex quinquefasciatus) that were exposed to the pesticide chlorpyrifos. Non-selective predation through harvesting and interspecific competition with Daphnia magna delayed the selection for individuals carrying the ace-1(R) resistance allele. Under non-toxic conditions, susceptible individuals without ace-1(R) prevailed. Likewise, predation delayed the reverse adaptation of the populations to a non-toxic environment, while the effect of interspecific competition was not significant. Applying a simulation model, we further identified how microevolution is generally determined by the type and degree of competition and predation. We infer that interactions with other species-especially strong in ecosystems with high biodiversity-can delay the development of pesticide resistance.","[Becker, Jeremias Martin; Liess, Matthias] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Becker, Jeremias Martin; Liess, Matthias] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Anal, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Becker, JM (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Syst Ecotoxicol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",jeremias.becker@ufz.de,"Liess, Matthias/A-8582-2009","Liess, Matthias/0000-0002-3321-8909; Becker, Jeremias/0000-0003-1496-0312",Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE); Helmholtz strategic research funding (POF III),This work was supported by Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE) and by the Helmholtz strategic research funding (POF III).,,49,19,19,0,49,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

We investigated how predation risk caused by domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) and local breeding density affected patterns of reproductive and survival senescence in Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) breeding semi-colonially in Denmark. We recorded the abundance of cats and the number of breeding pairs at 39 breeding sites during 24 years and related these to age-specific survival rate and reproductive senescence to test predictions of the life history theory of senescence. We found evidence for actuarial senescence for the first time in this species. Survival rate increased until reaching a plateau in midlife and then decreased later. We also found that survival rate was higher for males than females. Local breeding density or predation risk did not affect survival as predicted by theory. Barn Swallows with short lives did not invest more in reproduction in early life, inconsistent with expectations for trade-offs between reproduction and survival as theory suggests. However, we found that the rate of reproductive decline during senescence was steeper for individuals exposed to intense competition, and predation pressure accelerated the rate of reproductive senescence, but only in sites with many breeding pairs. These latter results are in accordance with one of the predictions suggested by the life history theory of aging. These results emphasize the importance of considering intraspecific competition and interspecific interactions such as predation when analyzing reproductive and actuarial senescence.","[Balbontin, J.] Fac Biol, Dept Zool, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Moller, A.

These species can be distinguished morphologically and genetically, as well as by their mycotoxin profiles. Aspergillus flavus produces both B aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), B aflatoxins or CPA alone, or neither mycotoxin; Aspergillus parasiticus produces B and G aflatoxins or the aflatoxin precursor O-methylsterigmatocystin, but not CPA. Only four of forty-five attempted interspecific crosses between opposite mating types of A.flavus and A.parasiticus were fertile and produced viable ascospores. Single ascospore strains from each cross were shown to be recombinant hybrids using multilocus genotyping and array comparative genome hybridization. Conidia of parents and their hybrid progeny were haploid and predominantly monokaryons and dikaryons based on flow cytometry. Multilocus phylogenetic inference showed that experimental hybrid progeny were grouped with naturally occurring A.flavus L strain and A.parasiticus. Higher total aflatoxin concentrations in some F1 progeny strains compared to midpoint parent aflatoxin levels indicate synergism in aflatoxin production; moreover, three progeny strains synthesized G aflatoxins that were not produced by the parents, and there was evidence of allopolyploidization in one strain. These results suggest that hybridization is an important diversifying force resulting in the genesis of novel toxin profiles in these agriculturally important fungi.","[Olarte, Rodrigo A.; Worthington, Carolyn J.; Singh, Rakhi; Monacell, James T.; Carbone, Ignazio] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Ctr Integrated Fungal Res, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Horn, Bruce W.; Dorner, Joe W.] ARS, Natl Peanut Res Lab, USDA, Dawson, GA 39842 USA; [Moore, Geromy G.] ARS, So Reg Res Ctr, USDA, New Orleans, LA 70179 USA; [Monacell, James T.; Stone, Eric A.; Carbone, Ignazio] N Carolina State Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Stone, Eric A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Xie, De-Yu] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Carbone, I (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Ctr Integrated Fungal Res, Box 7616, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",ignazio_carbone@ncsu.edu,"Stone, Eric/Q-7840-2016","XIE, DE-YU/0000-0002-3054-1188","North Carolina Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2008-34500-19396, 2010-34500-21676]; National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35319-16126]; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2013-68004-20359]; USDA National Needs FellowshipUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2008-38420-18743]; USDA-NIFA Predoctoral fellowship [2012-67011-19689]; National Science Foundation's Dimensions of Biodiversity (DoB) programNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-1046167]; University of North Carolina General Administration under an award for High Performance Computing (HPC) and Computational Sciences","We thank Milbra Schweikert and Travis Walk for their technical expertise and Valerie K.

This paper proposes to use Lotka-Volterra, model for SUstainable Development (LV-SUD) to analyse the interspecific interactions, equilibria and their stabilities among emissions, different types of energy consumption (renewable, nuclear, and fossil fuel), and real GDP, the main factors of 3Es issues. Modelling these interactions provides a useful multivariate framework for prediction outcomes. Interaction between 3Es, namely competition, symbiosis, or predation, plays an important role in policy development to achieve a balanced use of energy resources and to strengthen the green economy. Applying LV-SUD in Mexico, an emerging markets country, analysing results show that there is a mutualism between fossil fuel consumption and GDP; prey-predator relationships that fossil fuel and GDP enhance the growth of emissions, but emissions inhibit the growth of the others; and commensalisms that GDP benefits from nuclear power, and renewable power benefits from fossil fuel. It is suggested that national energy policies should remain committed to decoupling the relevance between non-clean energy and GDP, to actively developing clean energy and thereby to properly reducing fossil fuel consumption and emissions without harming economic growth.

Theories of species coexistence and invasion ecology are fundamentally connected and provide a common theoretical framework for studying the mechanisms underlying successful invasions and their ecological impacts. Temporal fluctuations in resource availability and differences in life-history traits between invasive and resident species are considered as likely drivers of the dynamics of invaded communities. Current critical issues in invasion ecology thus relate to the extent to which such mechanisms influence coexistence between invasive and resident species and to the ability of resident species to persist in an invasive-dominated ecosystem. We tested how a fluctuating resource, and species trait differences may explain and help predict long-term impacts of biological invasions in forest specialist insect communities. We used a simple invasion system comprising closely related invasive and resident seed-specialized wasps (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) competing for a well-known fluctuating resource and displaying divergent diapause, reproductive and phenological traits. Based on extensive long-term field observations (1977-2010), we developed a combination of mechanistic and statistical models aiming to (i) obtain a realistic description of the population dynamics of these interacting species over time, and (ii) clarify the respective contributions of fluctuation-dependent and fluctuation-independent mechanisms to long-term impact of invasion on the population dynamics of the resident wasp species. We showed that a fluctuation-dependent mechanism was unable to promote coexistence of the resident and invasive species. Earlier phenology of the invasive species was the main driver of invasion success, enabling the invader to exploit an empty niche. Phenology also had the greatest power to explain the long-term negative impact of the invasive on the resident species, through resource pre-emption. This study provides strong support for the critical role of species differences in interspecific competition outcomes within animal communities. Our mechanistic-statistical approach disentangles the critical drivers of novel species assemblages resulting from intentional and non-intentional introductions of non-native species.","[Gidoin, Cindy; Boivin, Thomas] INRA, UR Ecol Forets Mediterraneennes 629, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Roques, Lionel] INRA, UR Biostat & Proc Spatiaux 546, F-84914 Avignon, France","Boivin, T (corresponding author), INRA, UR Ecol Forets Mediterraneennes 629, F-84914 Avignon, France.",boivin@avignon.inra.fr,,"Boivin, Thomas/0000-0003-1694-2425",French Agence Nationale pour la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-INTB-1705-04-MACBI],"We are grateful to Vincent Garreta, Etienne Klein, Samuel Soubeyrand for valuable discussions on mechanistic-statistical modelling, Ricco Rakotomalala for his help in logistic regression development, and Doyle McKey and two anonymous reviewers for insightful comments on a previous version of this manuscript.

(Dermaptera: Forficulidae) has been widely studied as a key predator of pests in temperate regions, but its phenology and behavior may differ in warmer areas such as the Mediterranean. Here we assessed the phenology, aggregation, and interspecific association of F. auricularia and Forficula pubescens Gene, the only two species found consistently in both ground and canopy shelters in Mediterranean apple orchards. In addition to F. auricularia and F. pubescens, three other earwig species, namely Labidura riparia Pallas, Nala lividipes Dufour and Euborellia moesta Gene, were found occasionally. The mature stages of F auricularia were observed mainly from May to November in tree shelters and immature ones from October to June in ground shelters. Adult individuals of F. pubescens were observed year-round and nymph instars were detected from April to June in ground as well as in tree shelters. The suitability of the current degree-days models for temperate regions was evaluated for the prediction of European earwig phenology in a Mediterranean climate. Regarding interspecific association, F auricularia and F. pubescens co-occurred in canopies without apparent competition. This study provides useful weekly data about the phenology of the two earwig species throughout the year that can be used to detect the key periods during which to enhance their populations in pip fruit orchards or to control them in stone fruit crops. Furthermore, our results are of relevance for the development of new phenological models of earwigs in Mediterranean areas where nymphs hibernate, a feature that makes current models inaccurate.","[Lordan, Jaume; Alegre, Simo; Alins, Georgina] IRTA Estacio Expt Lleida, Lleida 25003, Spain; [Moerkens, Rob] Proefctr Hoogstraten, B-2328 Meerle, Belgium; [Moerkens, Rob] Univ Antwerp, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Sarasua, Maria-Jose] Ctr UdL IRTA R D Lleida, Lleida 25198, Spain","Lordan, J (corresponding author), IRTA Estacio Expt Lleida, Parc Cient & Tecnol Agroalimentari Lleida, Lleida 25003, Spain.",jaume.lordan@irta.cat,"Moerkens, Rob/F-4710-2011; Alins, Georgina GA/L-9011-2014","Alins, Georgina GA/0000-0002-2353-051X; /0000-0002-1599-0348; Moerkens, Rob/0000-0002-9882-9313",Spanish project Programa Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo Agrario Control integrado de plagas en frutales de pepita y hueso [AGL2010-17486],This study was funded by the Spanish project Programa Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo Agrario no AGL2010-17486 (AGR) Control integrado de plagas en frutales de pepita y hueso.,,64,11,11,0,37,SPANISH NATL INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD RESEARCH & TECHNOLO,MADRID,"AUTOPISTA A-6, KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",1695-971X,,,SPAN J AGRIC RES,Span.

Isotopic Bayesian mixing models should provide a better understanding of the contribution of preys to the diet of predators and the feeding behavior of a species over time. METHODS: The carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures from pup hair samples of 93 Galapagos sea lions and 48 Galapagos fur seals collected between 2003 and 2009 in different regions (east and west) of the archipelago were analyzed. A PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced with a PDZ Europa 20-20 continuous flow gas source mass spectrometer was employed. Bayesian models, SIAR and SIBER, were used to estimate the contribution of prey to the diet of predators, the niche breadth, and the trophic overlap level between the populations. RESULTS: Statistical differences in the isotopic values of both predators were observed over the time. The mixing model determined that Galapagos fur seals had a primarily teutophagous diet, whereas the Galapagos sea lions fed exclusively on fish in both regions of the archipelago. The SIBER analysis showed differences in the trophic niche between the two sea lion populations, with the western rookery of the Galapagos sea lion being the population with the largest trophic niche area. CONCLUSIONS: A trophic niche partitioning between Galapagos fur seals and Galapagos sea lions in the west of the archipelago is suggested by our results. At intraspecific level, the western population of the Galapagos sea lion (ZwW) showed higher trophic breadth than the eastern population, a strategy adopted by the ZwW to decrease the interspecific competition levels in the western region.

In the case of plant-pollinator mutualistic networks, despite the great progress in describing the interactions between plants and their pollinators, the capability of making quantitative predictions is still lacking. Here, in order to estimate pollinator species abundances and their niche distribution, I propose a general method to transform a plant-pollinator network into a competition model between pollinator species. Competition matrices were obtained from first principles' calculations, using qualitative interaction matrices compiled for a set of 38 plant-pollinator networks. This method is able to make accurate quantitative predictions for mutualistic networks spanning a broad geographic range. Specifically, the predicted biodiversity metrics for pollinators - species relative abundances, Shannon equitability and Gini-Simpson indices - agree quite well with those inferred from empirical counts of visits of pollinators to plants. Furthermore, this method allows building a one-dimensional niche axis for pollinators in which clusters of generalists are separated by specialists thus rendering support to the theory of emergent neutrality. The importance of interspecific competition between pollinator species is a controversial and unresolved issue, considerable circumstantial evidence has accrued that competition between insects does occur, but a clear measure of its impact on their species abundances is still lacking. I contributed to fill this gap by quantifying the effect of competition between pollinators. Particular applications of our analysis could be to estimate the quantitative effects of removing a species from a community or to address the fate of populations of native organisms when foreign species are introduced to ecosystems far beyond their home range.","Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Inst Phys, Complex Syst Grp, UY-11400 Montevideo, Uruguay","Fort, H (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Inst Phys, Complex Syst Grp, UY-11400 Montevideo, Uruguay.",hugo@fisica.edu.uy,,,PEDECIBA (Uruguay); ANII (SNI Uruguay),Work supported in part from PEDECIBA (Uruguay) and ANII (SNI Uruguay).

Here, we provide a synthetic perspective on the so far poorly understood effects of interspecific interactions on range expansion rates. We present theoretical foundations for how interspecific interactions may modulate range expansion rates, consider examples from empirical studies of biological invasions and natural range expansions as well as process-based simulations, and discuss how interspecific interactions can be more broadly represented in process-based, spatiotemporally explicit range forecasts. Theory tells us that interspecific interactions affect expansion rates via alteration of local population growth rates and spatial displacement rates, but also via effects on other demographic parameters. The best empirical evidence for interspecific effects on expansion rates comes from studies of biological invasions. Notably, invasion studies indicate that competitive dominance and release from specialized enemies can enhance expansion rates. Studies of natural range expansions especially point to the potential for competition from resident species to reduce expansion rates. Overall, it is clear that interspecific interactions may have important consequences for range dynamics, but also that their effects have received too little attention to robustly generalize on their importance. We then discuss how interspecific interactions effects can be more widely incorporated in dynamic modeling of range expansions. Importantly, models must describe spatiotemporal variation in both local population dynamics and dispersal. Finally, we derive the following guidelines for when it is particularly important to explicitly represent interspecific interactions in dynamic range expansion forecasts: if most interacting species show correlated spatial or temporal trends in their effects on the target species, if the number of interacting species is low, and if the abundance of one or more strongly interacting species is not closely linked to the abundance of the target species.","[Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Gravel, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Holt, Robert D.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Schurr, Frank M.; Pagel, Joern] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, UMR 5554, Inst Sci Evolut, FR-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Schurr, Frank M.; Pagel, Joern] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Thuiller, Wilfried; Muenkemueller, Tamara; Schiffers, Katja H.] Univ Grenoble 1, Evolu ,Modeling & Analyzing BIOdivers Grp, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS,UMR 5553, Grenoble 9, France; [Dullinger, Stefan] Univ Vienna, Dept Conservat Biol Vegetat Ecol & Landscape Ecol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Edwards, Thomas C., Jr.] Utah State Univ, USGS Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Higgins, Steven I.] Univ Otago, Dept Bot, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Nabel, Julia E.

We investigated whether a ripe-fruit specialist, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), arrived earlier at breakfast sites with very ephemeral and highly sought-after fruit, like figs, than sites with less ephemeral fruit that can be more predictably obtained throughout the entire day. We recorded when and where five adult female chimpanzees spent the night and acquired food for a total of 275 full days during three fruit-scarce periods in a West African tropical rainforest. We found that chimpanzees left their sleeping nests earlier (often before sunrise when the forest is still dark) when breakfasting on very ephemeral fruits, especially when they were farther away. Moreover, the females positioned their sleeping nests more in the direction of the next day's breakfast sites with ephemeral fruit compared with breakfast sites with other fruit. By analyzing departure times and nest positioning as a function of fruit type and location, while controlling for more parsimonious explanations, such as temperature, we found evidence that wild chimpanzees flexibly plan their breakfast time, type, and location after weighing multiple disparate pieces of information. Our study reveals a cognitive mechanism by which large-brained primates can buffer the effects of seasonal declines in food availability and increased interspecific competition to facilitate first access to nutritious food. We discuss the implications for theories on hominoid brain-size evolution.","[Janmaat, Karline R.

However, fitness differences among cross types can vary depending on biotic conditions, thereby influencing introgression patterns. Based on past work, we predicted that increased competition would enhance introgression between cultivated and wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus) by reducing fitness advantages of wild plants. To test this prediction, we established a factorial field experiment in Kansas, USA where we monitored the fitness of four cross types (Wild, F-1, F-2, and BCw hybrids) under different levels of interspecific and intraspecific competition. Intraspecific manipulations consisted both of density of competitors and of frequency of crop-wild hybrids. We recorded emergence of overwintered seeds, survival to reproduction, and numbers of seeds produced per reproductive plant. We also calculated two compound fitness measures: seeds produced per emerged seedling and seeds produced per planted seed. Cross type and intraspecific competition affected emergence and survival to reproduction, respectively. Further, cross type interacted with competitive treatments to influence all other fitness traits. More intense competition treatments, especially related to density of intraspecific competitors, repeatedly reduced the fitness advantage of wild plants when considering seeds produced per reproductive plant and per emerged seedling, and F-2 plants often became indistinguishable from the wilds. Wild fitness remained superior when seedling emergence was also considered as part of fitness, but the fitness of F-2 hybrids relative to wild plants more than quadrupled with the addition of interspecific competitors and high densities of intraspecific competitors. Meanwhile, contrary to prediction, lower hybrid frequency reduced wild fitness advantage. These results emphasize the importance of taking a full life cycle perspective. Additionally, due to effects of exogenous selection, a given hybrid generation may be especially well-suited to hastening introgression under particular environmental conditions.","[Mercer, Kristin L.; Kost, Matthew A.; Pace, Brian A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Emry, D.

This is particularly the case in urban habitats where the disturbed environment can alter natural behavior from that in undisturbed habitats. The rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), is an increasingly common invasive species, predominantly associated with large urban centers. Using an experimental approach, we tested the behavioral responses of native garden birds in response to the presence of a rose-ringed parakeet versus the presence of a similarly sized and dominant native bird, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). Parakeet presence significantly reduced feeding rates and increased vigilance among native birds compared with our control treatments. Of visits made by native birds in the presence of a parakeet, feeding was more likely to occur in sites within the parakeet range compared with sites outside, suggesting some habituation of native birds has occurred following prior exposure to parakeets but overall foraging behavior is still disrupted. The results of our study suggest that nonnative species can have complex and subtle impacts on native fauna and show that a nonnative competitor can impact native species simply through their presence near resources.","[Peck, Hannah L.; Marshall, Harry H.; Owens, Ian P.

Here, we use data from scent station field studies and permutation-based null model analyses to test whether spatial co-occurrence of different carnivores' species is non-random in a Central European landscape that has been strongly modified and fragmented through human activity. In general, our results suggest a higher degree of spatial co-occurrence of different carnivore species than expected by chance; though it should be noted that this difference was not detectable under the conservative form of the null model. On the other hand, our data do not provide evidence for a significant degree of spatial segregation at the interspecific level. In conclusion, our results imply that antagonistic interactions, such as interspecific competition and predation, are not the dominant factors shaping spatial distribution of carnivores.

Interspecific crossing experiments conducted so far suggest reproductive interference between the two nematode species. Theory predicts that one of the two competing species populations quickly displaces the other through reproductive interference in a frequency-dependent manner. Thus, it is anticipated that B. mucronatus suppresses the virulence of B. xylophilus against pine trees when B. mucronatus heavily outnumber B. xylophilus. To determine the suppressive effects of B. mucronatus, the two nematode species were inoculated simultaneously on 30 3-year-old Pinus thunbergii seedlings at three combinations of different numbers, and B. xylophilus alone was inoculated on 30 other seedlings at the corresponding numbers in early August. Seedlings were observed at intervals of 4 or 6 weeks and two stem sections were sampled from each seedling to determine the density and species composition of nematode populations after death or in December. Inoculation of B. mucronatus significantly retarded the speed of foliage discolouration from 0.170 +/- 0.024 week(-1) to 0.061 +/- 0.017 week(-1) and significantly prolonged the survival time of seedlings. Bursaphelenchus mucronatus significantly reduced the nematode density from 1799.7 +/- 305.0 to 521.0 +/- 148.4 (g dried seedling stem)(-1).

Recently, the crop edge has been considered as a potential refugia for many species. Indeed, weed species richness and abundance are higher in the crop edge than in the field margin and the field core. In this study we question whether weed functional diversity also varies among field elements and whether it is higher in the crop edge. We studied the interspecific and intraspecific variation of three functional traits (specific leaf area, canopy height and above-ground biomass) related to the response of weeds to competition and to agricultural practices, for seven weed species sampled in the crop edge, the field margin and the field core area in four winter-wheat fields. We show that trait values varied significantly with the species, the field element and their interaction. Within the field, all species had high specific leaf area, low canopy height and biomass, suggesting a shade-tolerance syndrome that could be a strategy in response to both competition with the crop and the disturbances induced by agricultural practices. In the crop edge, where the functional variation was the highest, two distinct functional strategies were observed, suggesting a resource partitioning under the predominance of weed-weed competition. In conclusion, the crop edge plays a key role in sustaining weed diversity, mostly because of its intermediate environmental properties that allow the coexistence of weeds with different ecological strategies.","[Perronne, Remi; Gaba, Sabrina; Cadet, Emilie; Le Corre, Valerie] INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, F-21000 Dijon, France","Le Corre, V (corresponding author), INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, BP 86510, F-21000 Dijon, France.",valerie.lecorre@dijon.inra.fr,"Gaba, Sabrina/N-8428-2013; Gaba, Sabrina/H-5240-2018","Gaba, Sabrina/0000-0002-7145-6713; Gaba, Sabrina/0000-0002-7145-6713; Le Corre, Valerie/0000-0001-6515-7795","INRA, Research Division Plant Health and the Environment","This work was funded by a grant from INRA, Research Division Plant Health and the Environment.

In previous studies, a canopy index based on three-dimensional canopy census data has been shown to be a good predictor of species-specific demographic rates across the entire tree community on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and has allowed quantifying between-species variation in light response. However, almost all other forest census plots lack data on the canopy structure. Hence, this study aims at assessing whether position-based neighborhood competition indices can replace information from canopy census data and produce similar estimates of the interspecific variation of light responses. We used inventory data from the census plot at Barro Colorado Island and calculated neighborhood competition indices with varying relative effects of the size and distance of neighboring trees. Among these indices, we selected the one that was most strongly correlated with the canopy index. We then compared outcomes of hierarchical Bayesian models for species-specific recruitment and growth rates including either the canopy index or the selected neighborhood competition index as predictor. Mean posterior estimates of light response parameters were highly correlated between models (r>0.85) and indicated that most species regenerate and grow better in higher light. Both light estimation approaches consistently found that the interspecific variation of light response was larger for recruitment than for growth rates. However, the classification of species into different groups of light response, e. g. weaker than linear (decelerating) vs. stronger than linear (accelerating) differed between approaches. These results imply that while the classification into light response groups might be biased when using neighborhood competition indices, they may be useful for determining species rankings and between-species variation of light response and therefore enable large comparative studies between different forest census plots.","[Grote, Steffi; Wirth, Christian] Univ Leipzig, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Condit, Richard; Hubbell, Stephen; Rueger, Nadja] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Washington, DC USA; [Hubbell, Stephen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Wirth, Christian; Rueger, Nadja] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany","Grote, S (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",grote.steffi@gmail.com,"Ruger, Nadja/Q-6418-2019; Wirth, Christian/A-4446-2016; Ruger, Nadja/J-6393-2015","Ruger, Nadja/0000-0003-2371-4172; Ruger, Nadja/0000-0003-2371-4172","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [RU 1536/3-1]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0640386, DEB-0425651, DEB-0346488, DEB-0129874, DEB-00753102, DEB-9909347, DEB-9615226, DEB-9405933, DEB-9221033, DEB-9100058, DEB-8906869, DEB-8605042, DEB-8206992, DEB-7922197]; Center for Tropical Forest Science,Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; John D. and Catherine T.

These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.","[Vanak, Abi Tamim; Thaker, Maria; Owen, Cailey; Greatwood, Sophie; Slotow, Rob] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, ZA-4000 Westville, South Africa; [Vanak, Abi Tamim] Ashoka Trust Res Ecol & Environm, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India; [Fortin, Daniel] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Thaker, Maria] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Ogden, Monika; Owen, Cailey] Karongwe Ecol Res Inst, ZA-1207 Schagen, South Africa","Thaker, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",mthaker@ces.iisc.ernet.in,"Slotow, Rob/AAM-9053-2020; Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020; Vanak, Abi/F-8519-2010","Vanak, Abi/0000-0003-2435-4260; Thaker, Maria/0000-0001-6019-2639; Slotow, Rob/0000-0001-9469-1508","Global Vision International; University of KwaZulu-Natal; National Research Foundation, South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [2069358]","Daniel Fortin and Abi Tamim Vanek contributed equally to this paper.

By contrast, facilitation, whereby herbivory by one insect benefits another via induced plant susceptibility, is uncommon. Positive reciprocal interactions between insect herbivores are even rarer. Here, we reveal a novel case of reciprocal feeding facilitation between above-ground aphids (Amphorophora idaei) and root-feeding vine weevil larvae (Otiorhynchus sulcatus), attacking red raspberry (Rubus idaeus). Using two raspberry cultivars with varying resistance to these herbivores, we further demonstrate that feeding facilitation occurred regardless of host plant resistance. This positive reciprocal interaction operates via an, as yet, unreported mechanism. Specifically, the aphid induces compensatory growth, possibly as a prelude to greater resistance/tolerance, whereas the root herbivore causes the plant to abandon this strategy. Both herbivores may ultimately benefit from this facilitative interaction.","[McKenzie, Scott W.; Vanbergen, Adam J.] CEH, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland; [McKenzie, Scott W.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [McKenzie, Scott W.; Hails, Rosemary S.] CEH, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [McKenzie, Scott W.; Jones, T.

The niche variation hypothesis predicts that among-individual variation in niche use will increase in the presence of intraspecific competition and decrease in the presence of interspecific competition. We sought to determine whether the local isotopic niche breadth of fish inhabiting a wetland was best explained by competition for resources and the niche variation hypothesis, by dispersal of individuals from locations with different prey resources or by a combination of the two. We analysed stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen as indices of feeding niche and compared metrics of within-site spread to characterise site-level isotopic niche breadth. We then evaluated the explanatory power of competing models of the direct and indirect effects of several environmental variables spanning gradients of disturbance, competition strength and food availability on among-individual variation of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). 2. The Dispersal model posits that only the direct effect of disturbance (i.e. changes in water level known to induce fish movement) influences among-individual variation in isotopic niche. The Partitioning model allows for only direct effects of local food availability on among-individual variation. The Combined model allows for both hypotheses by including the direct effects of disturbance and food availability. 3. A linear regression of the Combined model described more variance than models limited to the variables of either the Dispersal or Partitioning models. Of the independent variables considered, the food availability variable (per cent edible periphyton) explained the most variation in isotopic niche breadth, followed closely by the disturbance variable (days since last drying event). 4. Structural equation modelling provided further evidence that the Combined model was best supported by the data, with the Partitioning and the Dispersal models only modestly less informative. Again, the per cent edible periphyton was the variable with the largest direct effect on niche variability, with other food availability variables and the disturbance variable only slightly less important. Indirect effects of heterospecific and conspecific competitor densities were also important, through their effects on prey density. 5. Our results support the Combined hypotheses, although partitioning mechanisms appear to explain the most diet variation among individuals in the eastern mosquitofish. The results also support some predictions of the niche variation hypothesis, although both conspecific and interspecific competition appeared to increase isotopic niche breadth in contrast to predictions that interspecific competition would decrease it. We think this resulted from high diet overlap of co-occurring species, most of which consume similar macroinvertebrates.","[Abbey-Lee, Robin N.; Gaiser, Evelyn E.; Trexler, Joel C.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Gaiser, Evelyn E.; Trexler, Joel C.] Florida Int Univ, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Abbey-Lee, RN (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Evolutionary Ecol Variat Grp, Eberhard Gwinner Str 7, DE-82319 Seewiesen, Germany.",rabbeylee@orn.mpg.de,"Gaiser, Evelyn/ABG-2507-2020; Trexler, Joel C/I-5265-2012","Gaiser, Evelyn/0000-0003-2065-4821; Abbey-Lee, Robin/0000-0002-1799-1440",U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; Florida International University; US EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [EPA 904-R-07-001]; Everglades National Park (ENP) [EPA 904-R-07-001]; FIU [H5297-05-0088]; ENP [H5297-05-0088]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-0620409]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1237517] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This paper is in partial fulfilment of the requirements for a Master of Science in Biology degree by RAL.

Most empirical evidence comes from plant communities and sessile marine organisms. However, evidence for the relative role of positive interactions in organizing terrestrial animal communities is more limited, and a general framework that includes positive interactions among animals is lacking. The stress gradient hypothesis' (SGH) developed by plant ecologists predicts that the balance between positive and negative interactions will vary along gradients of biotic and abiotic stress, with positive interactions being more important in stressful environments. Paralleling the SGH, stress gradients for terrestrial herbivores could be equated to inverse primary productivity gradients, so we would expect positive interactions to prevail in more stressful, low productivity environments. However, this contradicts the typical view of terrestrial animal ecology that low primary productivity systems will foster intense competition for resources among consumers. Here we use alpine herbivores as a case study to test one of the predictions of the SGH in animal communities, namely the prevalence of positive interactions in low productivity environments. We identify potential mechanisms of facilitation and review the limited number of examples of interspecific interactions among alpine herbivores to assess the role of positive and negative interactions in structuring their communities. A meta-analysis showed no clear trend in the strength and direction of interactions among alpine herbivores. Although studies were biased towards reporting significant negative inter actions, we found no evidence of competition dominating in harsh environments. Thus, our results only partially support the SGH, but directly challenge the dominant view among animal ecologists. Clearly, a sound theoretical framework is needed to include competition, positive and neutral interactions as potential mechanisms determining the structure of animal communities under differing environmental conditions, and the stress-gradient hypothesis can provide a solid starting point.","[Barrio, I.

Though intraguild competition and predation can limit the set of species that coexist, most carnivores have traits that decrease the impacts of interspecific competition on fitness, a pattern that promotes coexistence. An increasing human population and demand for natural resources (e.g. farming) has fragmented landscapes, reduced available prey, and elevated rates of conflict. These anthropogenic pressures tend to eliminate large carnivores first, which can have cascading effects on ecosystem function (e.g. mesopredator release). Anthropogenic pressures might also affect mesocarnivores directly, but this hypothesis has received little research attention to date. Here, we used camera surveys to describe spatial and temporal patterns of carnivore occupancy in a mixed-use landscape in Kenya. This landscape included a community conservation area and seasonally occupied human settlement and livestock grazing areas. We detected 21 carnivore species and examined occupancy patterns for the 12 most frequently detected. Differences among species in responses to environmental conditions supported a hypothesis of spatial niche partitioning. Differences in the temporal activity patterns of the apex predators and mesocarnivores supported a hypothesis of temporal niche partitioning. Human land use altered occupancy patterns in 10 of 12 species. Apex predator occupancies were lower in more anthropogenically disturbed areas, but mesocarnivore occupancies were not inversely related to apex predators, contrary to the mesopredator release hypothesis. Our results suggest that a diverse carnivore community persists in this mixed use landscape because of seasonal variation in human land use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

There are two, nonexclusive, hypotheses typically proposed to explain the formation of social groups: increased predator vigilance and greater foraging efficiency. In mixed-species groups, these hypotheses are typically tested with species-level summary measures such as flocking propensity, the assignment of species-level roles, mean body size, and foraging and habitat characteristics. Literature syntheses make it clear that while these hypotheses are important, much about mixed-species groups remains unexplained. We suggest that we can substantially increase our understanding of the evolution and ecology of mixed-species social groups in terms of both traditional and novel hypotheses by shifting the analytical focus to bottom-up approaches common in intraspecific investigations of sociality. Bottom-up approaches to analyses of social structure treat pairwise interactions as the fundamental unit of analysis and social structure as an emergent property rather than relying on a priori assignments of species as units of association. The construction of social networks from pairwise interaction rates allows us to assess the factors that promote group formation on the basis of individuals, a more appropriate level of selection, rather than species groups. We illustrate this approach with data from mixed-species foraging assemblies in tits (Paridae), finding significant effects of dominance on social behaviour within species. This new focus allows us to address questions about active associations among heterospecifics, the role of individuals within mixed-species societies, and the role of environments, which will collectively provide a richer description of the evolution and function of mixed-species societies.

Dominant scavengers can impose a selection pressure that alters the predator's fitness, morphology, behavior, and ecology. Interactions between ursids, likely the most important dominant scavengers in the Holarctic region, and solitary felids, which are characterized by long feeding times, provide a good opportunity for studying the effects of kleptoparasitism by dominant scavengers. We analyzed the effects of scavenging by brown bears Ursus arctos on Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and predator's response to kleptoparasitism in a European temperate forest ecosystem. Bears found 32 % of lynx prey remains and 15 % of all biomass of large prey killed by lynx was lost to bears. In response, lynx increased their kill rate by 23 % but were able to compensate for only 59 % of the losses. The frequency of bear scavenging was strongly dependent on bear activity patterns and was highest during the lynx pregnancy and lactation period, when up to half of lynx kills were usurped by bears. We suggest that ursid scavenging, by promoting the hunting of smaller prey, may have played an important role in the evolution of the Lynx genus as well as other predators in the Holarctic. Our study indicates that prey loss to dominant scavengers is a widespread phenomenon among felids worldwide, including forest habitats. We highlight several implications of scavenging that could considerably improve our understanding of the ecology of vertebrate communities and the evolution of predators as well as benefit the future management and conservation of endangered predators.","[Krofel, Miha; Kos, Ivan] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Biol, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana 1001, Slovenia; [Krofel, Miha; Jerina, Klemen] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Forestry & Renewable Forest Resources, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana 1001, Slovenia","Krofel, M (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Dept Biol, Biotech Fac, Vecna Pot 111, Ljubljana 1001, Slovenia.",miha.krofel@gmail.com,"Krofel, Miha/I-4495-2019; Kos, Ivan/AAB-7566-2020","Krofel, Miha/0000-0002-2010-5219; ","European UnionEuropean Commission; Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P1-0184]; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food [V4-0497]; Slovenian Environmental Agency [2523-09-100075, 2523-08-100547]","We would like to thank M.

Recent laboratory studies have reached opposite conclusions regarding the dominance relationship between these species, even documenting a reversal of roles as predator and prey. Interestingly, these contradicting results involved crab populations from different regions in Atlantic Canada (St. George's Bay in the Northumberland Strait and Passamaquoddy Bay in the Bay of Fundy), which are genetically different and presumed to be the result of different invasion events. In this study we housed juvenile lobsters and adult green crabs together in 3-m diameter flow-through tanks, and monitored their mortality, growth and behaviour from September through December 2009. The experiment involved five treatments, three experimental treatments with 2.5 lobsters/m(2) housed with an equal density of green crabs from one of three regions (Passamaquoddy Bay, St. George's Bay or Chedabucto Bay on the Scotian Shelf) and two control treatments with lobsters alone stocked at either 2.5 or 5 individuals/m(2). Chedabucto Bay was chosen as a third region as crabs there are genetically similar to conspecifics in St. George's Bay, but experience environmental conditions more similar to Passamaquoddy Bay. Green crabs had a significant and negative impact on lobster survival during the experiment, and the magnitude of this impact varied in relation to the green crabs' geographic origin, as mortality was significantly higher for lobsters paired with St. George's Bay and Chedabucto Bay crabs than Passamaquoddy Bay crabs. These differences in lobster mortality patterns lead to two important conclusions. First, the greater predatory impact of green crabs from St. George's Bay relative to Passamaquoddy Bay is consistent with the contrasting results recently reported in the literature, suggesting that these are of biological significance and not simply the result of procedural differences between studies. Second, the fact that the predatory impact of Chedabucto Bay green crabs was similar to that of conspecifics from St. Georges Bay, but greater than those from Passamaquoddy Bay, suggests that these differences in interspecific dominance patterns are correlated with genetic differences between green crab populations related to their invasion history in Atlantic Canada.

However, predictions of this hypothesis require further empirical field tests. Here, we focus on evaluating two biotic factors known to severely limit plants, interspecific competition and insect herbivory, as mechanisms of biotic resistance. We experimentally evaluated the independent and combined effects of three levels of competition by tallgrass prairie vegetation and two levels of herbivory by native insects on seedling regeneration, size, and subsequent flowering of the Eurasian , a known invasive species elsewhere, and compared its responses to those of the ecologically similar and co-occurring native congener . Seedling emergence of was greater than that of and that emergence was reduced by the highest level of interspecific competition. Insect leaf herbivory was also greater on than on at all levels of competition. Herbivory on seedlings dramatically decreased the proportion of producing flower heads at all competition levels, but especially at the high competition level. Competition and herbivory interacted to significantly decrease plant survival and biomass, especially for . Thus, both competition and herbivory limited regeneration of both thistles, but their effects on seedling emergence, survival, size and subsequent reproduction were greater for than for These results help explain the unexpectedly low abundance recorded for in western tallgrass prairie, and also provide strong support for the biotic resistance hypothesis.","[Suwa, Tomomi; Louda, Svata M.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Suwa, T (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",suwatomo@msu.edu,,,Nature Conservancy-Nebraska Chapter; John Davidson Scholarship; School of Biological Sciences at University of Nebraska; NSF-DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0532018]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI-2005-35320-15379],"We thank J.

To determine the potential impact of new ecological interactions, we studied the diet of co-occurring juvenile gadoids in fjords, open water, and sea ice around Svalbard. We also reviewed the available literature on polar cod feeding in different habitats across the Arctic to determine whether region, habitat, or fish size may influence diet. Feeding by polar cod in the pelagic zone was size dependent, with small fish primarily consuming Calanus spp. and smaller copepods, with an increasing ration of Themisto spp. at larger sizes. In benthic habitats, diets were more varied and included considerably more unidentified material and sediment. Less than 40% dietary overlap was detected among the three species when they were found together. Stable isotope analyses indicated these patterns were representative of longer-term assimilation. The low interspecific dietary overlap suggests little direct competition. Future increases in abundance and the high predation potential of the boreal taxa, however, may impact the persistence of polar cod on some Arctic shelves.","[Renaud, Paul E.; Berge, Jorgen; Nahrgang, Jasmine] Akvaplan Niva, Fram Ctr Climate & Environm, Tromso, Norway; [Renaud, Paul E.; Berge, Jorgen; Varpe, Oystein; Lonne, Ole Jorgen] Univ Ctr Svalbard, Longyearbyen, Norway; [Varpe, Oystein; Hallanger, Ingeborg] Fram Ctr Climate & Environm, Norwegian Polar Inst, Tromso, Norway; [Ottesen, Camilla] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway","Renaud, PE (corresponding author), Akvaplan Niva, Fram Ctr Climate & Environm, Tromso, Norway.",pr@akvaplan.niva.no,"Lonne, Ole Jorgen/E-3539-2013; Renaud, Paul E/C-7191-2008; Varpe, Oystein/B-9693-2008; Berge, Jorgen/E-7544-2015; Nahrgang, Jasmine/AAQ-3594-2020; Berge, Jorgen/B-8749-2008","Varpe, Oystein/0000-0002-5895-6983; Berge, Jorgen/0000-0003-0900-5679; Nahrgang, Jasmine/0000-0002-4202-5922; Berge, Jorgen/0000-0003-0900-5679; Hallanger, Ingeborg G./0000-0002-9476-4401",EUEuropean Commission; Akvaplan-niva; UNIS; Conoco Phillips; Statoil,"We are grateful for the assistance of the officers and crew of the R/V Jan Mayen, and students from UNIS AB320 cruises in 2006 and 2008.

Such regulation is harder to understand in large marine ecosystems, as they extend over vast areas and are influenced by adjacent marine areas. Fully coupled biophysical models have increased in popularity during recent years, but these models are still in their infancy. Here we present a coupled model system of the Norwegian Sea, including an ocean model, a phytoplankton model and individual-based models of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus and planktivorous fish. The fish migration model is driven by survey observations, but the C. finmarchicus densities also affect the fish migrations. This leads to a realistic predation pressure on zooplankton by fish in time and space. The predation pressure of fish on zooplankton is calculated by modelling individual fish growth using bioenergetics models. We estimated that the major pelagic fish stocks in the Norwegian Sea, herring, mackerel and blue whiting, consumed a total of 82 million tonnes of zooplankton, including 35 million tonnes C. finmarchicus, in 1997. Furthermore, the interspecific competition has the greatest effect on blue whiting consumption, while herring consumption is unaffected by the other fish species in this one-year simulation. We also analysed the spatial distribution of C. finmarchicus in June and August and found the highest densities in the northern Norwegian Sea and around Iceland. The results give us a better understanding of the effect from fish predation on the Norwegian Sea ecosystem, and how it affects the C. finmarchicus stock.","[Utne, Kjell Rong; Hjollo, Solfrid Saetre; Huse, Geir; Skogen, Morten] Inst Marine Res, N-5085 Bergen, Norway","Utne, KR (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, Nordnesgt 33, N-5085 Bergen, Norway.",kjell.rong.utne@imr.no,"Huse, Geir/AAY-2341-2021","Hjollo, Solfrid Saetre/0000-0003-2897-474X; Skogen, Morten D./0000-0002-6304-7282",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Meece,We thank two anonymous referees for providing helpful comments on an early version of the manuscript.

For a realistic representation of the open marine plankton ecosystem, we have incorporated various natural phenomena such as dissolved limiting nutrient with general nutrient uptake function, nutrient recycling, interspecies competition and grazing at a higher level. For the model with constant nutrient input and different constant washout rates, conditions for boundedness of the solutions, existence and stability of non negative equilibria, as well as persistence are given. The model system is studied analytically and the threshold values for the existence and stability of various steady states are worked out. It is observed that if the dilution rate of nutrient crosses certain critical value, the system enters into Hopf-bifurcation. Finally, it is observed that planktonic bloom can be controlled and stability around the equilibrium of coexistence can be obtained if the dilution rate of phytoplankton population is increased.

We used traditional (morphological) and novel molecular methods of diet analysis to study the diet of two cryptic bat species that are sympatric in southern England (Plecotus austriacus and P. auritus) (Fig. 1). Using Roche FLX 454 (Roche, Basel, CH) high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and uniquely tagged generic arthropod primers, we identified 142 prey Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) in the diet of the cryptic bats, 60% of which were assigned to a likely species or genus. The findings from the molecular study supported the results of microscopic analyses in showing that the diets of both species were dominated by lepidopterans. However, HTS provided a sufficiently high resolution of prey identification to determine fine-scale differences in resource use. Although both bat species appeared to have a generalist diet, eared-moths from the family Noctuidae were the main prey consumed. Interspecific niche overlap was greater than expected by chance (O-jk = 0.72, P < 0.001) due to overlap in the consumption of the more common prey species. Yet, habitat associations of nongeneralist prey species found in the diets corresponded to those of their respective bat predator (grasslands for P. austriacus, and woodland for P. auritus). Overlap in common dietary resource use combined with differential specialist prey habitat associations suggests that habitat partitioning is the primary mechanism of coexistence. The performance of HTS is discussed in relation to previous methods of molecular and morphological diet analysis. By enabling species-level identification of dietary components, the application of DNA sequencing to diet analysis allows a more comprehensive comparison of the diet of sympatric cryptic species, and therefore can be an important tool for determining fine-scale mechanisms of coexistence.","[Razgour, Orly; Clare, Elizabeth L.; Zeale, Matt R.

This is often assessed by measuring how many individuals are killed by a predator, yet such direct effects may only be a relatively minor part of population dynamics. Predators frequently affect prey populations indirectly, with the fear of predation resulting in costly behavioural compensation that has the potential to lead to large population and community effects. Large observable lethal effects may then just represent the most easily observed special cases of the effects of predation on populations, with the costs of non-lethal effects being ubiquitous and usually dominant. This review explores these two ideas: that both cases where there are no population effects due to predation and those where lethal effects dominate are unusual and involve special circumstances. First, systems in which predation effects appear not to arise include (1) complete avoidance of predators by prey; (2) when other environmental factors limit populations so that predation is not additive to mortality; (3) when there are other more vulnerable prey for a predator; (4) when predators interact; (5) because the relationship of perceived predation risk with predator abundance is usually a non-linear function; (6) for the simple reason that non-lethal effects have not been considered. Second, lethal effects tend to dominate over non-lethal effects when (1) there is a high cost of compensating for predation risk associated with either a resource constraint or a particularly vulnerable niche or life-history stage (e.g. the nest stage generally for birds); (2) prey are the most popular prey of a predator or linear trophic chains operate; (3) there is evolutionary lag, such as introduced predators and na < ve prey populations; (4) there are several predator species hunting the same prey in diverse ways. The presence of predators may or may not affect the size of a bird population at any particular life-history stage, although in most cases it will do so through non-lethal effects and, occasionally, through lethal effects. However, the presence of predators will always affect intra- and interspecific competition and so will always affect population dynamics. Studies that wish to fully demonstrate that predation has no effect on bird populations must show that lethal effects and the costs of non-lethal compensation by the prey do not significantly change its density and, consequently, the level of competition.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland","Cresswell, W (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland.",wrlc@st-and.ac.uk,"Cresswell, Will/B-1472-2013","Cresswell, Will/0000-0002-4684-7624",,,,132,82,86,5,118,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Population dynamics of small pelagic fish may therefore be regulated neither strictly bottom-up nor top-down, but rather through multiple external and internal drivers. While in many studies single drivers have been identified, potential synergies of multiple factors, as well as their relative importance in regulating population dynamics of small pelagic fish, is a largely unresolved issue. Using a statistical, age-structured modeling approach, we demonstrate the relative importance and influence of bottom-up (e.g., climate, zooplankton availability) and top-down (i.e., fishing and predation) factors on the population dynamics of Bothnian Sea herring (Clupea harengus) throughout its life cycle. Our results indicate significant bottom-up effects of zooplankton and interspecific competition from sprat (Sprattus sprattus), particularly on younger age classes of herring. Although top-down forcing through fishing and predation by grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) also was evident, these factors were less important than resource availability and interspecific competition. Understanding key ecological processes and interactions is fundamental to ecosystem-based management practices necessary to promote sustainable exploitation of small pelagic fish.","[Lindegren, Martin] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Ostman, Orjan; Gardmark, Anna] Swedish Board Fisheries, Inst Coastal Res, SE-74241 Oregrund, Sweden","Lindegren, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark.",mli@aqua.dtu.dk,"Gardmark, Anna/AAC-3909-2021; Ostman, Orjan/ABF-8714-2020","Ostman, Orjan/0000-0002-1930-0148; Lindegren, Martin/0000-0002-9185-951X",,,,28,33,33,0,50,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2011,92,7,,,,,1407,1413,,10.1890/10-2229.1,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,793IR,WOS:000292814300004,21870614,,,,2021-09-21,

We tested for fine-scale competition over foraging space between sympatric pursuit-diving seabirds, Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)) and Common Murre (Uria aalge (Pontoppidan, 1763)). We simultaneous assessed the effects of inter- and intra-specific competition among these predators, predicting that the larger Common Murres would out-compete the smaller Marbled Murrelets for foraging space. A theodolite was used to map the fine-scale (+/- 2 m) distributions of birds on the water; distance from shore measurements and nearest-neighbour spatial statistics quantified the spatial overlap and segregation between species. Species distributions differed with respect to distance from shore, but overlapped extensively within 1200 m of the shoreline. Nearest-neighbour statistics, assessed with randomization tests, showed Marbled Murrelets foraging farther from Common Murres (mean distances 294 m) than from other Marbled Murre lets (95 m), but groups of Common Murres foraged with similar spacing among conspecifics (266 m) and competitors (186 m). These results suggest avoidance of Common Murres by Marbled Murrelets (interspecific competition) but intraspecifc competition among Common Murres.

The aims of the current work were to experimentally study whether the habitat choice of G. tigrinus and G. salinus was similar and whether G. tigrinus modified the habitat selection of G. salinus, providing thus evidence that competition for space between the two species might explain the disappearance of the native gammarids from the study area. In general, the gammarid amphipods had a significant overlap in habitat selection. Gammarids modified the habitat choices of co-occurring species but impacts were disproportional among species. The effects of G. tigrinus on G. salinus were stronger than vice versa. However, the effects varied among months, and the negative responses were not observed in all habitats. Thus, competition for space alone cannot explain the mass disappearance of the native G. salinus.","[Kotta, Jonne; Orav-Kotta, Helen; Herkuel, Kristjan; Kotta, Ilmar] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Herkuel, Kristjan] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia","Kotta, J (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",jonne.kotta@sea.ee,"Kotta, Jonne/B-5542-2009; Orav-Kotta, Helen/E-2810-2013; Herkul, Kristjan/G-5791-2016","Kotta, Jonne/0000-0002-4970-6755; Orav-Kotta, Helen/0000-0002-3029-5642; Herkul, Kristjan/0000-0002-4356-8152","Estonian Targeted Financing Programme [SF0180013s08]; Estonian Science Foundation [7813, 8254]",This study was financed by Estonian Targeted Financing Programme no.

However, few empirical studies examine why birds migrate, in part due to the difficulty of testing causal hypotheses in long-distance migration systems. Short-distance altitudinal migrations provide relatively tractable systems in which to test explanations for migration. Many past studies explain tropical altitudinal migration as a response to spatial and temporal variation in fruit availability. Yet this hypothesis fails to explain why some coexisting, closely-related frugivorous birds remain resident year-round. We take a mechanistic approach by proposing and evaluating two hypotheses (one based on competitive exclusion and the other based on differences in dietary specialization) to explain why some, but not all, tropical frugivores migrate. We tested predictions of these hypotheses by comparing diets, fruit preferences, and the relationships between diet and preference in closely-related pairs of migrant and resident species. Fecal samples and experimental choice trials revealed that sympatric migrants and residents differed in both their diets and fruit preferences. Migrants consumed a greater diversity of fruits and fewer arthropods than did their resident counterparts. Migrants also tended to have slightly stronger fruit preferences than residents. Most critically, diets of migrants more closely matched their preferences than did the diets of residents. These results suggest that migrants may be competitively superior foragers for fruit compared to residents (rather than vice versa), implying that current competitive interactions are unlikely to explain variation in migratory behavior among coexisting frugivores. We found some support for the dietary specialization hypothesis, propose refinements to the mechanism underlying this hypothesis, and discuss how dietary specialization might ultimately reflect past interspecific competition. We recommend that future studies quantify variation in nutritional content of tropical fruits, and determine whether frugivory is a consequence or a cause of migratory behaviour.","[Boyle, W.

However, the evolutionary consequences of indirect interactions are rarely considered. Here I conduct selection experiments and examine the evolutionary response of Colpoda sp., a ciliated protozoan, to other members of the inquiline community of purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea). I measured the evolution of six traits in response to (1) predation by mosquito larvae, (2) competition from other ciliated protozoans, and (3) simultaneous predation and competition. The latter treatment incorporated both direct effects and indirect effects due to interactions between predators and competitors. Population growth rate and cell size evolved in response to direct effects of predators and competitors. However, trait values in the multispecies treatment were similar to those in the monoculture treatment, indicating that direct effects were offset by strong indirect effects on the evolution of traits. For most of the traits measured, indirect effects were opposed to, and often stronger than, direct effects. These indirect effects occurred as a result of behavioral changes of the predator in the presence of competitors and as a result of reduced densities of competitors in the presence of predators. Incorporating indirect effects provides a more realistic description of how species evolve in complex natural communities.","[Terhorst, Casey P.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Terhorst, CP (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",casey.terhorst@kbs.msu.edu,,,"Florida State University (FSU); FSU English Department; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0519170, DEB-0716891]","This work could not have been accomplished without valuable assistance in the laboratory from F.

(Jatropha), potentially a multipurpose tree and biofuel source, owing to insufficient knowledge about the species. Use of allometry as a non-destructive method of monitoring growth and biomass attributes of Jatropha was investigated. The objectives were to examine: reliability of allometry between above-ground variables and basal diameter and crown depth of Jatropha; effects of below-ground interspecies competition and tree spacing on allometry; and validity of these relationships with independent data. The study site was Ukulinga Research Farm, South Africa. Destructive sampling was carried out in March 2008, and tree height and basal diameter were measured periodically during March 2005 to April 2007. Regression analysis and analyses of covariance were used to analyse the data. The height-diameter equation developed by destructive sampling was validated using independent data. Highly significant allometric regressions resulted from using basal diameter (r >= 0.89) and crown depth (r >= 0.94). Stem diameter had linear relationships with wood and foliage biomass percentages (r = 0.91). Height-diameter equations were equivalent across competition and tree spacing treatments. Predicted and measured tree heights were linearly related (r > 0.97). It could be concluded that above-ground allometry of Jatropha was very reliable and not significantly affected by either below-ground interspecies competition or tree spacing. The site-specific allometric equations are useful for accurate and non-destructive estimations of Jatropha growth under various growing and (non-pruning) tree management conditions. The equations presented here are, however, not universally applicable.","[Ghezehei, S. B.; Annandale, J. G.; Everson, C.

However, significant correlations may also exist between putatively unrelated characters due to shared relationships between those traits and underlying variables, such as body size. Although such patterns are often dismissed as simple body size scaling, this presumption may overlook important evolutionary patterns of diversification. If body size is the primary determinant of potential diversity in multiple unrelated characters, the observed differentiation of species may be governed by variability in body size, and any biotic or abiotic constraints on the diversification thereof. Here, we demonstrate that traits related to both predatory specialization (gape and diet preference) and predatory avoidance (the development of Batesian mimicry) are phylogenetically correlated in the North American snake tribe Lampropeltini. This is apparently due to shared relationships between those traits and adult body size, suggesting that size is the primary determinant of ecomorphological differentiation in the lampropeltinines. Diversification in body size is apparently not linked to climatic or environmental factors, and may have been driven by interspecific interactions such as competition. Additionally, we find the presence of a 'key zone' for the development of both rattle- and coral snake mimicry; only small snakes feeding primarily on ectothermic prey develop mimetic colour patterns, in or near the range of venomous model species.","[Pyron, R.

We re-analysed results of past research carried out: in Eastern Colombia to explore how interspecific competition accounts for this pattern. In three sown pastures and three native savannas. density data matrices were obtained from spatially explicit samplings at several successive dates, and spatio-temporal patterns of species assemblages were described through partial triadic analyses and geostatistics. This first analysis detected assemblage patchiness in the six plots at spatial scales ranging from 6 to 33 m. Species richness ranged from 5 to 6 species per plot. Null models were further used to analyse niche overlap and morphometric distribution patterns at two different scales, i.e. at the 'plot level' and the 'patch level'. Seasonal and vertical niche overlaps were higher than expected by chance at both scales, indicating high environmental constraints on assemblage membership. Within-patch overlaps were lower than plot-scale overlaps. Biometric niche overlap was random at the plot level and was weakly lower than that expected by chance in patches. Body weight was significantly overdispersed and constant whatever the scale. while body length and diameter showed a similar trend within patches. These results Suggest that earthworms form distinct assemblages within patches, mainly driven by deterministic responses to competition: ecologically similar species avoid competition through spatial segregation, whereas a minimal level of ecological segregation is required to allow co-existence in a given patch.","[Decaens, Thibaud] Univ Rouen, Ecol Lab, EA ECODIV 1293, UFR Sci & Tech, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France; [Jose Jimenez, Juan] CSIC, Inst Pirena Ecol, E-22700 Jaca, Huesca, Spain; [Rossi, Jean-Pierre] INRA, UMR BIOGECO, F-33612 Cestas, France","Decaens, T (corresponding author), Univ Rouen, Ecol Lab, EA ECODIV 1293, UFR Sci & Tech, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France.",thibaud.decaens@univ-rouen.fr,"Decaens, Thibaud/AAA-5287-2020; Jimenez, Juan J./B-9058-2013","Jimenez, Juan J./0000-0003-2398-0796; Rossi, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-8139-1116",,,,89,23,25,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4674,1469-7831,,J TROP ECOL,J.

We examined the potential for interspecific competition for nest sites between co-occurring native Mt. Graham red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis) and exotic Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti) in the Pinaleno Mountains of Arizona. Comparison of nest use between red and Abert's squirrels at different scales (nest, nest tree, and nest site) revealed contrasting results. Competition for nests and nest trees appears unlikely given the dissimilarity in use of nest types and tree characteristics. Abert's squirrels predominately used dreys, whereas red squirrels Mostly used cavity nests. Neither squirrel species occupied a nest used by the other species. Nest trees differed in size and species between squirrels for dreys, but not for cavities. Abert's squirrel nest sites were found in a wider range of microhabitats including almost all microhabitats in which red squirrel nest sites were located. Although there was significant overlap, each species showed distinct trends in microhabitat. In general, red squirrel nest sites were characterized as more densely forested areas dominated by corkbark fir (Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica), whereas Abert's squirrel nest sites were more open and contained greater tree species diversity. Overlap in microhabitat characteristics increases the likelihood of interspecific competition and could increase the vulnerability of red squirrels to extinction.","[Edelman, Andrew J.; Koprowski, John L.; Bertelsen, Sadie R.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Edelman, AJ (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",andrewe@unm.edu,"Edelman, Andrew J/C-2810-2012","Koprowski, John/0000-0003-1406-9853","University of Arizona Red Squirrel Monitoring Program; Undergraduate Biology Research Program; Arizona Game and Fish Department, Arizona Agricultural Experiment Station; T and E, Inc.","We thank J.

However, it is relatively unknown how potential competitive interactions could be taking place. In many freshwater turtles, semiochemicals from different glands might facilitate species and sex recognition. We hypothesized that chemosensory detection of competitor species might affect space use and habitat selection by freshwater turtles. We analyzed whether T. scripta and M. leprosa turtles recognized chemical cues from male and female conspecifics and heterospecifics in water. We compared time spent by turtles in clean water pools vs. water pools containing the different chemical stimuli. Introduced T. scripta did not avoid nor prefer water pools with chemical stimuli of native M. leprosa terrapins, which might favor the expansion of the invasive species. In contrast, M. leprosa preferred water with chemical stimuli of conspecifics and avoided water with chemical cues of T. scripta, which suggests that chemical cues could be used by native M. leprosa to avoid water pools occupied by introduced T. scripta. We suggest that this avoidance behavior of native M. leprosa may be one of the causes that contribute to the observed displacement of their populations by invasive T. scripta.","[Polo-Cavia, Nuria; Lopez, Pilar; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",Jose.Martin@mncn.csic.es,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014; , Nuria/L-5372-2014; Lopez, Pilar/K-6221-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Lopez, Pilar/0000-0001-6577-1509",Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2005-00391/BOS]; El Ventorrillo'' C.S.I.C.,"We thank an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments, the Grupo de Rehabilitacion de la Fauna Autoctona y su Habitat'' ( GREFA) for providing sliders, and El Ventorrillo'' MNCN Field Station for use of their facilities.

There has been much research into the implications of such variation for intraspecific interactions, yet little investigation into its role in influencing interspecific interactions outside of a predator-prey context. In this study, we investigated the role of individual-level behavioural variation in determining the outcomes of interactions between two ecologically similar fishes, the threespine and ninespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus and Pungitius pungitius). Experiment 1 asked whether individuals of both species were consistent in their expression of two behaviours: activity in novel surroundings and latency to attack prey. For each behaviour, focal individuals were assayed twice, 10 days apart. Performances were positively correlated between exposures, suggesting behavioural consistency within individuals, at least over this timescale. Experiment 2 revealed not only differences in habitat use described both by species-level variation, with ninespines spending more time in vegetated areas, but also by individual differences, with more active individuals of both species spending more time in open water than in vegetation. Experiment 3 revealed that when heterospecific pairs competed for prey, bolder individuals consumed a greater share, irrespective of species. These findings suggest that individual-level variation can facilitate overlap in habitat use between heterospecifics and also determine the outcomes of resource contests when they meet. We discuss how this might vary between populations as a function of prevailing selection pressures and suggest approaches for testing our predictions.","[Webster, M.

We manipulated breeding pool size in order to demonstrate experimentally that breeding habitat selection strategy has evolved in concert with changes in parental care and mating system. We also manipulated intra- and interspecific larval interactions to demonstrate that larval adaptation to the use of very small pools for breeding affected the evolution of larval competition and cannibalism.

The effect of low doses of mecoprop-P on the competitive interaations and plant community dynamics was investigated in a model system using Capsella bursa-pastoris and Geranium dissectum as test plants. Dose-response experiments on single species showed that compared to G. dissectum, C. bursa-pastoris was more affected by mecoprop-P. Consequently, we expected that G. dissectum would outcompete C. bursa-pastoris when mecoprop-P was applied at a low dose in the competition experiment. Indeed, mecoprop-P had a significant effect on the interspecific competitive ability of both C. bursa-pastoris and G. dissectum. Our previous expectation, however, was not met: The interspecific competitive ability of both species increased significantly with the dose of the herbicide, and it was predicted that C. bursa-pastoris and G. dissection are more likely to coexist in natural habitats with low concentrations of the herbicide compared to natural habitats with relatively high concentrations. The results from the dose-response experiments on the single species and the more laborious competition experiment approach, which is assumed to mimic the dynamics of plant communities more closely, show considerable discrepancies even though the experiments were performed at the same time and in the same greenhouse. This finding generally reduces the credibility of using single-species tests in ecological risk assessment of herbicide use.","[Damgaard, Christian] Univ Aarhus, Dept Terr Ecol, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Mathiassen, Solvejg Kopp; Kudsk, Per] Univ Aarhus, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Integrated Pest Management, DK-4200 Slagelse, Denmark","Damgaard, C (corresponding author), Univ Aarhus, Dept Terr Ecol, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.",cfd@dmu.dk,"Mathiassen, Solvejg K/A-6309-2009; Damgaard, Christian/G-2441-2010; Kudsk, Per/G-1210-2016","Damgaard, Christian/0000-0003-3932-4312; Kudsk, Per/0000-0003-2431-3610",,,,36,20,20,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

What are the respective importance and interactions of these factors? Is the intermediate disturbance hypothesis applicable to such systems? Methods: We used the spatially explicit individual-based model KiWi to investigate the effects on species diversity of perturbation frequency and intensity, different abiotic conditions, and interspecific competition simulated at the individual level. The simulation system considered the three dominant Caribbean mangrove species: Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa, applying species-specific growth and mortality characteristics. Firstly, effects on species dominance of the abiotic conditions nutrient availability and porewater salinity were tested with two competition scenarios. Secondly, the effect of perturbation frequency and intensity were investigated with selected abiotic conditions. Results: Abiotic conditions influenced species dominance and, in extreme cases, excluded one or two species. Abiotic and competition settings controlled the successional dynamics and the response of species dominance to perturbation regimes. A response consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis was observed only with a configuration of plant interaction in which one species behaved as a pioneer so that succession occurred by competitive exclusion. Conclusions: We suggest that successional dynamics interact with the intensity and timing of perturbations and determine whether or not mangrove tree diversity conforms to predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. For mangroves, these successional dynamics are site-specific depending on abiotic conditions and species configurations.","[Piou, Cyril; Berger, Uta; Hildenbrandt, Hanno] Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, D-23859 Bremen, Germany; [Feller, Ilka C.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Piou, C (corresponding author), Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-23859 Bremen, Germany.",cyril.piou@forst.tu-dresden.de; uta.berger@forst.tu-dresden.de; h.hildenbrandt@rug.nl; felleri@si.edu,,"Feller, Ilka/0000-0002-6391-1608",,,,42,13,14,0,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

I investigated interspecific variation in relative testis volume across 19 New Zealand gecko taxa and 63 additional species of squamate reptiles from other countries to make predictions about the social mating system of the New Zealand geckos. Relative testis size varied greatly between species of New Zealand gecko, with testes ranging from 119% larger than expected to 75% smaller than expected. This variation was even greater across other squamates, with testes ranging from 55 to 152% of expected size. This variation could not be explained by seasonality of breeding, clutch size or the sex ratio of populations. As species subject to more intense sperm competition sport relatively larger testes in other vertebrate groups, it is likely that similar variation in gecko testis size is due to differences in mating systems between species. Based on testis volume, it is predicted that at least half of the New Zealand gecko taxa studied are likely to have polygynandrous mating systems.","[Todd, Amanda C.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand","Todd, AC (corresponding author), Dept Conservat, Sci & Tech Publishing Res Dev & Improvement Div, POB 10420, Wellington 6143, New Zealand.",atodd@doc.govt.nz,,,,,,84,7,8,0,13,RSNZ PUBLISHING,WELLINGTON,"PO BOX  598, WELLINGTON, 00000, NEW ZEALAND",0301-4223,,,NEW ZEAL J ZOOL,N.

The relative importance of host-plants and predators in the population dynamics of herbivorous insects, and the frequency and intensity of inter-specific competition among herbivores, have both been intensively studied and debated. The joint effects of bottom-up, top-down, and within-trophic level interactions, however, have rarely been integrated in a single system. 2. I studied the dynamics of the cactus bug (Narnia pallidicornis), a specialist feeder on tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata), in response to variable host-plant quality, spider predation, and interactions with cactus-feeding beetles (Moneilema appressum). Previous work suggests that cactus reproductive effort (the proportion of meristems allocated to reproduction) is an important component of host-plant quality for Narnia. I conducted a 2-year field experiment to test the hypotheses that Narnia abundance is positively related to host-plant reproductive effort, and that interactions with predators and putative competitors alter the shape of this relationship. 3. I found strong support for the first prediction (positive Narnia-plant quality relationship) in both years, but neither predator removal nor beetle exclusion had detectable effects on this relationship in either year. I conclude that the dynamics of this insect herbivore are driven predominantly from the bottom-up, and that available data from this work and from previous studies are too variable to permit broad generalisations for the combined effects of host-plants, predation, and competition on herbivore dynamics.","[Miller, Tom E.

To investigate the mechanisms that permit coexistence, we studied two species of coexisting agamid lizards that exhibit striking divergence in their use of habitat in the Simpson Desert of central Australia. Here, the military dragon Ctenophorus isolepis is restricted primarily to sites providing >30% cover of hard spinifex Triodia basedowii, whereas the central netted dragon C. nuchalis occurs in areas with much sparser (<10%) cover. We constructed four mechanistic models to explain this pattern and then derived hypotheses to test them. One hypothesis, that competition restricts each species to its preferred habitat, was rejected after dyad encounters in field enclosures failed to elicit any habitat shift or any overt interactions between the species. Our next hypotheses were that each species exhibits preferences for different thermal environments or different prey types and that each selects the habitats that maximize access to them. Both were supported. C. isolepis preferred lower temperatures when active arid specialized in eating ants <5 mm long and selected spinifex-dominated areas where these requirements were met. In contrast, C. nuchalis preferred higher temperatures and a diversity of prey, both of which were available mostly in open areas. Finally, we used plasticine models to test the hypothesis that each species faced lower risk of predation in its selected habitat. This was partly supported, as models of both species were attacked more often in the open than under spinifex cover. The results show that habitat divergence Occurs along several, probably covarying, niche axes. We suggest that different levels of spinifex cover provide the template for a broad range of ecological interactions, allowing lizard species to partition biotic and abiotic resources and achieve the extraordinarily high levels of local diversity that are observed.","[Daly, Benjamin G.; Dickman, Chris R.; Crowther, Mathew S.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Wildlife Res, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Daly, BG (corresponding author), 8-2 Martins Ave, Bondi Jct, NSW 2026, Australia.",ben_daly18@hotmail.com,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019; Crowther, Mathew/M-7406-2013","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; Crowther, Mathew/0000-0001-8968-1161",,,,71,43,43,0,39,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2008,89,1,,,,,65,76,,10.1890/06-1991.1,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,270JN,WOS:000253717200009,18376548,,,,2021-09-21,

However, predators can alter such competitive interactions substantially. Predation can promote the coexistence of species in a situation where it would otherwise be impossible, for example if a tradeoff between the competitive abilities and predation resistance of the prey species exists. The field vole Microtus agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis are sympatric grassland species, which compete for the same resources. At the population level sibling voles are suggested to be superior competitors to field voles, yet more vulnerable to predation. We tested the effects of predation on the two species in 0.5 ha outdoor enclosures by exposing vole populations to radio-collared freely-hunting least weasels Mustela nivalis nivalis for three weeks. Lethal and non-lethal impacts of predation limited population densities of both species during and after the experimental period, but the effect was more pronounced in sibling voles in which population densities decreased markedly during the treatment period and even after that. Field vole population densities remained stable under weasel predation, while densities increased in controls. Survival in both species was lower in treatment populations compared to controls, but the effect tended to be more pronounced in sibling voles and in females of both species. The average mass of adults in both species declined in the treatment populations. These results suggest that predation by least weasels can limit vole populations locally, even during favourable summer conditions, and have extended negative effects on the dynamics of vole populations. In addition, predation alleviated interspecific competition between the vole species and is, therefore, a potential factor enabling the coexistence of them.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Biomed & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Koivisto, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",elanko@utu.fi,"Koivisto, Elina/D-8462-2016","Koivisto, Elina/0000-0002-7637-5509",,,,57,8,8,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2008,117,1,,,,,6,12,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15938.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,237PG,WOS:000251387000002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Metaphorical explanations for the decline in kereru included the loss of mana (authority and prestige) by the iwi (tribe) over the kereru and forest, and the retraction of the kereru's mauri (life force) by Tine Mahuta (God of the Forest). Interviewees reported that predation and interspecific competition with introduced species, variability in food supply, and loss of habitat were the principal biophysical mechanisms to have caused declines in kereru abundance. Long-term qualitative monitoring by Tuhoe Tuawhenua has the potential to guide the restoration of kereru and wider environmental management in Te Urewera.

The study community was composed of four top avian cliff-nesting predators: the Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos, the Bonelli's Eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus, the Eagle Owl Bubo bubo and the Peregrine Falco peregrinus. We tested the null hypothesis that their nest sites were distributed randomly within the study area, and built regression models as a function of the nearest neighbour distances (NNDs) among them. During a 15-year research period, we found a total of 560 traditional nest sites. Only those of A. chrysaetos showed regular spacing over the study area, while the distributions of the other three species did not differ significantly from random. Our modelling approach demonstrated that intraspecific NNDs were important only for the two largest species, A. chrysaetos and H. fasciatus, suggesting intraspecific territorial spacing for A. chrvsaetos, but a certain degree of spatial aggregation for H. fasciatus. In addition, the models suggested competitive interactions between these species. According to the relative importance of their interspecific NNDs, H. Asciatus appeared to be dominant over the smaller F peregrinus. Strong interspecific interactions were also suggested between B. bubo and E peregrinus. Intra-and interspecific relationships within the community followed a general pattern of dominance related to body mass. Notable exceptions were found especially for the interspecific interactions involving B. bubo, which may prey upon the other species.","[Martinez, Jose E.; Calvo, Jose F.] Univ Murcia, Dept Ecol & Hidrol, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Zuberogoitia, Inigo] Estudios Medioambientales Icarus Sl, Oficina Tecn, E-48940 Leioa, Bizkaia, Spain; [Zabala, Jabi] SEAR, Erandio 48950, Bizkaia, Spain; [Redpath, Stephen M.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland","Martinez, JE (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Ecol & Hidrol, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",ecoljemt@um.es,"Inigo, Zuberogoitia/H-5062-2019; Calvo, Jose Francisco/C-7076-2009; Zabala, Jabi/B-8157-2009; Redpath, Stephen/B-4640-2012","Calvo, Jose Francisco/0000-0002-3813-4333; Zabala, Jabi/0000-0002-1425-1594; Martinez, Jose Enrique/0000-0002-1200-5795; Redpath, Stephen/0000-0001-5399-9477",,,,74,23,27,0,35,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,2008,85,1,,,,,13,21,,,,,9,Ornithology,Zoology,323DI,WOS:000257423800003,,,,,2021-09-21,

A total of 1,710 flower heads from 38 populations were analysed for their carpel, egg and seed contents. Individual and population analyses control for the confounding influences of variation in both: (1) population traits, such as fly density and egg distribution among flower heads; and (2) individuals traits, such as carpel and egg numbers per flower head. Despite considerable variation in ecological conditions and pollinator densities across populations, large proportions (range 33-58%) of seeds are released after predation, with a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3, indicating that the mutualism is stable over the whole globeflower geographical range. The stability of the mutualistic interaction relies on density-dependent competition among larvae co-developing in a flower head. This competition is revealed by a sharp decrease in the number of seeds eaten per larva with increasing larval number, and is intensified by non-uniform egg distribution among globeflowers within a population. Carpel number is highly variable across globeflowers (range 10-69), and flies lay more eggs in large flowers.

Yet for many populations, interspecific competition, adverse weather, abandonment, nestling starvation, and egg failure may also be significant causes of nest failure. Despite the long interest in differential failure, serious challenges remain in the estimation of separate probabilities of nest failure from different causes. Apparent rates of failure suffer from at least two sources of bias: heterogeneous ages at discovery and classification error. We developed maximum-likelihood estimators for cause-specific daily probabilities of nest failure. We further show how the estimators can be extended to include classification error, if known. Finally, we demonstrate a simple application to Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus), Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), Violet-green Swallows (T. thalassina), and Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana). Daily probabilities of survival were lower for the Loggherhead Shrike (0.978 +/- 0.004) than for any of the three cavity-nesting species (range: 0.989 +/- 0.002 - 0.993 +/- 0.001). Weather was an important cause of nest failure for Loggerhead Shrikes (0.15 +/- 0.05 overall). Conversely, competition among secondary cavity-nesters was not an important contributor to nest failure (range: 2-5% of nest failures) for bluebirds or swallows. Our estimator differs from others by allowing multiple fates to be modeled as separately estimated parameters rather than as covariates to a single estimated failure probability. Thus, our estimator should be viewed as an important complement to existing methods.","US EPA, Off Res & Dev, NHEERL, Mid Continent Ecol Div, Duluth, MN 55804 USA; US EPA, Off Res & Dev, NHEERL, Western Ecol Div, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Etterson, MA (corresponding author), US EPA, Off Res & Dev, NHEERL, Mid Continent Ecol Div, 6201 Congdon Blvd, Duluth, MN 55804 USA.",etterson.matthew@epa.gov,,,,,,42,38,38,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,APR,2007,124,2,,,,,432,443,,10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[432:PRADCO]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ornithology,Zoology,169MN,WOS:000246596400006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Within mainstream ecological literature, functional structure has been viewed as resulting from the interplay of species interactions, resource levels and environmental variability. Classical models state that interspecific competition generates species segregation and guild formation in stable saturated environments, whereas opportunism causes species aggregation on abundant resources in variable unsaturated situations. 2. Nevertheless, intrinsic functional constraints may result in species-specific differences in resource-use capabilities. This could force some degree of functional structure without assuming other putative causes. However, the influence of such constraints has rarely been tested, and their relative contribution to observed patterns has not been quantified. 3. We used a multiple null-model approach to quantify the magnitude and direction (non-random aggregation or divergence) of the functional structure of a vertebrate predator assemblage exposed to variable prey abundance over an 18-year period. Observed trends were contrasted with predictions from null-models designed in an orthogonal fashion to account independently for the effects of functional constraints and opportunism. Subsequently, the unexplained variation was regressed against environmental variables to search for evidence of interspecific competition. 4. Overall, null-models accounting for functional constraints showed the best fit to the observed data, and suggested an effect of this factor in modulating predator opportunistic responses. However, regression models on residual variation indicated that such an effect was dependent on both total and relative abundance of principal (small mammals) and alternative (arthropods, birds, reptiles) prey categories. 5. In addition, no clear evidence for interspecific competition was found, but differential delays in predator functional responses could explain some of the unaccounted variation. Thus, we call for caution when interpreting empirical data in the context of classical models assuming synchronous responses of consumers to resource levels.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, CASEB, Santiago, Chile","Farias, AA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, CASEB, POB 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",afarias@bio.puc.cl,"Jaksic, Fabian M/G-1705-2014","Jaksic, Fabian M/0000-0003-0098-0291; Farias, Ariel/0000-0001-7510-2253",,,,47,14,16,0,12,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We developed a simulation model to explore the influence of aggregation on coexistence in such communities when an important assumption of previous studies - that interspecific interactions have only negative effects on the species involved - is relaxed. The model describes a community of competing insect larvae in which an interaction that is equivalent to intraguild predation (IGP) can occur, and is unusual in that it considers species exploiting very small resource patches (carrying capacity = 1). Model simulations show that, in the absence of any intraspecific aggregation, variation between species in the way that resource heterogeneity affects survival increases the likelihood of species coexistence. Simulations also show that intraspecific aggregation of the dominant competitor's eggs across resource patches can promote coexistence by reducing the importance of interspecific competition relative to that of intraspecific competition. Crucially, however, this effect is altered if one competitor indulges in IGP. In general, coexistence is only possible when the species that is capable of IGP is less effective at exploiting the shared resource than its competitor. Because it reduces the relative importance of interspecific interactions, intraspecific aggregation of the eggs of a species that is the victim of IGP actually reduces the likelihood of coexistence in parts of parameter space in which the persistence of the other species is dependent on its ability to exploit its competitor. Since resource heterogeneity, intraspecific aggregation and IGP are all common phenomena, these findings shed light on mechanisms that are likely to influence diversity in communities exploiting patchy resources.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9LT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Reader, T (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",tom.reader@nottingham.ac.uk,"Cornell, Stephen J/D-3955-2009; Reader, Tom/B-5518-2008","Reader, Tom/0000-0001-7586-8814",,,,52,4,4,0,22,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2006,115,2,,,,,321,333,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15199.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,093VQ,WOS:000241198800012,,,,,2021-09-21,

P. perna predominates in the lower mussel zone and M. galloprovincialis in the upper zone, with mixed beds where the two overlap. We examined competitive interactions between these species by translocating mussels into small plots at high densities. Treatments involved different combinations of species and densities placed in each zone. Mortality was monitored regularly and at the end of each experiment, growth and condition index were measured. The experiment was attempted three times. The first two attempts were disrupted by wave action, especially winter storms, but provided information on species-specific effects of wave action. In experiment one, wave induced mortality decreased from a mean for both species of approximately 90% on the low shore to ca. 50% on the high shore, and was 15-30% lower for P. perna than M. galloprovincialis in each zone. In experiment two, M. galloprovincialis mortality was not affected by zone (Kruskal-Wallis test, P > 0.05), but was higher than P. perna mortality in the low zone (P < 0.05). P. perna survival was significantly (P < 0.05) lower on the high than mid and low zones, apparently due to the effects of greater emersion. Condition index showed a similar pattern, being lowest in the low zone for M. galloprovincialis and in the high zone for P. perna (3-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Growth rates were fastest for both species in the low zone (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05 in both cases). The third experiment was run for 12 months in the low zone only and provided evidence of intraspecific competition for P. perna and of interspecific competition. Condition was significantly greater for P. perna in all treatments (2-way ANOVA), as was growth (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.05). Significant treatment effects indicated that P. perna had a negative effect on M. galloprovincialis survival (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05). Again wave action was important; by the end of the experiment all mussels had been removed from plots stocked only with M. galloprovincialis. Thus P. perna improves survival of M. galloprovincialis on the low shore in the short term, by providing protection against wave action, but excludes it competitively in the longer term. The results show that partial habitat segregation is likely to be a permanent feature on the south coast, with M. galloprovincialis unable to dominate the low shore due to the effects of waves and competitive exclusion by P. perna. This study is the first attempt to examine the mechanisms of interaction between invasive and indigenous marine mussel species and provides evidence of the importance of environmental conditions in the mediation of this interaction.","Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","McQuaid, CD (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",c.mcquaid@ru.ac.za,"McQuaid, Christopher/AAT-3725-2020; Rius, Marc/C-5088-2011","McQuaid, Christopher/0000-0002-3473-8308; Rius, Marc/0000-0002-2195-6605",,,,51,60,62,0,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

The variability of species combinations and membership assembly patterns in an insect pre-dispersal seed predator guild were studied at various spatial and temporal resolutions using presence/absence and abundance data in null models. The guild consists of seven beetle species (four bruchids and three curculionids) and one moth species that live on a perennial vetch, Vicia tenuifolia Roth (Leguminosae). 2. The seed predator guild varied considerably in the number of members and species combinations in space and time, and, contrary to expectations, there was no evidence of interspecific competition among guild members, supporting the view that other processes, including chance events, could contribute to guild formation. 3. It is concluded that, apart from the possibility of stochastic co-occurrence, it is the narrow host specialisation that constrains seed predator members to participate in the guild, and small differences in habitat preference can also lead to spatial and temporal variation.","Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; Hungarian Acad Sci, Dept Zool, Inst Plant Protect, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary","Szentesi, A (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",szentesi@cerberus.elte.hu,"Schmera, Denes/B-1617-2010","Schmera, Denes/0000-0003-1248-8413",,,,49,5,6,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The monthly availability of their food resources in the field, and the monthly variation in the feeding relationships between these snakes and their preys, were also studied. Food items of 1245 snakes. i.e. 554 Grayia smythii, and 691 Afronatrix anoscopus, were examined. The mean body length of Grayia smythii was significantly larger than that of Afronatrix anoscopus in any interspecific comparison, i.e. males versus males, females versus females, and females versus males; however, in both species the females attained significantly larger body sizes than the males. 676 prey items were obtained from the stomachs of Afronatrix anoscopus, and 390 from those of Grayia smythii. Both species of snake exhibited an increased activity in the open during the wet months, and this increased activity was positively correlated to the higher abundance of prey during the wet season. In both species the diet consisted of a great variety of different amphibian and fish species. Direct interference competition was not observed. The month-by-month dietary patterns exhibited by the two snake species were similar. Mean prey size was significantly larger in the larger species, and the difference in prey size between the two snake species increased during the dry season, i.e. during the period of reduced prey availability. The monthly availability of the three main food types for these snakes varied, and were significantly more abundant during the wet season (April-September). A positive relationship between prey availability and prey use by snakes strongly suggests that the two snake species are predatory generalists, utilizing prey in relation to their abundance in the field.","FIZV Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-00198 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), FIZV Ecol, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,51,33,35,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4674,1469-7831,,J TROP ECOL,J.

We present a comparative analysis based on a 30-year breeding survey of two related migratory songbird species [Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus (RW) and Great Reed Warbler A. arundinaceus (GRW)], which coexist in reedbeds by means of various interspecific interactions. The RW advanced breeding by 15 days and shortened its breeding time window, which is a combined effect of higher temperatures, alleviated competition as a consequence of population declines in the dominant GRW, and reduced RW population. Although the breeding period of GRW changed only slightly, its clutch initiation was likewise related to temperature. Most probably, advanced breeding in RW is favoured by changes in food supply and accelerated reed growth, which provides the necessary nest concealment earlier, whereas this does not affect the GRW, a species less vulnerable to nest predation. Clutch size decreased later in the season, so that earlier breeding produced a net increase in both species. An additional increase of clutch size in GRW can be explained by the use of higher-quality territories in today's smaller population. The main causes of nest losses were predation in RW and adverse weather in GRW, but reproductive success increased over the study period in both species, which was a consequence of larger clutches in RW, but of favourable weather during rearing and fewer total losses in GRW. Our results document that different causal mechanisms are involved in the reproductive changes of the two congeneric species living in the same habitat: RW breeding earlier by making use of competitive release and other ecological improvements, and GRW by benefiting from better rearing conditions.

We assessed this hypothesis by examining morphological diversity within stickleback populations in 40 undisturbed lakes from six islands off the mid-coast of British Columbia, Canada. Because larger lakes with well-developed littoral and limnetic zones will have greater trophic niche diversity than smaller lakes with only littoral zones, we predicted a positive association between lake size and variation in trophic morphology. Conversely, reduced vertebrate predation in small bog lakes allows increased variance in defensive structures without costs to fitness. Consistent with both predictions, we observed that phenotypic variance in two traits that are involved in feeding (gape width and pectoral fin length) increased with lake size while variability in defence structures (lateral plate number and dorsal spine length) was inversely related to lake size. Moreover, increased variance in defence morphology was accentuated in populations with severe armour reduction (spine loss, decreased plate overlap), another strong indicator of reduced vertebrate predation. In the majority of cases, these patterns were repeatable among islands, independent from the geographical distance between lakes, and arose from a combination of high variance within each of the sexes and increases in sexual dimorphism. These findings suggest that character release can be trait-specific and reflect the combined effects of competition, predation and habitat heterogeneity.

Influence of UV-B on plant competition can be studied using a variety of experimental and analytical approaches including inverse yield-density models and allometric, neighborhood or size-structure analyses that provide links between plant and ecosystem responses. These approaches differ in their abilities to extract information regarding competitive interactions and their morphological underpinnings. Only a limited number of studies have been carried out to investigate UV-B effects on plant competition, and most of these have used the replacement series approach, which has received much criticism. Nonetheless, results to date indicate that slight differences in UV-B-induced morphological responses of species grown within associations can alter canopy structure thereby influencing photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception and relative competitive ability. Because the response of individuals of the same species is expected to be uniform, UV-B may influence intraspecific competition less than interspecific competition. Before we can make clear generalizations and predictions concerning the effects of this radiation on plant competition, an understanding is crucial of the mechanisms underlying UV-B-induced shifts in competitive interactions by assessing competition over time.","Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Ctr Plant Res, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Jolliffe, PA (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Ctr Plant Res, 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",pjoll@interchange.ubc.ca,,,,,,177,5,5,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-8655,1751-1097,,PHOTOCHEM PHOTOBIOL,Photochem.

Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is to manipulate predator movement using semiochemicals. However, selective manipulation is impeded by attraction of both predators and pests to bark beetle pheromones. 2 The primary bark beetle affecting pine plantations in Wisconsin, U.S.A., is the pine engraver, Ips pini (Say). Other herbivores include Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) and Dryophthorus americanus Bedel (Curculionidae). The predominant predators are the beetles Thanasimus dubius (Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Histeridae). 3 We conducted field assays using two enantiomeric ratios of ipsdienol, and frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Ipsdienol is the principal pheromone component of L pini, and frontalin is produced by a number of Dendroctonus species. alpha-Pinene is a host monoterpene commonly incorporated into commercial frontalin lures. 4 Thanasimus dubius was attracted to frontalin plus alpha-pinene, and also to racemic ipsdienol. By contrast, I. pini was attracted to racemic ipsdienol, but showed no attraction to frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Platysoma cylindrica was attracted to 97%-(-)-ipsdienol and, to a lesser extent, racemic ipsdienol, but not to frontalin plus alpha-pinene. Ips grandicollis was attracted to frontalin plus alpha-pinene but not to ipsdienol. Dryophthorus americanus was attracted to both ipsdienol and frontalin plus alpha-pinene. 5 This ability to selectively attract the predator T. dubius without attracting the principal bark beetle in the system, L pini, provides new opportunities for research into augmentative biological control and basic population dynamics. Moreover, the attraction of T. dubius, but not P. cylindrica, to frontalin plus alpha-pinene creates opportunities for selective manipulation of just one predator. 6 Patterns of attraction by predators and bark beetles to these compounds appear to reflect various degrees of geographical and host tree overlap with several pheromone-producing species.","Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Biometry Program, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Aukema, BH (corresponding author), Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Pacific Forestry Ctr, 506 W Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.",baukema@pfc.forestry.ca,,,,,,88,18,20,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-9555,1461-9563,,AGR FOREST ENTOMOL,Agric.

The species are relatively large beetles, which are irregularly distributed throughout much of the highly and areas of Southwestern United States and Mexico. The tribe is composed of three monophyletic genera: Asbolus LeConte, Cryptoglossa Solier, and Schizillus Horn. Adult external and internal reproductive structures of the tribe are described and illustrated. Immature stages are described for Cryptoglossa muricata (LeConte), Cryptoglossa infausta (LeConte), Cryptoglossa asperata (Horn), Cryptoglossa spiculifera LeConte, Cryptoglossa variolosa (Horn), Asbolus verrucosus LeConte, Asbolus laevis LeConte, Asbolus mexicanus (Champion), Schizillus laticeps Horn, and Schizillus nunenmacheri Blaisdell. Keys are provided for the adult genera and species and for the known immature stages. A new subspecies, Cryptoglossa seriata cerralvoensis, is described from Mexico. Centrioptera Mannerheim is placed as a synonym of Cryptoglossa Solier. Asbolus LeConte is reinstated to replace Cryptoglossa (in part). Eschatoporis Blaisdell is removed to the Laenini (Lagriinae). A phylogeny, based on 50 adult and immature characters is proposed established on cladistic methodology. Phylogenetic relationships and systematic position of the subfamily, tribe, genera and species are examined. The biology of the species is discussed including ecological, morphological, and physiological adaptations to aridity. Ecological adaptations include strategies to acclimate to extreme environmental conditions: surface/subsurface daily and seasonal activity patterns, cavity utilization, substrate preference/restrictions (C. muricata, A. verrucosus, S. laticeps), euryphagous feeding habits, avoidance of interspecific competition. Adult and immature morphological adaptations include locomotory modifications relative to substrate utilization (i.e. larval madibular expansion in all Cryptoglossini) and heat avoidance modifications (i.e. subelytral/subpronotal cavities in A. verrucosus, A. laevis and A. papillosus. Physiological adaptations include high heat and wide humidity range tolerance (C. muricata and A. verrucosus), epicuticular lipids with high rations of straight-chain hydrocarbons (C. variolosa and A. verrucosus), long larval and adult life spans (seven years recorded for A. verrucosus). Specialized environmental adaptations include psammophily (A. verrucosus, A. papillosus and A. laevis, being respectively more adapted to psammophily, the last two restricted to sand dunes) and troglophily (S. nunenmacheri and A. mexicanus). Ecological importance (biomass) and economic importance of species is discussed. Predators and parasites of the Cryptoglossini are addressed. Catagoniopsis specularis (Aldrich and Weber), (Tachinidae) is recorded reared from both A. verrucosus and A. laevis. Defensive behavioral strategies include escape to shelters (Cryptoglossa), death feigning (all Cryptoglossa observed except C. asperata; most developed in Asbolus) and head standing (most immediate defense in all Cryptoglossa observed, absent in Asbolus and Schizillus except A. laevis).","Calif Acad Sci, Dept Entomol, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA","Aalbu, RL (corresponding author), Calif Acad Sci, Dept Entomol, 875 Howard St, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA.",,,,,,,121,11,11,2,24,MUSEUM & INST ZOOLOGY PAS-POLISH ACAD SCIENCES,WARSAW,"WILCZA STREET 64, 00-679 WARSAW, POLAND",0003-4541,1734-1833,,ANN ZOOL,Ann.

Nevertheless intense battles amongst sessile organisms for space are commonplace on hard substrata, mainly between fast-growing pioneer species. In this study we examined spatial interactions in encrusting species at 3 sites within each of 2 high Arctic localities, Horsund-fjord (77 degreesN) and Kongsfjord (79 degreesN) in Spitsbergen, and 2 Antarctic localities, Signy Island (60 degreesS) and Adelaide Island (68 degreesS). In both polar regions 1 to 11% of encrusting fauna were involved in intraspecific interactions. Intraspecific competition was common; it usually involved just 1 or 2 pioneer species, mainly ended in tied outcomes, and most variability was at a local scale. The proportion of intraspecific encounters varied considerably at local (km) scales (19 to 99% intraspecific at different sites), reflecting an extremely patchy environment due to ice scour. Most intraspecific encounters resulted in ties (stand-offs) and again most variability was at a local scale. Many intraspecific encounters were constructive, forming large (>1 m(3)) foliaceous colonies (termed bioconstructions) whose 3D structures can harbour rich biotas. In other colonies intraspecific competition caused crowding and accelerated ovicell production (reproductive activity). Homosyndrome (fusion) was not observed in the Arctic and was rare in the Antarctic, where its frequency differed significantly between competitor identities. We found that the likelihood of meeting conspecifics versus other species and of tied outcomes in encounters was related to the performance of species in interspecific competition: ties were most common, and homosyndrome only occurred in poor competitors. In the context of rapid Arctic and west Antarctic warming and ice-loading of nearshore waters, we predict strongly changing patterns of intraspecific competition. Indeed we suggest that decreased patchiness of intraversus interspecific competition and decreased levels of intraspecific competition should be strong indicators of increases in surface water ice-loading from ice-sheet collapses.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Marine Ecol Dept, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",dkab@bas.ac.uk,,,,,,67,10,10,0,19,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Valdes, Argentina). 2. Intrinsic hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypothesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant seal populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival.","Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia; Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Mammal Res Inst, ZA-0002 Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa; Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Antarctic Wildlife Res Unit, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Charles Darwin Univ, Key Ctr Trop Wildlife Management, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia","McMahon, CR (corresponding author), Univ Coll Swansea, Sch Biol Sci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",C.R.McMahon@swansea.ac.uk,"Hindell, Mark A/C-8368-2013; Bester, Marthan N/E-5387-2010; Hindell, Mark A/K-1131-2013; McMahon, Clive R/D-5713-2013; Bradshaw, Corey J.A./A-1311-2008","McMahon, Clive R/0000-0001-5241-8917; Bradshaw, Corey J.A./0000-0002-5328-7741; Hindell, Mark/0000-0002-7823-7185",,,,129,104,107,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,JAN,2005,35,1,,,,,82,100,,10.1111/j.1365-2907.2005.00055.x,,,19,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,889VM,WOS:000226470900004,,,,,2021-09-21,

According to model predictions, regeneration of most Nothofagus species is dependent on coarse-scale disturbance at favorable sites where shade-tolerant rain forest species co-occur. In contrast, at suboptimal sites where tree species richness is low, regeneration is not dependent on coarse-scale disturbance. We used variation in forest composition and structure as well as disturbance patterns in the forests of Puyehue National Park, Chile, to test several predictions from this general model. The study area presents a complex mosaic of disturbance patterns, including the effects of the strong 1960 earthquake as well as fire and wind disturbance. We reconstructed stand development on sites affected by these disturbances, and compared these patterns with the structure of old-growth forests along an elevation gradient from species-rich montane rain forest to monotypic subalpine Nothofagus forests. Tree age data indicate that both the Nothofagus and many of the rain forest tree species are long-lived, often reaching ages greater than 600 years. Regeneration of Nothofagus was abundant in stands recently disturbed by landslides, fire, or blowdown across the entire elevation gradient, and Nothofagus also regenerated in old-growth high-elevation forests. In contrast, regeneration of Nothofagus was scarce or absent in undisturbed stands and at lower elevation. In comparison with the rain forest species, Nothofagus species are more tolerant of the unfavorable site conditions associated with increasing elevation. Thus, there is a gradient of decreasing interspecific tree competition with increasing elevation, so that the dependence of regeneration of Nothofagus on coarse-scale disturbance is much less at higher elevation. This study confirms that changes in forest composition may be explained by simple processes occurring in accordance with the main predictions of the general model of Nothofagus forest dynamics: At low elevations, coarse-scale disturbance is required for Nothofagus regeneration; at higher elevations under decreasing competition the regeneration of Nothofagus is less dependent on coarse-scale disturbance. Thus, for the Puyehue landscape, patterns of forest structure and disturbance history are congruent with the major features of the general model of Nothofagus dynamics.","Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Pollmann, W (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Campus Box 260, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",pollmann@colorado.edu,"Veblen, Thomas T./U-6461-2018",,,,,59,46,47,1,20,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9615,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

While we have a good understanding of how trait changes affect predation risk, we lack a mechanistic understanding of why predator-induced phenotypes differ in growth. Using two mesocosm experiments, we combined phenotypic plasticity theory with predictions from optimal digestion theory to demonstrate that intra- and interspecific competition induced relatively long guts while predators induced relatively short guts. The longer guts induced by competition appear to be an adaptive response that allows more efficient digestion and more rapid growth whereas the shorter guts induced by predators appear to result from a tradeoff of building larger tails in predator environments at the cost of smaller bodies. By combining these two bodies of theory, we now have a much better understanding of the mechanisms that cause the phenotypic trade-offs that select for inducible defences.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea@pitt.edu,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014",,,,,47,123,125,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Such nonlethal predator effects have been abundantly demonstrated empirically in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. But the extent to which changes in species traits alter short-term responses such as growth rate or probability of survival is not clear. Here we develop models to examine the nonlethal effects of predators on prey growth. Our analyses illustrate how the nonlethal effects of predators on individual prey growth depend on environmental context; e.g., factors such as focal species density, competitor density, resource dynamics, and the timescale over which the interactions occur. This context dependence arises because of complex interactions of three mechanisms; (1) the direct negative effect of induced reduction in foraging rates, which is opposed by (2) the potential positive effects of reductions in intra- and interspecific competition, and (3) resource responses to reduced foraging.

The mink is an extremely adaptable, generalist predator. Over two continents, the American mink is associated with problems in the conservation of local species because of their impact on both prey and competitors. Here, we review the impact of American mink on native species, stemming from over a decade of research, and concentrate on two examples: the impact of American mink on the water vole in Britain and on the European mink in Eastern Europe. While the near extinction of the water vole in Britain and that of the European mink in Eastern Europe are largely due to predation and interspecific aggression, respectively, both may have been affected by a multitude of factors acting synergistically. Terns, and other seabirds, are impacted by mink predation; the effect on riparian bird species is less clear but may potentially be high. Emerging principles, supported by preliminary evidence, suggest that the return of the larger otter in the United Kingdom may be detrimental to mink populations. The impact of, or on, the current recovery of the polecat in the United Kingdom is unknown but evidence from Eastern Europe suggests that American mink negatively affect at least female polecats. We conclude by briefly presenting two case studies of small-scale mink removal and discuss considerations for future control projects. To mitigate mink impact on a larger scale we suggest a holistic approach, involving mink removal, habitat restoration, and recovery of native competitors.","Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Macdonald, DW (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",,,,,,,144,119,126,2,82,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4223,1175-8821,,NEW ZEAL J ZOOL,N.

A previous study compared the functional responses to their prey and intraspecific interference in mature larvae of Perlodes microcephalus, Isoperla grammatica, Dinocras cephalotes and Perla bipunctata. The present study extends this work by assessing interspecific interference between pairs of these species in equal numbers (one, two or three larvae per species) to provide total predator densities of two, four or six larvae. Baetis larvae as prey were replaced as they were eaten, and their density per predator was varied between 20 and 200 larvae. 2. The number of prey eaten by each competing species increased curvilinearly with prey density, the relationship being well described by a Type II model. Of the two constants in the model, handling time varied considerably between species, mean values being shortest for Perlodes, slightly higher for Isoperla, and much higher for Dinocras and Perla. It was not affected significantly either by predator density or the identity of the competing species. 3. Attack rate also varied between species and decreased with predator density. This decrease was slight for Perlodes, and also for Dinocras and Perla in competition with Isoperla. The decrease in Dinocras and Perla was similar to that for intraspecific interference. 4. The decrease in attack rate was described by a convex curve for Perlodes with the other three species and for Dinocras/Perla with Isoperla, but by a concave curve (negative power function) for Isoperla competing with the other three species, and for both Dinocras and Perla in competition with Perlodes. Prey consumption also decreased with predator density, the severity of competition with different species reflecting that for attack rate. 5. A comparison with previous results for intraspecific interference showed that the latter was dominant for Perlodes in all contests and for Dinocras or Perla competing with Isoperla, whilst interspecific interference dominated for Isoperla in all contests and for Dinocras and Perla competing with Perlodes. Both types of interference were applicable to competition between Dinocras and Perla. Isoperla was the least, and Perlodes the most, aggressive of the four species with Dinocras and Perla intermediate.","Freshwater Biol Assoc, Ambleside LA22 0LP, Cumbria, England","Elliott, JM (corresponding author), Freshwater Biol Assoc, Ambleside LA22 0LP, Cumbria, England.",,,,,,,34,20,21,0,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

I used various univariate and multivariate statistics, which are based on 6 variables, to test several hypotheses that are based upon the finding that canine dimorphism is strongly associated with intermale competition in platyrrhines (Kay et al., 1988), Greenfield (1992a), Plavcan and van Schaik (1992, 1994). Results from the indices of canine dimorphism and the unpaired t-tests corroborate the prediction that males of each species possess significantly larger canines than those of females Large male canines are especially prominent in 2 variables, maxillary and mandibular canine height. Greene's t-test (1989) does not support the prediction that Cebus apella and C. olivaceus possess a larger degree of canine dimorphism relative to C. albifrons and C. capucinus. No interspecific differences in degree of canine dimorphism are indicated by this test. Results of the discriminant function analyses (DFA) do not find that Cebus apella and C. olivaceus possess different canine form relative to C. albifrons and C. capucinus as predicted. However, Cebus apella is differentiated from the untufted capuchins (C. albifrons, C. capucinus, and C. olivaceus) by the DFA. I suggest that intermale competition is the primary selective force underlying the observed morphological patterns; however, it does not explain all the variation associated with canine dimorphism in Cebus.","Cent Michigan Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA","Masterson, TJ (corresponding author), Cent Michigan Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",,,,,,,49,2,2,0,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC/PLENUM PUBL,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0164-0291,,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

Even though this type of indirect interaction has received significant theoretical and empirical attention, alternative mechanisms producing similar results have not been considered in the literature. In this paper we document the results of a series of microcosm experiments aimed to evaluate the importance of the generalist consumer Daphnia ambigua upon the relative abundance of the more specialized Moina micrura and Ceriodaphnia dubia (Cladocera). We compared the population parameters of M. micrura and C. dubia when alone, in coexistence, and in the presence and absence of D. ambigua. While M. micrura and C. dubia did not show evidence for interspecific competition, the addition of D. ambigua promoted a reduction in the maximal population density of M. micrura, causing a pattern of indirect competition with C. dubia that resembles predator-mediated apparent competition. This result suggests that non-predatory interactions need to be considered as a potential source of apparent interactions in natural communities.","Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile","Martinez, G (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Casilla 653, Santiago, Chile.",gingerma@ing.uchile.cl,,"Medel, Rodrigo/0000-0001-9955-764X",,,,36,4,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2002,97,1,,,,,111,115,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970111.x,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,559JC,WOS:000176022200011,,,,,2021-09-21,

There is a substantial overlap in the hosts of the parasitoids, and every species has been collected from fruit flies attacked by at least one or two other species. The ovipositors of these braconids have a broad interspecific range of lengths, some are less than the length of the abdomen, and others, several times the length of the abdomen. The following three hypotheses are proposed to account for this variety of lengths: (1) Because of differences in the host stage attacked, there are differences in host vulnerability; i.e., mature host larvae feed at greater depths within fruit pulp and can be best reached with a longer ovipositor. There is an implication that competition among the wasp species has selected for foraging on different host stages and that this diversifying selection has resulted in different ovipositor lengths. (2) Although longer ovipositors increase host range and thus have competitive advantages, they may be heavy, awkward, and expensive to move around. If so, species with longer ovipositors might have to invest more in locomotion (reflected in wing size) and less in reproductive capacity (numbers of mature eggs held in the ovarial calyx), Balancing selection would then maintain both short ovipositor-small winged-high fecundity species and long ovipositor-large wing-low fecundity species. (3) Although there are niche overlaps among the species, each has a core environment determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, seasonality, and host diversity. Ovipositor lengths have evolved to met the requirements of these specialized environments, and are not due to interspecific competition mediated by ovipositor length; i.e,, there has been no diversifying or balancing selection for differences in ovipositor length. Hypothesis number I fails because all the species attack similar host stages. Neither was there support for hypothesis number 2. There were no correlations between wing size, or potential fecundity, and ovipositor length. The lack of correlation between species-pairs niche overlaps and differences in species-pairs relative ovipositor length is most consistent with hypothesis number 3. That is, because species with similar ovipositors are neither more or less likely I P to co-occur in the same samples from various fruits and locations than species with different ovipositor lengths it may be that species interactions are unimportant in the evolution of ovipositor lengths. If so, the lack of a pattern of competition made easily recognizable by differences in ovipositor length could influence biological control tactics. For example, if it is difficult to predict the abilities of newly introduced species to integrate in the existing guild of natural enemies, it may be more prudent over the short term to concentrate on the conservation of the natural enemies already present rather than pursue the classical introductions of new species.","USDA ARS, Ctr Med Agr & Vet Entomol, Gainesville, FL 32604 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Inst Ecol, Xalapa 91000, Veracruz, Mexico","Sivinski, J (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Ctr Med Agr & Vet Entomol, POB 14565, Gainesville, FL 32604 USA.",,"Aluja, Martin/Q-6810-2018","Aluja, Martin/0000-0002-2936-3011",,,,31,76,78,2,10,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0013-8746,,,ANN ENTOMOL SOC AM,Ann.

However, diets of the two predators differed in the relative contributions of small and large prey, with bobcats consuming relatively more rodent and lagomorph biomass and coyotes consuming relatively more ungulate biomass, Consumption among rodent prey species was highly correlated between bobcats and coyotes, indicating no evidence of prey partitioning within this group, Habitat selection by the two predators differed slightly at the landscape scale but not within home ranges, Bobcats and coyotes occupied small, overlapping home ranges, such that the likelihood of interspecific encounters (direct or indirect) was high, Bobcats displayed slight avoidance of overlapping coyote core areas during coyote reproductive seasons (winter and spring), when coyotes are typically most territorial (toward conspecifics), but displayed slight attraction during times of year when coyotes were not engaged in reproductive activities. Relative to coyotes, which were strongly nocturnal, diel activity patterns of bobcats were more diurnal and variable. However, activity patterns were not inversely correlated, Overall, these predators appeared to use resources independently and we found little evidence of negative interactions, Differences in resource use by bobcats and coyotes appeared to relate to fundamental niche differences as opposed to competition-related resource partitioning.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Neale, JCC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Toxicol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jcneale@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,78,70,73,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2001,94,2,,,,,236,249,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.940204.x,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,475PM,WOS:000171173200004,,,,,2021-09-21,

Our previous studies reveal that lizard parasites (ectoparasitic mites and ticks, and the endoparasite Plasmodium) do not set Liolaemus altitudinal limits. Thermal tolerances do not appear to limit altitudinal distributions, although cold ambient temperatures dictate that only live-bearing species can occur above 2,400 m elevation. Three Liolaemus species specialize on elevationally restricted microhabitats. Liolaemus tenuis is found exclusively in or at the base of trees, which are typically below 1,800 m. Liolaemus leopardinus specializes on large rocky outcrops found at high altitudes. Liolaemus monticola uses smaller rocks: oviparity set its upper distributional limit on two transects, but on one transect this lizard and its rocky habitat virtually disappeared above 1,500 m. Interspecific competition among Liolaemus appeared unrelated to elevational distribution. We found no instances of parapatric distributions among pairs of Liolaemus species having similar niche requirements. Other researchers have found that predation does not correlate with elevation: its role in determining lizard species distributions depends on both predator and prey identities. We conclude that factors setting distributional limits of Liolaemus species vary depending on individual circumstances in time and space: where physiology may be relevant on one transect, preferred microhabitat availability may be important in another.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Carothers, JH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Marquet, Pablo A/B-7732-2009; Jaksic, Fabian M/G-1705-2014","Marquet, Pablo A/0000-0001-6369-9339; Jaksic, Fabian M/0000-0003-0098-0291",,,,10,8,9,0,10,SOCIEDAD BIOLGIA CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 16164, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

Local guilds have historically been a major focus of community ecology; however, studies of local guilds rarely measure consequences of coexistence for fitness-related traits or test predictions of alternative hypotheses for how species may interact. We studied consequences of coexistence for Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata) and Virginia's Warblers (V. virginiae), which have overlapping breeding territories in central Arizona. We used reciprocal removal experiments to examine (1) whether coexistence results in ecological consequences with respect to access to nest sites, access to food resources, nest predation, and adult female predation, and (2) whether ecological consequences result in fitness consequences with respect to reproductive success (clutch size, number of young fledged per nest), or adult female survival (within a breeding season). When we removed Virginia's Warblers, Orange-crowned Warblers experienced reduced nest predation rates compared with control plots where Virginia's Warblers were present. When we removed Orange-crowned Warblers, Virginia's Warblers (1) shifted their nest sites to sites indistinguishable from Orange-crowned Warbler nest sites, (2) increased feeding rates during both the incubation and nest:ling periods, and (3) suffered reduced nest predation rates, compared with control plots where Orange-crowned Warblers were present. When the two species coexist, increased nest predation rates for both species appear to result from density-dependent functional shifts in nest predator behavior (short-term apparent competition). Reduced access to preferred nest sites for Virginia's Warblers coexisting with Orange-crowned Warblers appears to result from both Orange-crowned Warbler interference during nest site selection and building periods, and from Orange-crowned Warbler preemption of nest sites preferred by both species. The mechanisms whereby Orange-crowned Warblers may reduce access to food resources for coexisting Virginia's Warblers, however, are not yet fully understood. Both. Orange-crowned and Virginia's Warblers fledged between 78% and 129% more young per nest on plots where the opposite species had been removed, indicating that both species suffer substantial fitness costs of coexistence. Overall, results illustrate that (I) Orange-crowned and Virginia's Warblers do not coexist independently of each other, (2) interactions between the two species are complex and asymmetrical, (3) interactions between the two species result in substantial fitness costs of coexistence for both species, and (4) ecological interactions between the two species extend far beyond competition for food resources which has dominated studies of terrestrial vertebrate communities.","Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Avian Studies Program, US Geol Survey,Biol Resources Div, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Avian Studies Program, US Geol Survey,Biol Resources Div, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867",,,,89,121,128,0,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2001,82,1,,,,,189,206,,10.2307/2680096,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393UN,WOS:000166488200016,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

The effect of a piscivore, the smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), on intraspecific and interspecific interactions involving crayfish (Crustacea: Cambaridae: Cambarus longulus) and hellgrammites (Insecta: Megaloptera: Corydalus cornutus) was examined. Three possible interactions were recognized in all experiments: (1) the refuge occupant was evicted by an intruder; (2) the refuge occupant excluded the intruder from the refuge; (3) the occupant and the intruder shared the refuge. The size of both crayfish and hellgrammites had a statistically significant effect on the outcome of interspecific and intraspecific interactions, larger individuals being more successful at excluding or evicting smaller individuals from a refuge. The effect of size on the interactions, however, was tempered by the effects of prior occupancy of the refuge (owner-intruder models), allowing smaller individuals of both species to maintain occupancy of the refuge when faced with a larger intruder in about one-third of all trials. There was no significant effect of gender on the outcome of interactions between male and female crayfish. The presence of a fish (Micropterus dolomieu) significantly altered the outcome of interspecific and intraspecific interactions. Not only were both species more likely to gain access to the refuge as an intruder, but the occupant was less likely to be evicted, resulting in a greatly increased incidence of sharing of the refuge in the presence of the fish. Refuge sharing by crayfish never occurred unless a fish was present.

Limited availability of surface seeds fords some birds to scratch for seeds buried beneath soil, snow, or litter. Artificial seed trays were used to test the ability of five different sparrow species to extract seeds buried at different depths in soil. The results suggest three functional groups based on relative scratching ability. Strong scratchers, which included eastern towhee and song and white-throated sparrows. mel or exceeded their energetic requirements when foraging on seeds buried at ail depths (down to a maximum depth of 1.50-2.25 cm). A weak scratching species, Savannah sparrow, scratched with the same frequency as the strong scratchers, but experienced negative energy budgets when forced to forage on sub-surface seeds. Finally, a non-scratching species, field sparrow, failed to extract any buried seeds. Level of scratching ability may influence foraging efficiency at low resource densities. As a result, interspecific differences in scratching ability may contribute to habitat selection. Strong scratchers may be adapted to foraging near woody vegetation where intense resource competition and abundant litter limit the availability of surface seeds. Weak scratchers, on the other hand, may be forced to feed away from areas where surface seeds are limited. Since woody vegetation serves as a primary source of protective cover in early successional habitats, a tradeoff between foraging efficiency and the risk of predation may promote the local coexistence of species that differ in relative scratching ability and adaptations to evading predators.","Coll William & Mary, Ctr Conservat Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA","Whalen, DM (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",dwhalen@sevilleta.unm.edu,,,,,,63,6,7,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2000,88,3,,,,,574,584,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880314.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,292UK,WOS:000085813300014,,,,,2021-09-21,

Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Chesson, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",PLChesson@UCDavis.edu,,,,,,142,3538,3688,85,2170,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4162,,,ANNU REV ECOL SYST,Annu.

How so many species can coexist is still unknown. 2, Adult males of the majority of these species hold permanent territories which form dense multispecies mosaics across the shores. 3. The study examined six coexisting species of cichlids from the rocky habitat where males are known to control access to the algal food resources within their territorial space. These included four sibling species of the Pseudotropheus (Tropheops) species complex, which are specialized epilithic algal herbivores, and two sibling species of the trophically more generalist P. (Maylandia) species complex which feed upon both epilithic algae and plankton. 4. The hypotheses that both intraspecific and interspecific territoriality occur in these communities and that interspecific aggression initiated by territorial males is preferentially directed at species with the most similar diets to their own were tested. 5. It was found that males preferred to exclude conspecific intruders, while they tolerated intruders with different diets to their own. Also, male P. (Tropheops) preferentially excluded similar heterospecific dietary specialists, while male P. (Maylandia) tolerated similar heterospecific dietary generalists. 6. Based on this study, it is proposed that interspecific territoriality may be reducing competition between species with different diets and promoting their coexistence, while it may be enhancing competition between species with the same diet. Furthermore, it suggests that ecological generalism may be reducing the intensity of interspecific competition, while specializations for the same resources may be increasing competition.","Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England","Genner, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Sch Biol Sci, Bassett Crescent, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England.",,,"Turner, George/0000-0003-0099-7261",,,,29,48,49,0,17,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Based on the pattern of species range boundaries and abundances along the primary forest elevational gradient, ranging from 900 to 2000 m, the relative importance of interspecific competition and ecotones in structuring the assemblage was assessed. Tests were run for (1) all species, (2) amphibians, (3) reptiles, (4) amphibians dependent on streams for reproduction, and (5) amphibians that do not use streams for reproduction. For three null models, the observed patterns did not differ from random expectations. The results indicated that there are very few species whose gradient distributions may be limited by interspecific competition between congeners. Significant discontinuities in abundance patterns and range boundary dispersion revealed zonations in all subsets analyzed but neither indicated distinct species groups with sharp exclusion boundaries nor a strong response to vegetational ecotones. Physical factors varying in parallel with the gradient and specific habitat components, particularly water bodies suitable as amphibian breeding sites, are suggested to be the dominant factors limiting gradient distributions of amphibians and reptiles on Mount Kupe. The zonations revealed suggest a pattern of three spatially nonexclusive species groups: physical factors separate distinct lowland and montane species limited by physiological constraints and produce faunal discontinuities in the lower sub-montane forest around 1300 m; this boundary is encompassed by the range of a group of anuran species, whose distributions on the gradient are centered at intermediate elevation and appear to be limited by specific habitat requirements. The response to predominantly abiotic factors suggests a basic difference from endotherms, where biotic factors seem to be of major importance in limiting elevational distributions.","Nat Hist Museum, Dept Vertebrates, CH-3005 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Neuchatel, Inst Zool, CH-2007 Neuchatel, Switzerland; Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada","Hofer, U (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Vertebrates, Bernastr 15, CH-3005 Bern, Switzerland.",,"Bersier, Louis-Felix/G-8018-2011; Borcard, Daniel/J-6759-2019","Bersier, Louis-Felix/0000-0001-9552-8032; ",,,,59,55,63,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1999,80,3,,,,,976,988,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0976:SOOAHO]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,228UP,WOS:000082154300019,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

We sampled 40 aquatic sites monthly during 2.5 years for tadpoles, predators, and physiochemical characteristics. Most tadpole species showed temporal overlap but spatial segregation and low density, suggesting that interspecific competition among tadpoles is not presently important in this system. Invertebrate predators coexisted with more tadpole species than did fishes, suggesting that predation by fishes strongly influences the composition of tadpole assemblages. Ordination techniques were used to reduce dimensionality to simple vectors, which were then used in multiple regression analyses to search for key factors associated with tadpole assemblage structure. Although species composition was not directly related to abi otic characteristics, path analysis showed that the size and degree of permanence of the water body may indirectly influence species composition by altering predator composition. Tadpole species richness in a water body was not significantly related to abiotic factors or predators. However, predators were the main factor influencing tadpole assemblage composition. Most previous studies on tadpole community dynamics suggested that predators affect alpha (within habitat) diversity, but they did not consider beta diversity (among habitats). Our results showed that predators influenced beta diversity but had little or no effect on variation in alpha diversity.","Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, BR-69011970 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Azevedo-Ramos, C (corresponding author), Fed Univ Para, Ctr Filosofia & Ciencias Humanas, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil.",cramos@amazon.com.br,"Magnusson, William E/J-9408-2014; Bayliss, Peter/A-1928-2012","Magnusson, William E/0000-0003-1988-3950; Bayliss, Peter/0000-0001-5754-631X",,,,53,47,54,0,22,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 5,1999,,1,,,,,22,33,,10.2307/1447381,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,167TY,WOS:000078650400003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Therefore, herbivore densities will not only be determined by direct predator-prey interactions and direct and indirect defence of plants against herbivores, but also by other direct and indirect interactions such as apparent competition, intraguild predation, resource competition, etc. Although these interactions have received considerable attention in theory and experiments, little is known about their impact on biological control. In this paper, we first present a review of indirect food web interactions in biological control systems. We propose to distinguish between numerical indirect interactions, which are interactions where one species affects densities of another species through an effect on the numbers of an intermediate species and functional indirect interactions, defined as changes in the way that two species interact through the presence of a third species. It is argued that functional indirect interactions are important in food webs and deserve more attention. Subsequently, we discuss experimental results on interactions in an artificial food web consisting of pests and natural enemies on greenhouse cucumber. The two pest species are the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. Their natural enemies are the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, which is commonly used for spider mite control and the predatory mites Neoseiulus cucumeris and Iphiseius degenerans and the predatory bug Orius laevigatus, all natural enemies of thrips. First, we analyse the possible interactions between these seven species and we continue by discussing how functional indirect interactions, particularly the behaviour of arthropods, may change the significance and impact of direct interactions and numerical indirect interactions. It was found that a simple food web of only four species already gives rise to some quite complicated combinations of interactions. Spider mites and thrips interact indirectly through resource competition, but thrips larvae are intraguild predators of spider mites. Some of the natural enemies used for control of the two herbivore species are also intraguild predators. Moreover, spider mites produce a web that is subsequently used by thrips to hide from their predators. We discuss these and other results obtained so far and we conclude with a discussion of the potential impact of functional indirect and direct interactions on food webs and their significance for biological control.

Environmental factors facilitating early growth and survival of shad plus potential interspecific competition for zooplankton may reduce growth and survival of YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), another common species in reservoirs. We hypothesized that fewer YOY bluegill moving from the limnetic zone to the littoral zone in late spring probably slows or prevents the ontogenetic switch to piscivory by YOY largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), reducing their oversummer growth, overwinter survival, and hence recruitment to their second year. To determine whether shad and bluegill abundances indeed vary inversely in reservoirs, we quantified densities of YOY shad and bluegill in four reservoirs across several years (1987-1994; N = 22 reservoir-years). To assess how YOY bluegill abundance influenced the ontogenetic dietary switch to fish by largemouth bass, we conducted experiments with differing levels of realism and control (4-m(2) littoral cages, 4.5-m(2) outdoor pools, and 0.33-m(2) laboratory aquaria). In reservoirs, peak YOY bluegill density declined weakly in the limnetic zone but strongly in the littoral zone when peak limnetic YOY Dorosoma spp. exceeded 10 individuals/m(3). In pools and aquaria, largemouth bass grew more rapidly at greater than or equal to 3 than at zero bluegill per largemouth bass. Using known temperatures and largemouth bass growth in a bioenergetics model, we discovered that YOY largemouth bass in pools and aquaria ate less than or equal to 65% of their maximum daily consumption potential (in grams of wet mass) at greater than or equal to 6 bluegill per largemouth bass. In cages, largemouth bass consumed only 40% of their maximum and grew less at bluegill abundances similar to those in pools and aquaria, probably because dense vegetation and depletion of bluegill inhibited predatory success. In reservoirs with abundant shad, reduced littoral bluegill density likely compromises first-year growth and recruitment of largemouth bass. However, variable abiotic and biotic factors may modify YOY bluegill abundance and hence invalidate our predictions for largemouth bass recruitment success. To better predict fish community structure and develop management actions for reservoir ecosystems, multi-scale experimentation should be combined with whole-system manipulations (e.g., via adaptive management) to bound these variable interactions.","Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Zool, Columbus, OH 43212 USA","Garvey, JE (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Zool, 1314 Kinnear Rd, Columbus, OH 43212 USA.",,"Garvey, James/AAO-5698-2021; Garvey, Jim/A-4919-2012","Garvey, Jim/0000-0001-5393-9351",,,,116,42,44,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In the Salt River, in western Kentucky, U. S. A., pulmonates were fairly common in headwater streams, and were replaced in larger order tributaries by prosobranch snails. The literature suggests that pulmonates have tolerance and capacity adaptations to variation in physicochemical variables like temperature or dissolved oxygen. Only one of the two pulmonates tested in the laboratory, however, had quicker righting responses and rates of movement, important in recolonizing ephemeral habitats. A competition experiment in an artificial stream indicated that the large-river prosobranch, Lithasia obovata (Say, 1829), suffered less reduction in growth than the pulmonate Helisoma trivolvis (Say, 1817). Both the literature and experiments we have performed suggest that prosobranchs are less vulnerable to predators. We interpret these results to suggest pulmonates are more common in temporary headwater streams, or shallow littoral margins of lotic systems, because of greater physiological adaptation, while prosobranchs are more common in larger rivers (or in spring-fed rivers) because of greater competitive ability, lower risk of predation, or less-variable physicochemical regimes.","Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Brown, KM (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",,,,,,,71,42,44,0,22,AMER MALACOLOGICAL UNION,WILMINGTON,"DELAWARE MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, BOX 3937, WILMINGTON, DE 19807-0937 USA",0740-2783,,,AM MALACOL BULL,Am.

Thus, we have no idea what types of interspecific interactions to expect if we randomly sample species from an environment. The probability that a unidirectional, non-zero interaction is negative (P--) or positive (P-+) has a direct effect on the expected types of reciprocal interspecific interactions. Analysis of field studies where strengths and signs of interactions between seven or more species were documented (large studies were selected to avoid bias from choosing species known to interact) suggests that P-+ = P-- = 0.5. Data also suggest that the proportion of non-zero interactions (C) is generally less than 0.6 when 10 or more interactions are considered. The proportion of expected reciprocal interspecific interactions can be calculated given the proportion of direct interactions that are not significantly different from zero and assuming that non-zero interactions are equally likely to be positive or negative. In general, this neutral model predicts that if species are chosen from an environment randomly, non-interaction (0/0), commensalism (+/-/0), or amensalism (-/0) will be most common when C<0.6. Predation and functionally similar interactions (+/-), competition (-/-), and mutualism (+/+) should be relatively rare when there are less than 10 species with C<0.6.

Interspecific competition with larger carnivores may be a factor limiting wild dog density. The density of wild dogs on a 2600-km(2) area of the Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania) was 0.04 adults/km(2). Spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) density for the same area was estimated by audio playbacks as 0.32 hyaenas/km(2). Lion (Panthera leo) density determined from the ratio of hyaenas to lions, was 0.11 lions/km(2). Across six ecosystems including Selous, there were strong negative correlations between wild dog and hyaena densities (r = -0.32; p = 0.01) and between wild dog and lion densities (r = -0.91; p = 0.03). Hyaenas out-numbered wild dogs by ratios ranging from 8.1 to 122:1. Ratios of lions to wild dogs ranged from 3:1 to 21:1. The diets of hyaenas and wild dogs overlap extensively; those of wild dogs and lions show less overlap. Where hyaenas are common and visibility is good, interference competition from hyaenas at wild dog kills is common and reduces wild dogs' feeding time. Where hyaena density is lower and visibility is poor, interference competition at wild dog kills is rare. Wild dogs are commonly killed by lions and occasionally by hyaenas. These data suggest that competition with spotted hyaenas may limit or exclude wild dogs when hyaena density is high. Competition with lions appears less intense, but direct predation by lions on wild dogs is important. Competition and predation by larger carnivores may be of broad importance to the conservation of wild dogs and other medium-sized carnivores.","FRANKFURT ZOOL SOC, SELOUS WILD DOG PROJECT, SELOUS CONSERVAT PROGRAMME, DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA","Creel, S (corresponding author), ROCKEFELLER UNIV, FIELD RES CTR ECOL & ETHOL, TYRREL RD, BOX 38B, RR2, MILLBROOK, NY 12545 USA.",,,,,,,55,236,237,0,156,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Substratum selection by the burrowing larvae of the dragonfly Onychogomphus uncatus was examined in an artificial laboratory stream at different larval densities and in the presence of one of three other dragonfly species. 2. The larvae of O. uncatus, as well as those of the other species, clearly preferred gravelly sand substratum rather than gravel or stone. 3. At low larval density (71.4 m(-2)) in the stream, 83% of the O. uncatus were found in gravelly sand. An increase of larval abundance in the stream to 202.4, specimens m(-2) resulted in greater density in all substrata, but this increase was proportionally lowest in gravelly sand. 4. The presence of a second species had various effects on the microdistribution of O. uncatus. In the presence of Gomphus simillimus or Cordulegaster boltonii immaculifrons the distribution of O. uncatus changed significantly; their density increased in the normally less preferred substrata. This effect is interpreted as asymmetric interspecific interference.

We tested for the importance of priority effects on the interactions between immatures of the mosquito, Culiseta longiareolata, and immatures of the green toad, Bufo viridis, the two most abundant species of many temporary pools of the Negev Desert, Israel. Previously, we reported that when these two taxonomically distant species were placed together as early stage larvae, they competed strongly and when Culiseta larvae had the size advantage, they preyed on Bufo hatchlings. Here, we tested the interaction between these two species in artificial pools when Bufo enters first and develops prior to Culiseta entering. 2. We also tested for intra-specific competition and for the impact of both mosquito larva and tadpole on invading species. 3. We assessed these interactions by experimentally manipulating various combinations and densities of Bufo and Culiseta. We introduced early stage Bufo larvae 12 days prior to introducing first instar Culiseta larvae. 4. Bufo exhibited a strong intraspecific density-dependent effect: tadpoles were smaller and reached metamorphosis later at the higher density. We did not demonstrate an intraspecific density-dependent effect in Culiseta. 5. Culiseta larvae affected neither survival nor development rates of the larger Bufo. Early stage Culiseta larvae were vulnerable to predation by the larger Bufo but later instar Culiseta larval were no longer vulnerable. Bufo reduced larval development rate of Culiseta but did not affect pupal size. 6. Bufo tadpoles virtually eliminated, and Culiseta larvae strongly reduced, the number of individuals of an invading ceratopogonid midge species reaching the pupal stage. 7. The work here, combined with our previous work, demonstrates the importance of priority effects with respect to the outcome of competition and intraguild predation.","UNIV HAIFA,INST EVOLUT,LAB COMMUNITY ECOL,IL-31905 HAIFA,ISRAEL","Blaustein, L (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,LAB BIOL CONTROL,POB 653,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL.",,,,,,,48,96,99,1,58,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Holmgren), are in competition with each other. This work evaluated the influence of environmental factors on this community. We compared the arboreal nesting termite distribution, abundance, and colony size in the following 3 types of coconut plantation: (1) open plantations with tall trees (approximate to 25 m) at low density (less than or equal to 100 trees per hectare); (2) standard plantations with medium size trees (approximate to 13 m) at standard density (100-180 trees per hectare); (3) dense plantations (180-300 trees per hectare) with medium size or mixed size trees (13-25 m). The overall proportion of coconut trees occupied by arboreal termites increased from 25% in open plantations to 56% in standard or dense plantations. M. biroi was less abundant in open plantations than in standard or dense ones, whereas N. princeps was scarcest in standard plantations. N. novarumhebridarum occupied approximate to 2% of the trees in all plantation types, but showed a clear preference for dead trees. Nest volumes of all species and colony territories were larger in dense plantations, especially for N. princeps. Data on nest thermoregulation suggest that M. biroi is the most affected by sun exposure, which could constitute a limiting factor in open plantations, N. princeps incipient colonies would be particularly hindered by competition with first established colonies of hi. biroi in standard plantations. Large territories of N. princeps in dense plantations suggest that this species is especially favored by high tree densities, allowing easy colony expansion by galleries or satellite nests and reproduction by budding. We propose that arboreal termite community structure is mainly shaped by microclimatic conditions and food availability in open plantations, and by interspecific competition in denser habitats, although the incidence of other factors, such as predation or intraspecific competition, remains to be studied.",,"Leponce, M (corresponding author), FREE UNIV BRUSSELS, BIOL ANIM & CELLULAIRE LAB, CP160-12, 50 AV FD ROOSEVELT, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.",,"Roisin, Yves/C-1378-2010","Roisin, Yves/0000-0001-6635-3552",,,,36,11,11,1,18,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,ANNAPOLIS,"3 PARK PLACE, STE 307, ANNAPOLIS, MD 21401-3722 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

The environment of an individual vole can be considered to be predictable when the risks of predation and intra- and interspecific competition change with the cycle, such that both are high during the population highs of voles. The risk of predation is also high during the vole crash. After the crash, the vole population is characterized by low intra- and interspecific competition and low predation pressure. The main predators affecting voles during the crash are the small mustelids, least weasel and stoat. The density of these specialist predators declines drastically during the winter after the vole crash. We studied experimentally the impact of the perceived presence of stoats on the breeding and mating behaviour of voles. In a series of breeding experiments with bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, both old and young females suppressed breeding when exposed to the odour of stoats, Mustela erminea. The weights of females decreased in both experimental and control groups, but more among the voles under odour exposition. It seems that females actively avoided copulations under high predation risk and that breeding suppression is mediated by a change in female mating behaviour. There was no change in male behaviour or physical condition between the experimental and control treatments. An alternative mechanism for the observed breeding suppression could be the one caused by decreased feeding in females mediated with low energy intake which does not allow breeding. Regardless of its mechanism, delay of breeding should increase the probability of non-breeding females to survive to the next breeding season. The females surviving the crash should gain a strong selective advantage in a predator-free environment of the subsequent breeding season, which could explain the adaptive function of this antipredatory strategy.","UNIV JYVASKYLA,KONNEVESI RES STN,SF-Y0351 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND","YLONEN, H (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA,DEPT BIOL,POB 35,SF-Y0351 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND.",,,,,,,47,85,89,0,18,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

We consider large scale systems which can be decomposed into weakly coupled subsystems. Perturbation Theory is used in order to get a reduced set of differential equations governing slow time varying global variables. As examples, we study the influence of the individual behaviour of animals in competition and predator-prey models. The animals are assumed to do many activities all day long such as searching for food of different types. The degree of competition as well as the predation pressure are dependent upon these activities. Preys are more vulnerable when doing some activities during which they are very exposed to predators attacks rather than for others during which they are hidden. We study the effect of a change in the average individual behaviour of the animals on interspecific relationships. Computer simulations of the whole sets of equations are compared to simulations of the reduced sets of equations.","UNIV BOURGOGNE,DEPT MATH,TOPOL LAB,CNRS,URA 755,F-21004 DIJON,FRANCE","AUGER, PM (corresponding author), UNIV LYON 1,CNRS,URA 243,43 BD 11 NOVEMBRE 1918,F-69622 VILLEURBANNE,FRANCE.",,,"Auger, Pierre/0000-0003-2066-8174",,,,39,81,81,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0001-5342,,,ACTA BIOTHEOR,Acta Biotheor.,SEP,1994,42,2-3,,,,,111,136,,10.1007/BF00709485,,,26,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Mathematical & Computational Biology,PM355,WOS:A1994PM35500004,,,,,2021-09-21,

American toads arrive at breeding ponds 4-10 wk after wood frogs and typically select breeding sites that lack wood frog tadpoles. In an experiment conducted in seminatural ponds, adult toads completely avoided ovipositing in ponds with wood frog tadpoles. Additional experiments strongly suggest that predation of wood frog tadpoles on toad eggs and larvae is the primary reason for the evolution of adult avoidance behavior in toads. In one set of experiments, toad eggs and hatchlings suffered complete mortality within two days after being placed in artificial ponds containing natural densities of wood frog tadpoles. Similar mortality occurred when eggs and hatchlings were introduced into natural breeding sites. In one experiment in which 2000 toad hatchlings were added to natural ponds, all were killed and consumed within 45 min by wood frog tadpoles. Although tadpoles of most anurans are considered to be microphagous suspension feeders that occupy lower trophic levels of food chains, a growing body of evidence indicates that many tadpoles can temporarily shift feeding modes to become upper level, macrophagous predators. Because facultative predators such as wood frog tadpoles often reach far higher densities in ponds than do top predators, their role in structuring aquatic communities via opportunistic predation may be more important than previously realized.",,"PETRANKA, JW (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA,DEPT BIOL,ASHEVILLE,NC 28804, USA.",,,,,,,33,92,98,0,14,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS BUSINESS OFFICE,CARBONDALE,"SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT ZOOLOGY, CARBONDALE, IL 62901-6501",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,AUG 17,1994,,3,,,,,691,697,,10.2307/1447185,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,PD127,WOS:A1994PD12700012,,,,,2021-09-21,

We review ideas on apparent competition (also called ''competition for enemy-free space'') and sketch illustrative examples. One puzzling aspect of this indirect interaction is the repeated rediscovery of the essential ideas. Apparent competition arises between focal and alternative prey populations because, in the long term, enemy abundance depends on total prey availability; by increasing enemy numbers, alternative prey intensify predation on focal prey. A frequent empirical finding, consistent with theory, is exclusion of victim species from local communities by resident enemies. Theory suggests victim-species coexistence depends on particular conditions. To understand fully the consequences of shared enemies requires a body of contingent theory, specifying the time-scale of the interactions (short-and long-term consequences of sharing enemies generally differ), the structure of the food-web encompassing the interactions, its spatial context, etc. The ''core criterion'' for a focal victim species to invade a community supporting a resident, polyphagous enemy is r > aP (the invader's intrinsic rate of increase should exceed attack rate times average enemy abundance). A growing body of data and observations test, and support, this prediction.","UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL, NERC, CTR POPULAT BIOL, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND","HOLT, RD (corresponding author), UNIV KANSAS, MUSEUM NAT HIST, DEPT SYSTEMAT & ECOL, LAWRENCE, KS 66045 USA.",,,,,,,198,703,724,1,238,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4162,,,ANNU REV ECOL SYST,Annu.

The lakes are characterized by a dominance of large zooplankton species. Small zooplankton species are scarce, whereas in nearby lakes with fish they are common. The importance of biotic and abiotic factors in preventing the successful invasion of small zooplankton species into these fishless lakes was determined using a series of field manipulations. The relative importance of competition with large herbivores (the cladoceran Daphnia pulex), predation by large invertebrates (the dipteran Chaoborus americanus and the copepod Diaptomus leptopus), and abiotic conditions including pH were examined experimentally. Abiotic and/or resource conditions suppressed the population growth rate of 70% of the small zooplankton species introduced into enclosures in the fishless lakes relative to those introduced into enclosures in their resident lake (a lake with fish). Fewer small zooplankton species were suppressed in a similar experiment when pH was experimentally raised to 7, suggesting that pH is one factor that inhibits the successful invasion of small zooplankton into these lakes. Manipulations of large herbivores and invertebrate predators showed that predation was more important than competition in restricting the distribution of small species. Predation by Chaoborus primarily reduced the densities of crustaceans while predation by Diaptomus reduced the densities of rotifers. Competitive suppression of small zooplankton by Daphnia was not detected. The results suggest that both predation by Chaoborus and Diaptomus and abiotic conditions, including pH, are important factors determining zooplankton community structure in these fishless bog lakes.","MIAMI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,OXFORD,OH 45054",,,,"Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X",,,,86,101,109,0,42,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1993,74,8,,,,,2361,2380,,10.2307/1939588,,,20,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MJ575,WOS:A1993MJ57500017,,,,,2021-09-21,

The focus of the observations was a simple isolated rock, 0.9 m2 in area with an inclination of 75-degrees. The pulmonate homing limpet Siphonaria sirius responded by fleeing from its home in response to the whelk Thais clavigera and by clamping tightly to its home scar in response to the starfish Coscinasterias acutispina. Both behaviours were successful for avoiding predation. After a whelk moved far away, limpets returned to their homes. The patellid limpet Cellana toreuma showed mantle folding behaviour or fled for an average distance of 8 cm vertically upwards in response to the whelk and for an average distance of 21 cm vertically upwards in response to the starfish. The amount of time predators spent foraging increased in the low intertidal zone relative to the mid and high zones, and most predator attacks were observed during the limpets' resting periods (submersion in late afternoon or nighttime). The upward directional flight displayed by C. toreuma was related to the upward orientation of the limpets' heads when they are in a resting position. Half of the limpets observed fleeing downward away from a starfish, a movement elicited by a downward attack, received a second attack. These limpets were preyed upon at the second encounter 67% of the time. The upward fleeing behaviour of C. toreuma resulted in the shifting of its resting site higher up the study site where fewer attacks occurred and where the mortality rate was at its lowest. It is suggested that the homing behaviour of S. sirius and the upward fleeing behaviour of C. toreuma are mechanisms by means of which interspecific competition between limpets is reduced and coexistence on a small rock surface is maintained.",,"IWASAKI, K (corresponding author), KYOTO UNIV,FAC SCI,DEPT ZOOL,KYOTO 606,JAPAN.",,,,,,,70,39,39,1,20,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Introduced native fish, specifically smelt, Retropinna retropinna, and the common bully, Gobiomorphus cotidianus, now occur in this lake. As koaro co-exist with bullies in other lakes, but have declined in landlocked lakes containing smelt, the disappearance of koaro in Lake Rotopounamu is attributed to the introduction of smelt alone. Interspecific competition for food between 0 + year old koaro and smelt, combined with predation by 2 + year old smelt on koaro larvae, are thought to be responsible. Such a mechanism would be consistent with theoretical predictions of predator-prey regulation systems within same chain food webs. Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, which were introduced into a number of local lakes before smelt, and which preyed on the koaro, have been blamed for the decline of the koaro populations.

In mixed-species tests, sculpin feeding rates were no different than in the monospecific tests. Feeding rates for crayfish, however, were significantly reduced by the presence of sculpin. In mixed-species treatments in which small refuges were included in the aquaria, crayfish predation of eggs was 50% less than in the monospecific tests, i.e., 1.5 eggs/d, and, crayfish went on 93% fewer excursions outside refuges, spent 94% less time outside refuges, and engaged in 83% fewer feeding bouts than sculpin (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05 for all comparisons).

Here I present experimental evidence on the response of two species of gerbils (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum) to the presence of barn owls. I conducted the experiments in a large aviary. Both gerbils responded to the presence of barn owl predators by foraging in fewer resource patches (seed trays) and by quitting foraged resource patches at a higher resource harvest rate (giving-up density of resource; GUD). This reduced the amount of time gerbils were exposed to owl predation, and hence the encounter rate of owls with gerbils, i.e., behavioral resource depression. Thus, the presence of owls imposes a foraging cost on gerbils due to risk of predation, and also on the owls themselves due to resource depression. I then examined how resource depression relaxed over time following exposure to owls. In the days following an encounter with the predator, the reduction in foraging activity for both gerbil species eased. Increasing numbers of trays were foraged each day, and GUDs in seed trays declined. The two gerbils differed in their rate of recovery, with G. pyramidum returning to prepredator levels of foraging after 1 or 2 nights and G. allenbyi taking 5 nights or longer. Interspecific differences in recovery rates may be based on differences between the species in vulnerability to predation and/or ability to detect the presence of predators. The differences in recovery rates may be due to optimal memory windows or decay rates, where differences between species are based on risk of predation or on how perceived risk changes with time since a predator was last encountered. Finally, differences between or among competitors in recovery from resource depression may provide foraging opportunities in time for the species which recover most quickly and may have implications for species coexistence.",,"KOTLER, BP (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,IL-84993 SEDE BOQER,ISRAEL.",,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,41,63,65,0,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

The impact of these processes on the competition and coexistence of the two copepod species was examined with a small strategic model which could be solved analytically, and a detailed numerical simulation model integrating comprehensive experimental evidence with theoretical concepts about species coexistence. In the strategic model considering the major interactions between the two populations, no stable coexistence was achieved within a reasonable parameter range under steady state conditions. However, in the numerical simulation model, which included in addition to many biological details the spatial heterogeneity of the biotope, both species coexisted for a wide and sensible parameter range. Model results suggest that in the present case study, competition is mainly caused by common predators (i.e. carnivorous zooplankton), but not by utilization of common resources. Competition for common resources is weak and diffuse, because of numerous other herbivores. Predation of A. tonsa on nauplii of both species enhances intra-specific and interspecific competition at high abundances but despite being species-specific it does not support coexistence within a reasonable parameter range. Non-selective predation by carnivorous zooplankton depending on the combined abundance of the two prey species appears as the main factor promoting competition between copepod species. At the same time, it is - at least in the model - the most important mechanism of coexistence if the prey species are spatially heterogeneously distributed and the predation pressure relies on the local prey density. Revealing this mechanism of coexistence allows a better explanation for the observed spatial distribution of estuarine copepod species.","UNIV OLDENBURG, FACHBEREICH ECOL MODELLING 6, W-2900 OLDENBURG, GERMANY",,,,,,,,46,3,4,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Both fish species fed on Daphnia pulex in 1980 and growth was rapid; prey biomass per gram of fish was 2-12 times higher for white perch than for yellow perch. In 1987, white perch consumed up to three times more prey biomass than yellow perch, but the subsequent disappearance of D. pulex caused both fish species to switch to macroinvertebrates and growth of both species declined. Between 1977 and 1987, mean weights and specific growth rates of white perch exceeded yellow perch by October in all years, and weights of white perch were closely tied to the density of D. pulex in late summer-early fall (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.58, P = 0.07). Diet overlap for age-0 white and yellow perch was high when D. pulex was present, and the potential for interspecific competition was greatest when these fish were similar in length. Because of a prolonged spawning period, age-0 white perch had a wide range in lengths, which enabled them to feed on a broad size range of prey. As a result, predation on D. pulex by white perch was exerted over a wider size range than was exerted by yellow perch. Such circumstances may allow daphnids to persist when age-0 white perch are abundant. Consequently, competitive interactions between young white and yellow perch appear to be assymmetric, because the ability of large cohorts of yellow perch to collapse Daphnia pulex populations has greater effect on white perch growth than large cohorts of white perch have on yellow perch growth.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, BIOL FIELD STN, 900 SHACKELTON POINT RD, BRIDGEPORT, NY 13030 USA",,,,,,,,33,57,58,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

In this context, we examined the effect of temperature on interference competition (i.e. displacement) between two ecologically-similar caprellid species that co-occur in the Portuguese Atlantic archipelago of Madeira: the NIS Caprella scaura (Templeton, 1836) and its congener Caprella equilibra (Say, 1818). Mesocosm experiments were used to assess the interaction between the two species and the effects of wanner ocean waters on this interaction. Specifically, we investigated the effect of an increase in temperature on: i) survivorship and intraspecific displacement of the NIS C. scaura, ii) survivorship and interspecific displacement when this NIS and its congener C. equilibra coexisted at similar densities, and iii) survivorship and interspecific displacement in the two species when the density of NIS is higher compared to its congener. Furthermore, we explored differences in the heart rate of the two species as proxy for physiological condition. Our results showed that in a future scenario of ocean warming for Madeira Island (29 degrees C), survivorship and intraspecific displacement of C. scaura most likely will not be affected. The survivorship of the congener C. equilibra will not be compromised, but its displacement will be affected by a combination of temperature and density of NIS. Overall, our results showed that warming exacerbates interspecific interactions between the two caprellid species suggesting that climate change can modify species distribution among habitats, potentially affecting community structure and diversity. The results of this study highlight the importance of biotic interactions and environmental context to predict and assess NIS success and potential impacts on resident species in the perspective of climate change.","[Parretti, Paola; Cristina Costa, Ana] Univ Azores, InBIO Associate Lab, CIBIO, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Rua Mae Deus 13A, P-9501801 Sao Miguel, Acores, Portugal; [Parretti, Paola; Cristina Costa, Ana] Univ Azores, Fac Sci & Technol, Rua Mae Deus 13A, P-9501801 Sao Miguel, Acores, Portugal; [Parretti, Paola; Gestoso, Ignacio; Ramalhosa, Patricio; Canning-Clode, Joao] Agencia Reg Desenvolvimento Invest Tecnol & Inova, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Edificio Madeira Tecnopolo, P-9020105 Funchal, Madeira, Portugal; [Ros, Macarena] Univ Cadiz, Fac Ciencias Mar & Ambientales, Dept Biol, Area Ecol, Puerto Real 11510, Spain; [Gestoso, Ignacio; Canning-Clode, Joao] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Ramalhosa, Patricio] Agencia Reg Desenvolvimento Invest Tecnol & Inova, OOM Ocean Observ Madeira, Edificio Madeira Tecnopolo,Piso 0, P-9020105 Funchal, Madeira, Portugal","Parretti, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, InBIO Associate Lab, CIBIO, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Rua Mae Deus 13A, P-9501801 Sao Miguel, Acores, Portugal.; Parretti, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Fac Sci & Technol, Rua Mae Deus 13A, P-9501801 Sao Miguel, Acores, Portugal.; Parretti, P (corresponding author), Agencia Reg Desenvolvimento Invest Tecnol & Inova, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Edificio Madeira Tecnopolo, P-9020105 Funchal, Madeira, Portugal.",paola.parretti@uac.pt; mros@us.es; igestoso@mare-centre.pt; pramalhosa@mare-centre.pt; ana.cm.costa@uac.pt; joanning-clode@mare-centre.pt,"Ramalhosa, Patricio/N-7645-2016; Gestoso, Ignacio/E-8742-2015","Ramalhosa, Patricio/0000-0002-2355-9638; Gestoso, Ignacio/0000-0001-5521-3255; Ros, Macarena/0000-0001-8074-0778; Parretti, Paola/0000-0002-3265-5453","Fundo Regional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (FRCT) [M3.1.a/F/065/2015]; program ACORES 2020; Juan de la Cierva Postodoctoral Fellowship [IJCI-2017-34656]; ARDITI Grant Programme Madeira [M1420-09-5369-FSE-000001]; Project Observatorio Oceanico da Madeira-OOM [M1420-01-0145-FEDER-000001]; Madeira Regional Operational Programme (Madeira) under the Portugal 2020 strategy, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.

Parasites are one of the main actors in host-parasite interactions. Still, their role as a prey and the related consequences for such interactions and in other respects, such as food webs, are frequently overlooked. 2. This paper analyses predation pressure on a ubiquitous avian ectoparasitic fly, Carnus hemapterus, identifies their main natural enemies and quantifies their relative effect on the abundance of the parasite. Also, the effect of nest-site type on their main enemies' predation pressure was analysed. 3. Several ant species were found in the nest boxes of the host species, the European roller (Coracias garrulus), during the breeding season and preyed upon adult and larval stages of Carnus. 4. Ants were also the putative predators of carnid pupae after the breeding season, when significant reduction (on average, by half) in the abundance of carnid pupae occurred in 75% of nest boxes within few months. 5. Carnid pupae are also reported here, for the first time, to be parasitised by the parasitoid wasp Chartocerus conjugalis, whose prevalence was around 21%. 6. Nest-site type had no clear effect on the predation rate of carnid pupae after the breeding season. 7. It was concluded that predation is an important factor regulating the abundance of ectoparasites, and thus, it may influence the outcome of host-parasite relationships.","[Salido, Angela; Reyes-Lopez, Joaquin L.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Bot Ecol & Fisiol Vegetal, Edificio Celestino Mutis C4,Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Veiga, Jesus; Valera, Francisco] CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas EEZA, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 Almeria, Spain; [Nieves-Aldrey, Jose L.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain","Valera, F (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas EEZA, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 Almeria, Spain.",pvalera@eeza.csic.es,"Reyes-Lopez, Joaquin/AAW-6300-2021; Veiga, Jesus/H-2976-2018; Valera, Francisco/J-5951-2014; Nieves-Aldrey, Jose Luis/K-2544-2012","Veiga, Jesus/0000-0003-1140-2411; Reyes Lopez, Joaquin Luis/0000-0002-0702-4588; Valera, Francisco/0000-0003-2266-8899; Nieves-Aldrey, Jose Luis/0000-0002-4711-7455","MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE [PGC2018-097426-B-C22]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness [BES-2015-075951]","We thank Teresa Martinez and Ada Lopez for their help with fieldwork.

These factors should depend on, among other traits, species-specific bacterial environments and life-history characteristics. However, interspecific variation in feather deterioration, feather susceptibility to degradation by keratinolytic bacteria (degradability), and bacterial environment, have rarely been quantified. Here, we did so by measuring deterioration and degradability of wing feathers of fledglings in 16 bird species, and characterizing the bacterial environment where they developed. We found statistically significant interspecific variation for all considered variables. On average, non-melanised were more deteriorated than melanised feathers, but differences depended on the species. Moreover, nest bacterial loads were related to feather wear, but the sign of the association depended on the bacterial group considered and on feather pigmentation. We also found a positive association of feather degradability with wear of non-melanised feathers, and with bacterial loads. These results suggest that bacterial environments determine the integrity of fledgling feathers as well as their resistance to bacterial degradation, which implies a preponderant role of bacteria in driving the evolution of avian feathers.","[Azcarate-Garcia, Manuel; Ruiz-Rodriguez, Magdalena; Jose Soler, Juan] Estn Expt Zonas Aridas EEZA CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Almeria, Spain; [Gonzalez-Braojos, Sonia; Moreno, Juan] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat MNCN CSIC, Dept Ecol Evolut, Madrid, Spain; [Diaz-Lora, Silvia; Martin-Vivaldi, Manuel] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain; [Martin-Vivaldi, Manuel; Martinez-Bueno, Manuel; Jose Soler, Juan] Univ Granada, Unidad Asociada Coevoluc Cucos Hospedadores & Bac, Granada, Spain; [Martinez-Bueno, Manuel] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Microbiol, Granada, Spain","Soler, JJ (corresponding author), Estn Expt Zonas Aridas EEZA CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Almeria, Spain.",jsoler@eeza.csic.es,"Lora, Silvia Diaz/AAC-1173-2021; Martin-Vivaldi, Manuel/F-8256-2016; Soler, J.

Unfortunately, robust, comprehensive primate population estimates are often lacking, particularly for rare, elusive species. Historically, population estimates of primates have relied on labor-intensive line-transect sampling and distance estimation techniques. We used occupancy sampling to estimate the probability of occupancy and detection of seven lemur species in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, and explore relationships between occupancy and detection and landscape, habitat, and co-occurring species variables. We detected and provide estimates of occupancy and/or detection for seven lemur species in a World Heritage Site: Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. We found habitat type was an important variable explaining occupancy patterns for detection of golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), as well as red bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata). The presence of free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris) was an important factor in several competing models for red-bellied lemurs and eastern lesser bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur griseus), highlighting the threat posed by this exotic predator to primates. While some estimates had error values overlapping zero, reflecting the rarity and low detection of these species, these results indicate the importance of protecting multiple forest types to maintain lemur biodiversity and the underappreciated conservation threat of invasive species in Madagascar.","[Farris, Zach J.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Hlth, Exercise Sci, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Chan, Stephanie] McGill Univ, McGill Sch Environm, Ste-Anne-Bellevue, Quebec City, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Rafaliarison, Radoniaina] Mad Dog Initiative, Madagascar Lot VU 283 D, Villa ROTCIV, Manakambahiny, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Valenta, Kim] Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainseville, FL 32611 USA","Farris, ZJ (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Hlth, Exercise Sci, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",farriszj@appstate.edu,"Farris, Zach J./AAW-6579-2020",,,,,56,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0164-0291,1573-8604,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

Despite this, no study has analysed multispecies interactions by combining such a high number of aspects, mostly because the experimental manipulation of studied populations is rarely possible. In our work, we assessed several aspects of interspecific interactions in a rodent assembly composed by three species, by examining diet and temporal- niche partitioning, as well as relevant ectoparasite load and predation pressure, in a natural environment. We analysed stomach contents and ectoparasite load of 78 individuals belonging to all the species, whereas activity rhythms were measured with camera trapping (2200 night-traps, throughout 1 year). Our findings showed that the largest-sized species, i.e. the brown rat Rattus norvegicus was the strongest competitor and may affect diet, temporal behaviour and susceptibility to parasites of smaller-sized ones, i.e. the black rat Rattus rattus and the house mouse Mus domesticus. Larger-sized species showed a broader trophic niche with respect to smaller-sized ones, whereas the smallest species seemed to avoid the largest ones by shifting its temporal activity when the latter was mostly inactive. Larger-sized species may also act as potential predators towards smaller ones, which are also more vulnerable to ectoparasite infestation and to the predation by the only raptor bird present in the study area, the barn owl Tyto alba. We therefore highlight the importance to carry out community-wide studies, to understand interspecific intraguild relationships.","[Mori, Emiliano; Ferretti, F.; Fattorini, N.] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, SI, Italy","Mori, E (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, SI, Italy.",moriemiliano@tiscali.it,"Fattorini, Niccolo/AAJ-9976-2020","Fattorini, Niccolo/0000-0001-8022-7464; Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0002-0414-1615",,,,107,11,12,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Using purified proteins it was reported a species restriction for the interaction of ICAM-1 and LFA-1, being mouse ICAM-1 able to interact with human LFA-1 but not humanICAM1 with mouse LFA-1. However, in vivo results employing tumor cells transfected with human ICAM-1 suggest that functionally mouse LFA-1 can recognize human ICAM1. In order to clarify the interspecies cross-reactivity of the ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction, we have performed functional studies analyzing the ability of human soluble ICAM-1and human/mouse LFA-1 derived peptides to inhibit cell aggregation and adhesion as well as cell-mediated cytotoxicity in both mouse and human systems. In parallel, the affinity of the interaction between mouse LFA-1-derived peptides and human ICAM-1 was determined by calorimetry assays. According to the results obtained, it seems that human ICAM-1 is able to interact with mouse LFA-1 on intact cells, which should be taking into account when using humanized mice and xenograft models for the study of immune-related processes.","[Nunez, David; Comas, Laura; Lanuza, Pilar M.; Sanchez-Martinez, Diego; Perez-Hernandez, Marta; Pardo, Julian; Galvez, Eva M.] Biomed Res Ctr Aragon CIBA, Aragon Hlth Res Inst IIS Aragon, Immune Effector Cells Grp, Zaragoza, Spain; [Nunez, David; Comas, Laura; Lanuza, Pilar M.; Sanchez-Martinez, Diego; Perez-Hernandez, Marta; Catalan, Elena; Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biochem & Mol & Cell Biol, Zaragoza, Spain; [Nunez, David; Comas, Laura; Pilar Domingo, Maria; Galvez, Eva M.] CSIC, ICB, Inst Carboquim, Zaragoza, Spain; [Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian] Univ Zaragoza, CSIC, Inst Biocomputat & Phys Complex Syst BIFI, Unidad Asociada,IQFR,BIFI, Zaragoza, Spain; [Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian; Pardo, Julian] Govt Aragon, Aragon ID Fdn ARAID, Zaragoza, Spain; [Pardo, Julian] Univ Zaragoza, Nanosci Inst Aragon INA, Zaragoza, Spain; [Pardo, Julian] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Microbiol Prevent Med & Publ Hlth, Zaragoza, Spain","Galvez, EM (corresponding author), Biomed Res Ctr Aragon CIBA, Aragon Hlth Res Inst IIS Aragon, Immune Effector Cells Grp, Zaragoza, Spain.; Galvez, EM (corresponding author), CSIC, ICB, Inst Carboquim, Zaragoza, Spain.",eva@icb.csic.es,"COMAS, LAURA/AAB-4655-2021; Domingo, Pilar/D-6325-2014; Pardo, Julian/K-6764-2014; Perez-Hernandez, Marta/K-8778-2014; Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian/E-7946-2012; SANCHEZ, DIEGO/AAA-5440-2019; Galvez, Eva M./K-6751-2014","COMAS, LAURA/0000-0002-3843-1231; Domingo, Pilar/0000-0002-6829-8769; Pardo, Julian/0000-0003-0154-0730; Perez-Hernandez, Marta/0000-0003-1331-5493; Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian/0000-0001-5702-4538; SANCHEZ, DIEGO/0000-0003-4605-5325; Galvez, Eva M./0000-0001-6928-5516; Nunez Jurado, David/0000-0002-0360-5625; Lanuza, Pilar/0000-0001-7328-2094","Fondo Social Europeo (FSE; Gobierno de Aragon); Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) [2009tw0034]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SAF2011-25390, SAF2014-54763-C2-1-R, SAF2014-54763-C2-2-R, BFU2016-78232-P]; Aragon I+D (ARAID); Gobierno de AragonGobierno de Aragon; Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte","This work was supported by Fondo Social Europeo (FSE; Gobierno de Aragon) and by grants2009tw0034 from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), SAF2011-25390, SAF2014-54763-C2-1-R, SAF2014-54763-C2-2-R and BFU2016-78232-P (AVC) from Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (JP).

Sudden Oak Death (SOD), caused by Phytophthora ramorum (Oomycota), is an introduced disease causing large-scale tree mortality. Two additional Phytophthora species, Phytophthora nemorosa and Phytophthora pseudosyringae, cause significantly lower oak mortality, yet they also commonly colonize leaves of Umbellularia californica, the major transmissive host of SOD in California. We combined field surveys and inoculation experiments to understand disease prevalence dynamics and competitive interactions among these pathogen species. Despite the broader geographic distribution of P. nemorosa with respect to that of P. ramorum, our results suggest that P. nemorosa exhibits a narrower ecological amplitude and, in any given region, occupies fewer sites than P. ramorum. Our results additionally suggest that, perhaps due to priority effects, P. nemorosa can persist at levels comparable to those of P. ramorum in ecologically suitable plots when climate favors P. ramorum dormancy. However, P. ramorum prevalence increases to levels higher than those of the competing species when abundant rainfall triggers its sporulation. Understanding the determinants and outcomes of competition between these species has important implications for understanding the epidemiology and possible control strategies for Sudden Oak Death.

We conducted field research and an experiment to elucidate direct and indirect interactions among micro- and filamentous algae, their consumers (fingernail clams and water fleas consume the former and chironomids the latter), and loaches that prey on water fleas and chironomids. The experiment examined the effects loaches and fingernail clams have on algae biomass. Fingernail clams reduced microalgae biomass by filter feeding, while loaches increased it by feeding on water fleas. Loach predation on water fleas increased the biomass of microalgae indirectly, which might have led to an increased density of fingernail clams. Filter feeding on microalgae by fingernail clams increased the density of filamentous algae, a potential competitor of microalgae, suggesting that fingernail clams increase the density of chironomids by enhancing their diet, which may then increase the density of the loaches that prey on chironomids.

Research suggests that plant species converge toward similar environmental tolerances relative to the environments that they experience. Whether these patterns apply to severe environments or scale up to plant community-level patterns of relative climatic tolerances is poorly understood. Using estimates of species' climatic tolerances acquired from occurrence records, we determined the contributions of individual species' climatic niche breadths and environmental filtering to the relationships between community-average climatic tolerances and the local climates experienced by those communities. Location: Southwestern United States drylands. Methods: Interspecific variation in niche breadth was assessed as a function of species' climatic optima (median climatic niche value). The relationships between climatic optima and tolerances were used as null expectations for the relationship between abundance-weighted mean climatic tolerances of communities and the local climate of that community. Deviations from this null expectation indicate that species with greater or lesser climatic tolerances are favoured relative to co-occurring species, The intensity of environmental filtering was estimated by comparing the range of climatic tolerances within each community to a null distribution generated :from a random assembly algorithm. Results: The temperature niches of species were consistently symmetrical and of similar breadths, regardless of their temperature optima. In contrast, precipitation niches were skewed toward wetter conditions, and niche breadth increased with increasing precipitation optima. At the community level, relationships with climate were much stronger for temperature than for precipitation, Furthermore, cold and heat were stronger assembly fillers than drought or precipitation, with the intensity of environmental filtering increasing at both ends of climatic gradients, Community-average climatic tolerances did deviate significantly from null expectations, indicating that species with higher or lower relative climatic tolerances were favoured under certain conditions. Conclusions: Despite strong water limitation of plant performance in dryland ecosystems, communities tracked variation in temperature much more closely, intimating strong responses to anticipated temperature increases. Furthermore, abundance distributions were biased toward species with higher or lower relative climatic tolerances under different climatic conditions, but predictably so, indicating, the need for assembly models that include processes other than simple environmental filtering.","[Butterfield, Bradley J.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Butterfield, Bradley J.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Munson, Seth M.] No Arizona Univ, US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Box 5614, Flagstaff, AZ USA","Butterfield, BJ (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.; Butterfield, BJ (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Bradley.Butterfield@nau.edu; SMunson@usgs.gov,,,USGS Ecosystems Mission Area,"C.

We recently failed to find any age-independent link between dewlap size and social status in the common eland (Tragelaphus oryx), pointing to the possibility that sexual selection may not be the primary cause of dewlap evolution in ungulates. Here I use a two-pronged approach to test hypotheses on the function of ungulate dewlaps: an interspecific comparative analysis of bovids and deer, and an intraspecific study of eland antelopes in the wild. Results: Across species, the presence of dewlaps in males was not found to be associated with sexual size dimorphism, a commonly used measure of the intensity of sexual selection. The presence of dewlaps was, however, linked to very large male body size (>400 kg), which agrees with a thermoregulatory function as lower surface/volume-ratio counteracts heat dissipation in large-bodied species. In eland antelopes, large dewlap size was associated with higher, rather than lower, incidence of claw-marks (independently of age), a result which speaks against the dewlap as a predator deterrent and rather indicates a predation cost of the structure. Conclusion: The findings suggest that, although an additional function in communication should not be ruled out, the dewlap of ungulates may contrast with that of lizards and birds in thermoregulation being a primary function.","[Bro-Jorgensen, Jakob] Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Leahurst Campus, Neston CH64 7TE, England","Bro-Jorgensen, J (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Leahurst Campus, Neston CH64 7TE, England.",bro@liv.ac.uk,,,RCUK fellowshipUK Research & Innovation (UKRI) [EP/E50065X/1],This research was supported by an RCUK fellowship (EP/E50065X/1).,,39,4,4,1,26,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1742-9994,,,FRONT ZOOL,Front.

This simplifying assumption is often justified by the perception that variation among individuals does not have significant effects on the dynamics of whole populations. However, this perception may be skewed by a historic focus on studying single populations. A true evaluation of the extent to which among-individual variation affects the dynamics of populations requires the study of multiple populations. In this study, we examined variation in the dynamics of populations of a live-bearing, marine fish (black surfperch; Embiotoca jacksoni). In collaboration with an organization of citizen scientists (Reef Check California), we were able to examine the dynamics of eight populations that were distributed throughout similar to 700km of coastline, a distance that encompasses much of this species' range. We hypothesized that genetic variation within a local population would be related to the intensity of competition and to the strength of population regulation. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether genetic diversity (measured by the diversity of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes) was related to the strength of population regulation. Low-diversity populations experienced strong density dependence in population growth rates and population sizes were regulated much more tightly than they were in high-diversity populations. Mechanisms that contributed to this pattern include links between genetic diversity, habitat use, and spatial crowding. On average, low-diversity populations used less of the available habitat and exhibited greater spatial clustering (and more intense competition) for a given level of density (measured at the scale of the reef). Although the populations we studied also varied with respect to exogenous characteristics (habitat complexity, densities of predators, and interspecific competitors), none of these characteristics was significantly related to the strength of population regulation. In contrast, an endogenous characteristic of the population (genetic diversity) explained 77% of the variation in the strength of population regulation (95% CI: 27-94%). Our results suggest that the genetic and phenotypic composition of populations can play a major role in their dynamics.","[Johnson, D.

Few studies have assessed the importance of biological interactions in structuring these communities. In the present study, benthic diatom community structure in relation to manipulated food webs was assessed using in situ mesocosms, whereby predator-free environments and environments comprising two different fish species were assessed. Zooplankton abundance, settled algal biomass and the diatom community were monitored over a 12-day period across each of the three trophic scenarios. Differences among treatments over time were observed in zooplankton abundances, particularly copepods. Similarly, the benthic diatom community structure changed significantly over time across the three trophic treatments. However, no differences in total algal biomass were found among treatments. This was likely the result of non-diatom phytoplankton contributions. We propose that the benthic diatom community structure within the mesocosms was influenced by trophic cascades and potentially through direct consumption by the fish. The study highlights that not only are organisms at the base of the food web affected by predators at the top of the food web, but that predator identity is potentially an important consideration for predator-prey interaction outcomes with consequences for multiple trophic levels.","[Wasserman, R.

During warm periods, mountain ungulates living in open areas typically show a bimodal pattern of activity rhythms, with peaks at dawn and dusk. To date, however, little is known about the activity patterns of mountain ungulates living in forested habitats and in areas where large predators are present. Using camera traps over a 6-month period between May and October of 2012, we investigated the activity pattern of a chamois population dwelling in the forests of the northern Mount Velebit region (Croatia) and its overlap with the activity patterns of potential predators (brown bear, grey wolf) and competitors (wild boar). Chamois showed a peak of activity between 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., when 65 % of individuals were photographed. Contrary to previous literature on chamois, we found evidence for a unimodal pattern of activity with a peak in the early morning hours: At a seasonal level, this pattern remained fairly consistent, though the activity at dusk increased in the warmest months. The main peak of activity occurred during periods of decreased activity of potential predators and competitors, and chamois exhibited the least tolerance for overlap with grey wolf. Further studies are needed to clarify whether this pattern is typical of forest-dwelling populations or if it reflects a temporal niche shift, possibly as a strategy to avoid predators.","[Sprem, Nikica; Gancevic, Pavao] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Fisheries Beekeeping Game Management & Speci, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Zanella, Davor] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Ugarkovic, Damir; Prebanic, Ivan] Univ Zagreb, Fac Forestry, Dept Ecol & Silviculture, Zagreb 10002, Croatia; [Corlatti, Luca] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Wildlife Biol & Game Management, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","Sprem, N (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Fisheries Beekeeping Game Management & Speci, Svetosimunska Cesta 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",nsprem@agr.hr,"Corlatti, Luca/AAP-1047-2021; Sprem, Nikica/K-1003-2019; Ugarkovic, Damir/G-9213-2019","Corlatti, Luca/0000-0002-2706-3875; Sprem, Nikica/0000-0002-3475-6653",,,,48,16,18,0,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Studies on how flocks respond to fragmentation and land-use intensification continue to accumulate, but the question of whether the flock phenomenon makes species more vulnerable to anthropogenic change remains unclear. We review the literature on flocks in East Asia and demonstrate there is a good foundation of knowledge on which to build. We then outline potentially fruitful future directions, focusing on studies that can investigate how dependent species are on each other in flocks, and how such interdependencies might affect avian habitat selection in the different types of human-modified environments of this region.","[Goodale, Eben] Guangxi Univ, Dept Forestry, Nanning 530003, Peoples R China; [Ding, Ping; Si, Xingfeng] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaohu] Wildlife Conservat Soc, China Program, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Martinez, Ari] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Walters, Mitch] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32607 USA; [Robinson, Scott K.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Robinson, SK (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",srobinson@flmnh.ufl.edu,"Goodale, Eben/AAM-7436-2020; Si, Xingfeng/I-3957-2014; Ding, Ping/H-1817-2015","Goodale, Eben/0000-0003-3403-2847; Si, Xingfeng/0000-0003-4465-2759; ",1000 Plan Recruitment Program of Global Experts of the People's Republic of China; Special Talent Recruitment Program of Guangxi University,"We thank Aiwu Jiang, Yang Liu, Toshitaki Suzuki, Qiang Zhang, Chao Zhao, Jian Zhao and Fasheng Zou for discussion of East Asian mixed-species flocks and their help in obtaining the literature, and two anonymous reviewers on their constructive comments for improving the manuscript.

While long periodic cycles in population dynamics can make the experimental observation of the indirect effects difficult, modelling the possible effects on an evolutionary tithe scale may provide the much needed information on the potential threats of the invasive species on the ecosystem. Using empirical data from a recent invasion in northernmost Fennoscandia, we applied adaptive dynamics theory and modelled the long term consequences of the invasion by the winter moth into the resident community. Specifically, we investigated the outcome of the observed short-term asymmetric preferences of generalist predators and specialist parasitoids on the long term population dynamics of the invasive winter moth and resident autumnal moth sharing these natural enemies. Our results indicate that coexistence after the invasion is possible. However, the outcome of the indirect interaction on the population dynamics of the moth species was variable and the dynamics might not be persistent on an evolutionary time scale. In addition, the indirect interactions between the two moth species via shared natural enemies were able to cause asynchrony in the population cycles corresponding to field observations from previous sympatric outbreak areas. Therefore, the invasion may cause drastic changes in the resident community, for example by prolonging outbreak periods of birch-feeding moths, increasing the average population densities of the moths or, alternatively, leading to extinction of the resident moth species or to equilibrium densities of the two, formerly cyclic, herbivores.

The treatment that involved only the introduction of crustaceans had no significant effect on mosquito larval populations, while treatment with Bti alone caused only a significant reduction in the abundance of mosquito larvae in the short-term (within 310 days after treatment). In contrast, the combined treatment rapidly reduced the abundance of mosquito larvae, which remained low throughout the entire observation period of 28 days. Growth of the introduced crustacean communities was favored by the immediate reduction in the abundance of mosquito larvae following Bti administration, thus preventing recolonization of ponds by mosquito larvae at the late period (days 1428 after treatment).

Species' preferences for nest-sites have presumably evolved in relation to local habitat resources and/or interactions with other species. The importance of these two components in the nest-site selection of the Eurasian Honey Buzzard Pernis apivorus was assessed in two study areas in eastern Austria. There was almost no difference in macro- and micro-habitat features between nest-sites and random plots, suggesting that Honey Buzzards did not base their choice of nest-site on habitat characteristics. However, nests were placed significantly further from nests of Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis than would be expected if nest-sites had been chosen at random. Furthermore, in one study area Honey Buzzards appeared to favour areas close to human settlements, perhaps indicating a mechanism to avoid Goshawks, which tend to avoid the proximity of humans. No habitat variable was significantly associated with the loss of Honey Buzzard young, but predation was higher in territories closer to breeding pairs of Goshawks at both study sites. Although Honey Buzzards are restricted to nesting in forests, their choice of nest-site therefore appears to be largely dictated by the distribution of predators. Studies of habitat association may yield misleading results if the effects of predation risk on distribution are not considered.","[Gamauf, Anita] Museum Nat Hist Vienna, Zool Dept 1, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Gamauf, Anita] Univ Vienna, Dept Integrat Zool, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Tebb, Graham] Univ Vet Med, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Nemeth, Erwin] Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Nemeth, Erwin] BirdLife Austria, A-1070 Vienna, Austria","Gamauf, A (corresponding author), Museum Nat Hist Vienna, Zool Dept 1, Burgring 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",anita.gamauf@nhm-wien.ac.at,,"Nemeth, Erwin/0000-0001-9438-1411",Hochschuljubilaumsstiftung [H-1133/04]; Nationalparkplanung Donau Auen,"The study was funded by the Hochschuljubilaumsstiftung H-1133/04 and the Nationalparkplanung Donau Auen.

Most studies examine relationships of newcomers with native species, but interactions among introduced species could also affect community shifts. As early ontogenetic stages are particularly vulnerable to biotic interactions, we explored direct and indirect interactions across early life-history stages in space-dominating marine invertebrates. We used introduced ascidians and both native and introduced mussels. To increase generality, we ran our experiments in 2 distant locations, one in the northern and one in the southern hemisphere (Mediterranean and South Africa). We found no sperm interference between the ascidians, nor were there interspecific effects on settlement or metamorphosis success. However, larvae of the ascidian species reacted to each other by shifting from aggregated to random settlement. Juvenile mussels consumed large numbers of ascidian larvae, though larvae that avoided mussel predation showed higher settlement success. Mussel species in the southern hemisphere locality (native Perna perna and introduced Mytilus galloprovincialis) consumed more ascidian larvae than mussels in the northern locality (native M. galloprovincialis), with a tendency for ascidian larvae to avoid settling close to mussels in the northern locality. We conclude that larval consumption by mussels affects the establishment of ascidians, but that the magnitude of this effect is context dependant.

[Poaceae]) is an ornamental and invasive grass native to Asia that has naturalized in several areas of the Middle Atlantic United States. Predicting how likely miscanthus is to become invasive in other areas of the US is a concern of ecologists and horticulturists. The objective of this study was to measure the competitive ability of miscanthus with an aggressive native grass, switchgrass (Pancium virgatum L. [Poaceae]), in order to show which grass would be more likely to dominate when the two species were grown together. Although switchgrass is a smaller plant than miscanthus, in this greenhouse experiment it was significantly taller and had more vegetative and flowering culms than miscanthus. Miscanthus however, was a stable competitor and did not significantly change in shoot or root dry weight as 2 and 4 switchgrass plants replaced the respective number of miscanthus plants in each treatment. When miscanthus biotypes from four locations were compared, the Pennsylvania biotype was significantly larger and more competitive with switchgrass than was the Washington, DC biotype. As switchgrass plants were replaced with miscanthus, the shoot and root dry weights of the remaining switchgrass plants increased significantly, showing a higher competitive ability of switchgrass. Despite the fact that switchgrass was more competitive with itself than miscanthus, the highest overall dry weight per treatment contained eight switchgrass plants. Miscanthus showed stable, competitive growth when planted together with switchgrass and it is predicted to likely do the same in a field setting.","[Meyer, Mary Hockenberry; Paul, Joe; Anderson, Neil O.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Meyer, MH (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, 424 Alderman Hall, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",meyer023@umn.edu,,"Hockenberry Meyer, Mary/0000-0002-5457-200X",,,,46,18,20,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Little is known about how interaction of these chemicals with other biotic and abiotic stressors impact mosquito populations. We used two levels of nutrient (low and high) and four larval densities (10, 20, 30, 40) to examine the effects of low concentrations of insecticide malathion, on Culex pipiens L mosquitoes experiencing stress from larval competition. Addition of malathion at the high nutrient condition enhanced survival with increasing larval densities, but this effect was not observed at low nutrient condition. Males exposed to malathion were significantly larger than those from control treatments while the effect of malathion on size of females varied with larval density and the level of nutrients. Larval exposure to malathion and low nutrient resulted in significantly larger females with increases in larval densities compared with other treatments. The effect of malathion on male longevity varied with larval density and amount of nutrients. At higher densities, male longevity was consistently higher in low nutrient than in high nutrient conditions and addition of malathion in high nutrient treatment increased male longevity at the highest density. These effects are most likely attributable to release from competition among survivors after mortality from malathion and density-dependent effects. We conclude that biotic conditions of the larval habitat can alter the impact of low concentrations of chemical contaminants on mosquito populations in ways that may influence the pattern of disease transmission and the outcome of vector control efforts.

We modelled prey perception in different species of echolocating bats and show that differences in sensory systems can be important for shaping the niches of animals and for structuring animal communities. We argue that sensory specialization can lower interspecific competition by making the same world appear different. We specifically raise the claim that it is important to consider the interaction of sensory bias and the distribution of (prey) resource size. Using a modeling approach we assessed the potential contribution of sensory bias for species coexistence for the example of bat echolocation. We show that even relatively small sensory differences among coexisting species can translate into significant differences in access to food resources, if prey size distribution is skewed towards small prey. Specifically, for the prey size distribution occurring most frequently in nature, differences in sensory access to resources seem large enough to relax competition and facilitate species coexistence. Interaction between sensory bias and prey size distribution in a way that enhances species coexistence may be a general phenomenon not limited to bat echolocation.","[Safi, Kamran] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Safi, Kamran] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; [Siemers, Bjoern M.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Sensory Ecol Grp, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany","Safi, K (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Schlossallee 2, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany.",ksafi@orn.mpg.de; siemers@mail.orn.mpg.de,"Safi, Kamran/B-2079-2008","Safi, Kamran/0000-0002-8418-6759",Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society; SNSFSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PBZHA-118824],"We are grateful to C.

In contrast, the dominant factor affecting stem volume in the thinned plot was BA throughout stand development. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between BA and CI continued to increase after canopy closure and size rank among individuals became increasingly fixed.

Existing theory suggests that high resource competition can lead to mutualism. However, this is based on an analysis that need only apply near equilibrium, and experimental demonstrations of such mutualism are rare. Two alternative approaches to measuring food web mutualism are examined here. These are based on the population level effects of adding or removing a consumer species or on the amount of additional mortality that can be applied to one consumer without excluding it. Both measures suggest that mutualism is likely to be confined to two situations: when overlap in resource use by the consumers is very low and when the consumers are inefficient users of their resources. Competition between resources is also likely to increase the occurrence and magnitude of hypercompetition between consumers, where the reduction in population size caused by the introduced consumer is greater than that caused by a consumer that is identical to the resident species. Competition between resources can also increase the negative interaction between consumers by destabilizing the dynamics of the system. Such destabilization can cause negative indirect interactions between specialist consumers having no overlap in resource use.","Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Environm Risk, Ecol Risk Res Sect, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Zool Bldg,25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",abrams@zoo.utoronto.ca; mifuyun@hawaii.edu,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008; Nakajima, Mifuyu/N-5337-2015","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X; Nakajima, Mifuyu/0000-0001-7778-2029",,,,54,19,20,0,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

There have, however, been no studies on the cost of sharing an intermediate host with other parasites in terms of reduced adult parasite fecundity. Even if larval parasites suffer a reduction in size, caused by crowding, virtually nothing is known about longer-lasting effects after transmission to the definitive host. This study is the first to use in vitro cultivation with feeding of adult trematodes to investigate how numbers of parasites in the intermediate host affect the size and fecundity of adult parasites. For this purpose, we examined two different infracommunities of parasites in crustacean hosts. Firstly, we used experimental infections of Maritrema novaezealandensis in the amphipod, Paracalliope novizealandiae, to investigate potential density-dependent effects in single-species infections. Secondly, we used the crab, Macrophthalmus hirtipes (Ocypodidae), naturally infected by the trematodes, M. novaezealandensis and Levinseniella sp., the acanthocephalan, Profilicollis spp., and an acuariid nematode. These four helminths all develop and grow in their crustacean host before transmission to their bird definitive host by predation. In experimental infections, we found an intensity-dependent establishment success, with a decrease in the success rate of cercariae developing into infective metacercariae with an increasing dose of cercariae applied to each amphipod. In natural infections, we found that M. novaezealandensis-metacercariae achieved a smaller volume, on average, when infrapopulations of this parasite were large. Small metacercariae produced small in vitro-adult worms, which in turn produced fewer eggs. Crowding effects in the intermediate host thus were expressed at the adult stage in spite of the worms being cultured in a nutrient-rich medium. Furthermore, excystment success and egg-production in M. novaezealandensis in naturally infected crabs were influenced by the number of co-occurring Profilicollis cystacanths, indicating interspecific interactions between the two species. Our results thus indicate that the infracommunity of larval helminths in their intermediate host is interactive and that any density-dependent effect in the intermediate host may have lasting effects on individual parasite fitness.

Predators with differing foraging modes may have different effects on prey behavior, and these effects may be transmitted differently through food webs. Here we test the hypothesis that shifts in the type of predator present in a food web indirectly affect the prey's resource independent of changes in the density of prey. We assessed the importance of predator identity in mediating the grazing effects of the freshwater snail Physa integra on its periphyton resources using field and mesocosm studies. Field observations showed that Physa used covered habitats more in ponds containing fish than in ponds containing crayfish or no predators at all. A field experiment confirmed that snail behavior depended on predator identity. Physa placed near caged pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) selected covered habitats, but Physa placed near caged crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) moved to the surface of the water. The effects of predator identity on periphtyon were then examined in a mesocosm experiment, using caged predators. Habitat use of Physa was similar to their habitat use in the field experiment. In the presence of caged sunfish, periphyton standing crop in covered habitats was reduced to 34% of the standing crop in the presence of crayfish. In contrast, periphyton in near-surface habitats was 110% higher in the presence of fish than in the presence of crayfish. Thus, the effects of predator identity on Physa behavior cascaded through the food web to affect the abundance and spatial distribution of periphyton.","Clar Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16412 USA","Bernot, RJ (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 232 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

Thus, the biological control of herbivorous arthropods can be either enhanced or disrupted by introducing a predator species to an existing host-parasitoid system. We evaluate the impact of introducing a predator, the convergent ladybird beetle, Hippodamia convergens, on the biological control of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, by the parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes, under field conditions. Predation on immature parasitoids by H. convergens was intense: 98-100% of aphid mummies were consumed by the end of the experiment, and H. convergens substantially reduced immature parasitoid populations. Despite the negative impact of H. convergens on aphid parasitoids, aphid population suppression was greatest in treatments containing both H. convergens and parasitoids. The parasitoid alone or in combination with H. convergens suppressed cotton aphids in a density-dependent manner and increased total plant leaf area and biomass, H. convergens did not substantially alter the percentage of aphids mummified by parasitoids and showed a partial feeding preference for unparasitized aphids over aphid mummies. We conclude that under conditions where a predator shows both a partial preference for unparasitized hosts and high levels of predation on unparasitized hosts, we may expect the predator to improve suppression of herbivores even if it produces high levels of intraguild predation. While intraguild predation is an important ecological interaction in the early-season cotton agroecosystem, it does not disrupt cotton aphid biological control.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Colfer, RG (corresponding author), Mission Organ, POB 2357, Salinas, CA 93902 USA.",ramy@nsfoods.com,,,,,,78,133,138,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2001,126,2,,,,,292,304,,10.1007/s004420000510,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393XK,WOS:000166494800018,28547629,,,,2021-09-21,

Both ayu and pale chub attacked conspecifics with larger fish tending to be dominant. Pale chub never attacked ayu, but ayu occasionally attacked pale chub that invaded their territory, regardless of their body size. When ayu was present, pale chub employed algal feeding less frequently and snapped at an object on the water surface more frequently. The feeding behavior and habitat use of ayu also differed between streams where pale chub were present or absent in some periods.

Overwintering individuals of this species, and of native ladybirds, were collected from early season alfalfa in northern Utah during the period of initial establishment of the invader (1989 to 1999), and were measured for body size. Adult body size can vary widely within insect species, often reflecting differential success of individuals as immatures in obtaining food. Here I examine patterns of ladybird body size to address two questions associated with the establishment of C. septempunctata: (1) is there evidence for adverse impact on native species?, and (2) why has the invader has been so successful in establishment As an indirect test of adverse competitive effect of the invader on native species, I determined whether mean body size of adults of the five most common native species (Coccinella tranversoguttata, Hippodamia convergens, H. quinquesignata; H sinuata, and H, tredecimpunctata) declined over the period 1991-1997 as the invader increased rapidly in abundance. No such decline was observed for any of these species, thus providing no evidence that the invader's establishment has significantly increased scramble competition for food among immature ladybirds. I also compared body size distribution of the invading species with that of native species. The invader was distinctive in having particularly large variation in body size among individuals (i.e., in having relatively high proportions of both unusually large and small individuals). Such results are consistent with the hypothesis that the invader's success derives from being a generalist with much ecological flexibility in regard to the conditions under which it engages and succeeds in reproduction.","Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Evans, EW (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ewevans@biology.usu.edu,,,,,,50,55,57,0,24,"CZECH ACAD SCI, INST ENTOMOLOGY",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"BRANISOVSKA 31, CESKE BUDEJOVICE 370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,1802-8829,,EUR J ENTOMOL,Eur.

We studied (1) larval feeding, walking, intraspecific interactions (cannibalism, touch-avoidance responses and/or touching with palps and tarsi) and tendency to aggregate (when resting), (2) predation and cannibalism on phytoseiid eggs by young females and (3) the effects of starvation for 10 days on young females relative to ambulation speed, longevity, fecundity, progeny survival and sex ratio. Larvae of T. athiasae were almost inert, did not feed and hardly walked or interacted whereas larvae of N. californicus fed, walked and interacted, mainly by touching with palps and tarsi. No cannibalism in the larval stage was observed for either species. The presence of prey increased the larval walking and intraspecific interactions of N. californicus but not of T. athiasae. Egg predation by adult females of both species was substantially higher than cannibalism, implying that both are capable of distinguishing their eggs from those of other species. Soaking eggs for 30 min in deionized water increased cannibalism in both species. During the 10 days of starvation, the ambulation speed of adult female N. californicus ranged from 1.8 to 10.1 times that of T. athiasae. The 50% lethal time value (LT50) of T. athiasae (6.0 days) was significantly lower than that of N. californicus (10.4 days). None of the starved T. athiasae recuperated following the reintroduction of prey, whereas 75% of N. californicus did and oviposited after 2 days. These traits should enable N. californicus to persist when prey is scarce; however the selective predation of N. californicus eggs by T. athiasae could prevent establishment of N. californicus.

Most of the analysis is based on a consumer-resource model introduced by Robert MacArthur. Contrary to many statements in the literature and in textbooks, measures of competition may decrease as similarity increases and may be greatest when similarity of the two species' sets of resource capture rates is very low. High competition with low similarity may occur whether competition is measured by a competition coefficient near equilibrium or is measured by the proportional increase in a species' population density when its competitor is removed. However, these two measures may differ considerably and may change in opposite directions with a given change in similarity. The general conditions required for such counterintuitive relationships between similarity and competition are that the consumer species have relatively low resource requirements for successful reproduction and that the resources be self-reproducing. These same conditions also frequently lead to exclusion of one or more resources via apparent competition, and this is always true of MacArthur's model. A variety of other models of competition are analyzed, and circumstances most likely to produce large competitive effects with little overlap are identified.","Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,46,71,74,0,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5801 S ELLIS AVENUE, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance. There was a high degree of uncertainty predicted and observed in the study system. Despite this, I show that the degree and the sources of uncertainty were predictable for each species. This suggests that the inverse community matrix offers a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the outcome of field press experiments.","YALE UNIV,CTR COMPUTAT ECOL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511","Schmitz, OJ (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH FORESTRY & ENVIRONM STUDIES,370 PROSPECT ST,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511, USA.",,,,,,,54,96,98,1,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1997,78,1,,,,,55,69,,,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WD345,WOS:A1997WD34500004,,,,,2021-09-21,

Least weasels (Mustela nivalis) hunt in dense plant cover, whereas kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) hunt in habitats with sparse plant cover. Field voles (Microtus agrestis), the main food of weasels and kestrels, prefer open country with a high grass layer. We simulated a multipredator environment in an aviary (3.0 x 4.8 x 2.2 m) to find out whether predator facilitation plays a role in the interactions between voles, small mustelids, and raptors. In each replicate, we placed a field vole in a pen including sides of high and low grass layers (cover and open). In a predator-free situation, voles preferred cover but shifted to open when a weasel was introduced to cover. In the presence of a kestrel, voles occupied cover and decreased their mobility In the presence of a kestrel plus a kestrel, voles behaved as under the kestrel risk alone. Therefore, in these aviary circumstances, voles perceived the kestrel risk as greater than the weasel risk. Predator facilitation in the assemblage of predators subsisting on rodent prey may contribute to the crash of the four-year vole cycle: microhabitat shift due to an avoidance of weasel jaws may drive voles to raptor talons.",,"Korpimaki, E (corresponding author), UNIV TURKU, DEPT BIOL, ECOL ZOOL LAB, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND.",,,,,,,40,89,96,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The model parameters were estimated from field data, with the exception of three parameters, for which a range of plausible values was selected. Most parameter combinations generated high-amplitude, chaotic oscillations with a distinct periodic component; the median parameter values predicted dynamics closely resembling the observed 3-5 yr rodent oscillations in northern Fennoscandia. The results were not sensitive to a number of structural changes in the model, suggested by empirical observations: stochastic variation in the prey-carrying capacity, predator refuge at low density, predation on mustelids by large generalist predators in the years when rodents decline, and an alternative assumption about winter breeding in rodents. The model-predicted period and amplitude of oscillations agreed most closely with observations when the model included a low-density refuge for the mustelids. Another predator-prey model with ratio-dependent functional response did not predict dynamics resembling the observed dynamics. The present results provide further support to the hypothesis that the rodent oscillations are maintained by delayed density dependence imposed by specialist predators. Our results also suggest that the dynamics may be chaotic, with a periodic component, rather than a limit cycle with environmental stochasticity.","UNIV TURKU,DEPT BIOL,ECOL ZOOL LAB,SF-20500 TURKU,FINLAND","HANSKI, I (corresponding author), HELSINKI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DIV ECOL,POB 17,P RAUTATIEKATU 13,SF-00014 HELSINKI,FINLAND.",,,,,,,55,138,139,2,45,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,1995,76,3,,,,,840,850,,10.2307/1939349,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QU358,WOS:A1995QU35800014,,,,,2021-09-21,

The predictions are that early maturity and high gonadal investment will occur: (1) in large and fast-growing juveniles; (2) in populations with low adult:juvenile growth ratios; (3) in populations with low density; and (4) in the absence of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), a competing congener. Predictions 1 and 4 were fully supported and Prediction 2 was partly supported, but Prediction 3 was not. The earliest maturing juveniles within populations were significantly larger than conspecifics of the same age that did not mature. Females from a lake population that were transplanted into a fishless pond exhibited both significantly faster growth and a significantly higher gonad to body mass ratio (gonadosomatic index) than females living in the lake. At the population level, juvenile growth was significantly correlated with age at maturity (r = -0.53), but not with gonadosomatic index, whereas the Adult: Juvenile Growth Ratio showed a significant, negative correlation with gonadosomatic index (r = -0.66), but not with mean age at maturity. Mean age at maturity showed a stronger correlation with the indicator of life-span and adult survival rate (r = 0.74), suggesting that mortality is more important than growth in the shaping of reproductive life histories of pumpkinseed. High population density was associated with early maturity and high gonadal investment, the opposite of what was predicted. However, pumpkinseed populations that co-occurred with bluegills did mature significantly later and at a larger size and tended to have a lower gonadal investment than populations living in waterbodies without bluegills. This difference in reproductive patterns in the presence of bluegill is consistent with two-stage life history theory and may be the result of a direct effect of bluegills on pumpkinseed growth and survivorship, as well as differences in environmental conditions where the two species do or do not co-occur.",,"FOX, MG (corresponding author), TRENT UNIV,ENVIRONM & RESOURCE STUDIES PROGRAM,PETERBOROUGH K9J 7B8,ON,CANADA.",,,,,,,63,104,108,0,81,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1994,75,4,,,,,1157,1171,,10.2307/1939439,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NP103,WOS:A1994NP10300028,,,,,2021-09-21,

Surveys of naturally breeding populations on an experimental pond site indicated that the two species often compete in the larval phase, and because both species may overwinter as larvae, interactions can occur between disparate size (year) classes. Using an additive design, I conducted field experiments manipulating densities of four species-class combinations (year I and II bullfrogs and green frogs) in the presence of low numbers of the other classes. The design permitted estimates of the effect of manipulated species/classes on different target classes and, because the latter were held constant, the effects of manipulated classes on themselves. Strong competitive effects were found within and between species/classes with one important exception. Neither class of green frogs affected small bullfrogs despite the fact that both had strong effects on large bullfrogs. Both classes of bullfrogs, however, affected both classes of green frogs. In general, smaller classes had a greater per unit biomass effect on target classes than larger classes and tolerated competitive effects better. Independent of size effects, bullfrogs appeared to be better competitors than green frogs because of other traits, presumably greater activity levels. I interpret these results in terms of a simple model of the ontogenetic scaling of foraging costs and gains. This model enables a mechanistic interpretation of the above results through the two components of competitive interactions, effect and response. Larger classes have greater per capita effects on resources, but because the gain curve is decelerating, smaller classes have greater per unit biomass effects. On the other hand, smaller classes respond less to competitors because net gain for these classes is higher of affected less by a decline in resources. I argue that to understand size-structured interactions in many taxa, we must first isolate the underlying ontogenetic or size-scaling component of competitive relations, and then add to these relations the effects of unique species traits.",,"WERNER, EE (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT BIOL, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,66,123,127,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1994,75,1,,,,,197,213,,10.2307/1939394,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MP602,WOS:A1994MP60200019,,,,,2021-09-21,

While describing spatiotemporal patterns in animal movement from tracking data is common, understanding the associated search strategies employed continues to be a key challenge in ecology. Moreover, studies in marine ecology commonly focus on singular aspects of species' movements, however using multiple analytical approaches can further enable researchers to identify ecological phenomena and resolve fundamental ecological questions relating to movement. Here, we used a set of statistical physics-based methods to analyze satellite tracking data from three co-occurring apex predators (tiger, great hammerhead and bull sharks) that predominantly inhabit productive coastal regions of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. We analyzed data from 96 sharks and calculated a range of metrics, including each species' displacements, turning angles, dispersion, space-use and community-wide movement patterns to characterize each species' movements and identify potential search strategies. Our comprehensive approach revealed high interspecific variability in shark movement patterns and search strategies. Tiger sharks displayed near-random movements consistent with a Brownian strategy commonly associated with movements through resource-rich habitats. Great hammerheads showed a mixed-movement strategy including Brownian and resident-type movements, suggesting adaptation to widespread and localized high resource availability. Bull sharks followed a resident movement strategy with restricted movements indicating localized high resource availability. We hypothesize that the species-specific search strategies identified here may help foster the co-existence of these sympatric apex predators. Following this comprehensive approach provided novel insights into spatial ecology and assisted with identifying unique movement and search strategies. Similar future studies of animal movement will help characterize movement patterns and also enable the identification of search strategies to help elucidate the ecological drivers of movement and to understand species' responses to environmental change.","[Calich, Hannah J.; Pattiaratchi, Charitha] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Perth, WA, Australia; [Calich, Hannah J.; Pattiaratchi, Charitha; Sequeira, Ana M.

Herbivore-associated cues to host selection at the plant and leaf scale aid understanding of mechanisms responsible for host preference that might translate into increased performance, as well as processes structuring herbivore populations mediated by interactions. We investigated how changes induced by a galling insect in the tropical fern Cyathea phalerata act as repellent or attractant cues for sawfly feeding and the effects of leaf size on herbivory levels. We recorded gall abundance, damage by chewers, leaf size, plant nutritional quality, phenolic concentration and leaf anatomical traits between galled and non-galled leaf samples. Galled samples contained less N, higher levels of phenolics and higher C/N ratio. However, leaf-chewing damage did not differ between galled and non-galled leaves. The gall structure was avoided by chewers, as it had high concentrations of phenolics, lignification and suberization. Larger leaves sustained higher gall abundance, but leaf size did not have a significant effect on chewer damage. A co-occurrence index calculated for both guilds indicated that galls and chewers exhibited a distribution that did not differ from random, reinforcing that the two guilds on C. phalerata do not show patterns of repulsion such as those maintained by interspecific competition. Sawflies dismissing chemical cues indicate that the increase in phenolics caused by galling insects does not generate increased protection of the galled pinnules. Our results highlight ferns as key resources for herbivores and as a potential plant group to study new research avenues on plant-insect interactions.","[de Farias, R. P.; da Costa, L. E.

Here, we used a long-term plant survey between 2006 and 2012 in 46 French vineyards and quantified the effects of management practices (tillage, mowing, and herbicide) on colonization, germination, and seed survival of 30 weed species in relation to their seed mass. To do so, we used a recent statistical approach to reliably estimate demographic parameters for plant populations with a seed bank using time series of presence-absence data, which we extended to account for interspecies variation in the effects of management practices on demographic parameters. Our main finding was that when the level of disturbance increased (i.e., in plots with a higher number of herbicides, tillage, or mowing treatments), colonization success and survival in large-seeded species increased faster than in small-seeded species. High disturbance through tillage increased survival in the seed bank of species with high seed mass. The application of herbicides increased germination, survival, and colonization probabilities of species with high seed mass. Mowing, representing habitats more competitive for light, increased the survival of species with high seed mass. Overall, the strong relationships between the effects of management practices and seed mass provide an indicator for predicting the dynamics of weed communities under disturbance.","[Kazakou, Elena] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, CEFE, Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro,Montpellier Supagro,CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Fried, Guillaume] Anses, Lab Sante Vegetaux, Unite Entomol & Plantes Invas, Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Cheptou, Pierre-Olivier; Gimenez, Olivier] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, CEFE, Univ Montpellier, CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France","Kazakou, E (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, CEFE, Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro,Montpellier Supagro,CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France.",elena.kazakou@cefe.cnrs.fr,,"Gimenez, Olivier/0000-0001-7001-5142",French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-16-CE02-0007],OG was funded by the French National Research Agency (grant ANR-16-CE02-0007).,,52,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here we reconstruct yearly scale growth of three Puget Sound (PS) Chum Salmon Oncorhynchus keta stocks over 16 brood years (1997-2012) to better understand how variation in marine growth may be related to environmental factors, intra- and interspecific competition, and stock productivity. Generalized additive mixed models identified copepod species richness in the northern California Current and the abundance of PS Pink Salmon O. gorbuscha and Chum Salmon as strong predictors of first-year growth, the latter indicative of density-dependent effects as the abundance of local competitors (Pink and Chum salmon) increased. Second-year growth was negatively related to the Aleutian Low-Beaufort Sea Anticyclone (ALBSA), a recently defined metric of the Aleutian Low, and showed a nonlinear positive to negative relationship with sea surface temperature in the Gulf of Alaska. Puget Sound Chum and Pink Salmon abundances were also significantly related to second-year growth but did not suggest density-dependent effects like those observed in ocean year 1. Third-year growth was closely related to large-scale climate indicators, demonstrating a nonlinear negative to positive relationship with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, a negative relationship with ALBSA, and a negative relationship with North Pacific Pink Salmon abundance when catch statistics indicated that abundance was high. Models indicated that PS Chum Salmon stock productivity (recruits per spawner) was positively correlated with back-calculated first-year growth and negatively correlated with second- and third-year growth, suggesting that for brood years whose surviving adults experienced rapid early marine growth, there were cohort survival benefits. As new relationships between large-scale indicators and Pacific salmon stocks are identified, incorporating these indicators into forecasting efforts is paramount for effective and sustainable management of fishery resources.","[Anderson, Austin J.; Claiborne, Andrew M.; Agha, Mickey; Litz, Marisa N.

In 1971-1989, the vendace stock was strong and exhibited a two-year cycle. In 1990-1999, extreme weather conditions and predation resulted in recruitment failures, after which overfishing kept year-classes small. From 2000 onwards, the two-year oscillations were re-established at a lower level. Here, we show that the two-year cyclicity prevalent in the 1980s was consistent with the hypothesis of asymmetric competition between adults and juveniles. Food consumption by juveniles of strong year-classes retarded growth and weakened condition of the co-occurring adults, resulting in less abundant year-classes. In 2000-2018, the role of intraspecific competition diminished due to interspecific competition from increased populations of other planktivorous fish, preventing vendace from attaining higher abundance. Elevated temperature probably confounded the effects of competition, but its direct role was masked by simultaneous gradual eutrophication and fish assemblage changes.","[Sarvala, Jouko] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Helminen, Harri] Luostarinkatu 3, FI-20700 Turku, Finland","Sarvala, J (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",jouko.sarvala@utu.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [09/109, 09/074, 1071004]; Foundation for the Study of Natural Resources in Finland; Lake Pyhajarvi Fisheries Management Association; Water Protection Association for SW Finland; Lake Pyhajarvi Collaborative Task Force; municipality of Sakyla; Department of Biology, University of Turku","This work was funded mainly by grants from the Academy of Finland to JS (09/109, 09/074, 1071004).

For managers to effectively identify trade-offs and avoid their undesirable outcomes, they must understand the agents involved and their corresponding interactions. A literature review of interspecific trade-offs within freshwater and marine ecosystems was conducted to illustrate the scope of potential interspecific trade-offs that may occur. We identified common pitfalls that lead to failed recognition of interspecific trade-offs, including, single-species management and limited consideration of the spatial and temporal scale of ecosystems and their management regimes. We devised a classification framework of common interspecific trade-offs within aquatic systems. The classification can help managers determine whether the conflict is species based through direct relationships (i.e., predator-prey, competition, other antagonistic relationships) or indirect relationships involving intermediate species (i.e., conflict-generating species) or whether the conflict is driven by opposing management objectives for species that would otherwise not interact (i.e., nontarget management effects). Once the nature and scope of trade-offs are understood, existing decision-making tools, such as structured decision-making and real-options analysis, can be incorporated to improve the management of aquatic ecosystems.

However, these concepts have been comparatively understudied in agricultural systems despite their potential to infer nutrient limitation and interspecific resource competition. Methods This study established a model mixed pasture system to assess tissue C:N and C:P stoichiometry and aboveground biomass (AGB) in a grass (Phalaris aquatica) and legume (Trifolium vesiculosum) under factorial inputs of high and low nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), in monoculture and mixture. Due to inherent trait diversity, we expected grass and legume growth, shoot vs root stoichiometry and N:P homeostasis to differ in response to nutrient limitation and between monoculture and mixture. Results Grass AGB was greater with N addition and in mixture, and legume AGB was decreased by N but increased by P, more so in mixture. Nutrient limitation in grass was determined via a strong coupling of growth with shoot stoichiometry, by which AGB decreased and C:N increased under N limitation. Legume growth was not correlated with tissue stoichiometry, but potential for growth limitation by N and P was detected via increased shoot C:N under low N and P, and C:P under low P. Legume shoot N:P was more homeostatic than grass, and grass shoot N:P homeostasis was greater in mixtures than in monocultures. Conclusions Integrating ecological stoichiometry alongside trait-based ecology is a useful tool for predicting how fertiliser management may affect nutrient balance and species dominance in mixed pasture agroecosystems.","[Ball, K.

Coastal habitat restoration has predominantly emphasized designs that minimize physical stress and competition. As evidence of the pervasiveness of this approach, we conducted a global survey of seagrass restorationers and found a strong affinity for stress-avoidant designs with adult shoots in dispersed rather than aggregated configurations. To test the alternative hypothesis that including positive interactions can enhance restoration success, we experimentally incorporated: (i) interspecific facilitation (clam additions) into seed sowing, and (ii) both intra- and interspecific facilitation (planting a single-large versus multiple-small patches and adding clams) into shoot planting. Clam additions to seeds significantly enhanced plant biomass and patch size; and nutrient analysis suggested the causative mechanism was clam enhancement of available nitrogen. In contrast, adult outplant growth was enhanced by intra- but not interspecific facilitation. Dispersed configurations consistently declined, whereas large-intact patches, which had the same initial biomass as dispersed plots, increased in patch area and doubled in shoot density. These results demonstrate that expanding restoration strategies to include positive interactions with respect to seagrass ontogeny has the capability to switch the trajectory of restoration from failure to success.","[Zhang, Y.

Based on this model, we propose a new theory to explain patterns of species abundance, assuming a trade-off between competitive ability and fecundity among species. This model makes testable predictions about species positions in the rank abundance diagram under a discrete species competitiveness.

One hypothesis is that gray fox declines may result from interspecific interactions, particularly competition with abundant coyotes (Canis latrans Say, 1823). Alternatively, gray foxes may respond negatively to increased urbanization and reduced forest cover. To evaluate these hypotheses, we used single-species occupancy models of camera trap data to test the effects of habitat covariates, such as the amount of urbanization and forest, on coyote and gray fox occupancy. Additionally, we test the effect of an index based on an N-mixture model of the number of coyotes at each camera trap site on gray fox occupancy. Results indicate that occupancy probabilities of coyote and gray fox relate positively to the amount of forest, but they provided no evidence urban cover impacts gray foxes. Additionally, gray fox occupancy was negatively related to the index of the number of coyotes at each site. Our models support the idea that interactions with coyotes impact gray fox occupancy across the eastern United States. These results illustrate how large-scale studies can relate mechanisms identified within specific landscapes to phenomena observed at larger scales.","[Egan, Michael E.; Day, Casey C.; Zollner, Patrick A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Katzner, Todd E.] US Geol Survey, Boise, ID 83706 USA","Egan, ME (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",MichaelEgan93@gmail.com,"Day, Casey/AAY-1146-2021",,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire Stennis project [1010322],"We thank the hundreds of volunteer camera trappers who worked long hours in cold winter weather to collect the data that were used in this project.

Interactions vary from agonistic to cooperative and should result in predictable patterns in trait and range evolution. However, despite a conceptual understanding of these processes, they have been difficult to model, particularly on macroevolutionary timescales and across broad geographic spaces. Here, we investigate the influence of biotic interactions on trait evolution and community assembly inmonitor lizards (Varanus). Monitors are an iconic radiation with a cosmopolitan distribution and the greatest size disparity of any living terrestrial vertebrate genus. Between the colossal Komodo dragon Varanus komodoensis and the smallest Australian dwarf goannas, Varanus length and mass vary by multiple orders of magnitude. To test the hypothesis that size variation in this genus was driven by character displacement, we extended existing phylogenetic comparative methods which consider lineage interactions to account for dynamic biogeographic history and apply these methods to Australian monitors and marsupial predators. Incorporating both exon-capture molecular and morphological data sets we use a combined evidence approach to estimate the relationships among living and extinct varaniform lizards. Our results suggest that communities of Australian Varanus show high functional diversity as a result of continent-wide interspecific competition among monitors but not with faunivorous marsupials. We demonstrate that patterns of trait evolution resulting from character displacement on continental scales are recoverable from comparative data and highlight that these macroevolutionary patterns may develop in parallel across widely distributed sympatric groups.","[Brennan, Ian G.; Keogh, J.

Among Coleoptera, dung beetles are one of the groups that display this behavior. Although diverse aspects of natural history have been reviewed, no agreement exists on which theory may explain this food searching tactic. We performed a systematic literature review about this behavior in dung beetles, analyzing existing studies, and discussing potential explanations. We identified six different hypotheses (resource partitioning, food detection, foraging time, predator's avoidance, thermoregulation, and resting). Based on the evidence that we found, we support the hypothesis that the main driver of perching behavior is a strategy of spatial segregation. We found reports for several tribes in different biogeographical regions, especially in Neotropical forests. Few studies explore the relationship between perching height and dung beetles' size. However, recent findings sustained that dung beetles perch at a height proportional to its size, large beetles prefer bigger leaves, and functional groups perch at different heights. Dung beetles observed perching were strictly coprophagous and there is no specific relationship between dial activity and perching behavior. We also found perching records of the three main functional guilds (tunnelers, rollers, and dwellers). Despite several studies of dung beetles perching, there is a lack of experimental analyses. One aspect to analyze in future investigations is the relationship between perching behavior and functional traits. Finally, it is essential to explore and solve some questions that we propose to understand the functional role of this behavior in the structure of assemblages.

As a result, browsing pressure in forests is increasing and concerns about the effects of increasingly common multi-species deer communities on forestry are rising. However, we currently lack an understanding of how the composition of deer communities affects browsing damage, particularly with respect to the role of species with different dietary requirements. Further, the relative importance of predictors of browsing damage in systems with multiple browsers remains elusive. Here, we used data from Swedish management, which is monitoring ungulates and their damage to forests, to test how deer densities, forage availability, and winter severity predict browsing damage on commercially important Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) at national and regional scales. Moose (Alces alces) is the main browser of Scots pine, but competes with other deer over more preferred forage. During winter, a higher index of moose density was associated with higher browsing damage in northern Sweden, where there is low competition from other deer. In southern Sweden, competition from other deer is higher and a higher density index of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was associated with higher winter damage. However, there was no relationship between moose density and damage. We suggest that moose are forced to browse more pine due to interspecific competition over alternative forage resources in the south, yielding stronger relationships between densities of competing deer species and damage than between moose density and damage. Pine density, a proxy for forage availability, was an equally or more important determinant for browsing damage as deer density indices in most regions. Increasing pine density was associated with reduced browsing damage caused in winter in all regions and reduced damage caused in summer in central Sweden. Increased winter severity, as an index of snow depth, predicted increased winter damage in the northern region only. To reduce winter damage, our results suggest that management should consider deer densities and forage availability simultaneously, while adopting a multi-species approach. Results varied among regions, with densities of other deer being more relevant in the south and winter severity more relevant in the north. Management data did not predict summer damage well. Since national models did not capture regional variations, we conclude that management decisions and actions need to be tailored to the regional or local scale.","[Pfeffer, Sabine E.; Singh, Navinder J.; Cromsigt, Joris P.

This scenario becomes more evident in human-dominated landscapes where homogenization of space can contribute to the shortage of resources, modifying species feeding behavior to an uncertain degree. Understanding how these species modify their feeding habits within the context of habitat transformation is of special interest. We evaluated the diversity of prey and overlap for two predators, the chilla fox Lycalopex griseus and the barn owl Tyto alba, during three seasons in 2018 (winter, spring and summer). The study was based on the analysis of feces and pellets in a landscape with agricultural predominance in Southern-central Chile. We found the chilla fox had a generalist dietary profile, feeding on a broad spectrum of prey, with predominance of lagomorphs and, to a lesser extent, rodents.In contrast, the diet of the barn owl mainly consisted of small rodents, with little variation across seasons. Analyses of dietary overlap showed fluctuations during the periods surveyed, with a maximum value in winter and a minimum value in spring. Variations in the consumption of prey based on their size could facilitate their coexistence in the study area.","[Zuniga, A.

Trait-based mechanistic modelling is an important tool to unravel and quantify various direct and indirect interactions between species. The present study explores whether MacArthur's consumer-resource model can be used as a viable base model to predict dinoflagellate growth in closed multispecies systems. To this end, two batch culture experiments (294 cultures in total) with monocultures and multispecies cultures of Alexandrium minutum, Prorocentrum lima, P. micans, Protoceratium reticulatum and Scrippsiella trochoidea were performed. Despite changes to the relative (different nitrate concentrations) and absolute nutrient availability (dilutions of L1 medium), P. micans outcompeted all other species in mixed cultures. Consumer-resource modelling parameterized using monoculture growth correctly predicted this species dominance (R-2 between 0.80 and 0.95). Parameter estimates revealed that P. micans had a faster uptake of nitrogen when compared to its competitors, but did not differ in resource efficiency and natural mortality rate. Yet, while the model accurately predicted community dynamics during the growth phase, it was not able to predict their dynamics beyond the point of quiescence. Consumer-resource modelling was shown to differentiate the roles of resource assimilation, resource efficiency, and natural mortality rates in batch culture experiments with minimal data requirements beyond common measurements. The results suggest that consumer resource models provide a promising basis for trait-based modelling of interspecific competition between (harmful) algae.","[De Rijcke, M.; Vandegehuchte, M.

This is difficult to explain because many interspecies interactions are competitive, and ecological theory predicts that one species will drive the extinction of another species that competes for the same resource. Conversely, evolutionary theory proposes that natural selection can lead to coexistence by driving competing species to use non-overlapping resources. However, evolutionary escape from extinction may be slow compared to the rate of competitive exclusion. Here, we use experimental co-cultures of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the evolution of coexistence in species that compete for resources. We find that while E. coli usually outcompetes S. cerevisiae in co-culture, a few populations evolved stable coexistence after similar to 1000 generations of coevolution. We sequenced S. cerevisiae and E. coli populations, identified multi-hit genes, and engineered alleles from these genes into several genetic backgrounds, finding that some mutations modified interactions between E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Together, our data demonstrate that coexistence can evolve, de novo, from intense competition between two species with no history of coevolution.","[Barber, Jake N.; Sezmis, Aysha L.; Woods, Laura C.; Anderson, Trenton D.; Voss, Jasmyn M.; McDonald, Michael J.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Monash, Vic, Australia","McDonald, MJ (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Monash, Vic, Australia.",mike.mcdonald@monash.edu,,"Novais Barbosa, Judite/0000-0003-1852-2790; Woods, Laura/0000-0003-4525-4760; McDonald, Michael/0000-0002-5735-960X",ARC Discovery GrantAustralian Research Council [DP180102161]; ARC Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT170100441],MJM was supported by ARC Discovery Grant (DP180102161) and an ARC Future Fellowship (FT170100441).,,63,3,3,12,25,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1751-7362,1751-7370,,ISME J,ISME J.,MAR,2021,15,3,,,,,746,761,,10.1038/s41396-020-00810-z,,OCT 2020,16,Ecology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,QM1BA,WOS:000582287900001,33093620,,,,2021-09-21,

Previous work has demonstrated differences in assertiveness at strain level within one species, and revealed either exclusion of competitors by complementary partner strains or their inhibition by single strains. This work addresses interspecies differences in the assertiveness of L. curvatus and L. sakei. Strain sets of L. curvatus and L. sakei were employed as starters in a fermented sausage model and their abundancy upon fermentation was determined by strain-specific MALDI-TOF MS identification. Generally, single or groups of L. sakei strains outcompeted L. curvatus strains. In multiple growth tests employing mMRS and mMSM it could be shown that assertive L. sakei strains can be predicted along their mu max in mMSM. Still, L. curvatus TMW 1.624 could suppress all L. curvatus and most L. sakei strains in competitive settings. This could be referred to its expression of several bacteriocins, which are active against all of the L. curvatus strains. Strain specific differences could be demonstrated in the susceptibility of L. sakei to bacteriocins, and in oxidative stress tolerance, which is higher in co-existing L. sakei strains than in the bacteriocin producer. This suggests that tolerance to bacteriocins and oxidative stress represent additional determinants for assertiveness, above previously reported bacteriocin production versus metabolic complementarism of partner strains.","[Janssen, Dorothee; Dworschak, Lena; Ehrmann, Matthias A.; Vogel, Rudi F.] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Tech Mikrobiol, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Ludwig, Christina] Tech Univ Munich, Bayer Zentrum Biomol Massenspektrometrie BayBioMS, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Vogel, RF (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Tech Mikrobiol, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",rudi.vogel@tum.de,,,"German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) via the German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF); Research Association of the German Food Industry (FEI) [AiF 18552N, 19690N]",Part of this work was supported by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) via the German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) and the Research Association of the German Food Industry (FEI) projects AiF 18552N and 19690N.,,50,0,0,3,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1605,1879-3460,,INT J FOOD MICROBIOL,Int.

In woodpeckers (Picidae), co-existence is frequently accompanied by plumage convergence. A particularly striking case concerns three woodpecker species in the Atlantic Forest of South America: Robust Woodpecker (Campephilus robustus), Lineated Woodpecker (Dryocopus lineatus) and Helmeted Woodpecker (Celeus galeatus), which show a remarkable degree of plumage similarity thought to result from convergence due to interspecific social dominance mimicry (ISDM). We studied the foraging ecology and interactions of these three species in old-growth forests and selectively logged forests to test the extent to which these species differ in various aspects of their foraging ecology, and we examined whether particular foraging requirements may help explain the association of the threatened Helmeted Woodpecker with mature forests. The species selected different tree species, tree diameters, foraging heights, decay states of trees and decay states of substrates, resulting in marked niche separation among the three species. Proportionally, the Robust Woodpecker chiselled more, Helmeted Woodpecker used more probing and Lineated Woodpecker used more hammering. Helmeted Woodpecker was the only species that included bamboos as foraging substrates, and it foraged more on dead wood than Lineated or Robust Woodpeckers, but mostly on small dead branches in live trees rather than standing dead trees. Foraging requirements are not the most likely factor explaining the association of Helmeted Woodpecker with mature forests. Limited resource and substrate overlap among the three woodpecker species, lack of interspecific interactions, and rarity of the Helmeted Woodpecker do not match predictions if these species were conforming to a mimicry complex under the hypothesis of ISDM. Instead, plumage convergence may aid in interactions with third species, or impart advantages in intraspecific competition.","[Fernandez, Juan Manuel] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CICyTTP, Diamante, Entre Rios, Argentina; [Fernandez, Juan Manuel] Univ Nacl Nordeste, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat & Agrimensura, Ave Independencia 5470, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina; [Areta, Juan Ignacio] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Bio & Geociencias Noroeste Argentino IBIGEO, Lab Ecol Comportamiento & Sonidos Nat, Ave 9 Julio 14, RA-4405 Rosario De Lerma, Salta, Argentina; [Lammertink, Martjan] Univ Nacl Misiones, CONICET, Inst Biol Subtrop, Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [Lammertink, Martjan] Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA","Fernandez, JM (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CICyTTP, Diamante, Entre Rios, Argentina.; Fernandez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Nordeste, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat & Agrimensura, Ave Independencia 5470, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina.",fzjmanuel@gmail.com,,"Fernandez, Juan Manuel/0000-0003-4979-2670",Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Neotropical Birds program; Forest Park Foundation Fund for Conservation Collaborations; National GeographicNational Geographic Society; Aves Argentinas,"Comments and recommendations from two reviewers and the Subject Editor Jan Lifjeld much improved our manuscript.

However, there might be large discrepancies between the speed of the upward shift of the climatic niche and the actual migration velocity of the species, especially in long-lived organisms such as trees. In fact, most studies did not find any significant upward shift of the distributional limits of temperate forest trees over the last decades. It therefore beckons the questions why trees are moving upslope much slower than their bioclimatic envelope and what are the implications for ecosystem functioning. Here, we compared the simulations of the upslope displacement of the bioclimatic envelope of 16 tree species inhabiting temperate mountain forests under ongoing and future climate change obtained by correlative species distribution models (SDMs) to those from a dynamic forest model accounting for dispersal, competition and demography. We then partitioned the discrepancy in upslope migration velocity between the SDMs and the dynamic forest model into different components by manipulating dispersal limitation, interspecific competition and demography. Tree species in the dynamic forest model migrated only slowly upslope in contrast to the SDMs. Most of the difference in migration velocity can directly be attributed to tree's demography (long life cycle), followed by effects of competition and only a marginal contribution of dispersal limitation. Additionally, lower elevation species ('non-treeline') shifted slower upslope than high elevation species ('treeline') indicating a strong effect of interspecific competition at their leading edge. Synthesis. Forests have a high inertia to climate change because of their longevity and ability to acclimatize to high climatic fluctuations. Lower elevation tree species (deciduous) only slowly establish in stands at higher elevation where coniferous species dominate and likely profit from facilitation by disturbance events. Therefore, forest ecosystems seem to persist, even if climate becomes unfavourable, until they approach a tipping point at which an extreme event (e.g. drought, storm or insect attack) leads to a large dieback and resource change enabling new suitable species to spread and establish.","[Scherrer, Daniel; Vitasse, Yann; Wohlgemuth, Thomas; Lischke, Heike] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Scherrer, Daniel; Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Surface Dynam, Lausanne, Switzerland","Scherrer, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.; Scherrer, D (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland.",daniel.scherrer@wsl.ch,"Vitasse, Yann/K-3349-2017; Wohlgemuth, Thomas/E-6588-2016; Lischke, Heike/J-5719-2013; Scherrer, Daniel/K-3416-2013; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011","Vitasse, Yann/0000-0002-7454-505X; Wohlgemuth, Thomas/0000-0002-4623-0894; Lischke, Heike/0000-0003-4284-5194; Scherrer, Daniel/0000-0001-9983-7510; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815",Swiss National Forest Inventory by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment FOEN; Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [CR23I2_162754]; SwissForestLab,"D.S. acknowledges funding from the Swiss National Forest Inventory run by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment FOEN and the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.

Using data from 47 North American sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations, we present evidence that the magnitude and direction of climate and competition effects vary over large spatial scales. In the south, a warm ocean and abundant salmon competitors combined to strongly reduce sockeye productivity, whereas in the north, a warm ocean substantially increased productivity and offset the negative effects of competition at sea. From 2005 to 2015, the approximately 82 million adult pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) produced annually from hatcheries were estimated to have reduced the productivity of southern sockeye salmon by similar to 15%, on average. In contrast, for sockeye at the northwestern end of their range, the same level of hatchery production was predicted to have reduced the positive effects of a warming ocean by similar to 50% (from a similar to 10% to a similar to 5% increase in productivity, on average). These findings reveal spatially dependent effects of climate and competition on sockeye productivity and highlight the need for international discussions about large-scale hatchery production.","[Connors, Brendan] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, 9860 W Saanich Rd, Sidney, BC V8L 5T5, Canada; [Malick, Michael J.] NOAA, NRC Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Ruggerone, Gregory T.] Nat Resources Consultants Inc, Seattle, WA 98199 USA; [Rand, Pete; Campbell, Robert; Gorman, Kristen] Prince William Sound Sci Ctr, POB 705,300 Breakwater Ave, Cordova, AK 99574 USA; [Adkison, Milo; Gorman, Kristen] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Irvine, James R.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Pacific Biol Stn, 3190 Hammond Bay Rd, Nanaimo, BC V9T 6N7, Canada","Connors, B (corresponding author), Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, 9860 W Saanich Rd, Sidney, BC V8L 5T5, Canada.",brendan.connors@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,,"Malick, Michael/0000-0002-8376-5476; Irvine, Jim/0000-0002-5314-0109; Gorman, Kristen B./0000-0002-0258-9264",National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; State of Alaskan Salmon and People project,"We are grateful for the efforts of the many technicians and biologists who gathered and processed the salmon data used in this manuscript and to Jeanette Clark, Rich Brenner, and Stephanie Freund for compiling it.

When different species produce acoustic signals simultaneously, the signals create a noisy environment, with potential acoustic interference between species. Theoretical studies suggest that such reproductive interference may have strong effects on species interaction. For example, the inferior resource competitor can survive if its disadvantage is counterbalanced by superiority in reproductive interference. Two field cricket species, Teleogryllus occipitalis (Audinet-Serville) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) and Loxoblemmus equestris Saussure (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), cooccur in the same habitat. A previous study has shown that L. equestris is an inferior species to T. occipitalis in terms of resource competition. Therefore, we predicted that mate location and choice behavior of female T. occipitalis would be negatively affected by the acoustic signals of L. equestris and tested this with a series of playback experiments.The mate choice behavior of female T. occipitalis was not significantly affected by the calling song of L. equestris. Our results suggest that the acoustic interference does not explain the cooccurrence of the two species in the same habitat.","[Kuriwada, Takashi; Kawasaki, Rintaro; Kuwano, Akifumi] Kagoshima Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Sci Educ, Lab Zool, Korimoto 1-20-6, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Reddy, Gadi V.

Here, we developed an integrative framework and synthesized data from 256 studies of intraguild predation, scavenging, kleptoparisitism and resource availability to examine global patterns of suppression and facilitation. Large carnivores were responsible for one third of mesocarnivore mortality (n = 1,581 individuals), and intraguild mortality rates were superadditive, increasing from 10.6% to 25.5% in systems with two vs. three large carnivores. Scavenged ungulates comprised 30% of mesocarnivore diets, with larger mesocarnivores relying most heavily on carrion. Large carnivores provided 1,351 kg of carrion per individual per year to scavengers, and this subsidy decreased at higher latitudes. However, reliance on carrion by mesocarnivores remained high, and abundance correlations among sympatric carnivores were more negative in these stressful, high-latitude systems. Carrion provisioning by large carnivores may therefore enhance suppression rather than benefiting mesocarnivores. These findings highlight the synergistic effects of scavenging and predation risk in structuring carnivore communities, suggesting that the ecosystem service of mesocarnivore suppression provided by large carnivores is strong and not easily replaced by humans.","[Prugh, Laura R.; Sivy, Kelly J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Prugh, LR (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lprugh@uw.edu,,,Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1652420] Funding Source: Medline,,,99,28,29,4,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

The woodpecker killed 2 piculet nestlings but did not consume or remove them to feed its own nestlings. The attack could have been motivated by territorial defense, and to reduce competition for nest sites, since the piculet nest was within the territory of the woodpecker, and near its active nest and one of its most consumed sap trees. The observations described here provide new ethological information about the levels of aggression of the White-fronted Woodpecker, and suggests that interspecific competition likely could constitute one of the causes of nest failure among Neotropical woodpeckers.

This phenomenon is an important metric for understanding community functional dynamics, yet the use of spatial patterns for predicting microbial interactions is currently lacking. Here we propose supervised deep learning as a new tool for network inference. An agent-based model was used to simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of two interacting organisms under diverse growth and interaction scenarios, the data of which was subsequently used to train deep neural networks. For small-size domains (100 mu m x 100 mu m) over which interaction coefficients are assumed to be invariant, we obtained fairly accurate predictions, as indicated by an average R-2 value of 0.84. In application to relatively larger domains (450 mu m x 450 mu m) where interaction coefficients are varying in space, deep learning models correctly predicted spatial distributions of interaction coefficients without any additional training. Lastly, we evaluated our model against real biological data obtained using Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli co-cultures treated with polymeric chitin or N-acetylglucosamine, the hydrolysis product of chitin. While P. fluorescens can utilize both substrates for growth, E. coli lacked the ability to degrade chitin. Consistent with our expectations, our model predicted context-dependent interactions across two substrates, i.e., degrader-cheater relationship on chitin polymers and competition on monomers. The combined use of the agent-based model and machine learning algorithm successfully demonstrates how to infer microbial interactions from spatially distributed data, presenting itself as a useful tool for the analysis of more complex microbial community interactions.

Partitioning of space and time can reduce competition by decreasing the frequency of interspecific encounters that exploit a common resource base. We investigated temporal and spatial partitioning of tigers (Panthers tigris), leopards (Panthera pardus), dholes (Cuon alpinus), and their ungulate prey in Thung Yai Naresuan (East) Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand from April 2010 to January 2012. We collected camera trap data from 106 locations over 1,817 trap nights. Kernel density estimation and Spearnian's rank correlation were used to quantify temporal and spatial activity patterns. Pianka's index was used to investigate the temporal and spatial overlap for each species pair. Tigers (crepuscular activity pattern) showed no temporal correlation with leopards (mostly diurnal) or dholes (strongly diurnal), but leopard activity appeared to correlate positively with dhole activity. Tigers exhibited temporal overlap with larger gaur (Bos gaurus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor); leopards did so with barking deer (Muntiacus munqak) and wild boar (Sus scrota); and dholes did so with barking deer and wild boar. The spatial correlations of tigers, leopards, and dholes did not significantly overlap, though numerically overlap was higher between felids than with the canid. None of the three predators significantly correlated with prey distribution, except for dholes with sambar. Our findings suggest that tigers, leopards, and dholes co-occur with spatial and temporal partitioning due to differences in prey activity and low overlap in space use correlated to prey preference. The partition in space and time between tigers and leopards can minimise their competition-associated prey activity, while leopards and dholes seem to be more generalist and not spatially correlated with each other.","[Vinitpornsawan, Supagit; Fuller, Todd K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Vinitpornsawan, Supagit] Wildlife Conservat Off, Natl Pk Wildlife & Plant Conservat Dept, 61 Paholyathin Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand","Fuller, TK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",tkfuller@eco.umass.edu,,,"Wildlife Conservation Society; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Rhino-Tiger Conservation Fund; Thailand Wildlife Research Division, Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation","We acknowledge the Wildlife Conservation Society; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Rhino-Tiger Conservation Fund; and the Thailand Wildlife Research Division, Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation for supporting this work.

Mating system evolution is therefore expected to profoundly affect the covariation between secondary sexual traits and mating success. Whereas there is such evidence at the interspecific level, data within species remain scarce. We here investigate sexual selection acting on the exaggerated male fore femur and the male wing in the common and widespread dung flies Sepsis punctum and S. neocynipsea (Diptera: Sepsidae). Both species exhibit intraspecific differences in mating systems and variation in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) across continents that correlates with the extent of male-male competition. We predicted that populations subject to increased male-male competition will experience stronger directional selection on the sexually dimorphic male foreleg. Our results suggest that fore femur size, width and shape were indeed positively associated with mating success in populations with male-biased SSD in both species, which was not evident in conspecific populations with female-biased SSD. However, this was also the case for wing size and shape, a trait often assumed to be primarily under natural selection. After correcting for selection on overall body size by accounting for allometric scaling, we found little evidence for independent selection on any of these size or shape traits in legs or wings, irrespective of the mating system. Sexual dimorphism and (foreleg) trait exaggeration is therefore unlikely to be driven by direct precopulatory sexual selection, but more so by selection on overall size or possibly selection on allometric scaling.","[Baur, Julian; Roy, Jeannine; Schafer, Martin A.; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.

However, what actually drives social affinity between species in the wild will depend on the characteristics of the species available to group. Here we first present an agent-based model that predicts trait-related survival benefits from mixed-species group formation in a multi-species community and we then test the model predictions in a community-wide field study of African savannah herbivores using multi-layered network analysis. We reveal benefits from information transfer about predators as a key determinant of mixed-species group formation, and that dilution benefits alone are not enough to explain patterns in interspecific sociality. The findings highlight the limitations of classical ecological approaches focusing only on direct trophic interactions when analysing community structure and suggest that declines in species occupying central social network positions, such as key informants, can have significant repercussions throughout communities.","[Meise, Kristine; Bro-Jorgensen, Jakob] Univ Liverpool, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Inst Integrat Biol, Neston CH64 7TE, England; [Meise, Kristine; Franks, Daniel W.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Franks, Daniel W.] Univ York, Dept Comp Sci, York YO10 5GH, N Yorkshire, England","Bro-Jorgensen, J (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Mammalian Behav & Evolut Grp, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Inst Integrat Biol, Neston CH64 7TE, England.",bro@liv.ac.uk,,"Franks, Daniel Wayne/0000-0002-4832-7470","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L007185/1, NE/L007266/1]","We are grateful to the Kenyan National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation, the Narok County Government, the Chief Park Warden of the Masai Mara National Reserve, and the Kenya Wildlife Service for permission to conduct the fieldwork.

While broad trophic guilds (e.g., frugivore, insectivore) of bats are recognized, details of diet and similarities among species remain largely unknown. We used stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) to characterize the community structure of a diverse Neotropical bat fauna from Belize to test predictions of niche theory and the competitive exclusion principle. We predicted that (1) interspecific variation in isotopic overlap would be greater within guilds than between guilds, and (2) no two sympatric populations would have isotopic niches that overlap completely, unless there is variation along some other axis (e.g., temporal, spatial). We additionally tested body size as an explanatory metric of potential overlap and predicted that larger-bodied animals would have greater niche breadths. Results suggest that while guild-level characterizations of communities are at least somewhat informative, there are multiple examples of intra- and inter-guild species pairs with significantly overlapping isotopic niches, suggesting that, counter to predictions, they may compete for resources. Understanding the trophic structure of animal communities is fundamental to conservation and management of endangered species and ecosystems and important for evolutionary studies, and stable isotope analyses can provide key insights as well as informing hypotheses of the diet of species that are not well known. in Spanish is available with online material.","[Oelbaum, Phillip J.; Broders, Hugh G.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Fenton, M.

In recent decades, Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic, has undergone concurrent increases in the availability of the forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) and the number of migratory harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) during the open-water period; however, the impacts of these changes on endemic Arctic species, such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida), have received little attention. We coupled stomach contents with stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of muscle and liver to determine the extent of potential competition between ringed seals (n=91) and harp seals (n=39) in Cumberland Sound. Isotopic niche breadth was greater for ringed seals (95% ellipse: 10.08 parts per thousand(2)) than for harp seals (95% ellipse: 8.00 parts per thousand(2)), and harp seal isotopic niche overlapped more with ringed seal isotopic niche than vice versa, suggesting asymmetrical competition potential. Although there was high overlap in isotopic niche breadth (range 50.3-91.0%) and prey species consumed (Schoener's Index 0.60), stomach content analysis revealed differences in prey species proportions and size composition, thereby reducing the degree of realized niche overlap. Harp seals consumed a higher biomass of fish (66.7%) than did ringed seals (31.9%), and harp seals also consumed larger capelin (64-200mm), polar cod (Boreogadus saida; 28-194mm), and Liparidae (55-115mm) than ringed seals (63-154mm, 20-189mm, and 16-128mm, respectively).

An approach to answering this question is to examine spatial patterns of coexistence among putatively competing species. The degree to which interspecies competition predominates in a community can have important effects on our ability predict the response of that community to perturbations, most notably climate change, when shifting species' ranges may result in novel species assemblages. We present a study on the avifauna of the Eastern Himalayas. We hypothesize that in a community where competitive interactions predominate, there will be a relationship between pairwise altitudinal overlaps and morphological differences between species. Moreover, we hypothesize that both morphological traits and altitudinal traits depart from a Brownian motion evolution model, resulting in species trait covariances having a phylogenetic component. We find a significant relationship between morphological dissimilarity and altitudinal overlaps of species pairs. We also find that closely related species are significantly more altitudinally stratified than a null model would predict. However, as more distantly related species pairs are included in the analysis, this pattern disappears, indicating that competitive interactions predominate only in closely related species. This is further suggested by the fact that altitudinal ranges themselves are phylogenetically overdispersed at the genus level, as are morphological traits. This effect disappears when the entire phylogeny is examined, with morphology and altitude being phylogenetically underdispersed. Model fitting suggests that individual clades have evolved towards local clade-specific fitness peaks, while within-clade results show evidence of niche partitioning. We interpret these results as a tension between competition on shorter time scales and selection on longer time scales, where competition forces closelyrelated species away from fitness peaks in order to allow for niche separation and hence coexistence, suggesting that this effect is partially responsible for the recent diversification of Eastern Himalayan avifauna.","[Surya, Gautam S.; Keitt, Timothy H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Surya, Gautam S.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA","Surya, GS (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.; Surya, GS (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA.",gsurya@wcs.org,"Keitt, Timothy H./AAF-9787-2021","Keitt, Timothy H./0000-0002-4587-1083","Indo-US Science and Technology Forum - Research Internships in Science and Engineering fellowship; University of Texas, Department of Integrative Biology startup grant; Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund [140510101]; Indo-US Science and Technology Forum's RISE fellowships; University of Texas's Integrative Biology Department","This work was funded by Indo-US Science and Technology Forum - Research Internships in Science and Engineering fellowship (no grant number available) - awarded to GSS, https://www.iusstf.org/program/research-internships-in-science-engineering; University of Texas, Department of Integrative Biology startup grant (no grant number available) - awarded to GSS; and Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (Project 140510101) - awarded to GSS, https://www.speciesconservation.org/.The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.; Funding for this project was obtained from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum's RISE fellowships and the University of Texas's Integrative Biology Department.

Most studies of species co-occurrence have focused on negative association patterns (segregation presumed to arise from competition), often ignoring positive aggregations, although positive and negative associations may arise from multiple mechanisms. We used a pairwise approach to identify co-occurrence patterns of 76 fish species across almost 9500 lakes, followed by a meta-analytic approach to compare the co-occurrence pattern of each species pair across watersheds and determine their cumulative species associations. Biological information relating to species' phylogeny, habitat preferences, and diet was used to group species into relevant subsets in order to test community assembly processes of competition, predation, and habitat filtering. We found consistent non-random patterns of co-occurrence in nearly half the species pairs and more extremely aggregated than segregated species pairs. Observed co-occurrence patterns indicated the importance of shared habitat requirements and predation, rather than competition, driving positively aggregated and negatively segregated species associations, respectively. Our meta-analytic approach incorporating important biological attributes permitted the testing of specific mechanisms of community assembly, providing novel insights into the major determinants of fish community structure and their generality across a vast set of lakes.","[Cordero, Ruben D.; Jackson, Donald A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Jackson, DA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",don.jackson@utoronto.ca,"Cordero, Ruben/AAV-8025-2021","Cordero, Ruben/0000-0002-2128-6904",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We would like to thank H.

A dedicated rhino sanctuary was established in 1986 as part of efforts by the Kenyan government to safeguard the remaining populations of the critically endangered black rhino, and now contains more than 13% of the national population. In response to the challenges involved in observing black rhinos in their natural habitat, population numbers in the sanctuary are monitored using night censuses based on observation of rhino visits to artificial water holes. The 2019 night census recorded 96.2% of the known rhinos in the sanctuary, confirming that this is reliable method for monitoring rhino populations, with potential for use in other areas. It also provides information on health and population structure that are not obtainable by other methods. The results indicate that numbers of black rhino in the sanctuary continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate than in previous years. This slowdown likely reflects intraspecific competition for food resources as population density now stands at more than double the recommended ecological carrying capacity (EEC). The survey also found evidence of interspecific competition with other browsers, as well as a threat from predation of young animals by hyenas. We recommend further study of all these aspects, as well as continued translocation of surplus rhinos from the sanctuary to repopulate surrounding areas.","[Kiambi, Sospeter; Muriithi, Kenneth; Waiguchu, Grace; Ochieng, Kenneth] Kenya Wildlife Serv, Tsavo West Natl Pk, POB 71, Mtito Andel 90128, Kenya; [Khayale, Cedric; Kariuki, Linus; Omondi, Patrick] Kenya Wildlife Serv, Biodivers Res & Planning, POB 40241, Nairobi 00100, Kenya","Kiambi, S (corresponding author), Kenya Wildlife Serv, Tsavo West Natl Pk, POB 71, Mtito Andel 90128, Kenya.",kiambis@kws.go.ke,,,Zoological Society of London (ZSL),"We thank KWS Tsavo NP management for facilitating the night census.

Here, we explored the FRs of two land snails that occur in south-western Ontario, one native (Mesodon thyroidus) and one non-indigenous (Cepaea nemoralis) to Canada. The non-indigenous species appears to have low ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities. Consistent with theory, while both species conformed to Type II functional responses, the native species had a significantly higher attack rate (5.30 vs 0.41, respectively) and slightly lower handling time (0.020 vs 0.023), and hence a higher maximum feeding rate (50.0 vs 43.5). The non-indigenous species exhibited a significantly longer time to contact for a variety of food types, and appeared less discriminating of paper that was offered as a non-food type. The non-indigenous species also ate significantly less food when in mixed species trials with the native snail. These feeding patterns match the known low ecological impact of the introduced snail and are consistent with the view that it is an inferior competitor relative to the native species. However, field experimentation is required to clarify whether the largely microallopatric distributions of the two species in south-western Ontario reflect competitive dominance by the native species or other factors such as habitat preference, feeding preferences or predator avoidance. The relative patterns of feeding behaviour and ecological impact are, however, fully in line with recent functional response theory and application.","[Hoxha, Tedi; Crookes, Steve; MacIsaac, Ian; Chang, Xuexiu; Johansson, Mattias; MacIsaac, Hugh J.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Crookes, Steve] Univ Guelph, Biodivers Inst Ontario, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Chang, Xuexiu; MacIsaac, Hugh J.] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Johansson, Mattias] Univ North Georgia, Dept Biol, Gainesville, GA USA; [Dick, Jaimie T.

This creates context dependencies for microbial interactions that are based on the functional composition of the community. Context dependent interactions are ecologically important and clearly present in nature, yet firmly established theoretical methods are lacking from many modern computational investigations. Here, we propose a novel network inference method that enables predictions for interspecies interactions affected by shifts in community composition and species populations. Our approach first identifies interspecies interactions in binary communities, which is subsequently used as a basis to infer modulation in more complex multi-species communities based on the assumption that microbes minimize adjustments of pairwise interactions in response to neighbor species. We termed this rule-based inference minimal interspecies interaction adjustment (MIIA). Our critical assessment of MIIA has produced reliable predictions of shifting interspecies interactions that are dependent on the functional role of neighbor organisms. We also show how MIIA has been applied to a microbial community composed of competing soil bacteria to elucidate a new finding that - in many cases - adding fewer competitors could impose more significant impact on binary interactions. The ability to predict membership-dependent community behavior is expected to help deepen our understanding of how microbiomes are organized in nature and how they may be designed and/or controlled in the future.","[Song, Hyun-Seob; Lee, Joon-Yong; Nelson, William C.; Fredrickson, Jim K.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Biol Sci Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Haruta, Shin] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan; [Lee, Dong-Yup] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Bioproc Technol Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Lee, Dong-Yup] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Suwon, South Korea; [Lindemann, Stephen R.] Purdue Univ, Dept Food Sci, Whistler Ctr Carbohydrate Res, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Lindemann, Stephen R.] Purdue Univ, Dept Nutr Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bernstein, Hans C.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Tromso, Norway; [Bernstein, Hans C.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Arctic Ctr Sustainable Energy, Tromso, Norway","Song, HS (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Biol Sci Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",hyunseob.song@pnnl.gov,"Nelson, William C/E-9263-2016","Nelson, William C/0000-0002-1873-3929; Bernstein, Hans/0000-0003-2913-7708; Lee, Joon-Yong/0000-0002-5864-8518; Haruta, Shin/0000-0002-3705-2459","US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as part of Foundational Scientific Focus Area (SFA); US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER),Subsurface Biogeochemistry Research (SBR) SFA at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL); DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-76RLO 1830]; US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), Soil Microbiome SFA","This research was supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as part of Foundational Scientific Focus Area (SFA), Soil Microbiome SFA, and Subsurface Biogeochemistry Research (SBR) SFA at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

In whole-ecosystem manipulations of small Caribbean islands on which brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) were the native top predator, we experimentally staged invasions by competitors (green anoles, Anolis smaragdinus) and/or new top predators (curly-tailed lizards, Leiocephalus carinatus). We show that curly-tailed lizards destabilized the coexistence of competing prey species, contrary to the classic idea of keystone predation. Fear-driven avoidance of predators collapsed the spatial and dietary niche structure that otherwise stabilized coexistence, which intensified interspecific competition within predator-free refuges and contributed to the extinction of green-anole populations on two islands. Moreover, whereas adding either green anoles or curly-tailed lizards lengthened food chains on the islands, adding both species reversed this effect-in part because the apex predators were trophic omnivores. Our results underscore the importance of top-down control in ecological communities, but show that its outcomes depend on prey behaviour, spatial structure, and omnivory. Diversity-enhancing effects of top predators cannot be assumed, and non-consumptive effects of predation risk may be a widespread constraint on species coexistence.","[Pringle, Robert M.; Kartzinel, Tyler R.; Hutchinson, Matthew C.; Coverdale, Tyler C.; Daskin, Joshua H.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kartzinel, Tyler R.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Palmer, Todd M.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Thurman, Timothy J.; Xu, Charles C.

Adult females are very efficient in locating aphid infestations over a relatively long range, up to 45 m, and deposit eggs near or within aphid colonies. The predatory larvae are aphid generalists preying on several agriculturally important aphid species. The successful use of this biocontrol agent in agricultural systems depends on several biotic and abiotic factors. Among biotic factors, aphid species, plant structure, interspecific competition and intraguild predation may significantly impact the predator ' s population dynamics. Key abiotic conditions include day lengths (above a critical threshold to prevent diapause), availability of mating sites in the crop, temperature (above 15 degrees C to enable egg laying), air relative humidity (above 70%) and availability of pupation sites. Although several successes have been reported in open field crops with naturally occurring or released populations, commercial releases are primarily used in protected crops. Optimized emergence boxes combining provisioning of food sources for the adults, integration with the technological advances that occurred in the greenhouse environment lately, insights into the nutritional ecology in open field crops and exploration of the genetic variability are proposed as future directions to improve adoption and efficacy of A. aphidimyza in crop protection.

However, the mechanisms that enable long-term coexistence and factors that drive complementary movement are poorly understood. As interspecific interactions can have a large influence on survival and trophic linkages, research on shark assemblages could substantially increase our understanding of marine community dynamics. In this study, we used passive acoustic telemetry to compare the activity space size, spatial overlap and habitat use patterns of six co-occurring shark species from the same family in a tropical nearshore embayment. Our results indicated that all sizes of Rhizoprionodon taylori (a small-bodied, highly productive species) used significantly larger amounts of space (e.g., mean 95% KUD=85.9km(2)) than juveniles of large-bodied, less productive species (e.g., Carcharhinus amboinensis; 62.3km(2)) that use nearshore areas as nursery areas. Most large, less productive species appeared risk averse by using less space, while the smaller more productive species took greater risk by roaming broadly. These movement strategies are likely a means of avoiding predation or gaining access to new or additional resources. Spatial overlap patterns varied substantially between species with overlap in core use areas ranging from 1.2 to 27.6%, but were consistent over time. Most species exhibited low spatial overlap, suggesting spatial partitioning to reduce interspecific competition. While a few species exhibited a high degree of spatial overlap (up to 60% of activity space extent), dietary diversity may reduce competition to support co-occurrence. These data suggest that complex interactions occur in communal nurseries in nearshore waters where species are in direct competition for resources at vulnerable life stages.","[Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.; Munroe, Samantha E.

We have studied whether these effects could alter the probability of local extinction of three predatory mites naturally associated with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in citrus in Spain and, therefore, disrupt the biological control of this phytophagous mite. Laboratory and semi-field results provide evidence that the natural regulation of T. urticae in citrus can be seriously disrupted in a warmer future. On the one hand, T. urticae populations at conditions representative of future hotter and drier summers, could reach higher population densities than forecasted according to its demographic parameters. On the other hand, T. urticae regulation provided by its predators depended on the environmental conditions, was species-specific, and was affected by interspecific interactions. In some cases, one of the predatory mite species in the system could not be recovered. Because there is evidence that the composition of the community under scrutiny is highly sensitive to local habitat conditions, our results can be taken as evidence that local extinctions may occur more frequently in a warmer future and further contribute to an increasingly higher frequency of T. urticae outbreaks.","[Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina; Jaques, Josep A.] UJI, Unitat Associada Entomol UJI IVIA, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Campus Riu Sec,Ave Vicent Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Ibanez-Gual, Victoria] UJI, Dept Matemat, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Montserrat, Marta] Univ Malaga, Inst Hortofruticultura Subtrop & Mediterranea La, Consejo Super Invest Cient IHSM UMA CSIC, Avda Dr Weinberg S-N, Malaga 29750, Spain; [Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina] SAU, Dept Calidad Torres Hnos & Sucs, Pol Ind Agr 2, Almenara 12590, Spain","Jaques, JA (corresponding author), UJI, Unitat Associada Entomol UJI IVIA, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Campus Riu Sec,Ave Vicent Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",josep.jaques@camn.uji.es,"Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo/K-9298-2014; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/AAG-1438-2020; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/J-7922-2017; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina/F-6359-2011; Jaques, Josep A./B-8352-2009; Montserrat, Marta/A-7625-2012","Urbaneja-Bernat, Pablo/0000-0002-6995-5468; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/0000-0001-7043-8233; Gual, Maria Victoria Ibanez/0000-0001-7043-8233; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina/0000-0002-1070-3741; Jaques, Josep A./0000-0003-1353-1727; Montserrat, Marta/0000-0002-6859-4955","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, MINECO [AGL2011-30538-C03-01, AGL2014-55616-C3-3-R]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, MCINNSpanish Government [EEBB-I-14-08555]","This study was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, MINECO, (Grants AGL2011-30538-C03-01 and AGL2014-55616-C3-3-R) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, MCINN, (Grant EEBB-I-14-08555).",,83,4,4,0,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

A backbone of classic niche theory is that local coexistence of competitors is favoured by the contraction or divergence of species' niches. However, this effect should depend on the diversity of resources available in the local environment, particularly when resources vary in multiple ecological dimensions. Here, we investigated how available resource breadth (i.e. prey diversity) and competition together shape multidimensional niche variation (between and within individuals) and interspecific niche overlap in 42 populations of congeneric tropical frog species. We modelled realized niches in two key trophic dimensions (prey size and carbon stable isotopes) and sampled available food resources to quantify two-dimensional resource breadth. We found a 14-fold variation in multidimensional population niche width across populations, most of which was accounted for by within-individual diet variation. This striking variation was predicted by an interaction whereby individual niche breadth increased with resource breadth and decreased with the number of congeneric competitors. These ecological gradients also interact to influence the degree of niche overlap between species, which surprisingly decreased with population total niche width, providing novel insights on how similar species can coexist in local communities. Together, our results emphasize that patterns of exploitation of resources in multiple dimensions are driven by both competitive interactions and extrinsic factors such as local resource breadth.","[Costa-Pereira, Raul] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Biodiversidade, Rio Claro, Brazil; [Costa-Pereira, Raul; Araujo, Marcio S.] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Rio Claro, Brazil; [Costa-Pereira, Raul; Ingram, Travis] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Souza, Franco L.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Campo Grande, Brazil; [Costa-Pereira, Raul] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Costa-Pereira, R (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Biodiversidade, Rio Claro, Brazil.; Costa-Pereira, R (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Rio Claro, Brazil.; Costa-Pereira, R (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.; Costa-Pereira, R (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",raulcpereira@gmail.com,"Costa-Pereira, Raul/A-5527-2018; Araujo, Marcio Silva/G-9485-2011","Costa-Pereira, Raul/0000-0003-2370-5866; Araujo, Marcio Silva/0000-0003-3533-744X; Souza, Franco Leandro/0000-0002-7041-4036","Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ) [UoO1409]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/20924-5, 2017/20069-6, 2010/15567-8]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [301306/2018-4]","T.I., M.S.A., and R.C.-P. received support from the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund (UoO1409).

We propose that there are three distinct components to liana-tree interactions: prevalence, defined as the proportion of infested trees; load, defined as the mean liana cover on infested trees; and tolerance, defined as the effect of a given level of infestation on tree population growth rates. We introduce a new metric that integrates these components, the liana burden, defined as the total effect of lianas on per capita population growth rates given current prevalence, load, and tolerance. Using these metrics, we quantify variation among 33 co-occurring tropical tree species in liana-tree interactions and its relation with shade-tolerance. The focal tree species vary strongly in liana prevalence, load, tolerance, and burden. Interspecific variation in tolerance is the largest contributor to interspecific variation in burden. Species rankings of per capita population growth rates under current liana infestation levels differ somewhat from rankings under liana-free conditions, and differ strongly from rankings under uniformly high liana infestation. Thus, lianas alter competitive hierarchies to benefit tree species that are relatively tolerant of and/or resistant to lianas. Among the focal tree species, shade-tolerance is positively correlated with liana tolerance and prevalence, but largely unrelated to load and burden, meaning shade-tolerance does not predict which species are competitively disadvantaged by lianas. We describe a variety of mechanisms by which lianas may potentially increase or decrease niche differences among tree species, including interactions with spatial and temporal environmental niche partitioning, and potential differences among tree species in relative vulnerability to different liana species. Synthesis. Lianas, like other natural enemies, can in principle alter competitive hierarchies and niche structure of co-occurring tree species, and our analyses suggest such influences are substantial in our focal tropical tree community and likely many other tree communities as well. Quantifying these effects requires a more comprehensive approach including analyses and modelling of dynamics of liana-tree interactions and their variation with tree and liana species identities.","[Muller-Landau, Helene C.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Visser, Marco D.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Muller-Landau, HC (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama.",mullerh@si.edu,,"Muller-Landau, Helene/0000-0002-3526-9021","Andrew W.

The authors equipped 48 wind masts with arrays of two microphones and located the vertical distribution of a community of 19 bat species and two species groups over their annual activity period (> 8000 nights). The authors tested the correlation between the proportion of flights at height and the acoustic features of bat calls as well as their wing morphology. The authors found that call peak frequency and bandwidth are good predictors of bat use of the vertical space regardless of their acoustic strategies (i.e., gleaning, hawking, or detecting prey flutter). High wing aspect ratios and high wing loadings were associated with high proportions of time spent at height, confirming hypotheses from the literature.

Within each substrate, competition for space and resources is vital for the local persistence of fungi. The capacity to detect and respond by dispersal away from unfavorable conditions may confer higher fitness in fungi. Informed dispersal theory posits that organisms are predicted to detect information about their surroundings which may trigger a dispersal response. As such, we expect that fungi will increase allocation to dispersal in the presence of a strong competitor. In a laboratory setting, we tested how competition with other filamentous fungi affected the development of conidial pycnidiomata (asexual fruiting bodies) in Phacidium lacerum over 10 days. Phacidium lacerum was not observed to produce more asexual fruiting bodies or produce them earlier when experiencing interspecific competition with other filamentous fungi. However, we found that a trade-off existed between growth rate and allocation to dispersal. We also observed a defensive response to specific interspecific competitors in the form of hyphal melanization of the colony which may have an impact on the growth rate and dispersal trade-off. Our results suggest that P. lacerum have the capacity to detect and respond to competitors by changing their allocation to dispersal and growth. However, allocation to defence may come at a cost to growth and dispersal. Thus, it is likely that optimal life history allocation in fungi constrained to ephemeral resources will depend on the competitive strength of neighbors surrounding them.","[Chan, Justin Y.; Bonser, Stephen P.; Cornwell, William K.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Powell, Jeff R.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia","Chan, JY (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",justin.y.chan@unsw.edu.au,"; Powell, Jeff/A-5076-2010","Bonser, Stephen/0000-0002-6608-9912; Cornwell, Will/0000-0003-4080-4073; Powell, Jeff/0000-0003-1091-2452",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP160103765],"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP160103765",,59,2,2,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Selected transformants were analysed by whole-genome sequencing. In addition, bioinformatics analyses and in silico gene flow prediction were also performed to support the experimental results. Transformant strains included some that became resistant to carbapenems or changed their antimicrobial susceptibility profile. Foreign DNA acquisition was confirmed by whole-genome analysis. The acquired DNA most frequently identified corresponded to mobile genetic elements, antimicrobial resistance genes and operons involved in metabolism. Bioinformatics analyses and in silico gene flow prediction showed continued exchange of genetic material between A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae when they share the same habitat.

Dispersal evolution is driven by a trade-off between costs and benefits, which is influenced by interindividual variability and local environmental conditions (context-dependent dispersal). Many studies have investigated how dispersal decisions may be influenced by environmental factors, including density, predation and interspecific competition. Yet few have attempted to examine how habitat disturbance may affect the dispersal process in spatially structured populations. In early successional species, one might expect individuals to adjust their dispersal decisions based on two main factors that potentially have an influence on reproductive success: patch size and the level of patch disturbance. In this study, we examined how these two factors affect breeding success and dispersal decisions in an early successional amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad, Bombina variegata. To this end, we used capture-recapture data collected on a spatially structured population occupying 28 breeding patches. We took advantage of recent developments in multievent capture-recapture models to detect signs of context-dependent dispersal. The results revealed that the probability of successful reproduction and the number of newly metamorphosed individuals increased with both the size and the proportion of disturbance of a patch. In addition, our results showed that the factors affecting breeding success also influenced breeding dispersal probability. Large patch size negatively influenced emigration probability; in contrast, it positively influenced immigration probability. Equally, higher disturbance had a strong negative influence on emigration probability and slightly positively affected immigration probability. These findings strongly suggest that individuals make context-dependent dispersal decisions, adjusted to maximize future fitness prospects in a patch, allowing them to better cope with rapid changes in environmental conditions resulting from the ecological succession process. This opens new areas of potential research into the role of dispersal in organism specialization along an ecological succession gradient. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Most AHL receptors are thought to be specific for their cognate signal, ensuring that bacteria cooperate and share resources only with closely related kin cells. Although specificity is considered fundamental to QS, there are reports of promiscuous receptors that respond broadly to nonself signals. These promiscuous responses expand the function of QS systems to include interspecies interactions and have been implicated in both interspecies competition and cooperation. Because bacteria are frequently members of polymicrobial communities, AHL cross talk between species could have profound impacts. To better understand the prevalence of QS promiscuity, we measured the activity of seven QS receptors in their native host organisms. To facilitate comparison of our results to previous studies, we also measured receptor activity using heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. We found that the standard E. coli methods consistently overestimate receptor promiscuity and sensitivity and that overexpression of the receptors is sufficient to account for the discrepancy between native and E. coli reporters. Additionally, receptor overexpression resulted in AHL-independent activity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using our activation data, we developed a quantitative score of receptor selectivity. We find that the receptors display a wide range of selectivity and that most receptors respond sensitively and strongly to at least one nonself signal, suggesting a broad potential for cross talk between QS systems. IMPORTANCE Specific recognition of cognate signals is considered fundamental to cell signaling circuits as it creates fidelity in the communication system. In bacterial quorum sensing (QS), receptor specificity ensures that bacteria cooperate only with kin. There are examples, however, of QS receptors that respond promiscuously to multiple signals. Eavesdropping by these promiscuous receptors can be beneficial in both interspecies competition and cooperation. Despite their potential significance, we know little about the prevalence of promiscuous QS receptors. Further, many studies rely on methods requiring receptor overexpression, which is known to increase apparent promiscuity. By systematically studying QS receptors in their natural parent strains, we find that the receptors display a wide range of selectivity and that there is potential for significant cross talk between QS systems. Our results provide a basis for hypotheses about the evolution and function of promiscuous signal receptors and for predictions about interspecies interactions in complex microbial communities.","[Wellington, Samantha; Greenberg, E.

Differential adjustment to climate warming within trophic levels may affect coexistence of competing species, because relative phenologies alter facilitative and competitive outcomes [8, 9], but evidence for this is scant [10, 11]. Here, we report on two mechanisms through which climate change may affect fatal interactions between two sympatric passerines, the resident great tit Parus major and the migratory pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, competing for nest sites. Spring temperature more strongly affected breeding phenology of tits than flycatchers, and tits killed more flycatchers when flycatcher arrival coincided with peak laying in the tits. Ongoing climate change may diminish this fatal competition if great tit and flycatcher phenologies diverge. However, great tit density increased after warm winters, and flycatcher mortality was elevated when tit densities were higher. Consequently, flycatcher males in synchronous and high-tit-density years suffered mortality by great tits of up to 8.9%. Interestingly, we found no population consequences of fatal competition, suggesting that mortality predominantly happened among surplus males. Indeed, late-arriving males are less likely to find a partner [12], and here we show that such late arrivers are more likely to die from competition with great tits. We conclude that our breeding population is buffered against detrimental effects of competition.

Based on the 16S rRNA amplicon data, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the two predominant phyla along the intestine; bacterial richness and Shannon diversity index were higher in the middle-intestine than in the fore-and hind-intestine of the grass carp. A significant reduction in Halomonas and Shewanella number was observed in the middle-and hind-intestine as compared with that in the fore intestine; in contrast, a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Cetobacterium was observed in the hind-intestine than in the fore-and middle-intestine. Microbiota located in the fore-, middle-, and hind-intestine formed a unique ecological network model of interspecific interactions. The dominant intestinal microbiota was a major component of the network, and many operational taxonomic units from the dominant microbiota served as connectors and module hubs in the network, which contributed to the homeostasis of the intestinal microbiota. Competitive interactions predominated in the microbial community in the fore-and middle-intestine, whereas cooperative interactions were dominant in the hind-intestine. Predicted function analysis (PICRUSt) showed that microbial function composition significantly changed along the intestine. In the nutrition metabolism, the carbohydrate metabolism functions of the microbiota were increased along the intestine, but the opposite trend was detected in lipid metabolism. The microbiota in the middle-intestine played a more important role in amino acid and energy metabolism, while the hind-intestine was the main site for fiber fermentation, where the predominant positive interactions of microbiota could enhance the ability of the grass carp to obtain more nutrients and energy from plants. Generally, our results suggested that the microbial competition significantly varied along the intestine, as well as the microbial function composition, and complex interspecific interactions promoted the carbohydrate fermentation of intestinal microbiota of grass carp.","[Yang, Gang] Nanchang Univ, Inst Life Sci, Postdoctoral Rover Biol, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Gang; Jian, Shao Qing; Cao, Hongzhong; Wen, Chungen; Hu, Baoqing] Nanchang Univ, Inst Life Sci, Key Lab Mol Biol & Genet Engn Jiangxi, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Peng, Mo] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Sch Anim Sci & Technol, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Peng, Liusheng; Yuan, Jianguo] Inst Special Aquaculture, Yichun, Peoples R China; [Liang, Lifeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, BGI Educ Ctr, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Peng, M (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Sch Anim Sci & Technol, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",pengmowell@jxau.edu.cn,,,"Postdoctoral Research Fund of Jiangxi [2017KY32, 2017KY34]; Natural Science Foundation of JiangxiNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20152ACB21010]; Science and technology research projects from department of education of Jiangxi [GJJ150076]; Modern agricultural cooperative research innovation special funds of Jiangxi [JXXTCX201602, JXARS-03]","This study was supported by Postdoctoral Research Fund of Jiangxi (2017KY32 and 2017KY34), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi (20152ACB21010), Science and technology research projects from department of education of Jiangxi (GJJ150076), and Modern agricultural cooperative research innovation special funds of Jiangxi (JXXTCX201602 and JXARS-03).",,70,19,22,4,138,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0044-8486,1873-5622,,AQUACULTURE,Aquaculture,JAN 1,2019,498,,,,,,151,161,,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.08.062,,,11,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,GV1BU,WOS:000445802900018,,,,,2021-09-21,

Activity patterns are shaped by physiological constraints, evolutionary history, circadian and seasonal changes and may be influenced by other factors, including ecological competition and interspecific interactions. Remote-sensing camera traps allow the collection of species presence data throughout the 24 h period and for almost indefinite lengths of time. Here, we collate data from 10 separate camera trap surveys in order to describe circadian and seasonal activity patterns of 10 mammal species, and, in particular, to evaluate interspecific (dis)associations of five predator-prey pairs. We recorded 8,761 independent detections throughout Northern Ireland. Badgers, foxes, pine martens and wood mice were nocturnal; European and Irish hares and European rabbits were crepuscular; fallow deer and grey and red squirrels were diurnal. All species exhibited significant seasonal variation in activity relative to the timing of sunrise/sunset. Foxes in particular were more crepuscular from spring to autumn and hares more diurnal. Lagged regression analyses of predator-prey activity patterns between foxes and prey (hares, rabbits and wood mice), and pine marten and prey (squirrel and wood mice) revealed significant annual and seasonal cross-correlations. We found synchronised activity patterns between foxes and hares, rabbits and wood mice and pine marten and wood mice, and asynchrony between squirrels and pine martens. Here, we provide fundamental ecological data on endemic, invasive, pest and commercially valuable species in Ireland, as well as those of conservation importance and those that could harbour diseases of economic and/or zoonotic relevance. Our data will be valuable in informing the development of appropriate species-specific methodologies and processes and associated policies.","[Caravaggi, Anthony; Vallely, Marie-Claire; Hogg, Kayleigh; Freeman, Marianne; Fadaei, Erfan; Dick, Jaimie T.

New methods for modelling species distributions include the effects of biotic interactions alongside more commonly used abiotic variables such as temperature and precipitation; however, it is not clear which types of interspecific relationship contribute to shaping species distributions and should therefore be prioritized in models. Even if some interactions are known to be influential at local spatial scales, there is no guarantee they will have similar impacts at macroecological scales. Here we apply a novel method based on information theory to determine which types of interspecific relationship drive species distributions. Our results show that negative biotic interactions such as competition have the greatest effect on model predictions for species from a California grassland community. This knowledge will help focus data collection and improve model predictions for identifying at-risk species. Furthermore, our methodological approach is applicable to any kind of species distribution model that can be specified with and without interspecific relationships.","[Staniczenko, Phillip P.

Stresses arise as a consequence of the spatially inhomogeneous tissue growth due to the different activity of healthy and cancer cells inhabiting the various districts of the tissue, an additional piling up effect, induced by stress transferring across the scales, contributing to determine the total stress occurring at the macroscopic level. The spatially inhomogeneous growth rates accompany nonuniform and time-propagating stress profiles, which constitute mechanical barriers to nutrient transport and influence the intratumoral interstitial flow, in this way deciding the starved/feeded regions, with direct aftereffects on necrosis, angiogenesis, cancer aggressiveness and overall tumor mass size. Despite their ascertained role in tumor mechanobiology, stresses cannot be directly appraised neither from overall tumor size nor through standard non-invasive measurements. To date, the sole way for qualitatively revealing their presence within solid tumors is ex vivo, by engraving the excised masses and then observing opening between the cut edges. Therefore, to contribute to unveil stresses and their implications in tumors, it is first proposed a multiscale model where Volterra-Lotka (predator/prey-like) equations describing the interspecific (environment-mediated) competitions among healthy and cancer cells are coupled with equations of nonlinear poroelasticity. Then, an experimental study on mice injected subcutaneously with a suspension of two different cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2 and MDA.MB231) was conducted to provide experimental evidences that gave qualitative and some new quantitative confirmations of the theoretical model predictions.","[Carotenuto, A.

Here we present a synthesizing unit (SU) based competition model taking co-limitation into account, which is the extension of the competition model developed by Dutta et al. (2014).The study aims at understanding the mechanisms of violation of competitive exclusion principle for phytoplankton species with seasonal environmental forcing when multiple resource limitation is taken into account and species growth is formulated based on SU. We also explore the role of changing environmental conditions on species coexistence on a seasonal and a decadal time scale by linking the model forcing to the Helgoland Roads Time Series data sets. For the first time, based on the Helgoland Roads data, we are able to find a realistic parameterization for the phytoplankton competition model where growth is formulated using SU concept. Our study confirms that more species than limiting resources can coexist with seasonal variations of environmental conditions. This supersaturation is related to periodic changes in species' biomass, variation in interspecific competition and niche configuration, nonlinear functional response and the position of resource supply within the convex hull of species' resource uptake rate. Changes in environmental conditions within realistic ranges do not prevent the coexistence of species rather it slightly changes species' biomass and turnover time. This study also confirms that our model with SU based species growth performs better than species competition model where multiple resource limitation is formulated based on the product of several Monod functions. Our study has created a new avenue for phytoplankton coexistence research and the results might be helpful to answer the complex questions on species diversity maintenance in nature.","[Sarker, Subrata; Meunier, Cedric L.; Wiltshire, Karen H.] Alfred Wegener Inst, Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany; [Feudel, Ulrike] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, ICBM, Theoret Phys Complex Syst, PF 2503, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Lemke, Peter] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Dutta, Partha S.] Indian Inst Technol Ropar, Dept Math, Rupnagar, Punjab, India; [Sarker, Subrata] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh","Sarker, S (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany.",subrata.sarker@awi.de,"Meunier, Cedric L/K-2792-2015; Lemke, Peter/B-6393-2013","Meunier, Cedric L/0000-0002-4070-4286; Lemke, Peter/0000-0001-5739-3149; Dutta, Partha Sharathi/0000-0001-6067-1023",Bundesministerium fur Bildung and Forschung (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LN1702A],"We acknowledge the present and past crews of the research vessels 'Aade' and 'Ellenbogen' for their unfailing provision of samples.

These qualitative predictions were compared with data on host specificity, with good agreement. Analysis of the data also indicates that Maculinea teleius and Maculinea arion respond differently to changes in relative host abundances. Maculinea teleius shows a larger fraction of sites where it displays multiple host behaviour and a larger fraction of sites where the niches of the hosts overlap. In some instances, Maculinea teleius is adapted to Myrmica hosts that are present in lower frequencies.

Predicting species responses to climate change involves understanding both the direct effects of environmental change, as well as indirect effects mediated by altered interspecific interactions. Indirect effects may be particularly important for understanding native species responses in systems invaded by highly competitive exotic species. For instance, Mediterranean climate regions are predicted to experience more frequent drought, and are increasingly invaded by exotic annual plants. For native shrubs in these regions, seedling establishment is episodic, and associated with high rainfall years. However, exotic annual plants also often increase in abundance with high rainfall, suggesting competition from exotic annual species could alter the relationship between rainfall and shrub seedling establishment. Theories such as the stress gradient hypothesis predict competition intensity should increase with resource supply, but there have been few evaluations of competitive interactions across experimental gradients of soil moisture availability. 2. Here we examined how competition from an exotic annual influenced native shrub establishment, across an experimental soil moisture gradient. Seedlings of two native shrub species (Encelia californica and Eriogonum fasciculotum) were grown with and without an exotic grass competitor (Avena fatua) across eight water availability levels, and monitored for growth and survival. These species are common and abundant in the Mediterranean climate region of coastal Southern California, where climate change projections include long-term drought for the coming decades. 3. Without competition, shrub seedlings achieved higher growth and survival at high water availability levels. However, when grown in competition with the exotic grass, shrub seedlings had higher growth and/or survival under relatively dry conditions, suggesting competition can modify and even reverse species responses to changing rainfall patterns, compared to predictions made in the absence of competitors. The exotic grass strongly reduced soil nitrate and water availability when it was planted with the native shrub seedlings, and the exotic grass responded with positive but saturating growth with increasing levels of water addition. 4. Synthesis. This experiment demonstrates that competition from invasive species can alter native species responses to climate change; consistent with ecological theories predicting a positive association between the supply of limiting resources and the intensity of competition.","[Esch, Ellen H.; Cleland, Elsa E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ecol Behav & Evolut Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Esch, Ellen H.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Ashbacher, Angelita C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Kopp, Christopher W.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Cleland, EE (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ecol Behav & Evolut Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ecleland@ucsd.edu,,"Esch, Ellen/0000-0002-4253-0910",National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1144086]; National Science Foundation Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-1154082]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1154082] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: DGE-1144086; National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1154082",,124,5,5,5,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis on temporal samples (10-57 years) of 19 breeding bird assemblages of various habitats. We used presence/absence null model (SIM2) in combination with the C-score and Sorensen indices. The C-score index estimates the average number of checkerboards for two species, while the S(sic)rensen index measures the qualitative similarity of co-occurrence between two species in a time series. We used pairwise null model analysis to select significant species pairs based on three selection criteria: the standard confidence interval criterion, conservative empirical Bayes mean based criterion and confidence limit based criterion. Altogether, 21402 species pairs were analysed. The SIM2 algorithm detected from 157 to 7 segregated pairs depending on the selection criterion. The number of significant negative pairs with possible biological significance (foraging guild membership, predator-prey interactions) was far lower and represented approximately 0.0-0.3% (4-65) of pairs in a matrix. Indeed, the number of detected negative associations depended on the selection criterion. Moreover, the number of segregated pairs was negatively related to the area of the census plots and fill of the species matrix. Our results underline the minor importance of interspecific competitive interactions in temporal patterns of bird assemblages. Instead, we suggest that stochastic factors, climate or heterospecific social information may lead to more or less synchronous dynamics of bird pairs. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Despite their ecological importance, there is little information about what drives the distribution of species exhibiting this growth form. This study investigates the determinants of the distribution of a cushion plant species, Euphorbia clavarioides at (1) a fine scale, using field-collected predictors from an alpine landscape; and (2) a broad scale, using distribution records and climate data across the species' distributional range. At the fine scale, the species was locally rare (occurring in about 4 percent of samples) and may be limited to specific microsites by interspecific competition with taller-growing species. Broad-scale species distribution modeling showed that both temperature and rainfall are important in predicting the distribution of E. clavarioides with a higher probability of occurrence in areas with higher annual precipitation and mean annual temperatures < 15 degrees C. Given the species' sensitivity to competition and abiotic conditions (high temperatures and low precipitation), E. clavarioides may be vulnerable to environmental changes. Therefore, assuming that other cushion plant species exhibit similar patterns, species of this growth form may be particularly useful indicators of change in alpine, Arctic, and Antarctic areas.","[Momberg, Mia; Greve, Michelle; van der Merwe, Stephni; le Roux, Peter C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Pretoria, South Africa","Momberg, M (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",miamomberg@gmail.com,"le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011","le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; van der Merwe, Stephni/0000-0002-6385-8536; Momberg, Mia/0000-0002-8901-9271",University of Pretoria's Research Development Programme; National Research Foundation [95768]; South African Association of Botanists; National Research Foundation's Scarce Skills Programme,"We acknowledge funding from the University of Pretoria's Research Development Programme and the National Research Foundation (Incentive Funding for Rated Researchers, grant number 95768).

To investigate how warming may affect native and invasive species separately and together (intraspecific and interspecific competition, respectively) and whether any warming impact is resource dependent, we examined the performance of two competing herbivores (native Pieris canidia and invasive P. rapae) on two common host plants under three temperature settings (control, 3 degrees C, and 6 degrees C warming using environmental chambers). The results revealed that warming benefited the development and growth of both Pieris under intraspecific competition, but the benefits were host-plant dependent. Notably, the native or invasive Pieris gained an advantage from interspecific competition (host-plant dependent), but warming neutralized the competitive advantages of either Pieris species. These findings raise the possibility that warming-induced shifts in competitive status may become a crucial mechanism shaping ecosystems worldwide, because most ecosystems are challenged by species invasion and warming. Moreover, this study revealed a discrepancy in species thermal performance between intra-and interspecific competition. Therefore, to predict native-invasive species competition under warming, current thermal performance applications should use species performance curves derived from interspecific rather than intraspecific competition studies (although the latter is more readily available).","[Lin, Zheng-Hong; Wu, Chung-Huey; Ho, Chuan-Kai] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wu, Chung-Huey] Univ Melbourne, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Ho, Chuan-Kai] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan","Ho, CK (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei, Taiwan.; Ho, CK (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",ckho@ntu.edu.tw,"Wu, Chung-Huey/D-9318-2012","Wu, Chung-Huey/0000-0001-9490-2969; HO, CHUAN-KAI/0000-0002-6437-0073","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)Ministry of Science and Technology, China [102-2628-B-002-005-MY3, 105-2621-B-002-001, 106-2313-B-002-002]; National Taiwan University (NTU)National Taiwan UniversityNanyang Technological University","We thank anonymous reviewers, Steven C.

Similar reciprocal indirect effects may emerge even when the signal is not mimicked; termed associational effects, such interactions are well known in plants sharing herbivores but have received little attention in animal studies. We investigated associational interactions in a system where unequally defended prey (chemically defended Bufo bufo and undefended Rana temporaria tadpoles), sharing general morphology but not an aposematic signal, were exposed to predation by the carp Cyprinus carpio along a gradient of relative prey abundance. In the absence of fish, the assemblage composition had no effect on the survival of Rana, while that of Bufo decreased with increasing abundance of Rana. Fish reduced the survival of tadpoles from both species. However, increased relative abundance of Bufo in the community led to enhanced survival in both Bufo and Rana. Increasing relative proportions of heterospecifics reduced metamorph mass only in Bufo, indicating greater sensitivity to interspecific competition compared to Rana; the effect was reduced in the presence of fish. Our results show that undefended non-mimetic prey enjoy reduced predation with increasing relative abundance of chemically defended prey, which in turn suffer greater mortality with an increasing proportion of the undefended species. Associational resistance/susceptibility, driven by current assemblage composition, not by selection for resemblance, can shape the dynamics of mixed communities of defended and undefended prey in the absence of mimicry.","[Kaczmarek, Jan M.; Kaczmarski, Mikolaj; Kloskowski, Janusz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Zool, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Mazurkiewicz, Jan] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Inland Fisheries & Aquaculture, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland","Kaczmarek, JM (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Dept Zool, Ul Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.",kaczmarq@up.poznan.pl,"KACZMARSKI, MIKOLAJ/AAA-3643-2021","KACZMARSKI, MIKOLAJ/0000-0002-3341-0933; Kaczmarek, Jan/0000-0002-4152-6928; Mazurkiewicz, Jan/0000-0002-3344-1094; Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421",Poznan University of Life Sciences Grant Program for Young Scientists [507.511.60/2016],"The project was funded by Poznan University of Life Sciences Grant Program for Young Scientists (project no. 507.511.60/2016) awarded to JMK.

Interspecific competition among hymenopteran parasitoids may shape their behavioural strategies for host resource exploitation. In order to reduce or prevent competition, many parasitoid species have evolved the ability to discriminate between unparasitised hosts and hosts parasitised by another parasitoid species (i.e. heterospecific host discrimination). However, discriminatory ability might be affected by host instar. 2. This study reports the first results on whether host instar can influence the use of heterospecific-parasitised hosts by sympatric parasitoids of the genus Aphytis (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). 3. Aphytis melinus and Aphytis chrysomphali discriminated between unparasitised and heterospecific-parasitised hosts when they found a third-instar host (high quality), with a tendency to multi-parasitise. However, this discrimination was not observed in the second instar (lower size). 4. The behavioural strategies adopted towards multi-parasitise third-instar hosts varied between both species. Aphytis chrysomphali reduced its clutch size in heterospecific-parasitised hosts, whereas A. melinus tended to probe them for longer than healthy hosts. 5. Overall, our results highlight the importance of host instar in the study of intrinsic competition between parasitoids.","[Cebolla, Ruth; Bru, Pablo; Urbaneja, Alberto; Tena, Alejandro] IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Asociada Entomol Agr UJI IVIA, Valencia, Spain","Tena, A (corresponding author), IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Carretera CV 315,Km 10-7, Valencia 46113, Spain.",atena@ivia.es,"URBANEJA, ALBERTO/AAW-6198-2020; Cebolla, Ruth/AAB-2243-2019; Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011","URBANEJA, ALBERTO/0000-0001-5986-3685; Cebolla, Ruth/0000-0003-0610-8672; Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [BES-2012-058937, AGL2011-30538-C03-02]; INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA); IVIA; Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio de la Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat Valenciana","The authors would like to thank A.

Using information from empirically observed tradeoffs to augment the parametrisation of mechanism-based models should therefore improve model predictions, provided that tradeoffs and mechanisms are chosen correctly. We developed and tested such a model for 35 grassland plant species using monoculture measurements of three species characteristics related to nitrogen uptake and retention, which previous experiments indicate as important at our site. Matching classical theoretical expectations, these characteristics defined a distinct tradeoff surface, and models parameterised with these characteristics closely matched observations from experimental multi-species mixtures. Importantly, predictions improved significantly when we incorporated information from tradeoffs by 'snapping' characteristics to the nearest location on the tradeoff surface, suggesting that the tradeoffs and mechanisms we identify are important determinants of local community structure. This 'snapping' method could therefore constitute a broadly applicable test for identifying influential tradeoffs and mechanisms.","[Clark, Adam Thomas; Lehman, Clarence; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Clark, Adam Thomas] Univ Leipzig, Ritterstr 26, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Clark, Adam Thomas] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Divers, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Tilman, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, 2400 Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Clark, Adam Thomas] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Synth Ctr Biodivers Sci sDiv, Deutsch Pl 5E, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Clark, AT (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.; Clark, AT (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Ritterstr 26, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.; Clark, AT (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Divers, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.; Clark, AT (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Synth Ctr Biodivers Sci sDiv, Deutsch Pl 5E, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",adam.tclark@gmail.com,"Clark, Adam Thomas/S-7544-2017","Clark, Adam Thomas/0000-0002-8843-3278","US National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-8114302, DEB-8811884, DEB-9411972, DEB-0080382, DEB-0620652, DEB-1234162]; Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve; University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; NSF GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [00006595]; Balzan Prize Foundation","This work was supported by grants from the US National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research Program, including DEB-8114302, DEB-8811884, DEB-9411972, DEB-0080382, DEB-0620652, and DEB-1234162, by the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, and by the University of Minnesota.

Studies have tested stress tolerance and competitive ability in mediating interaction outcomes, but few have incorporated this to predict how species interactions shift between competition and facilitation along stress gradients. We used field surveys, salt tolerance and competition experiments to develop a predictive model interspecific interaction shifts across salinity stress gradients. Field survey and greenhouse tolerance tests revealed tradeoffs between stress tolerance and competitive ability. Modeling showed that along salinity gradients, (1) plant interactions shifted from competition to facilitation at high salinities within the physiological limits of salt-intolerant plants, (2) facilitation collapsed when salinity stress exceeded the physiological tolerance of salt-intolerant plants, and (3) neighbor removal experiments overestimate interspecific facilitation by including intraspecific effects. A community-level field experiment, suggested that (1) species interactions are competitive in benign and, facilitative in harsh condition, but fuzzy under medium environmental stress due to niche differences of species and weak stress amelioration, and (2) the SGH works on strong but not weak stress gradients, so SGH confusion arises when it is applied across questionable stress gradients. Our study clarifies how species interactions vary along stress gradients. Moving forward, focusing on SGH applications rather than exceptions on weak or nonexistent gradients would be most productive.","[Qi, Man; Sun, Tao; Xue, SuFeng; Yang, Wei; Shao, DongDong] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain","Sun, T (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",suntao@bnu.edu.cn,"Martinez-Lopez, Javier/C-7069-2009; Qi, Man/AAK-1565-2021; Martinez-Lopez, Javier/K-4306-2015","Yang, Wei/0000-0003-1353-846X; sun, tao/0000-0001-5277-8699; Martinez-Lopez, Javier/0000-0002-0825-7252",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation for Innovative Research Group [51721093]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51279007]; National Basic Research Program of China (973)National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB430402],"This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China (973) (2013CB430402), the National Natural Science Foundation for Innovative Research Group (No. 51721093), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51279007) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,41,24,24,15,120,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2018,99,4,,,,,848,857,,10.1002/ecy.2147,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GB2JM,WOS:000428878200009,29345307,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

We propose and evaluate a novel framework based on a set of global, i.e. for the whole community, indices of competition (GIC) that allows quantitative predictions of community productivity without knowing the entire community matrix. This framework also serves for comparisons among widely different taxa. These GICs were mostly evaluated in communities of primary producers and are expressible in terms of relative yields (mixture biomass/monoculture biomass), such as the relative yield total (RYT) - the total sum of relative yields - and the mean relative yield (MRY). Specifically: 1) we conducted a meta-analysis of 166 published competition experiments covering a wide variety of communities - bacteria, protists, plankton, plants, fish, insects, mammals. For each experiment we computed the set of GICs. 2) We derived from the Lotka-Volterra competition model (LVCM) analytical expressions for the RYT and MRY in terms of the species richness and the mean value of the interspecific interaction coefficients. 3) We tested the agreement of such expressions with the corresponding empirical GICs computed in 1). The main findings are: First, the RYT (significantly different among taxonomic groups) increases with the species richness S; conversely the MRY (not different among groups) decreases with S. Second, these analytical expressions for the RYT and MRY, besides giving the above qualitative dependence on S, reproduce with accuracy these empirical GIC. Third, we thus show that our general formulas can be used to assess the effects of competition on global community attributes in cases with incomplete information on the LVCM parameters (i.e. when only a subset of these parameters is known).","[Fort, Hugo] Univ Republica, Inst Phys, Fac Sci, Igua 4225, UY-11400 Montevideo, Uruguay; [Segura, Angel] Univ Republ, Modelizac & Anal Recursos Nat, CURE, Rocha, Uruguay","Fort, H (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Inst Phys, Fac Sci, Igua 4225, UY-11400 Montevideo, Uruguay.",hugo@fisica.edu.uy,,,ANII(SNI)-Uruguay,HF and AMS acknowledge support from ANII(SNI)-Uruguay.,,46,8,8,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2018,127,3,,,,,392,402,,10.1111/oik.04756,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FY2NL,WOS:000426652500007,,,,,2021-09-21,

These priority effects are predicted to be stronger at high temperatures, as higher vital rates caused by warming allow early arrivers to more rapidly impact a shared environment. We tested this prediction using a pair of congeneric aphid species that specialize on milkweed plants. We manipulated temperature and arrival order of the two aphid species and measured aphid population dynamics and milkweed survival and defensive traits. We found that warming increased the impact of aphids on the quantity and quality of milkweed, which amplified the importance of priority effects by increasing the competitive exclusion of the inferior competitor when it arrived late. Warming also enhanced interspecific differences in dispersal, which could alter relative arrival times at a regional scale. Our experiment provides a first link between temperature-dependent trophic interactions, priority effects, and dispersal. This study suggests that the indirect and cascading effects of temperature observed here may be important determinants of diversity in the temporally and spatially complex landscapes that characterize ecological communities.","[Grainger, Tess Nahanni; Rego, Adam Ivan; Gilbert, Benjamin] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Grainger, TN (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",tess.grainger@mail.utoronto.ca,"Gilbert, Benjamin/E-6616-2010","Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0002-4947-6822; Rego, Adam/0000-0003-0813-7901",,,,70,15,15,0,35,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Climate warming and water acidification are two concerned environmental issues changing the freshwater ecosystems. To investigate the competitive responses of phytoplankton to warming and acidification, we co-cultured Microcystis aeruginosa and Scenedesmus obliquus at a temperature range of 15-35 degrees C and a pH range of 5-9. Results showed that S. obliquus was superior competitor at 15 degrees C. At 20-30 degrees C, the populations of both Scenedesmus and Microcystis were inhibited by the presence of each other. S. obliquus was in competitive domination at the initial phase of cultivation, but was finally replaced by M. aeruginosa. Microcystis kept competition advantage at 35 degrees C, whereas Scenedesmus outcompeted Microcystis at acidic conditions (pH <= 6). Neutral and weakly alkaline conditions (pH 7-9) supported the replacement of competition domination from Scenedesmus to Microcystis. The present study revealed that climate warming may accelerate the phytoplankton succession from green algae to cyanobacteria, with the predicted promoted cyanobacteria blooms. Nonetheless, water acidification causes Microcystis to be a weak competitor with green algae, suggesting that the advantageous effect of Microcystis toward green algae at high temperatures was controlled by other variables like the water pH.","[Yang, Jingwen; Tang, Hengxing; Zhang, Xingxing; Zhu, Xuexia; Huang, Yuan; Yang, Zhou] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Huang, Y; Yang, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",huangyuan@njnu.edu.cn; yangzhou@njnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Youth Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31500373]; Natural Science Youth Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150972]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions [15KJD180002],"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China (31500373), Natural Science Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20150972), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (15KJD180002).",,37,28,28,7,49,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

In the genus Lepus (Mammals, Lagomorphs) genetic mixing has been widely documented and it probably affected the population dynamics of species, particularly during climatic oscillations. We thus propose and investigate a mathematical model, with the aim to describe and predict the outcome of interspecific interactions in a three-population system including European (Lepus europaeus), mountain (Lepus timidus) and hybrid hares.& para;& para;Our results show that the three-population system can survive at a stable level, but equilibria involving only parental species could also be feasible. This implies that, depending on initial conditions, the mountain hare could suffer from the competition with European and hybrid hares and its population could disappear in the near future. Under climate change scenarios, the conditions for coexistence will become even more restrictive, mountain hare populations could be depressed and finally collapse.& para;& para;Thus, at present the hybridization phenomenon does not necessarily represent a threat to the conservation of the unique genomes of the parental species, but climate change and human intervention, namely the introduction of European hares in the range of the Alpine mountain species, could result in an increase in the contact zones between populations, finally promoting hybridization and biotic homogenization.

If resource quality is important for maximizing fitness, then the duration of decision making may be in conflict with other crucial and time consuming tasks, such as anti-predator behaviours or competition monitoring. Individuals facing the risk of predation and/or competition should adjust the duration of decision making and, as a consequence, their level of choosiness for resources. When exposed to predation, the forager could either maintain its level of choosiness for food items but accept a reduction in the amount of food items consumed or it could reduce its level of choosiness and accept all prey items encountered. Under competition risk, individuals are expected to reduce their level of choosiness as slow decision making exposes individuals to a higher risk of opportunity costs. To test these predictions, the level of choosiness of a seed-eating carabid beetle, Harpalus affinis, was examined under 4 different experimental conditions of risk: i) predation risk; ii) intraspecific competition; iii) interspecific competition; and, iv) control. All the risks were simulated using chemical cues from individual conspecifics or beetles of different species that are predatory or granivorous. Our results show that when foraging under the risk of predation, H. affinis individuals significantly reduce their level of choosiness for seeds. Reductions in level of choosiness for food items might serve as a sensible strategy to reduce both the total duration of a foraging task and the cognitive load of the food quality assessment. No significant differences were observed when individuals were exposed to competition cues. Competition, (i.e opportunity cost) may not be perceived as risk high enough to induce changes in the level of choosiness. Our results suggest that considering the amount of items consumed, alone, would be a misleading metric when assessing individual response to a risk of predation. Foraging studies should therefore also take in account the decision making process.","[Charalabidis, Alice; Petit, Sandrine; Bohan, David A.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, Dijon, France; [Charalabidis, Alice; Dechaume-Moncharmont, Francois-Xavier] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR CNRS Biogeosci 6282, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Dijon, France","Bohan, DA (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, Dijon, France.",David.Bohan@inra.fr,"Dechaume-Moncharmont, Francois-Xavier/F-2394-2011; Bohan, David A/D-7992-2012; Petit, Sandrine/C-3310-2013","Dechaume-Moncharmont, Francois-Xavier/0000-0001-7607-8224; Bohan, David A/0000-0001-5656-775X; Petit, Sandrine/0000-0001-8781-8873; Charalabidis, Alice/0000-0002-7225-2114","Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change; European Research Area Network in the Coordinated-Integrated Pest Management in Europe Strategic Research Agenda (FACCE ERA-NET C-IPM) [00000877]; French Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12-Agro-0006, ANR-13-Agro-0001]; Institute Nationale de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA); Region of Burgundy Franche-Comte","This work was supported by the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change, European Research Area Network in the Coordinated-Integrated Pest Management in Europe Strategic Research Agenda (FACCE ERA-NET C-IPM) project BioAWARE (AFB Projet 00000877, https://www.facceipi.com) and the PEERLESS (ANR-12-Agro-0006) and AGROBIOSE (ANR-13-Agro-0001) grants from the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/) to DB and SP.

Many studies have tested (and mainly refuted) this hypothesis for plant and bacterial communities. Results for the few studies with avian species are not conclusive. We tested Darwin's hypothesis for waterbirds using a set of open, artificial fish ponds in Donana, south-western Spain, that provide relatively homogeneous habitat where competition is likely to be intense. Monthly counts of 38 ponds (for 11 months, i.e. 418 censuses) recorded 76 bird species. Darwin's hypothesis predicted that species appearing in the same pond would be less related phylogenetically than expected if species occurred randomly across ponds and months according to the structure of the overall community across the entire pond complex. However, the waterbird community did not show a predominantly overdispersed pattern, suggesting that interspecific competition among phylogenetically related species was not the main force structuring communities. In contrast, the proportion of clustered communities was higher than expected throughout the annual cycle, indicating that related waterbirds tend to co-occur on the same site, probably because they have similar microhabitat preferences. Clustering patterns were mainly driven by abundant and closely related duck species, and also by shorebirds. However, few individual pond communities remained significantly different from random after correction for multiple testing. Furthermore, the probability of co-occurrence of a given species pair was negatively related to the phylogenetic distance between them. In conclusion, our study shows waterbird communities are mainly phylogenetically clustered or random, and do not support the competition-relatedness hypothesis.","[Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther] Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther] Miguel Hernandez Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Elche, Spain; [Green, Andy J.] Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Seville, Spain","Sebastian-Gonzalez, E (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.; Sebastian-Gonzalez, E (corresponding author), Miguel Hernandez Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Elche, Spain.",esebgo@gmail.com,"Green, Andy J/A-5189-2008; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/J-7883-2012","Green, Andy J/0000-0002-1268-4951; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/0000-0001-7229-1845",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1345247],ES-G was supported under the NSF grant Award #1345247.,,61,4,4,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

In an attempt to maximize the benefits from these roofs, the choice and management of the flora on the roofs remain understudied, especially in non-temperate climates. While the perennial succulent, Sedum, is commonly planted on green roofs, the use and integration of additional plant forms can potentially create more biodiverse roofs. Here, we conducted an experiment to evaluate the interactions between the local Sedum sediforme and local annuals under a Mediterranean climate. We followed the development of S. sediforme and annuals and monitored the invasibility of the green roof over three years. We additionally monitored the substrate temperature, moisture, conductivity, pH, nitrate and percent organic matter. In an attempt to increase intraspecific competition, which is predicted to reduce interspecific competition, S. sediforme were initially arranged in two different dispersion patterns - uniform and clumped. Three levels of S. sediforme (absent, uniform and clumped) were crossed with the presence or absence of twenty species of annuals, introduced as seeds. Sedum sediforme dispersion did not differentially affect annuals, but both dispersion patterns of S. sediforme reduced biomass and diversity of annuals during the third year. Annual presence reduced clumped dispersion of S. sediforme cover and inflorescences throughout all three years, but increased total chlorophyll levels in S. sediforme leaf tissue during the third year. Sedum sediforme also reduced abundance and biomass of colonizing plants. Sedum sediforme and annuals each showed valuable enhancements to some of the most important green roof functions. Annuals increased nitrate fixation in the substrate which may have explained the increased levels of chlorophyll and carotenoids in S. sediforme in these treatments. Finally, S. sediforme interacted with annuals to reduce substrate temperature and presence of annuals reduced substrate moisture thereby improving storm-water abatement capacity. We conclude that the combination of annuals and S. sediforme in Mediterranean green roofs will improve green roof function as an important component in future sustainable urban planning.","[Vasl, A.; Shalom, H.; Kadas, G.

Classical theory predicts that interspecific competition should lead to all potential niches being occupied, yet observational data suggest that many niches are unfilled. Here we show that theory can be reconciled with observational data by reconceptualizing competition in the Hutchinsonian niche space to distinguish between substitutable and non-substitutable resources. When resources are substitutable (for example, seeds of different size), the components of competition along the niche axes combine multiplicatively, leading to a densely packed niche space. However, when resources are non-substitutable (such as seeds and nest sites), we show that the components of competition combine additively. Disruptive selection therefore limits niche overlap between non-substitutable niche axes, leaving most potential niches unfilled. A key corollary is that increasing the number of niche axes may greatly increase the number of potential niches but does not necessarily increase diversity.

The recovery of many marine mammal populations on the west coast of the United States has been viewed as a success; however, within Puget Sound in Washington State, the increased abundance of three protected pinniped species may be adversely affecting the recovery of threatened Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and endangered killer whales (Orcinus orca) within the region. Between 1970 and 2015, we estimate that the annual biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds has increased from 68 to 625 metric tons. Converting juvenile Chinook salmon into adult equivalents, we found that by 2015, pinnipeds consumed double that of resident killer whales and six times greater than the combined commercial and recreational catches. We demonstrate the importance of interspecific interactions when evaluating species recovery. As more protected species respond positively to recovery efforts, managers should attempt to evaluate tradeoffs between these recovery efforts and the unintended ecosystem consequences of predation and competition on other protected species.","[Chasco, Brandon; Kaplan, Isaac C.; Noren, Dawn; Ford, Michael J.; Hanson, M.

The Amazon biome is the only region in the world where four alligatorid species are known to occur in sympatry, and they attain high densities in some regions. As top predators with a diverse range of prey species occupying different trophic levels, their impact upon food webs should be substantial, but the degree to which crocodilians differ in their food sources, and potentially avoid competitive exclusion where they occur syntopically is not well understood. Although most crocodilians are considered generalist opportunistic predators that feed on any source of protein available in the environment, Amazonian crocodilians show broad differences in the proportions of prey items they consume. It is believed that these differences may in part reflect habitat use, but it is unknown to what extent they represent interspecific differences in prey preferences or are a direct function of habitat selection. Stable carbon isotope data (C-13) of crocodilians and their potential prey were used to assess differences in reliance on terrestrial versus aquatic resources. These data were then placed in a spatial context using classified maps that reflect habitat types (headwater streams, mid-order flooded-forest streams and varzea floodplains) to elucidate whether dietary differences are explained by habitat selection or are more likely a reflection of prey preferences. We found evidence for differences in types of basal resources supporting these crocodilians. Mean C-13 values were highest in Paleosuchus trigonatus (Schneider's dwarf caiman, -25.71.2 parts per thousand), intermediate in Caiman crocodilus (spectacled caiman, -27.4 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand) and Paleosuchus palpebrosus (Cuvier's dwarf caiman, -27.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand) and lowest in Melanosuchus niger (black caiman, -29.9 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand). A progressive decrease in C-13 values of crocodilian tissues occurred from headwaters to floodplains, which most likely reflects a progressive increase in autochthonous over allochthonous inputs in lower reaches of streams. The shift from terrestrial to aquatic resources sustaining these sympatric predators mirrors their spatial distribution along this ecotone. However, after taking into account the habitat in which pairs of syntopic individuals of distinct species occurred, significant differences in C-13 values suggest that P.trigonatus and P.palpebrosus have different prey bases. Thus, despite being opportunistic predators, our results show that differences in crocodilian diets likely result from prey preferences and not only from habitat selection. These findings suggest that some species of crocodilians may be less generalist than traditionally thought and their influence on terrestrial or aquatic food webs might be species specific.","[Villamarin, Francisco; Magnusson, William E.] INPA, Coordenacao Pesquisas Biodiversidade, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Jardine, Timothy D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Bunn, Stuart E.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Marioni, Boris] INPA, Programa Posgrad Biol Agua Doce & Pesca Interior, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Villamarin, F (corresponding author), INPA, Coordenacao Pesquisas Biodiversidade, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",fco.villamarin@gmail.com,"Bunn, Stuart E/B-9065-2008","Bunn, Stuart E/0000-0002-6540-3586; Villamarin, Francisco/0000-0001-9038-3516; Jardine, Timothy/0000-0002-5917-9792",Centro de Estudos Integrados da Biodiversidade Amazonica (INCT-CENBAM); Biodiversity Research Program (PPBio); PRONEX/FAPEAM/CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),Centro de Estudos Integrados da Biodiversidade Amazonica (INCT-CENBAM); Biodiversity Research Program (PPBio); PRONEX/FAPEAM/CNPq,,81,3,3,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Here, we examine energy and macronutrient acquisition in unicyanobacterial consortia for which species-resolved genome information exists for all members, allowing us to use multi-omic approaches to predict species' abilities to acquire resources and examine expression of resource-acquisition genes during succession. Metabolic reconstruction indicated that a majority of heterotrophic community members lacked the genes required to directly acquire the inorganic nutrients provided in culture medium, suggesting high metabolic interdependency. The sole primary producer in consortium UCC-O, cyanobacterium Phormidium sp. OSCR, displayed declining expression of energy harvest, carbon fixation, and nitrate and sulfate reduction proteins but sharply increasing phosphate transporter expression over 28 days. Most heterotrophic members likewise exhibited signs of phosphorus starvation during succession. Though similar in their responses to phosphorus limitation, heterotrophs displayed species-specific expression of nitrogen acquisition genes. These results suggest niche partitioning around nitrogen sources may structure the community when organisms directly compete for limited phosphate. Such niche complementarity around nitrogen sources may increase community diversity and productivity in phosphate-limited phototrophic communities.","[Lindemann, Stephen R.; Mobberley, Jennifer M.; Cole, Jessica K.; Taylor, Ronald C.; Huang, Eric; Chrisler, William B.; Nelson, William C.; Fredrickson, James K.; Romine, Margaret F.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Div Biol Sci, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Lindemann, Stephen R.; Markillie, L.

We measured root phosphatase activity and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization among two N-2- and two non-N-2-fixing seedlings, and grew them alone and in competition with different inorganic and organic P forms to assess potential P partitioning. We found an inverse relationship between root phosphatase activity and AM colonization in field-collected seedlings, indicative of a trade-off in P acquisition strategies. This correlated with the predominantly exploited P sources in the seedling experiment: the N-2 fixer with high N-2 fixation and root phosphatase activity grew best on organic P, whereas the poor N-2 fixer and the two non-N-2 fixers with high AM colonization grew best on inorganic P. When grown in competition, however, AM colonization, root phosphatase activity and N-2 fixation increased in the N-2 fixers, allowing them to outcompete the non-N-2 fixers regardless of P source. Our results indicate that some tropical trees have the capacity to partition soil P, but this does not eliminate interspecific competition. Rather, enhanced P and N acquisition strategies may increase the competitive ability of N-2 fixers relative to non-N-2 fixers.","[Nasto, Megan K.; Cleveland, Cory C.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Osborne, Brooke B.; Porder, Stephen] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59803 USA; [Asner, Gregory P.; Balzotti, Christopher S.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Taylor, Philip G.; Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA","Nasto, MK (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",megan.nasto@umontana.edu,"Townsend, Alan/AAE-9602-2019; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013","Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421; Cleveland, Cory/0000-0002-8804-4248","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0918387, DEB-0918835]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1263651, 1264031, 1601408] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank Osa Conservation, the Organizacion para Estudios Tropicales and the Ministerio de Ambiente y Energia in Costa Rica for facilitating access to field sites, research permits and logistical support in Costa Rica.

Promoting mixed-species forests is an important strategy for adaptation and risk reduction in the face of global change. Concurrently, a main challenge in ecology is to quantify the effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning. In forests, the effects of individual tree species on ecosystem functions depend largely on their dimensions, which are commonly predicted using allometric equations. However, little is known about how diversity influences allometry or how to incorporate this effect into allometric equations. Ignoring the effects of interspecific interactions on allometric relationships may result in severely biased predictions. 2. This study examined the effects of tree-species diversity, competition and tree social status on crown-projection area (cpa), height (h) and live-crown length (lcl) of trees using a European-wide data set containing 17 target species and 12 939 trees. The cpa, h and lcl were predicted as functions of stem diameter at 1.3 m, tree-species diversity, tree height relative to the stand mean height (rh) and a competition index (CI) that accounted for stand density and interspecific differences in competitive ability based on species-specific wood density or shade tolerance. 3. Averaged across species, diameter had the greatest effect on cpa and lcl, followed by the competition index, while rh had the greatest effect on lcl. Tree-species diversity had the smallest effect on cpa, h and lcl. Interspecific variability in cpa, h or lcl responses to diversity, CI, or rh was sometimes related to wood density or shade tolerance. 4. Synthesis. This study shows the strong influence of stand structure and species composition on allometric relationships. These influences can be quantified using measures of competition, tree-species diversity and relative tree height so that general equations can be developed for a given species to be applied to a wide range of species compositions and stand structures. This new approach will greatly improve predictions of biomass and carbon stocks in structurally and compositionally diverse forests.","[Forrester, David Ian; Benneter, Adam; Bauhus, Juergen] Freiburg Univ, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Silviculture, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Bouriaud, Olivier] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Forestry, Str Univ 13, Suceava 720229, Romania; [Bouriaud, Olivier] Natl Inst Res & Dev Silviculture, Natl Forest Inventory, 73b Calea Bucovinei, Campulung Moldovenesc 725100, Romania","Forrester, DI (corresponding author), Freiburg Univ, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Silviculture, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.",david.forrester@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de,"Benneter, Adam/N-3763-2018; Forrester, David I/L-5351-2013; Bouriaud, Olivier/C-4700-2011; Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013; Benneter, Adam/P-5459-2019","Benneter, Adam/0000-0003-3844-657X; Bouriaud, Olivier/0000-0002-8046-466X; Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986; Benneter, Adam/0000-0003-3844-657X","Heisenberg Fellowship from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FO 791/4-1]; European UnionEuropean Commission [265171]","D.I.F. was funded by a Heisenberg Fellowship (FO 791/4-1) from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG).

Neotropical birds that follow army ants are an appropriate system within which to study such eavesdropping behavior. Mixed-species groups of these understory birds congregate around ant swarms, where they forage on insects flushed by the ants. Obligate ant-followers have specialized behaviors to track ant swarms and may serve as information sources for facultative ant-followers. Owing to strong dominance hierarchies among species, however, the value of the information likely depends on the competitive relationship between the information provider and the eavesdropper. I investigated whether ant-following birds preferentially followed the songs of some antbird species over others, testing the prediction that the vocalizations of small (subordinate) ant-following species would attract more individuals than the vocalizations of large (dominant) species. I conducted playback experiments that broadcast songs of the small White-cheeked Antbird (Gymnopithys leucaspis), the larger Reddish-winged Bare-eye (Phlegopsis erythoptera), and a control that does not attend ant swarms (the Peruvian Warbling-Antbird [Hypocnemis peruviana]). I also observed birds at swarms to investigate additional factors that may affect information utility. Although overall response rates to playback were low (as expected in this low-density setting), heterospecific individuals responded significantly more often to playback of songs of the White-cheeked Antbird compared with those of both the Reddish-winged Bare-eye and the control. Observations at swarms did not show significant differences in abundance or vocalization rate between species, so this difference in response rate may be explained by the White-cheeked Antbird's favorable combination of subordinate status and far-carrying song. These 2 factors (competition and cue prominence) are also important determinants of information utility in analogous systems involving other taxa. These dynamics of interspecific information use by ant-following birds may provide insights into the general mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of mixed-species foraging aggregations.","[Batcheller, Hope J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Batcheller, HJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",hjb58@cornell.edu,,,Rawlings Cornell Presidential Research Scholarship; Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Team Redhead Fund,This work was funded by the Rawlings Cornell Presidential Research Scholarship and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Team Redhead Fund.

Ponto-Caspian gobies are a good example of a territorial species, which can have negative impact on native species with similar biology due to competitive interactions. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential impact of the invasive Ponto-Caspian western tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris on the native stone loach Barbatula barbatula through shelter competition. We used male and female gobies in their reproductive season to test whether they would be more aggressive towards native stone loach, accounting for different light conditions in a limited shelter competition scenario. The results of our study showed that both tested species occupied the shelter mostly during the daylight. Only male goby reduced the shelter occupancy of stone loach despite the fact that interspecific aggressive acts were very rare. It was associated with the nest guarding by male gobies, considering that the study was conducted during their reproductive season. Based on our results, it is possible that, under natural conditions, male tubenose goby would force stone loach to stay away from the shelter, especially in late spring and early summer, when gobies are in reproductive state. This might affect stone loach populations by devoiding them of optimum sites and increasing their exposure to predators.","[Blonska, Dagmara; Grabowska, Joanna] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Ul Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Kobak, Jaroslaw] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Grabowska, J (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Ul Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",joko@biol.uni.lodz.pl,"Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Grabowska, Joanna/K-8305-2013","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Grabowska, Joanna/0000-0001-9924-0650; Blonska, Dagmara/0000-0002-2200-3347","University of Lodz [5811/E-345/M/2015, 5811/E-345/M/2016]","The study was supported by an internal grant from the University of Lodz (5811/E-345/M/2015, 5811/E-345/M/2016).

Here, we report evidence of interspecific interactions between this species and some synanthropic co-occurring birds in three urban parks of Rome (central Italy). In both nesting and feeding sites, we recorded 158 interactions with seven syntopic species in eight colonial focal nests (0.74 events/hr). The number and frequency of interactions significantly differ among nests and species, the Italian Sparrow (Passer italiae) being the most interactive species. For this species, the frequency of interactions was normally distributed between different months with a peak in June. We also observed a case of nest cohabitation, as well as predatory attacks carried out by Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix). As far as foraging sites are concerned, 11 out of 74 clusters of parakeets (15%) hosted four bird species, mainly Starling, Sturnus vulgaris, but we did not observe any interactions. Although Monk Parakeet is a social bird generally tolerant towards other species near their nests and in foraging areas, we observed interspecific interactions in nesting sites as a response to competitive or predatory mechanisms. Italian Sparrows interact because they use parakeet nests as a secondary structure for nesting (cohabitation) and, probably, because of the wide availability of food resources (invertebrates) useful for juvenile recruitment. The interaction of parakeets with Hooded Crow is a response to predatory attacks on eggs or juveniles. However, interspecific interactions seem to be occasional events in nesting sites and are apparently absent in feeding sites, where competitive behaviour is probably reduced due to high availability of plant resources. In urbanised areas, where Monk Parakeets have recently been introduced, the number of competitors and predators might be very reduced (both in number of events and species) in comparison to native areas where competition and predatory mechanisms reflect long-term co-evolutionary dynamics.","[Di Santo, Marianna] Xemina Emoz Nat Cultural & Environm Assoc, Via Michele Saponaro 10, I-00143 Rome, Italy; [Battisti, Corrado] Citta Metropolitana Roma Capitale, Serv Aree Protette Parchi Reg, Torre Flavia LTER Long Term Ecol Res Stn, Via Tiburtina 691, I-00159 Rome, Italy; [Bologna, Marco A.] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale G Marconi 446, I-00146 Rome, Italy","Battisti, C (corresponding author), Citta Metropolitana Roma Capitale, Serv Aree Protette Parchi Reg, Torre Flavia LTER Long Term Ecol Res Stn, Via Tiburtina 691, I-00159 Rome, Italy.",c.battisti@cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it,"Battisti, Corrado/Q-4061-2016",,,,,70,5,6,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

We evaluated the survivorship of Chthamalus recruits in Playa San Miguel, Baja California, for over a year to evaluate if the supply of new recruits was of greater importance than the post-recruitment factors of competition and predation in determining adult population size. We hypothesized that the number of Chthamalus recruits would predict the number of adults present and that predation and competition would not play a significant role in determining adult densities. Recruit density was a robust predictor of adult density despite the presence of weak density-dependent mortality. Neither predation nor competition significantly affected the survivorship of recruits and did not decouple the relationship between recruit and adult densities, suggesting that these post-recruitment controls did not play an important role in determining the population size of Chthamalus barnacles at this site. The data support the hypothesis that supply-side control is the primary factor structuring the population of Chthamalus in the intertidal community at Playa San Miguel.","[Lievana MacTavish, Andrea; Betty Ladah, Lydia] CICESE, Dept Biol Oceanog, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico","Ladah, LB (corresponding author), CICESE, Dept Biol Oceanog, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico.",lladah@cicese.edu.mx,,"Ladah, Lydia/0000-0003-4009-4817","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia project 'LINK' [105622]; UCMEXUS-CONACYT project 'FLOO, Fluxes Linking the Offshore and the Onshore'","This study was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia project 'LINK' under grant no. 105622 and by the UCMEXUS-CONACYT project 'FLOO, Fluxes Linking the Offshore and the Onshore'.",,62,1,1,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",1745-1000,1745-1019,,MAR BIOL RES,Mar.

However, intraspecific variation is ubiquitous in nature because of ontogenetic growth and critical in food-we dynamics. To understand individual interaction-mediated food webs, researchers have recently focused on body size as the most fundamental biological aspect and assessed a parameter called the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR). Herein, I review the conceptual development of the PPMR and suggest four major concerns regarding its measurement: (1) PPMR should be measured at the individual level because species-averaged values distort actual feeding relationships, (2) individual-level PPMR data on gape-unconstrained predators (e.g., terrestrial carnivores) are limited because previous studies have targeted gape-limited fish predators, (3) predators' prey size selectivity (preferred PPRM) is conceptually different from dietary prey size (realized PPMR) and should be distinguished by incorporating environmental prey abundance information, and (4) determinants of preferred PPMR, rather than those of realized PPMR, should be identified to describe size-dependent predation. Future studies are encouraged to explore not only predation but also other interaction types (e.g., competition, mutualism, and herbivory) at the individual level. However, this is not likely to occur while ecological communities are still considered to be interspecific interaction networks. To resolve this situation and more comprehensively understand biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, I suggest that community ecology requires a paradigm shift in the unit of interaction from species to individuals, similar to evolutionary biology, which revolutionized the unit of selection, because interactions occur between individuals.","[Nakazawa, Takefumi] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Nakazawa, T (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",take.nkzw@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","I am greatly honored to receive the 20th Miyadi Award of the Ecological Society of Japan.

However, it is unclear whether theoretical models can predict such patterns and how environmental factors may modify the effects of species interactions on species co-occurrence. Here we extend a spatially explicit neutral model by including competitive effects on birth and death probabilities to assess whether competition alone is able to produce non-random patterns of species co-occurrence. We show that transitive and intransitive competitive hierarchies alone (in the absence of environmental heterogeneity) are indeed able to generate non-random patterns with commonly used metrics and null models. Moreover, even weak levels of intransitive competition can increase local species richness. However, there is no simple rule or consistent directional change towards aggregation or segregation caused by competitive interactions. Instead, the spatial pattern depends on both the type of species interaction and the strength of dispersal. We conclude that co-occurrence analysis alone may not able to identify the underlying processes that generate the patterns.","[Ulrich, Werner] Nicholas Copernicus Univ Torun, Chair Ecol & Biogeog, Lwowska 39, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Jabot, Franck] Irstea, UR LISC, Aubiere, France; [Gotelli, Nicolas J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT USA","Ulrich, W (corresponding author), Nicholas Copernicus Univ Torun, Chair Ecol & Biogeog, Lwowska 39, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",ulrichw@umk.pl,,"Jabot, Franck/0000-0002-3113-9510; Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619",Polish National Science Centre [2014/13/B/NZ8/04681],WU was supported by a grant from the Polish National Science Centre (2014/13/B/NZ8/04681).,,72,34,36,4,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2017,126,1,,,,,91,100,,10.1111/oik.03392,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH7IW,WOS:000391947400010,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

The material thus grown was conditioned in a stream for microbial colonization, and its subsequent decomposition was measured in laboratory microcosms. Elevated CO2 reduced the quality of T. pratense but not that of A. capillaris. Water shortage limited plant quality but did not interact with CO2 concentration. Interspecific competition only affected nitrogen concentration in A. capillaris. Elevated CO2 did not affect decomposition rate, and A. capillaris, the species richer in nutrients, decomposed more slowly.

We tested how short-and long-term exposure to projected future temperatures affects intraspecific and interspecific competitive interactions in two species of coral reef damselfishes. In conspecific contests, juvenile Ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, exhibited no change in aggressive interactions after 4d exposure to higher temperatures. However, after 90d of exposure, fish showed a nonadaptive reduction in aggression at elevated temperatures. Conversely, 4d exposure to higher temperature increased aggression towards conspecifics in the lemon damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis. 90d exposure began to reduce this pattern, but overall there was little effect of temperature. Aggression in interspecific contests increased with short-term exposure, but was significantly lower after long-term exposure indicative of acclimation. Our results show how the length of exposure to elevated temperature can affect the outcome of competitive interactions. Furthermore, we illustrate that results from intraspecific contests may not accurately predict interspecific interactions, which will challenge our ability to generalise the effects of warming on competitive interactions.","[Warren, Donald T.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Dept Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Warren, Donald T.; Donelson, Jennifer M.; McCormick, Mark I.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Donelson, Jennifer M.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Ferrari, Maud C.

Studies have demonstrated the influence of localized competition and predation among stream fishes, but researchers have been largely unable to determine to what extent interspecific interactions act to control fish assemblage structure. Recent declines to geographic range and abundance of Plains Topminnow (Fundulus sciadicus (Cope)) have been anecdotally attributed to altered fish assemblages and potential competitive or predatory associations; however, important species interactions have yet to be identified. Variation among fish assemblage structure at 473 locations known to historically support Plains Topminnow was described in Nebraska to demonstrate the role of assemblage dynamics in regulating species occurrence. Nonrandom patterns of fish assemblage composition in terms of Plains Topminnow persistence were apparent statewide, and multiple relationships were recognized as regionally influential (e.g., Niobrara River: Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede)). Strong correlations were described relating Plains Topminnow extirpation to nonnative species establishment (Common Carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus), Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis (Baird and Girard)), and several potential predatory (Esocidae, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque)) or competitive interactions (Western Mosquitofish, Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus (Rafinesque), Sand Shiner Notropis stramineus (Cope), Red Shiner Cyprinella lutrensis (Baird and Girard)) were identified. Positive relationships are attributed to similar reliance of particular abiotic conditions (Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides (Rafinesque)) or habitat types (Gasterosteidae, Green Sunfish Lepomis cyanellus (Rafinesque), Iowa Darter Etheostoma exile (Winn)). Other identified species will require research to elucidate potential biotic interactions with Plains Topminnow. Resultant models are hypothesized to reflect biotic processes, and thereby provide analytical insight into the long-term influence of fish assemblage structure on a rare species. Identified relationships provide preliminary recognition of potentially important interspecific interactions involving an unfamiliar species from which further hypotheses can be evaluated to ascertain casual relationships.","[Schumann, D.

Bacteria growing in biofilms exhibit phenotypes distinct from planktonic growth, often rendering the application of antibacterial compounds ineffective. Computational modeling represents a complementary tool to experimentation for generating fundamental knowledge and developing more effective treatment strategies for chronic wound biofilm consortia. Results: We developed spatiotemporal models to investigate the multispecies metabolism of a biofilm consortium comprised of two common chronic wound isolates: the aerobe Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the facultative anaerobe Staphylococcus aureus. By combining genome-scale metabolic reconstructions with partial differential equations for metabolite diffusion, the models were able to provide both temporal and spatial predictions with genome-scale resolution. The models were used to analyze the metabolic differences between single species and two species biofilms and to demonstrate the tendency of the two bacteria to spatially partition in the multispecies biofilm as observed experimentally. Nutrient gradients imposed by supplying glucose at the bottom and oxygen at the top of the biofilm induced spatial partitioning of the two species, with S. aureus most concentrated in the anaerobic region and P. aeruginosa present only in the aerobic region. The two species system was predicted to support a maximum biofilm thickness much greater than P. aeruginosa alone but slightly less than S. aureus alone, suggesting an antagonistic metabolic effect of P. aeruginosa on S. aureus. When each species was allowed to enhance its growth through consumption of secreted metabolic byproducts assuming identical uptake kinetics, the competitiveness of P. aeruginosa was further reduced due primarily to the more efficient lactate metabolism of S. aureus. Lysis of S. aureus by a small molecule inhibitor secreted from P. aeruginosa and/or P. aeruginosa aerotaxis were predicted to substantially increase P. aeruginosa competitiveness in the aerobic region, consistent with in vitro experimental studies. Conclusions: Our biofilm modeling approach allows the prediction of individual species metabolism and interspecies interactions in both time and space with genome-scale resolution. This study yielded new insights into the multispecies metabolism of a chronic wound biofilm, in particular metabolic factors that may lead to spatial partitioning of the two bacterial species. We believe that P. aeruginosa lysis of S. aureus combined with nutrient competition is a particularly relevant scenario for which model predictions could be tested experimentally.","[Phalak, Poonam; Chen, Jin; Henson, Michael A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem Engn, 240 Thatcher Way,Life Sci Labs Bldg, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Phalak, Poonam; Chen, Jin; Henson, Michael A.] Univ Massachusetts, Inst Appl Life Sci, 240 Thatcher Way,Life Sci Labs Bldg, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Carlson, Ross P.] Montana State Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Carlson, Ross P.] Montana State Univ, Ctr Biofilm Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Henson, MA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem Engn, 240 Thatcher Way,Life Sci Labs Bldg, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.; Henson, MA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Inst Appl Life Sci, 240 Thatcher Way,Life Sci Labs Bldg, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",henson@ecs.umass.edu,"Phalak, Poonam/AAC-6302-2020","Phalak, Poonam/0000-0001-5437-8023",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U01EB019416]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET 1511346]; University of Massachusetts to Poonam Phalak as part of the Biotechnology Training Program (National Research Service Award) [T32 GM108556]; Directorate For EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1511346] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [U01EB019416] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM108556] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,The authors wish to acknowledge NIH (Award U01EB019416) and NSF (Award CBET 1511346) for partial financial support of this research.

As a consequence, interactions between species that occur in ecosystems are not taken into account. To investigate the effects of contaminants on interacting species dynamics, our study describes the functioning of a 2-L laboratory microcosm with two species, the duckweed Lemna minor and the microalgae Pseudo-kirchneriella subcapitata, exposed to cadmium contamination. We modelled the dynamics of both species and their interactions using a mechanistic model based on coupled ordinary differential equations. The main processes occurring in this two-species microcosm were thus formalised, including growth and settling of algae, growth of duckweeds, interspecific competition between the two species and cadmium effects. We estimated model parameters by Bayesian inference, using simultaneously all the data issued from multiple laboratory experiments specifically conducted for this study. Cadmium concentrations ranged between 0 and 50 mu g.L-1. For all parameters of our model, we obtained biologically realistic values and reasonable uncertainties. Only duckweed dynamics was affected by interspecific competition, while algal dynamics was not impaired. Growth rate of both species decreased with cadmium concentration, as well as competition intensity showing that the interspecific competition pressure on duckweed decreased with cadmium concentration. This innovative combination of mechanistic modelling and model guided experiments was successful to understand the algae-duckweed microcosm functioning without and with contaminant. This approach appears promising to include interactions between species when studying contaminant effects on ecosystem functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Seed predators may, therefore, adopt foraging strategies that favor dietary diversity and resource monitoring, rather than efficient energy intake, as suggested by optimal foraging theory. We tested whether fine-scale space use by a small-group-living seed predator-the bald-faced saki monkey (Pithecia irrorata)-reflected optimization of short-term foraging efficiency, maximization of daily dietary diversity, and/or responses to the threat of territorial encroachment by neighboring groups. Food patches across home ranges of five adjacent saki groups were widely spread, but areas with higher densities of stems or food species were not allocated greater feeding time. Foraging patterns-specifically, relatively long daily travel paths that bypassed available fruiting trees and relatively short feeding bouts in undepleted food patches-suggest a strategy that maximizes dietary diversification, rather than optimal foraging. Travel distance was unrelated to the proportion of seeds in the diet. Moreover, while taxonomically diverse, the daily diets of our study groups were no more species-rich than randomly derived diets based on co-occurring available food species. Sakis preferentially used overlapping areas of their HRs, within which adjacent groups shared many food trees, yet the density of food plants or food species in these areas was no greater than in other HR areas. The high likelihood of depletion by neighboring groups of otherwise enduring food sources may encourage monitoring of peripheral food patches in overlap areas, even if at the expense of immediate energy intake, suggesting that between-group competition is a key driver of fine-scale home range use in sakis.

The aim of this study was to characterize spatial and temporal water uptake of subtropical tree saplings, to assess the role of interspecific interaction on water uptake patterns and to quantify species niche breadth and overlap. Our experiment comprised two deciduous (Castanea henryi, Quercus serrata) and two evergreen tree species (Elaeocarpus decipiens, Schima superba) that were each planted in monoculture and 4-species mixture. We used deuterium-enriched water to trace seasonal water uptake from 5 cm and 20 cm soil depth. Castanea exploited predominantly the upper soil (74% of overall tracer uptake across treatments) whereas Quercus (50%), Elaeocarpus (57%) and Schima (62%) tended to use both soil layers more equally. Species identity had an overall significant effect on isotopic enrichment in stem water. There was no effect of species richness: niche breadth and overlap of single species was not affected by interspecific interactions in mixtures. Niche overlap between deciduous species was lowest (74%) whereas the two evergreen species had similar water uptake patterns (91%). According to our results, interspecific competition did not alter water uptake patterns of the studied species during the early phase of forest establishment. Thus, soil water uptake complementarity could only occur through inherent (fundamental) specific differences in water uptake niches based on sapling specialization, while phenotypic adjustments to interspecific interaction or neighbor diversity are less important.

Accordingly, we tested whether interplanting facilitates water utilization of rubber trees using stable isotope (delta D, delta O-18, and delta C-13) methods and by measuring soil water content (SWC), shoot potential, and leaf C and N concentrations in a Hevea-Flemingia agroforestry system in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. We detected a big difference in the utilization of different soil layer water between both species in this agroforestry system, as evidenced by the opposite seasonal fluctuations in both dD and d18O in stem water. However, similar predawn shoot potential of rubber trees at both sites demonstrating that the interplanted species did not affect the water requirements of rubber trees greatly. Rubber trees with higher d13C and more stable physiological indexes in this agroforestry system showed higher water use efficiency (WUE) and tolerance ability, and the SWC results suggested this agroforestry is conductive to water conservation. Our results clearly indicated that intercropping legume plants with rubber trees can benefit rubber trees own higher N supply, increase their WUE and better utilize soil water of each soil layer.","[Wu, Junen; Liu, Wenjie; Chen, Chunfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Junen; Chen, Chunfeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Liu, WJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",lwj@xtbg.org.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [2013FA022, 2014HB042]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31570622, 41271051, 31170447]; Chinese Academy of Sciences 135-ProgramChinese Academy of Sciences [KFJ-EW-STS-084]","We thank Dr. Deng Y, Mr. Liu MN and the Central Laboratory of XTBG for their help.

The presence of con-and/or heterospecific competitors would further affect the oviposition preference, because the preceding herbivores induce direct/indirect defences in plants against forthcoming herbivores, and thereby alter oviposition decisions. In previous studies, the abovementioned factors have not been studied in an integrative manner. We performed here a case study of this by assessing the oviposition preferences of a small white butterfly, Pieris rapae, for plants occupied by combinations of conspecific larvae, heterospecific larvae (Plutella xylostella), specialist parasitoids of Pi. rapae (Cotesia glomerata) and generalist predators (ants). We previously reported that the females showed equal preference for Pl. xylostella-infested and uninfested plants. Here, we showed that Pi. rapae females preferred uninfested plants to conspecific-infested ones, and Pl. xylostella-infested plants to Pi. rapae-infested ones. We discuss these oviposition preferences of Pi. rapae females in the framework of costs and benefits of interspecific herbivore associations from the above point of view.","[Shiojiri, Kaori; Takabayashi, Junji] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 2-509-3 Hirano, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Shiojiri, Kaori] Kyoto Univ, Hakubi Ctr Adv Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Sabelis, Maurice] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Kruislaan 320, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands","Takabayashi, J (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 2-509-3 Hirano, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",junji@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Takabayashi, Junji/G-2212-2010","Takabayashi, Junji/0000-0002-3575-9952","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","Grants for scientific research of priority area (S) and a scientific research study (B) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to J.T. supported this study in part.",,35,2,2,0,31,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

Management of such species outside a conservation area can influence species interactions inside the protected zone. This may result in unintended effects on populations of conservation concern even if they spend their entire life cycle within the protected area. We examined interspecific interactions between three species of large herbivores in the absence of mammalian predators in the Swiss National Park, and assessed whether the population size of the migratory red deer (Cervus elaphus) that is harvested outside the park in autumn and winter affected the two resident species, chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and ibex (Capra ibex). Dietary overlap was high between the three species while they co-occurred in the park, suggesting potential for interspecific resource competition. Particularly the habitat use of chamois was affected by red deer population size, with decreased use of meadows and forest with increasing red deer numbers, and increased use of areas covered by scree. Ibex habitat use was affected by the population sizes of all three species, but effects differed between species and season. Moreover, horn growth in young chamois and the population growth rate of ibex were negatively related to red deer numbers. The results suggest that high population size of red deer negatively affects ibex and chamois through the migratory behavior of red deer between protected and non-protected areas. Effective management of a migratory ungulate species outside the protected part of its range, taking account of its ecology and natural behavior, can thus have positive effects on populations within a protected area by alleviating interspecific competition. However, this requires co-operation between policy makers and hunters, acceptance by local people, as well as flexibility to deviate from traditional management regimes such as supplementary feeding to tie animals to certain areas.","[Anderwald, Pia; Haller, Rudolf M.; Schweiger, Anna K.; Filli, Flurin] Swiss Natl Pk, Chaste Planta Wildenberg, CH-7530 Zernez, Switzerland; [Herfindal, Ivar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Risch, Anita C.; Schuetz, Martin; Schweiger, Anna K.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Schweiger, Anna K.] Univ Zurich Irchel, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Anderwald, P (corresponding author), Swiss Natl Pk, Chaste Planta Wildenberg, CH-7530 Zernez, Switzerland.",pia.anderwald@nationalpark.ch,"Herfindal, Ivar/A-4609-2015; Risch, Anita C./A-9836-2012","Herfindal, Ivar/0000-0002-5860-9252; Risch, Anita C./0000-0003-0531-8336; Schweiger, Anna Katharina/0000-0002-5567-4200",,,,74,12,12,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,NOV,2015,6,11,,,,,,,228,10.1890/ES15-00365.1,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CZ7WH,WOS:000367310600019,,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

We used these predictions to assess the relative effects of habitat filtering and niche differentiation on recruit community assembly over spatial (5- and 30-m neighbourhoods) and temporal (20-yr) scales in the Forest Dynamics Plot at Barro Colorado Island. Location: Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Methods: We integrated data on the spatial patterns of >= 1 cm DBH (diameter at 1.3 m above ground) recruits with data on seven functional traits for 64 species. First, we quantified the interspecific association patterns of all species pairs i and j using the K-function K-ij(r) and the nearest-neighbour distribution function D-ij(r). Second, for those pairs with significant spatial associations, we calculated an index of interspecific spatial association using the results of these two summary statistics. Finally, we examined the relationship between interspecific spatial association and trait similarity using simple and partial Mantel tests. Results: In all censuses, almost one-half of species pairs had no spatial associations, but for pairs that were significantly spatially associated, positive relationships between trait similarity and spatial association occurred in 5-m and 30-m neighbourhoods, whereas significant negative relationships only appeared in 5-m neighbourhoods. This suggests that habitat filtering was more important than niche differentiation in assembling recruit communities at 5- and 30-m scales. Habitat filtering mainly acted upon traits related to topographic habitat preferences and dispersal mode, whereas spatial association was inversely related to similarity in terms of wood specific gravity and shade tolerance. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both stochastic and deterministic processes operate in species-rich ecological communities, but the role of habitat filtering and niche differentiation as determinants of community assembly vary over spatial and temporal scales. Species co-occurrence was driven by habitat filtering at small and large scales, but also by a combination of niche differentiation and weaker-competitor exclusion effects at small scales. Temporal variations in the importance of habitat filtering and niche differentiation could be related to the occurrence of disturbances such as tree falls.

Within this framework, population dynamics and competition outcome can be determined without assuming any particular form of the population growth function. The dynamics of each species is determined by two parameters: the mean resource requirement theta (related to the mean metabolic rate) and individual distinguishability D-r (related to intra- compared to interspecific functional variation).

However, the differences in competitive ability may depend on the identity of competitors. In order to test the effects of competitors, Ageratina adenophora plants from both native and invasive ranges competed directly, and competed with native residents from both invasive (China) and native (Mexico) ranges respectively. Invasive A. adenophora plants were more competitive than their conspecifics from native populations when competing with natives from China (interspecific competition), but not when competing with natives from Mexico. Invasive A. adenophora plants also showed higher competitive ability when grown in high-density monoculture communities of plants from the same population (intrapopulation competition). In contrast, invasive A. adenophora plants showed lower competitive ability when competing with plants from native populations (intraspecific competition). Our results indicated that in the invasive range A. adenophora has evolved to effectively cope with co-occurring natives and high density environments, contributing to invasion success.

PSF is a key determinant influencing plant population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem functions. Despite accumulating evidence for the importance of PSF and development of specific PSF models, different models are not yet fully integrated. Here, we review the theoretical progress in understanding PSF. When first proposed. PSF was integrated with various mathematical frameworks to discuss its influence on plant competition. Recent theoretical models have advanced PSF research at different levels of ecological organizations by considering multiple species, applying spatially explicit simulations to examine how local scale predictions apply to larger scales, and assessing the effect of PSF on plant temporal dynamics over the course of succession. We then review two foundational models for microbial- and litter-mediated PSF. We present a theoretical framework to illustrate that although the two models are typically presented separately, their behavior can be understood together by invasibility analysis. We conclude with suggestions for future directions in PSF theoretical studies, which include specifically addressing microbial diversity to integrate litter- and microbial-mediated PSF, and apply PSF to general coexistence theory through a trait-based approach.","[Ke, Po-Ju] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ke, Po-Ju; Miki, Takeshi] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Miki, Takeshi] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 115, Taiwan","Ke, PJ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 371 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pojuke@stanford.edu,"Ke, Po-Ju/Q-3010-2019; Miki, Takeshi/F-8189-2010","Ke, Po-Ju/0000-0002-8371-7984; Miki, Takeshi/0000-0002-2452-8681",National Taiwan University and Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [NSC101-2621-B-002-004-MY3],The authors thank Tadashi Fukami and Kabir Peay for their useful comments on the manuscript.

We document a striking new case of plumage convergence in the Helmeted Woodpecker (Dryocopus galeatus) and explore the possibility of visual mimicry among Atlantic Forest woodpeckers. Our multilocus phylogenetic analyses unequivocally place D. galeatus within Celeus, indicating that the former has subsequently converged in appearance upon the distantly related and syntopic Dryocopus lineatus, to which it bears a remarkable resemblance in plumage coloration and pattern. Although details of the Helmeted Woodpecker's ecology and natural history are only now beginning to emerge, its smaller size and submissive behavior are consistent with predictions derived from evolutionary game-theory models and the hypothesis of interspecific social-dominance mimicry (ISDM). Moreover, estimates of avian visual acuity suggest that size-related mimetic deception is plausible at distances ecologically relevant to Celeus and Dryocopus foraging behavior. In light of our results, we recommend taxonomic transfer of D. galeatus to Celeus and emphasize the need for detailed behavioral studies that examine the social costs and benefits of plumage convergence to explicitly test for ISDM and other forms of mimicry in these Atlantic Forest woodpecker communities. Future field studies examining potential cases of competitive mimicry should also take into account the mimic's acoustic behavior, particularly in the presence of putative model species and other heterospecific competitors, as any discontinuity between morphological and behavioral mimicry would likely preclude the possibility of deception.","[Benz, Brett W.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Robbins, Mark B.] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Zimmer, Kevin J.] Los Angeles Cty Museum Nat Hist, Los Angeles, CA USA","Benz, BW (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, New York, NY 10024 USA.",bbenz@amnh.org,,,"Monell Molecular Laboratory; Cullman Research Facility in the Department of Ornithology, American Museum of Natural History","We thank the following institutions and their staffs for providing tissue loans: American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH); National Museum of Natural History (USNM); Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science (LSUMNS); Museo de Zoologia, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM); University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute (KU); University of Washington Burke Museum (UWBM); and Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (LACM).

Such quick and drastic changes in climate are likely to affect species distribution. According to future climate scenarios some species will have the possibility to colonise new areas, mainly due to expansion of suitable habitat conditions, whereas other species could be negatively affected due to habitat reduction. In this study, we analysed, in the perspective stated above, the distribution of two hare species: the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) and the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), across Central Italian Alps. Mountain hare on the Alps is a relict species, while brown hare is widespread all over Italy and also across the Alps at lower elevations. We applied future climate scenarios to both hare species to understand how climate change could affect their distribution in the next 70 years. Mountain hare distribution surface area is predicted to decrease in the next few years at its southern edge, but the species should expand its range in northern areas. Interestingly, brown hare distribution seems to be unaffected by climate changes, since no evident area of substitution appeared in our simulations. Hence, contrary to one's expectations based on the two species different niches, while we were able to predict a reduction in mountain hare distribution, our simulations did not show a substitution of the mountain hare by the more generalist brown hare at the southern margins of its distribution.

Avoidance of dominant competitors along the axes of space and time is a potential mechanism for reducing chances of direct encounters between species. However, when resources are essential and spatially fixed, options for spatial partitioning may be limited. We examined resource partitioning within a guild of eight carnivore species at water sources across two commercial farmlands in southwest Namibia. In this semi-desert environment, surface water is scarce and farmers are forced to provision water for livestock through artificial means. Camera traps were used to record spatial and temporal activity patterns of carnivore species at artificial and natural permanent water sources. We found that carnivores use either spatial or temporal resource partitioning, with temporal partitioning being most frequently seen. An association was seen between difference in body mass and degree of spatial partitioning, where species pairings with larger differences in body mass showed the greatest degree of partitioning. These results show that while in arid environments water is rare and used by a number of carnivore species, resource partitioning allows a guild of carnivores, including species of conservation concern, to coexist outside of protected areas.","[Edwards, S.; Wiesel, I.] Brown Hyena Res Project, Luderitz 9000, Namibia; [Edwards, S.; Gange, A.

How such traits evolve across species remains unclear. Recent work suggests that activation of sex steroid receptors in neuromuscular systems is necessary for the fine motor skills needed to execute physically elaborate displays. Thus, using passerine birds as models, we test whether interspecific variation in display complexity predicts species differences in the abundance of androgen and oestrogen receptors (AR and ER-) expressed in the forelimb musculature and spinal cord. We find that small-scale evolutionary patterns in physical display complexity positively predict expression of AR in the main muscles that lift and retract the wings. No such relationship is detected in the spinal cord, and we do not find a correlation between display behaviour and neuromuscular expression of ER-. Also, we find that AR expression levels in different androgen targets throughout the body - namely the wing muscles, spinal cord and testes - are not necessarily correlated, providing evidence that evolutionary forces drive AR expression in a tissue-specific manner. These results suggest co-evolution between the physical prowess necessary for display performance and levels of AR expression in avian forelimb muscles. Moreover, this relationship appears to be both specific to muscle and AR-mediated signalling. Given that prior work suggests that activation of muscular AR is a necessary component of physical display performance, our current data support the hypothesis that sexual selection shapes levels of AR expressed in the forelimb skeletal muscles to help drive the evolution of adaptive motor abilities.","[Fuxjager, Matthew J.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Fuxjager, Matthew J.; Eaton, Joy; Salwiczek, Lucie H.; Rensel, Michelle A.; Schlinger, Barney A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Integrat Biol & Physiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fuxjager, Matthew J.; Schlinger, Barney A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Lab Neuroendocrinol, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lindsay, Willow R.; Day, Lainy B.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; [Lindsay, Willow R.] Gothenburg Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Salwiczek, Lucie H.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Neurobiol, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Barske, Julia; Sorenson, Laurie; Schlinger, Barney A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Schlinger, Barney A.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 084303092, Panama","Fuxjager, MJ (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, 228 Winston Hall, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",mfoxhunter@gmail.com,,"Day, Lainy/0000-0002-9122-3044","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32 HD007228]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-0646459, IOS-1122180]; Division Of Integrative Organismal SystemsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1122180] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [T32HD007228] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank STRI for assistance with the project, and Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente and the Autoridad del Canal de Panama for permission to collect these species.

In communities of frogs and toads, the phenology of advertisement calling provides insights into temporal partitioning of reproductive effort and its implications for community dynamics. This study assessed the phenology of advertisement calling in an anuran community from Melbourne, in southern Australia. We collated data from 1432 surveys of 253 sites and used logistic regression to quantify seasonality in the nightly probability of calling and the influence of meteorological variables on this probability for six species of frogs. We found limited overlap in the predicted seasonal peaks of calling among these species. Those shown to have overlapping calling peaks are unlikely to be in direct competition, due to differences in larval ecology (Crinia signifera and Litoria ewingii) or differences in calling behavior and acoustics (Limnodynastes dumerilii and Litoria raniformis). In contrast, closely related and ecologically similar species (Crinia signfera and Crinia parinsignifera; Litoria ewingii and Litoria verreauxii) appear to have staggered seasonal peaks of calling. In combination with interspecific variation in the meteorological correlates of calling, these results may be indicative of temporal partitioning of reproductive activity to facilitate coexistence, as has been reported for tropical and temperate anurans from other parts of the globe.","[Heard, Geoffrey W.; Canessa, Stefano] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Heard, Geoffrey W.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Parris, Kirsten M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia","Heard, GW (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",heardg@unimelb.edu.au,"Parris, Kirsten/K-7684-2012; Canessa, Stefano/J-2069-2014","Parris, Kirsten/0000-0003-2550-585X; Canessa, Stefano/0000-0002-0932-826X","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Australian National Environmental Research Program; Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology; Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning; Growling Grass Frog Trust Fund; Museums Victoria; Melbourne Water; Parks Victoria; Victorian Department of State Development, Business and Innovation","Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council, Australian National Environmental Research Program, Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology, Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Growling Grass Frog Trust Fund, Museums Victoria, Melbourne Water, Parks Victoria and the Victorian Department of State Development, Business and Innovation.",,70,7,7,6,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

By definition, biological species are reproductively isolated, but many animals fail to distinguish between conspecifics and closely related heterospecifics. In some cases, phenotypic plasticity may interfere with species recognition. Here, we document a seasonal polyphenism in the degree of dark wing pigmentation in smoky rubyspot damselflies (Hetaerina titia) - a shift so pronounced that it led early researchers to classify different forms of H.titia as separate species. We further show how the seasonal colour shift impacts species recognition with the sympatric congener Hetaerina occisa. Interspecific aggression (territorial fights) and reproductive interference (mating attempts) are much more frequent early in the year, when H.titia more closely resembles H.occisa, compared to later in the year when the dark phase of H.titia predominates. Using wing colour manipulations of tethered damselflies, we show that the seasonal changes in interspecific interactions are caused not only by the seasonal colour shift but also by shifts in discriminatory behaviour in both species. We also experimentally tested and rejected the hypothesis that learning underlies the behavioural shifts in H.occisa. An alternative hypothesis, which remains to be tested, is that the seasonal polyphenism in H.titia wing coloration has resulted in the evolution of a corresponding seasonal polyphenism in species recognition in H.occisa. This study illustrates one of the many possible ways that plasticity in species recognition cues may influence the evolution of interspecific interactions.","[Drury, J. P.; Grether, G.

In rubyspot damselflies (Hetaerina spp.), the red wing coloration of mature males is hypothesized to be a key trait for sex recognition and competitor recognition within species and the proximate trigger for interspecific male-male aggression. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating the wing coloration of tethered conspecific intruders and measuring the responses of territory holders of three species in the field. As predicted, covering the red spots of mature males with black ink nearly eliminated territorial responses, and in some cases, territorial holders clasped the blackened males as if they were females. Adding red spots to female wings triggered territorial responses and nearly eliminated sexual responses. Immature males with artificial red spots were attacked at the same rate as mature male intruders, and much more frequently than were immature male controls. The results varied somewhat by species. In H.titia, the only species of Hetaerina with substantial black wing pigmentation, the effects of blackening the red spots of intruders varied both geographically and seasonally. But even when blackening the red spots of male intruders did not reduce the aggressive response of H.titia territory holders, adding artificial red spots to female wings elicited aggressive responses and nearly eliminated sexual responses. The results of this study further strengthen the evidence that interspecific aggression in Hetaerina results from overlap in territorial signals and that the derived black wing pigmentation of H.titia reduces interspecific aggression.","[Grether, Gregory F.; Drury, Jonathan P.; Berlin, Erin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Anderson, Christopher N.] Dominican Univ, Dept Biol Sci, River Forest, IL USA; Dept Biol, Ecole Normale Superieure, F-75005 Paris, France","Grether, GF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",ggrether@ucla.edu,"Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011",,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1020586]; NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates programNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); UCLA Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology; UCLA Graduate Division; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1020586] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank Tim Alvey, Simone Giovanetti, Kate Henderson, Sara Hu, Linnea Karlen, Emily Khazan, and Summer Sanford for field assistance.

Because the declines have spanned a wide geographic area, the primary mechanisms driving them likely operate at a large, multiregional scale at sea. However, identification of such mechanisms has remained elusive. Using hierarchical models of stock-recruitment dynamics, we tested the hypothesis that competition between pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and sockeye salmon for prey has led to reduced growth and productivity and delayed maturation of up to 36 sockeye populations spanning the region during the past 55 years. Our findings indicate the abundance of North Pacific pink salmon in the second year of sockeye life at sea is a key factor contributing to the decline of sockeye salmon productivity, including sockeye in the Fraser River where an increase from 200 to 400 million pink salmon is predicted to reduce sockeye recruitment by 39%. Additionally, length-at-age of Fraser River sockeye salmon declined with greater sockeye and pink salmon abundance, and age at maturity increased with greater pink salmon abundance. Our analyses provide evidence that interspecific competition for prey can affect growth, age, and survival of sockeye salmon at sea.","[Ruggerone, Gregory T.] Nat Resources Consultants, Seattle, WA 98199 USA; [Connors, Brendan M.] ESSA Technol, Vancouver, BC V6H 3H4, Canada; [Connors, Brendan M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Ruggerone, GT (corresponding author), Nat Resources Consultants, Seattle, WA 98199 USA.",gruggerone@nrccorp.com,,,,,,86,39,44,0,46,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

In natural communities, complex species interactions are likely to affect the outcomes of reciprocal co-evolution between consumers and their resource species. Individuals face multiple enemies simultaneously, and consequently they need to adapt to several different types of enemy pressures. In this study, we assessed how protist predation affects the susceptibility of bacterial populations to infection by viral parasites, and whether there is an associated cost of defence on the competitive ability of the bacteria. As a study system we used Serratia marcescens and its lytic bacteriophage, along with two bacteriovorous protists with distinct feeding modes: Tetrahymena thermophila (particle feeder) and Acanthamoeba castellanii (surface feeder). The results were further confirmed with another study system with Pseudomonas and Tetrahymena thermophila. Results: We found that selection by protist predators lowered the susceptibility to infections by lytic phages in Serratia and Pseudomonas. In Serratia, concurrent selection by phages and protists led to lowered susceptibility to phage infections and this effect was independent from whether the bacteria shared a co-evolutionary history with the phage population or not. Bacteria that had evolved with phages were overall more susceptible to phage infection (compared to bacteria with history with multiple enemies) but they were less vulnerable to the phages they had co-evolved with than ancestral phages. Selection by bacterial enemies was costly in general and was seen as a lowered fitness in absence of phages, measured as a biomass yield. Conclusions: Our results show the significance of multiple species interactions on pairwise consumer-resource interaction, and suggest potential overlap in defending against predatory and parasitic enemies in microbial consumer-resource communities. Ultimately, our results could have larger scale effects on eco-evolutionary community dynamics.","[Ormala-Odegrip, Anni-Maria; Ojala, Ville; Zhang, Ji; Bamford, Jaana K.

This event was followed by higher recruitment of three infaunal clam species, Ruditapes philippinarum, Meretrix lusoria and Mactra venenformis, than before, most probably owing to competitive release from the shrimp. Thereafter, Me. lusoria and Ma. venenformis were successful in establishing their adult populations in the newly vacated habitat, but R. philippinarum failed. The surface sediment is more easily eroded by hydrodynamic forcing there than in the low-tide zone where the R. philippinarum population persisted. In the present study, the examination of spatiotemporal size-frequency variations in the clam species detected that their success/failure was primarily caused by the survival of juveniles in the first winter after recruitment. The assessment of potential sediment erodibility through time suggested that the seabed of the high to mid-tide zone was subject to more intense physical disturbance in winter than in the other seasons, especially during the nighttime. This was attributable to seasonally varying (1) prevailing wind directions, (2) daily nighttime length and (3) emergence/submergence durations per tide according to the seasonal change in diurnal tidal-height inequality. We hypothesized that some high burrowing ability of juvenile clams is required for their persistence in the unstable sediment, which was tested by laboratory and field experiments. The burrowing performance of juveniles was higher in Me. lusoria and Ma. venenformis than in R. philippinarum and was reduced under dark against light conditions in all species. For those juveniles occurring in the high to mid-tide zone, vulnerability to sediment erosion would increase at nights in the wintertime through a combined effect of the stronger wave action and the extension of both nighttime length and nighttime duration of submergence with very shallow waters. With forced repetitive re-burrowing, R. philippinarum reduced burrowing performance, whereas the other two species either enhanced or maintained it. Thus the interspecific difference in the resistivity of juvenile clams to unstable sediments can explain their overwintering success/failure in the high to mid-tide zone. The present findings provide a new perspective for the mechanism of winter mortality of infaunal bivalves inhabiting tidal flats in temperate to boreal regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we quantified the phylogenetic structure of mammal communities in Africa to investigate how community structure varies with respect to climate and species richness variation across the continent. In addition, we investigated how phylogenetic patterns vary across carnivores, primates, and ungulates. We predicted that climate would differentially affect the structure of communities from different clades due to between-clade biological variation. We examined 203 communities using two metrics, the net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon (NTI) indices. We used simultaneous autoregressive models to predict community phylogenetic structure from climate variables and species richness. We found that most individual communities exhibited a phylogenetic structure consistent with a null model, but both climate and species richness significantly predicted variation in community phylogenetic metrics. Using NTI, species rich communities were composed of more distantly related taxa for all mammal communities, as well as for communities of carnivorans or ungulates. Temperature seasonality predicted the phylogenetic structure of mammal, carnivoran, and ungulate communities, and annual rainfall predicted primate community structure. Additional climate variables related to temperature and rainfall also predicted the phylogenetic structure of ungulate communities. We suggest that both past interspecific competition and habitat filtering have shaped variation in tropical mammal communities. The significant effect of climatic factors on community structure has important implications for the diversity of mammal communities given current models of future climate change.","[Kamilar, Jason M.; Reed, Kaye E.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Kamilar, Jason M.] Midwestern Univ, Dept Anat, Arizona Coll Osteopath Med, Glendale, AZ USA; [Beaudrot, Lydia] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Beaudrot, Lydia] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Reed, Kaye E.] Arizona State Univ, Inst Human Origins, Tempe, AZ USA","Kamilar, JM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",jason.kamilar@asu.edu,"; Beaudrot, L./M-6936-2017","Kamilar, Jason/0000-0001-6082-9396; Beaudrot, L./0000-0001-8135-7519",UC Davis Open Access Fund; Midwestern University,"We thank Jillian DeBenney and Joshua Kohn for African mammal data compilation.

We used accurately recorded occurrence records and ecological niche modeling to predict the distribution of two poorly known small carnivore species that occur in Asia, the spotted linsang (Prionodon pardicolor) and banded linsang (Prionodon linsang), and analyzed their niche overlaps for habitat and elevation. We then assessed the loss of their suitable habitat and estimated the proportion of predicted presence under protected areas. We identified and assessed possible anthropogenic threats, and used our modeling predictions to recommend surveying priorities. Our study confirmed that these two linsangs are geographically separated, with no known overlap of their distributions. Our results indicated that the habitat and elevation niches of these two linsangs are similar: they both occur primarily in evergreen forest and can be found at all elevations up to around 3,000 m. Although these two linsangs might be allopatric due to intense interspecific competition between them, other explanations could explain their distribution patterns, such as biogeographical and ecological barriers. Our findings suggest that these two linsangs might be threatened by the loss, degradation, and fragmentation of tropical evergreen forests. Urgent field studies are thus needed to learn more about their habitat requirements and the impact of anthropogenic threats, including tropical forest disturbance and hunting.","[Jennings, Andrew P.] SMALL CARNIVORES Res & Conservat, Portland, ME USA; [Veron, Geraldine] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat, CNRS MNHN UPMC EPHE, Evolut,Biodivers,ISYEB,UMR 7205, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Jennings, AP (corresponding author), SMALL CARNIVORES Res & Conservat, 83 St Lawrence St, Portland, ME USA.",smallcarnivores@yahoo.com,"Veron, Geraldine/P-8163-2019","Veron, Geraldine/0000-0003-4247-3976",CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission; MNHN; French Ministry of Research (Programmes Pluriformations and Actions Transversales du Museum),"We are very grateful to the following researchers (and their institutions and sponsors) for providing information: Mohd.

The effects of phenology on species interactions are especially pronounced in aquatic systems, but the evidence is largely derived from experimental studies. We examined whether differences in breeding phenology between two pond-breeding salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum and A. maculatum) affected metamorph recruitment and demographic traits within natural populations, with the expectation that the fall-breeding A. annulatum would negatively affect the spring-breeding A. maculatum. We monitored populations of each species at five ponds over 4 years using drift fences. Metamorph abundance and survival of A. annulatum were affected by intra- and interspecific processes, whereas metamorph size and date of emigration were primarily influenced by intraspecific effects. Metamorph abundance, snout-vent length, date of emigration and survival for A. maculatum were all predicted by combinations of intra- and interspecific effects, but often showed negative relationships with A. annulatum metamorph traits and abundance. Size and date of metamorphosis were strongly correlated within each species, but in opposite patterns (negative for A. annulatum and positive for A. maculatum), suggesting that the two species use alternative strategies to enhance terrestrial survival and that these factors may influence their interactions. Our results match predictions from experimental studies that suggest recruitment is influenced by intra- and interspecific processes which are determined by phenological differences between species. Incorporating spatiotemporal variability when modeling population dynamics is necessary to understand the importance of phenology in species interactions, especially as shifts in phenology occur under climate change.","[Anderson, Thomas L.; Conner, Christopher A.; Osbourn, Michael S.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Hocking, Daniel J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Earl, Julia E.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Harper, Elizabeth B.] Paul Smiths Coll, Div Nat Resource Management & Ecol, Paul Smiths, NY 12970 USA; [Peterman, William E.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey Prairie Res Inst, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Rittenhouse, Tracy A.

In carnivores, interference is widespread between species with similar diets. Smaller species are expected to differentiate their diet from that of larger, dominant ones, to reduce the risk of potentially lethal encounters. Interference has been reported between tigers and common leopards, with the former dominant over the latter. In 2009-2011, in an area of Terai, South-West Nepal, we assessed food habits and prey selection of tigers and common leopards, to evaluate whether prey partitioning occurred between these large cats. Prey availability was high, both in terms of number of species (at least seven wild ungulates beside livestock, two primates and an array of smaller prey) and density (large ungulates, livestock and primates: 130.8-174.8 individuals per km(2)). Wild vertebrates were the staple of both cats (tigers: 82.7%; common leopards: 66.6%), but common leopards used livestock significantly more than tigers did. Diet breadth of leopards was c. 20% larger than that of tigers, indicating a broader trophic niche. Significant differences in prey use and selection occurred between tigers and leopards, with the former using large (i.e. >100kg) prey more often and small (i.e. 5-25kg) prey less often than the latter did. Medium-sized prey were taken in comparable proportions by the two cats, with a great overlap of diet (Pianka index: 0.85). In conclusion, in our study area, apparently tigers and leopards did not base their coexistence on diet partitioning, suggesting a major role for spatial and/or temporal partitioning.","[Lovari, S.; Ferretti, F.] Ev K2 CNR Agcy, Bergamo, Italy; [Lovari, S.; Ferretti, F.] Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Pokheral, C.

The magnitude of interference is linked to that of attack efficiency: when both levels are intermediate, populations are maximally stable and have high competitive ability. Individual variation can affect ecological dynamics through its effect on attack efficiency and handling time. Because interference has a non-linear effect on consumer foraging rates, individual variation in mutual interference can strongly affect ecological dynamics. Here, we explicitly incorporate individual variation in attack efficiency, handling time and interference into a dynamic consumer-resource model and show that variation increases species coexistence by depressing attack efficiency to a greater extent than predator interference. We argue that this differential effect of variation affects the equilibrium densities of consumers and their prey, thus altering their competitive ability. Intermediate levels of variation can maximize both consumer persistence and competitive ability. Our results show the importance of quantifying individual variation in natural populations for understanding the persistence and stability of species within communities.","[Gibert, Jean P.; DeLong, John P.] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Gibert, JP (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",jeanphisth@gmail.com,,"DeLong, John/0000-0003-0558-8213",,,,62,16,16,1,4,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2504,,978-0-12-802445-4,ADV ECOL RES,Adv.

Analysis of video footage suggested competition was enforced without agonistic behaviour and access to the resource was not governed by size.

However, detailed information is still scarce for Niviventer confucianus and Apodemus draco in the Hengduan Mountains on their habitat requirements. Data on habitats utilized by sympatric N. confucianus and A. draco were collected using transect line sampling from April to December 2008 in Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve, China. The results indicated that both mammals exhibited an obvious habitat preference across seasons. In spring, N. confucianus preferred habitats at lower elevations, with thicker leaf litter, lower bamboo cover, shorter total length of fallen logs and higher tree diversity, and A. draco preferred habitats at lower elevations and with higher percentage of nut trees. In summer-autumn, N. confucianus frequently occurred at sites with lower elevations and thicker leaf litter, while A. dram preferred habitats with thicker leaf litter and higher percentage of nut trees. In winter, N. confucianus preferred sites with lower elevations and dead tree density, and higher canopy and percentage of nut trees. In contrast, A. draco preferred habitats with thicker leaf litter and higher shrub density. Variables closely relating to food availability and predation risks contributed more to discriminating habitat plots from control ones, implying that the two factors played an important role in shaping their process of habitat selection. In addition, both mammals exhibited a distinct habitat use pattern from each other, and some variables, such as elevation, contributed more to their habitat separation across seasons, which can potentially reduce interspecific competition and further facilitate their coexistence in sympatry.","[Yuan, Shibin; Mu, Huaqiang; Cao, Shanshan; Zhang, Mingchun; Yang, Xuyu; Hui, Jinchu; Zhang, Zejun] China West Normal Univ, Inst Rare Anim & Plants, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xiaodong] Sichuan Forestry Bur, Wildlife Conservat Div, Chengdu 610081, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZJ (corresponding author), China West Normal Univ, Inst Rare Anim & Plants, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China.",zhangzj@ioz.ac.cn,"Yuan, Shibin/W-5289-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970382, 31270570]; Giant Pandas International Cooperation Foundation of State Forestry Administration; Foundations of the National Ministry of Education for New-Century Distinguished Talents","This project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (30970382, 31270570), Giant Pandas International Cooperation Foundation of State Forestry Administration, and Foundations of the National Ministry of Education for New-Century Distinguished Talents.

We contrast the hatching periods, growth, prey selectivity, and feeding success of the planktonic stages of the two species. Polar cod hatched from January to mid-July and sand lance from mid-July to early September, precluding any competition among the larval stages. By weight, sand lance larvae grew 3.7 times faster than polar cod larvae. The co-occurring juveniles of both species fed primarily on copepods and to a lesser extent on bivalve larvae, shifting to larger prey with growth. The feeding success of both species appeared limited by the availability of their preferred prey. A significant diet overlap in juveniles >25 mm suggested potential competition for Pseudocalanus spp., Calanus spp., and bivalve larvae. However, sand lance strongly selected for nauplii while the more diversified diet of polar cod comprised mainly the copepodites of these species. Interspecific competition for food is unlikely at this time but is predicted to amplify with a climate-related reduction in the size of zooplankton prey and an increase in the abundance of sand lance.","[Falardeau, Marianne; Fortier, Louis] Univ Laval, Quebec Ocean, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Robert, Dominique] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Fisheries & Marine Inst, Ctr Fisheries Ecosyst Res, St John, NF A1C 5R3, Canada","Falardeau, M (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Quebec Ocean, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",marianne.falardeau-cote.1@ulaval.ca,,,Ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and Quebec-Ocean,"We are grateful to the captains and crews of the Canadian icebreaker CCGS Amundsen.

The relative proportion of the individual species in a four-species biofilm was assessed using quantitative PCR based on SYBR Green I fluorescence with specific primers. The results indicated strong synergistic interactions in a four-species biofilm model community with a more than 3-fold increase in biofilm formation and demonstrated the strong dominance of two strains, Xanthomonas retroflexus and Paenibacillus amylolyticus. The developed approach can be used as a standard procedure for evaluating interspecies interactions in defined microbial communities.

Green roofs with shallow growing media represent stressful conditions for plant survival, thus plants that survive and grow are important for maximizing economic and ecological benefits. While field trials are essential for selecting appropriate green roof plants, we wanted to determine whether plant leaf traits could predict changes in abundance ( growth) to provide a more general framework for plant selection. We quantified leaf traits and derived life-history traits ( Grime's C-S-R strategies) for 13 species used in a four-year green roof experiment involving five plant life forms. Changes in canopy density in monocultures and mixtures containing one to five life forms were determined and related to plant traits using multiple regression. We expected traits related to stress-tolerance would characterize the species that best grew in this relatively harsh setting. While all species survived to the end of the experiment, canopy species diversity in mixture treatments was usually much lower than originally planted. Most species grew slower in mixture compared to monoculture, suggesting that interspecific competition reduced canopy diversity. Species dominant in mixture treatments tended to be fast-growing ruderals and included both native and non-native species. Specific leaf area was a consistently strong predictor of final biomass and the change in abundance in both monoculture and mixture treatments. Some species in contrasting life-form groups showed compensatory dynamics, suggesting that life-form mixtures can maximize resilience of cover and biomass in the face of environmental fluctuations. This study confirms that plant traits can be used to predict growth performance in green roof ecosystems. While rapid canopy growth is desirable for green roofs, maintenance of species diversity may require engineering of conditions that favor less aggressive species.","[Lundholm, Jeremy; Heim, Amy; Tran, Stephanie] St Marys Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada; [Lundholm, Jeremy; Heim, Amy; Tran, Stephanie] St Marys Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada; [Smith, Tyler] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Eastern Cereal & Oilseen Resarch Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Lundholm, J (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",jlundholm@smu.ca,,"Smith, Tyler/0000-0001-7683-2653",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This work was supported by an NSERC Discovery grant to J.

Within the biomedical environment, sequencing data are increasingly used for disease diagnosis and prognosis, treatment development, counseling, and so on. Many of these applications rely on the identification of disease causing variants. This is a particularly challenging problem because of the large number and wide variety of sequence variants identified in sequencing projects, and also because we only have a limited understanding of the physicochemical/biochemical properties that differentiate neutral from pathologic variants. Nonetheless, these last years have witnessed important methodological advances for one class of variants, those corresponding to changes in the amino-acid sequence of proteins. Proteins are a main constituent of living systems. We know that although their biological properties are essentially determined by the amino-acid sequence, not all the changes in this sequence have the same impact. Some are neutral, but others affect protein function and lead to disease. A large body of evidence shows that whether one or the other is the case that depends on properties such as mutation location in the protein structure, interspecies conservation, and so on. Mutation prediction methods based on these features have good success rates, in the 70-90% range, although representation over time suggests there is a performance plateau that would limit their applicability. In light of the most recent advances in the field, and after reviewing the foundations of prediction methods, we discuss the existence of this performance threshold and how it can be overcomed.","[Riera, Casandra; Lois, Sergio; de la Cruz, Xavier] VHIR, Lab Translat Bioinformat Neurosci, Barcelona, Spain; [de la Cruz, Xavier] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain","de la Cruz, X (corresponding author), VHIR, Lab Translat Bioinformat Neurosci, Barcelona, Spain.",xavier.delacruz@vhir.org,,"De la Cruz Montserrat, Fco.

This species has become a serious pest of vegetable and ornamental crops. The CLIMEX simulation was applied to T. palmi to predict its potential geographic distribution in Korea under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 climate change scenario. In the CLIMEX simulation, the ecoclimatic index was calculated, and compared in each simulated year and each simulated location. The map comparisons show good agreements between simulated and present distributions of T. palmi, indicating that the CLIMEX model has promising potential for prediction of future distributions of this species in Korea. In the near future, until the year 2020, all the western and eastern parts of Korea show favorable to marginal suitability for T. palmi populations in the fields. After the year 2040, potential distributions shift from no persistence to favorable for establishment and persistence from coastal to interior regions of the Korean peninsula, except for a north-eastern interior region which is the northernmost part of a high mountainous (Baekdu-Daegan) area in Korea. Based on the simulation results, the geographical distribution of T. palmi will expand over its current weather restrictions in the near future under a severe climate change scenario. Thus, pest management measures and strategies should be re-evaluated in Korea, and should include further studies on interspecific competition and ecosystem changes due to climate changes.","[Park, Jung-Joon] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Agr & Life Sci, Dept Appl Biol, Jinju, South Korea; [Mo, Hyoung-ho; Cho, Kijong] Korea Univ, Div Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Lee, Gwan-Seok] Natl Inst Agr Sci Technol, Div Plant Protect, RDA, Suwon, South Korea; [Lee, Sung-Eun] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Appl Biosci, Taegu, South Korea; [Lee, Joon-Ho] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Biotechnol, Entomol Program, Seoul, South Korea","Cho, K (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Div Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",kjcho@korea.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Education [NRF-2012R1A1A2007061]; Rural Development AdministrationRural Development Administration (RDA) [PJ009394032013],This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2012R1A1A2007061) and Rural Development Administration (PJ009394032013).

In Australia, human arrival approximately 50 thousand years ago was associated with the continental-scale extinction of numerous marsupial megafauna species and a permanent change in vegetation structure. An alternative stable state persisted until a second regime shift occurred during the late Holocene, when the largest two remaining marsupial carnivores, the thylacine and devil, disappeared from mainland Australia. These extinctions have been widely attributed to the human-assisted invasion of a competing predator, the dingo. In this unusual case, the simultaneous effects of human intensification (population growth and technological advances) and climate change (particularly increased ENSO variability) have been largely overlooked. We developed a dynamic model system capable of simulating the complex interactions between the main predators (humans, thylacines, devils, dingoes) and their marsupial prey (macropods), which we coupled with reconstructions of human population growth and climate change for late-Holocene Australia. Because the strength of important interspecific interactions cannot be estimated directly, we used detailed scenario testing and sensitivity analysis to identify robust model outcomes and investigate competing explanations for the Holocene regime shift. This approach identified human intensification as the most probable cause, while also demonstrating the potential importance of synergies with the effects of climate change. Our models indicate that the prehistoric impact of humans on Australian mammals was not limited to the late Pleistocene (i.e., the megafaunal extinctions) but extended into the late Holocene.","[Prowse, Thomas A.

However, these mechanisms may not be independent as species can exhibit behavioral or physiological changes in response to competition that alters their colonization rates. This study examines the effect of interspecific interactions on the colonization rates of four microscopic species (three ciliates and a rotifer) in aquatic microcosms. Two species showed significant reductions in the time to colonize patches when confronted with a competitor, one was a good disperser (Colpidium striatum) and the other was the slowest disperser (Philodina spp.). These results indicate that species' colonization rates in a metacommunity can vary depending on the presence of competitors. Thus, we suggest that predictions based on heuristic tradeoffs between competition and colonization should consider effects of common biotic interactions such as competition.","[Jeganmohan, Shajini; Tucker, Caroline; Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tucker, Caroline; Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","Cadotte, MW (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",mcadotte@utsc.utoronto.ca,"Cadotte, Marc/AAG-8147-2020","Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693; TUCKER, CAROLINE/0000-0002-4871-2010",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [386151]; Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Research Fund,"The authors wish to thank generous funding from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC #386151 to MWC) and from the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Research Fund.

Both of these impacts increase marine microbial diversity by increasing interspecific competition. By contrast, very little is known about the role of phage predation in terrestrial ecosystems. A recent field study in Barrow, AK found phage predation to be a key factor controlling terrestrial bacterial population dynamics in Arctic soils. When phage abundance was artificially reduced using a tea extract, antiphage treatment, bacterial abundance, and respiration increased accordingly, suggesting top-down control by phages. The goal of this study was to examine the impact of phage predation in temperate soil ecosystems. Laboratory-scale experiments confirmed the potent antiphage properties of tea extracts. However, field experiments conducted at two discrete sites (upland and wetland) yielded little evidence that top-down control by phage predation was significant in temperate soils.","[Helsley, Kaitlin R.; Brown, Theresa M.; Furlong, Kevin; Williamson, Kurt E.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Integrated Sci Ctr 2127, Williamsburg, VA 22185 USA","Williamson, KE (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Integrated Sci Ctr 2127, Williamsburg, VA 22185 USA.",kewilliamson@wm.edu,,,William & Mary Honors Fund; Jeffress Memorial Trust [J-988],"This work was supported by William & Mary Honors Funding to KRH provided by individual donors Dr. John Sherwood, Ms. Margery Daughtry, Mr. Ted Dintersmith, and Ms. Janet Bouland and by a grant to KEW from the Jeffress Memorial Trust ( J-988).

We studied the colonization of Piedmont (NW-Italy) by American grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and its effect on the native red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). Presence/absence data (2 x 2 km(2)), of both species were (re)constructed using questionnaires, literature, existing databases, unpublished information, and direct monitoring with hair-tubes. In 1970 red squirrels were still widespread and greys were restricted to forests near the introduction site. By 1990, grey squirrels had increased their range to 220 km(2), which coincided with the disappearance of native squirrels from 33 squares inside this range. The invasive species continued its spread occupying an area of 2,016 km(2) in 2010; within this area red squirrels went extinct in 88 squares. Overall, from 1970 to 2010 red squirrel went extinct in 62 % of 2 x 2 km(2) (ca. 1,689 km(2)), and were replaced by grey squirrels. The spread of the alien species was slow in the first 20 years, but doubled in the successive two decades. Nevertheless spread was slower than in Ireland and England. Grey squirrel adapt to climate and habitats in both North and South Europe, causing extinction of the native red squirrel. A EU LIFE co-funded project with the aim to control the grey squirrel in North Italy and recent trade-restrictions and trade-ban are a first step in reducing the risk of grey squirrels invading other countries, but their effectiveness will have to be evaluated.","[Bertolino, Sandro; di Montezemolo, Nicola Cordero] Univ Turin, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy; [Preatoni, Damiano G.; Wauters, Lucas A.; Martinoli, Adriano] Univ Insubria, Environm Anal & Management Unit, Guido Tosi Res Grp, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Varese, Italy","Wauters, LA (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Environm Anal & Management Unit, Guido Tosi Res Grp, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Varese, Italy.",l.wauters@uninsubria.it,"Preatoni, Damiano G./A-8621-2010; Bertolino, Sandro/V-5508-2019; Martinoli, Adriano/L-4924-2016","Preatoni, Damiano G./0000-0001-8760-1316; Wauters, Lucas Armand/0000-0002-7012-9200; Martinoli, Adriano/0000-0003-0298-0869; Wauters, Lucas/0000-0002-4871-5035","Provincia di Torino Servizio Tutela della Fauna e della Flora, Regione Piemonte Settore Pianificazione delle Aree Protette, Parco dei Laghi di Avigliana and Direzione Agricoltura Osservatorio faunistico regionale; EC-SQUARE Project [LIFE09 NAT/IT/000095]","This paper is dedicated to Prof. Italo Currado (1936-2005) who first raised the attention on the risks posed by the presence of the grey squirrel in Italy.

Past research into NCEs has tended to focus on pair-wise interactions between predators and prey, while in natural ecosystems, species exist in complex communities with several trophic levels made up of multiple autotrophic and heterotropic species. To address how predator NCEs alter the photosynthetic and heterotrophic components of communities, we exposed microbial microcosms to one of three predator treatments: live predators (full predator effect), freeze-killed predators (NCEs only) or no predators (control), and incubated them under either 12 h:12 h light:dark conditions or continual darkness. Under 12 h:12 h light:dark conditions, NCEs-only communities never differed from predator-free communities, but differed from live predator communities. Under conditions of continual darkness, the structure of NCEs-only communities differed from predator-free controls, but not from live predator communities, suggesting NCEs can be strong enough to structure communities. Predation threat may cause certain prey to induce defences, such as reductions in movement, which make them less competitive in a community setting. This reduction in competitive ability could lead to these species being driven to extinction through interspecific competition, resulting in similar communities to those in which live predators are present. Heterotrophic species whose rates of resource acquisition depend on movement rates may be affected to a greater extent than autotrophs by predator-induced reductions in movement, accounting for our observed differences in predator NCEs in dark' and light' communities. Our results suggest that the community-level consequences of fear are greater in the dark. Synthesis Predators affect prey through consumptive and non-consumptive effects (NCEs) such as alterations to prey behaviour, morphology, and life history. However, predators and prey do not exist in isolated pairs, but in complex communities where they interact with many other species. Using a long term study (>10 predator generations), we show that predator NCEs alone can alter community structure under conditions of darkness, but not in a 12h:12h light:dark cycle. Our results demonstrate for the first time that although the community-level consequences of predator NCEs may be dramatic, they depend upon the abiotic conditions of the ecosystem.","[Forbes, Coreen; Hammill, Edd] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Forbes, Coreen; Hammill, Edd] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Hammill, Edd] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Forbes, C (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",edd_hammill@hotmail.com,,,,,,33,9,9,1,53,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2013,122,12,,,,,1662,1668,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00557.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,254OX,WOS:000327176100002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Mechanistic definitions consider an animal's home range to be the spatial expression of a cognitive map that is kept up-to-date with the status of critical resources that contribute to animal fitness. We assumed there are two major determinants structuring the home range of cats as apex predators in insular ecosystems: the distribution of critical food resources and conspecific distribution. We hypothesized that cats structure their home ranges by optimizing the use of staple critical food resources and that as a consequence of the presence of rich resources cats tend to socialise, aggregate and share space. We carried out spatial analyses using location data for feral cats tracked using lightweight GPS collars in conjunction with the suitability value of rabbit patches and their associated ownership costs for cats within a New Zealand braided-river environment. Cat home ranges and spatial distribution, especially for females, were related to the inclusion of rabbit patches within home ranges with higher mean value than the average of neighbourhood patches in the landscape. Cats showed solitary behaviour but tolerance to conspecific presence by sharing high-use areas and high-value rabbit patches, mostly at different times, resulting in occasional encounters among males and females. Home range size and patterns of spatial overlap were dependant on sex and season. Solitary spacing patterns as consequence of innate preferences together with resource constraints may regulate feral cat population densities.","[Recio, Mariano R.] Univ Otago, Sch Surveying, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Recio, Mariano R.; Seddon, Philip J.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Recio, MR (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",mariano.recio@otago.ac.nz,"Seddon, Philip/G-8659-2011","Seddon, Philip/0000-0001-9076-9566; /0000-0002-9449-2952",Department of Zoology Research Grant; School of Surveying Research Funds (PBRF); University of Otago,We thank Richard Maloney and the Department of Conservation staff in Twizel for the logistic support; Simon Stevenson for the assistance in the field; Godley Peaks and Lylibank Station for access permission to their lands; Emilio Virgos for providing helpful discussions and assistance.

However, these studies have always measured foraging at artificial, static baits that omit traits of living prey items and potential coevolutionary predatorprey relationships. In a series of lab experiments, we compare the ability of ants to harvest live termites (Reticulitermes virginicus) in nests varying in defensive ability. Moreover, we compare foraging performance of 2 co-occurring ant speciesuthe North American native Aphaenogaster rudis and the invasive Pachycondyla chinensisudiffering in their evolutionary experience hunting R. virginicus. Our results show how the invasive P. chinensis may displace the native keystone A. rudis by directly killing A. rudis workers and reducing termite prey available for A. rudis. Specifically, P. chinensis is more sensitive to novel termite prey than the native A. rudis and then destroys termite coloniesueven if they are highly defended by soldiers or nest architecture. Our results further show how whole colony behavioral dominance by P. chinensis is mediated by behavioral interactions among individual workers. More generally, our experimental approach using live prey to study interspecific competition can integrate evolutionary dynamics into studies of proximate behavioral factors governing species coexistence.","[Bednar, David M.; Shik, Jonathan Z.; Silverman, Jules] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Silverman, J (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol, 3314 Gardner Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",jules_silverman@ncsu.edu,,"Shik, Jonathan Zvi/0000-0003-3309-7737",Blanton J.

Simulation results demonstrate how eutrophication invokes more competitions in a competitive ecosystem resulting in the loss of phytoplankton diversity in ecological time. The paradox is enhanced under local interactions, indicating that the limited dispersal of phytoplankton reduces interspecific competition greatly. Thus, the paradox of enrichment appears when eutrophication destroys an ecosystem either by elevated interspecific competition within a trophic level and/or destabilization by trophic interactions. Unless eutrophication due to human activities is ceased, the world's aquatic ecosystems will be at risk.","[Tubay, Jerrold M.; Ito, Hiromu; Uehara, Takashi; Kakishima, Satoshi; Tainaka, Kei-ichi; Yoshimura, Jin] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Naka Ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan; [Tubay, Jerrold M.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Inst Math Sci & Phys, Div Math, Coll 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Morita, Satoru; Tainaka, Kei-ichi; Yoshimura, Jin] Shizuoka Univ, Dept Math & Syst Engn, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan; [Togashi, Tatsuya; Yoshimura, Jin] Chiba Univ, Marine Biosyst Res Ctr, Kamogawa, Chiba 2995502, Japan; [Niraula, Mohan P.; Casareto, Beatriz E.; Suzuki, Yoshimi] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Suruga Ku, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Yoshimura, Jin] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Yoshimura, J (corresponding author), Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Naka Ku, 3-5-1 Johoku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4328561, Japan.",jin@sys.eng.shizuoka.ac.jp,"Morita, Satoru/W-7768-2018; Tubay, Jerrold/G-4039-2017","Morita, Satoru/0000-0001-5219-6218; Tubay, Jerrold/0000-0003-4826-1966; Kakishima, Satoshi/0000-0001-6000-3068","Japan Society for Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24500273, 22255004, 22370010]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20121003]; Global Coral Reef Conservation Project (GCRCP) of Mitsubishi Corporation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25257406, 22370010] Funding Source: KAKEN","We would like to acknowledge Dr. James Grover for his important comments on the manuscript.

We reviewed the diets of two large cats of similar sizes, the endangered snow leopard (Panthera uncia, 16 studies) and the near-threatened common leopard (Panthera pardus, 11 studies), in Asia. These cats share ca 10,000 km(2) of their mountainous range, although snow leopards tend to occur at a significantly higher altitude than common leopards, the former being a cold-adapted species of open habitats, whereas the latter is an ecologically flexible one, with a preference for woodland. The spectrum of prey of common leopards was 2.5 times greater than that of snow leopards, with wild prey being the staple for both species. Livestock rarely contributed much to the diet. When the breadth of trophic niches was compared, overlap ranged from 0.83 (weight categories) to one (main food categories). As these leopard species have approximately the same size and comparable food habits, one can predict that competition will arise when they live in sympatry. On mountains, climate change has been elevating the upper forest limit, where both leopard species occur. This means a habitat increase for common leopards and a substantial habitat reduction for snow leopards, whose range is going to be squeezed between the forest and the barren rocky altitudes, with medium- to long-term undesirable effects on the conservation of this endangered cat.","[Lovari, S.] Univ Siena, Unita Ric Ecol Comportamentale Etol & Gest Fauna, Dipartimento Sci Vita, I-53100 Siena, Italy; Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, BIOCONNET, Biodivers & Conservat Network, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Lovari, S (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Unita Ric Ecol Comportamentale Etol & Gest Fauna, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",lovari@unisi.it,,"LOVARI, Sandro/0000-0002-9945-0268","National Geographic Society (USA)National Geographic Society; Project SHARE, Ev-K2-CNR (Italy)","We are grateful to S.

We monitored cats within natural habitat fragments in the Chicago metropolitan area to characterize population demographics, disease prevalence, movement patterns and habitat selection, in addition to assessing the possible influence of coyotes on cats. The population was dominated by adults of both sexes, and 24% of adults were in reproductive condition. Annual survival rate was relatively high (S=0.70, SE=0.10), with vehicles and predation the primary causes of death. Size of annual home range varied by sex, but not reproductive status or body weight. We observed partitioning of the landscape by cats and coyotes, with little interspecific overlap between core areas of activity. Coyotes selected for natural habitats whereas cats selected for developed areas such as residences. Free-roaming cats were in better condition than we predicted, but their use of natural habitat fragments, and presumably their ecological impact, appeared to be limited by coyotes through intraguild competition.","[Gehrt, Stanley D.; Wilson, Evan C.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gehrt, Stanley D.; Brown, Justin L.] Max McGraw Wildlife Fdn, Dundee, IL USA; [Anchor, Chris] Forest Preserve Dist Cook, Elgin, IL USA","Gehrt, SD (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",gehrt.1@osu.edu,,"Wilson, Evan/0000-0002-7294-6300",Cook County Animal and Rabies Control,"Funding was provided by Cook County Animal and Rabies Control (www.cookcountygov.com).

However, BEMs are widely applied and have proven to be often useful. Here we investigate, under which conditions evolution of dispersal, local adaptation or interspecific competition may be of minor importance for forecasting future range shifts. Therefore we use individual-based simulations of metapopulations under climate change living in spatial temperature gradients. Scenarios incorporate single-species systems or systems with competing species, respectively. Dispersal rate is evolving and adaptation to local conditions may also evolve in some scenarios. Results show that in single-species scenarios excluding evolutionary adaptation, species either follow optimal habitat conditions or go extinct if habitat connectivity is too low. These simulations are in close accordance to predictions from BEMs. Including evolutionary adaptation qualitatively changes these results. In the absence of competing species the species either completely invades the world or goes extinct. With competitors, results strongly depend on habitat fragmentation. For highly connected habitats the range border may shift as predicted by BEMs, for intermediate connectivity it will lag behind, while species will go extinct if fragmentation is too high. Our results indicate that (simple) BEMs may work well if habitats are well connected and species will not encounter many difficulties in dispersing to new sites. Selection in this case may promote evolution of even higher dispersal activities. We thus show that the presence of biotic interactions may be ignored for predictions of range shifts when high dispersal can be expected.","[Kubisch, Alexander; Hovestadt, Thomas; Poethke, Hans Joachim] Univ Wurzburg, Field Stn Fabr Schleichach, DE-96181 Rauhenebrach, Germany; [Degen, Tobias] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, DE-12587 Berlin, Germany","Kubisch, A (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Field Stn Fabr Schleichach, Glashuettenstr 5, DE-96181 Rauhenebrach, Germany.",kubisch@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Kubisch, Alexander/C-2103-2015","Kubisch, Alexander/0000-0003-1303-4245; Hovestadt, Thomas/0000-0001-7368-6013",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG PO 244/4-1]; project CLIMIT; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR),"AK was supported by a grant from the German Science Foundation (DFG PO 244/4-1), TH within project CLIMIT (Settele and Kuhn 2009) funded by ANR through the FP6 BiodivERsA Eranet.",,66,36,36,2,110,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,AUG,2013,36,8,,,,,873,882,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.00062.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,176TO,WOS:000321328100004,,,,,2021-09-21,

Though many interspecific associations have been described for closely related mammals, few studies have examined the associations between mammals in different orders. The yellow mongoose (Cynictus pencillata), a carnivore, and the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a rodent, co-occur in arid and semi-arid South Africa where they share sleeping burrows, predators, a similar body size, and the capability to emit alarm calls in response to predators. To investigate enhanced predator avoidance as a potential benefit explaining the persistence of this association, we assessed individual mongoose vigilance alone and with squirrels or other mongooses, and with varying interspecific group size, using field observations. We also tested for responses to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls in both study species using playback experiments. The proportion of time mongoose individuals spent vigilant decreased in the presence of squirrels or other mongooses and was negatively correlated with interspecific group size; a similar pattern was previously shown for conspecific groups of Cape ground squirrels. These results are predicted by both the dilution and collective detection hypotheses. In addition, hetero- and conspecific alarm calls elicited vigilance responses in both species. These results suggest that both species can benefit from the collective detection and dilution arising from their interspecific association and that this interspecific association could be mutualistic.","[Makenbach, Sarah A.; Waterman, Jane M.; Roth, James D.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Waterman, JM (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, 50 Sifton Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",Jane.Waterman@ad.umanitoba.ca,"Roth, James D/N-4178-2016",,National Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank M.

In this study, we examine the impacts of the trophic ecology of non-native fishes on the three species' in the San Rafael River, Utah, USA. We employ a suite of abundance comparisons, stable isotope techniques and size-at-age back-calculation analyses to compare food web structure and growth rates of the three species' in study areas with and without established populations of non-native species. We found that the three species' are more abundant in areas with few non-native fishes present, regardless of habitat complexity. Stable isotope analyses indicate non-native fishes lengthen the food chain by 0.5 trophic positions. Further, the trophic niche spaces of the native fishes shift and are narrower in the presence of non-native fishes, as several non-native species' trophic niche spaces overlap almost entirely with each of the three species' (bluehead sucker and flannelmouth sucker 100%, roundtail chub 98.5%) indicating strong potential for competition. However, the three species' demonstrated no evidence of reduced growth in the presence of these non-native fishes. Collectively, these results suggest that while non-native fishes alter the food web structure presenting novel sources of predation and competition, mechanisms other than competition are controlling the size-structure of three species' populations in the San Rafael River.","[Walsworth, Timothy E.; Budy, Phaedra; Thiede, Gary P.] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Walsworth, TE (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",tewalsworth@gmail.com,,,United States Bureau of Reclamation Activities to Avoid Jeopardy Program; S.E. and Jessie E.

However, the use of statistical niche models in combination with the analysis of phenotypic variation along environmental gradients can help to reduce such complexity and identify a subset of candidate factors. In the present study, we used such approaches to describe and identify factors responsible for the parapatric distribution of two closely-related livebearer fish species along a salinity gradient in the lowlands of Trinidad, West Indies. The downstream distribution limits of Poecilia reticulata were strongly correlated with the brackishfreshwater interface. We did not observe significant phenotypic variation in life-history traits for this species when comparing marginal with more central populations, suggesting that abrupt changes in conditions at the brackishfreshwater interface limit its distribution. By contrast, Poecilia picta was present across a wide range of salinities, although it gradually disappeared from upstream freshwater localities. In addition, P.picta populations exhibited an increase in offspring size in localities where they coexist with P.reticulata, suggesting a role for interspecific competition. The parapatric distribution of these two species, suggests that P.reticulata distributions are limited by an abiotic factor (salinity), whereas P.picta is limited by a biotic factor (interspecific competition). Similar parapatric patterns have been previously described in other systems, suggesting they might be a common pattern in nature.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London","[Torres-Dowdall, Julian; Handelsman, Corey A.; Ghalambor, Cameron K.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Dargent, Felipe] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Ramnarine, Indar W.] Univ W Indies, Dept Life Sci, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago","Torres-Dowdall, J (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Fak Biol, Lehrstuhl Zool & Evolut Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",julian.torres-dowdall@uni-konstanz.de,"Ghalambor, Cameron/V-4486-2019; Dargent, Felipe/F-8749-2012","Ghalambor, Cameron/0000-0003-2515-4981; Torres-Dowdall, Julian/0000-0003-2729-6246; Dargent, Felipe/0000-0002-4510-0086","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB- 0846175, 1011655]","We thank M.

We examined diets of fish collected at depths of 69128m in Lake Michigan offshore of Frankfort and Muskegon, Michigan, and Two Rivers and Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, during JanuaryMay 2009 and 2010. Important prey (by dry weight proportion and by percent frequency of occurrence) for Slimy Sculpin were Mysis (0.34; 45%), Diporeia (0.16; 34%), and Limnocalanus macrurus (0.22; 68%); important prey for Deepwater Sculpin were Mysis (0.74; 92%) and Diporeia (0.16; 54%). Round Goby consumed mainly bivalves (i.e., dreissenids: 0.68; 95%) and Mysis (0.15; 37%). The two sculpin species consumed the eggs of Bloaters Coregonus hoyi (Slimy Sculpin: 0.04, 11%; Deepwater Sculpin: 0.02, 7%) and the eggs of Deepwater Sculpin (Slimy Sculpin: 0.03, 13%; Deepwater Sculpin: 0.05, 16%) during FebruaryMay at all sites. Round Goby also consumed eggs of these species but at lower levels (0.01; <1%). Diet overlap was identified between sculpin species at Frankfort and Sturgeon Bay, suggesting possible interspecific competition, but their diets did not overlap at Two Rivers; diet overlap was never observed between Round Goby and either sculpin species. Given that (1) diet overlap varied by site and (2) diet proportions varied spatially more than temporally, benthivores appear to be exhibiting localized responses to recent ecological changes. Overall, these results reveal that egg predation and interspecific competition could be important interactions to consider in future examinations of the population dynamics of these species or in ecosystem models that forecast how fisheries will respond to possible perturbations or management scenarios.

Great Tits occupied nest boxes regardless of the number of House Sparrows breeding in the vicinity. During the second part of the breeding season, the percentage of successful Great Tit pairs was negatively correlated with the occupation of nest boxes by the House Sparrows, in both the large- and small-entrance nest boxes. More Great Tit pairs bred and more young were fledged in the small- than large-entrance nest boxes. Great Tits occupied more large-entrance nest boxes during the first than the second part of the breeding season. This difference was probably due to House Sparrows occupying more large-entrance nest boxes during the second than first part of the breeding season. 74 % of the large-entrance nest boxes in which Great Tits built nests in both the first and second parts of the season were later occupied by House Sparrows. Great Tits preferred large-entrance nest boxes in the fall, when House Sparrows use only a few boxes for roosting, but not for breeding. The findings indicate that Great Tits are subject to interspecific competition with House Sparrows for nesting cavities, the intensity of which varies during the breeding season and is higher during the second part when more House Sparrows breed.","[Charter, Motti; Leshem, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Charter, Motti] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Charter, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",charterm@post.tau.ac.il,"Charter, Motti/AAQ-9529-2021; Izhaki, Ido/I-9712-2019","Charter, Motti/0000-0003-3861-6356; Izhaki, Ido/0000-0002-4525-4683",,,,41,9,10,1,44,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Yet, due to methodological and technical challenges very little is known about the mediation of these interactions and their effect on cetaceans' behavior. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are a highly vocal species and can be both food competitors and potential predators of many other cetaceans. Thus, the interception of their vocalizations by unintended cetacean receivers may be particularly important in mediating interspecific interactions. To address this hypothesis, we conducted playbacks of killer whale vocalizations recorded during herring-feeding activity to free-ranging long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas). Using a multi-sensor tag, we were able to track the whales and to monitor changes of their movements and social behavior in response to the playbacks. We demonstrated that the playback of killer whale sounds to pilot whales induced a clear increase in group size and a strong attraction of the animals towards the sound source. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that the interception of heterospecific vocalizations can mediate interactions between different cetacean species in previously unrecognized ways.","[Cure, Charlotte; Antunes, Ricardo; Samarra, Filipa; Alves, Ana Catarina; Miller, Patrick J.

The intensity of selection and the strength of coevolutionary interactions will depend on how stringent predators are in their choice of prey. We estimated susceptibility of different species of birds to predation by two common raptors, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis and the Eurasian sparrowhawk A. nisus, in an agricultural landscape in Denmark and boreal forests in Finland. We estimated susceptibility to predation as the deviation of the log10-transformed observed frequency of prey of different species from the log10-transformed expectation based on population density during the breeding season. We found a high degree of consistency in susceptibility to predation by the goshawk in two areas in Finland. More importantly, there was significant consistency in susceptibility to predation between Denmark and Finland, albeit the degree of consistency in the goshawk was higher than in the sparrowhawk. There was considerable overlap in susceptibility to predation between goshawk and sparrowhawk in Denmark, but not in Finland, implying differences in intensity of interspecific competition as reflected by a much higher extent of goshawk predation on sparrowhawks in Denmark than in Finland. Our findings suggest that hawks impose similar selection pressures on their prey populations, and that the degree of consistency has implications for intensity of interspecific killing.","[Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, FR-91405 Orsay, France; [Solonen, Tapio] Luontotutkimus Solonen Oy, FI-00960 Helsinki, Finland; [Byholm, Patrik] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Huhta, Esa] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Rovaniemi Res Unit, FI-96301 Rovaniemi, Finland; [Tornberg, Risto] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland","Moller, AP (corresponding author), Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Batiment 362, FR-91405 Orsay, France.",anders.moller@u-psud.fr,"Moller, Anders/O-6665-2016","Moller, Anders/0000-0003-3739-4675; Byholm, Patrik/0000-0003-0216-137X",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [208861]; Ella and Georg Ehrenrooth Foundation; Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural Foundation; Kone Foundation; Swedish Cultural foundation in Finland,"V.

Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"Research was funded through the Australian Research Council.

Predator environments (i.e., isolated predators, conspecific pairs, and interspecific pair) were used to identify multiple predator effects on prey by comparing observed predation to that predicted from the multiplicative risk model. Behavioural data and per capita consumption rates provided insight into mechanisms underlying observed multiple predator effects on prey. Experiments were conducted at various spatial scales in the laboratory and field. In all experiments, dogwhelks reduced or ceased feeding when a green crab was present compared to isolated dogwhelks, although overall predation was not influenced. Independent multiple predator effects on prey, where observed and predicted consumption did not differ, were usually maintained because crabs and whelks forage on dissimilar time scales. Contrary to other studies, interference competition through aggressive encounters was not observed for dogwhelk and green crab conspecifics, or the interspecific pair, and non-independent multiple predator effects on prey in the form of risk reduction did not result. Spatial scale appeared to influence some outcomes of predator interactions. In large tanks, green crab conspecifics and the interspecific pair caused risk enhancement for prey. This resulted from increased search time, increased per capita consumption rate, and decreased handling time per prey of crabs, and was likely induced by longer residence time of water in the large tanks compared to smaller tanks. In small tanks, dogwhelks with a conspecific had higher per capita consumption rates than isolated dogwhelks, suggesting risk enhancement for prey. However, dogwhelks were unable to consume enough prey over the experiment to allow detection of a non-independent multiple predator effect on prey by comparing observed to predicted consumption. Predator species that operate on different time scales of predation may have independent multiple predator effects on prey even when changes to individual predator behaviours or per capita consumption rates occur. Examination of predator behaviours and per capita consumption rates, in addition to the full suite of predator environments, is essential to fully understand dynamics among multiple conspecific and interspecific predators, particularly when predator species forage on dissimilar time scales.

The seasonal succession with peaks of Aphanizomenon sp., followed by peaks of N. spumigena, has been explained by the species-specific niches of the two species. In a three-factorial outdoor experiment, we tested if nutrient and radiation conditions may impact physiological and biochemical responses of N. spumigena and Aphanizomenon sp. in the presence or absence of the other species. The two nutrient treatments were f/2 medium without NO (3) (-) (-N) and f/2 medium without PO (4) (3-) (-P), and the two ambient radiation treatments were photosynthetic active radiation > 395 nm (PAR) and PAR + UV-A + UV-B > 295 nm. The study showed that Aphanizomenon sp. was not negatively affected by the presence of N. spumigena and that N. spumigena was better adapted to both N and P limitation in interaction with ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm). In the Baltic Sea, these physical conditions are likely to prevail in the surface water during summer. Interestingly, the specific growth rate of N. spumigena was stimulated by the presence of Aphanizomenon sp. We suggest that the seasonal succession, with peaks of Aphanizomenon sp. followed by peaks of N. spumigena, is a result from species-specific preferences of environmental conditions and/or stimulation by Aphanizomenon sp. rather than an allelopathic effect of N. spumigena. The results from our study, together with a predicted stronger stratification due to effects of climate change in the Baltic Sea with increased temperature and increased precipitation and increased UV-B due to ozone losses, reflect a scenario with a continuing future dominance of the toxic N. spumigena.","[Mohlin, Malin; Roleda, Michael Y.; Pattanaik, Bagmi; Tenne, Stefanie-Joana; Wulff, Angela] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Ecol Marine Bot, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Wulff, A (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Ecol Marine Bot, Box 461, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",angela.wulff@marecol.gu.se,"Roleda, Michael Y./H-9645-2019","Roleda, Michael Y./0000-0003-0568-9081",Swedish Research Council for EnvironmentSwedish Research Council Formas; Oscar and Lilli Lamm Foundation; Carl Trygger Foundation; Swedish Institute; Wilhelm and Martina Lundgren Foundation; Stockholms universitets marina forskningscentrum; Filosofiska fakulteternas gemensamma donationsnamnd,"We thank M.

Nevertheless, the adaptive value of post-anthesis traits is seldom tested. In this study, we estimated the adaptive values of pre- and post-anthesis traits in two stressful environments (water stress and interspecific competition), using the selfing annual species Arabidopsis thaliana. By estimating seed production and by performing laboratory natural selection (LNS), we assessed the strength and nature (directional, disruptive and stabilizing) of selection acting on phenological traits in A. thaliana under the two tested stress conditions, each with four intensities. Both the type of stress and its intensity affected the strength and nature of selection, as did genetic constraints among phenological traits. Under water stress, both experimental approaches demonstrated directional selection for a shorter life cycle, although bolting time imposes a genetic constraint on the length of the interval between bolting and anthesis. Under interspecific competition, results from the two experimental approaches showed discrepancies. Estimation of seed production predicted directional selection toward early pre-anthesis traits and long post-anthesis periods. In contrast, the LNS approach suggested neutrality for all phenological traits. This study opens questions on adaptation in complex natural environment where many selective pressures act simultaneously.","[Brachi, Benjamin; Aime, Carla; Glorieux, Cedric; Cuguen, Joel; Roux, Fabrice] Univ Sci & Technol Lille Lille 1, CNRS, UMR 8198, Lab Genet & Evolut Populat Vegetales, Villeneuve Dascq, France","Roux, F (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Lille Lille 1, CNRS, UMR 8198, Lab Genet & Evolut Populat Vegetales, Villeneuve Dascq, France.",fabrice.roux@univ-lille1.fr,"Cuguen, Joel/A-1708-2009","Cuguen, Joel/0000-0002-6448-920X; Fabrice, Roux/0000-0001-8059-5638; Aime, Carla/0000-0002-9579-3861; Brachi, Benjamin/0000-0001-5988-7150",French Ministry of Higher Education and Research,"This study was supported by a Ph.D. fellowship from the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research to BB.

The goal of our study is to assess the influence of changing macroclimate, competition and habitat connectivity on the migration rates of 14 tree species. We also compare the projections of range shifts from species distribution models (SDMs) that incorporate realistic migration rates with classical models that assume no or unlimited migration. Location Europe. Methods We calibrated SDMs with species abundance data from 5768 forest plots from ICP Forest Level 1 in relation to climate, topography, soil and land-use data to predict current and future tree distributions. To predict future species ranges from these models, we applied three migration scenarios: no migration, unlimited migration and realistic migration. The migration rates for the SDMs incorporating realistic migration were estimated according to macroclimate, interspecific competition and habitat connectivity from simulation experiments with a spatially explicit process model (TreeMig). From these relationships, we then developed a migration cost surface to constrain the predicted distributions of the SDMs. Results The distributions of early-successional species during the 21st century predicted by SDMs that incorporate realistic migration matched quite well with the unlimited migration assumption (mean migration rate over Europe for A1fi/GRAS climate and land-use change scenario 156.7 +/- 79.1 m year(-1) and for B1/SEDG 164.3 +/- 84.2 m year(-1)). The predicted distributions of mid-to late-successional species matched better with the no migration assumption (A1fi/GRAS, 15.2 +/- 24.5 m year(-1) and B1/SEDG, 16.0 +/- 25.6 m year(-1)). Inter-specific competition, which is higher under favourable growing conditions, reduced range shift velocity more than did adverse macroclimatic conditions (i.e. very cold or dry climate). Habitat fragmentation also led to considerable time lags in range shifts. Main conclusions Migration rates depend on species traits, competition, spatial habitat configuration and climatic conditions. As a result, re-adjustments of species ranges to climate and land-use change are complex and very individualistic, yet still quite predictable. Early-successional species track climate change almost instantaneously while mid-to late-successional species were predicted to migrate very slowly.","[Meier, Eliane S.; Lischke, Heike; Schmatz, Dirk R.; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] WSL, Swiss Fed Res Inst, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Meier, ES (corresponding author), WSL, Swiss Fed Res Inst, Zurcherstrasse 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",eliane.meier@wsl.ch,"Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; Meier, Eliane S/D-5214-2012; Lischke, Heike/J-5719-2013; Schmatz, Dirk/L-7281-2013","Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Meier, Eliane S/0000-0002-9545-1167; Lischke, Heike/0000-0003-4284-5194; Schmatz, Dirk/0000-0002-8198-6136",ECOCHANGEEuropean Commission [GOCE-CT-2007-036866]; MOTIVE [ENV-CT-2009-226544],"We thank F.

Generalized additive models (GAMs) of abundance (count) and presence-absence data were applied separately for each species to examine the influence of selected factors (depth, bottom temperature, substrate type and location) on distribution and abundance. The final models indicated strong predictive relationships, suggesting habitat partitioning between species. Ontogenetic distributions were observed as larger individuals of each species tended to be associated with deeper depths and lower latitudes. Analysis of stomach contents indicated that these species consume a wide variety of prey and that the diet composition also shifted ontogenetically. Multivariate analyses of the mean percent weight (%W) of 23 diet categories indicated that the diets differed among and within species. The diet of M. jaok consisted primarily of mysids, shrimps, and flatfish, with larger sculpins feeding on a greater amount of flatfish prey and less benthic infauna. Both M. polyacanthocephalus and M. scorpius fed considerably on commercially important Chionoecetes crabs, particularly C. opilio; however, similar-sized M. polyacanthocephalus consumed larger Chionoecetes prey than M. scorpius. Diets were more variable among smaller sculpins of these 2 species, and piscivory was more common among M. polyacanthocephalus. Habitat and diet partitioning were evident among species within this genus, as each species exhibited distinct spatial boundaries and diets, possibly avoiding inter-and intraspecific competition in this environment.","[TenBrink, Todd T.; Buckley, Troy W.] NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","TenBrink, TT (corresponding author), NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",todd.tenbrink@noaa.gov,,,North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) [628],"We thank all the scientists participating in AFSC surveys responsible for data collection, and A.

We studied the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), an efficient predator, and wolverine (Gulo gulo), an opportunistic predator and scavenger, that coexist in the reindeer husbandry area in northern Sweden. Both species are major predators on semidomestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), but wolverines frequently scavenge ungulate carcasses. We examined the composition and use of food resources by wolverines and in particular the relative importance of lynx-killed reindeer in wolverine diet. We also examined the influence of wolverine scavenging on lynx kill rate. We found that 52% of carcasses visited by wolverines were lynx-killed reindeer, but only 11% were wolverine-killed reindeer. Of all wolverine locations at carcasses, 28% were on lynx-killed and 24% on wolverine-killed reindeer. Remaining locations were mainly on reindeer that died from accidents (23%) or were killed by unknown carnivores (9%). Lynx predation rate on reindeer was nine times higher than that of wolverines. Wolverines scavenged 68% of available lynx-killed reindeer, 29% of which were still being used by lynx at wolverine arrival. Still, wolverine scavenging had a limited influence on lynx kill rate. Time to next kill decreased only when the lynx kill was an adult reindeer in forest; however, most lynx-killed reindeer were found on tundra. Wolverines appear to benefit from coexistence with lynx through increased scavenging opportunities. We suspect that lynx presence reduces wolverine predation on reindeer due to increased scavenging opportunities. These results may have important implications for carnivore management in reindeer husbandry areas.","[Mattisson, Jenny; Andren, Henrik; Persson, Jens; Segerstrom, Peter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Dept Ecol, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden","Mattisson, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",jenny.mattisson@nina.no,"Andren, Henrik/C-8995-2015; Mattisson, Jenny/X-4750-2019","Mattisson, Jenny/0000-0001-6032-5307; Persson, Jens/0000-0003-1405-7561; Andren, Henrik/0000-0002-5616-2426","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management; World Wide Fund for Nature (Sweden); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas; private foundations Olle och Signhild Engkvists Stiftelser and Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse","We thank Geir Rune Rauset, Gustaf Samelius, Einar Segerstrom, and Hakan Falk for their contribution to data collection in the field.

In this paper, with the methods of adaptive dynamics and critical function analysis, we investigate under what conditions such a coexistence is also evolutionarily stable, and whether the two predator species may evolve from a single ancestor via evolutionary branching. We assume that predator strategies differ in capture rates and a predator with a high capture rate for one prey has a low capture rate for the other and vice versa. First, by using the method of critical function analysis, we identify the general properties of trade-off functions that allow for evolutionary branching in the predator strategy. It is found that if the trade-off curve is weakly convex in the vicinity of the singular strategy and the interspecific prey competition is not strong, then this singular strategy is an evolutionary branching point, near which the resident and mutant predator populations can coexist and diverge in their strategies. Second, we find that after branching has occurred in the predator phenotype, if the trade-off curve is globally convex, the predator population will eventually branch into two extreme specialists, each completely specializing on a particular prey species. However, in the case of smoothed step function-like trade-off, an interior dimorphic singular coalition becomes possible, the predator population will eventually evolve into two generalist species, each feeding on both of the two prey species. The algebraical analysis reveals that an evolutionarily stable dimorphism will always be attractive and that no further branching is possible under this model.

As the Earth's climate warms, interactions such as competition, predation, and mutualism are changing due to shifts in per capita interaction strength and the relative abundance of interacting species. Changes in interspecific relationships, in turn, can drive important local-scale changes in community dynamics, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, and can potentially alter large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance. In many cases, the importance of indirect effects of warming, mediated by changing species interactions, will be greater-albeit less well understood-than direct effects in determining the community-and ecosystem-level outcomes of global climate change. Despite considerable community-specific idiosyncrasy, ecological theory and a growing body of data suggest that certain general trends are emerging at local scales: positive interactions tend to become more prevalent with warming, and top trophic levels are disproportionately vulnerable. In addition, important ecological changes result when the geographic overlap between species changes, and when the seasonal timing of life history events of interacting species falls into or out of synchrony. We assess the degree to which such changes are predictable, and urge advancement on several high priority questions surrounding the relationships between temperature and community ecology. An improved understanding of how assemblages of multiple, interacting species will respond to climate change is imperative if we hope to effectively prepare for and adapt to its effects.

Game theory suggests numerous strategies, each with specific decision rules that allow cooperators to control a non-contributing partner. This diversity of hypothetical strategies seems likely to reflect diversity in the types of intraspecific cooperation and interspecific mutualism that exist in nature. It is therefore important to provide a framework that explains similarities and differences between the various hypothetical strategies and that predicts how key parameters that describe the natural history of natural systems favour different control mechanisms. We develop a novel unifying framework for pairwise interactions between unrelated individuals, in which we link specific control mechanisms to specific game structures. The latter are defined by unique combinations of the states of five parameters that describe investment, aspects of the payoff matrix, the number of interactions and partner choice. We find that specific control mechanisms potentially have utility in a limited number of game structures; conversely, each game structure may typically offer a few competing control mechanisms. Our framework offers theoreticians specific problems that await mathematical exploration, while at the same time offering empiricists guidelines for evaluating the game structure and corresponding control mechanisms in their systems.","[Bshary, Redouan] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, CH-2009 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Bronstein, Judith L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA","Bshary, R (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Emile Argand 11,BP 158, CH-2009 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",redouan.bshary@unine.ch,,"Bshary, Redouan/0000-0001-7198-8472",Swiss Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),"RB is funded by the Swiss Science Foundation.

Competition for hosts may occur between adult female parasitoids ('extrinsic' competition) or their progeny ('intrinsic' competition). Here, we examined intrinsic competition between two solitary secondary hyperparasitoids, Lysibia nana and Gelis agilis in cocoons of a primary parasitoid, Cotesia glomerata. Each species was allowed to sting hosts previously parasitized by the other at 24 h time intervals over the course of 144 h (6 days). When hosts were attacked simultaneously, neither species was dominant although the species to attack first won most encounters when it had a 24-48 h head start. However, after this time there was dramatic shift in the outcome with G. agilis dominating in all hosts > 72-h old, regardless of which species had parasitized C. glomerata first. G. agilis larvae, which initially had competed with L. nana for control of C. glomerata resources, began attacking the larvae of L. nana, whereas L. nana rejected hosts with older G. agilis larvae or pupae. Effects of multiparasitism also affected the development time and adult mass of the winning parasitoid. Our results reveal a shift in the trophic status of G. agilis from C. glomerata (in younger hosts) to L. nana (in older hosts), the first time such a phenomenon has been reported in parasitoids.","[Harvey, Jeffrey A.; Pashalidou, Foteini; Soler, Roxina; Bezemer, T.

The inhibiting effect of the NF on the growth of L. monocytogenes was examined by inoculating different levels of NF isolated from the minced tuna. The kinetic data were fitted to the Baranyi model and estimated the growth parameters such as specific growth rate (mu(max)), maximum population density (N-max), and lag time. The temperature and inoculated NF dependency on the mu(max) of L. monocytogenes and NF were described by modified Ratkowsky's square-root model. As the initial NF level increased, the slopes of the square-root models were decreased for both L. monocytogenes and NF. The N-max of L. monocytogenes was described as a function of temperature and inoculated NF level. Simultaneous growth prediction of L. monocytogenes and NF under constant temperature conditions was examined by using the differential equations based on the Baranyi model with the effect of interspecies competition substituted into the developed mu(max) and N-max models. The root mean square errors between the model prediction and the observation for L. monocytogenes and NF were 0.42 and 0.34, respectively. Predictive simulation under fluctuating temperature conditions also demonstrated a high accuracy of simultaneous prediction for both L. monocytogenes and NF, representing the root mean square errors of 0.19 and 0.34, respectively. These results illustrate that the developed model permits accurate estimation of the behavior of L. monocytogenes in minced tuna under real temperature history until consumption.","[Koseki, Shigenobu] Natl Food Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058642, Japan; [Takizawa, Yoshiko; Miya, Satoko; Takahashi, Hajime; Kimura, Bon] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088477, Japan","Koseki, S (corresponding author), Natl Food Res Inst, 2-1-12 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058642, Japan.",koseki@affrc.go.jp,"Kimbo, Bon/O-1879-2014; Koseki, Shige/J-8317-2012","Kimbo, Bon/0000-0002-3071-1343; Koseki, Shige/0000-0001-7046-5354","Food Safety Commission, JapanFood Safety Commission of Japan [0705]","This study was supported by Grants-in-Aid from the Food Safety Commission, Japan (No. 0705).",,41,14,14,0,18,INT ASSOC FOOD PROTECTION,DES MOINES,"6200 AURORA AVE SUITE 200W, DES MOINES, IA 50322-2863 USA",0362-028X,1944-9097,,J FOOD PROTECT,J.

Most of these studies have been conducted on either immobile invasive plants or sessile fauna found at the base of food webs. Fewer studies have examined the impacts of vagile invasive consumers on native competitors. This is an issue of some importance given the controlling influence that consumers have on lower order plants and animals. Here, we present results of laboratory experiments designed to assess the impacts of unintended aquaculture releases of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), in estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico, on the functionally similar redspotted sunfish (Lepomis miniatus). Laboratory choice tests showed that tilapia prefer the same structured habitat that native sunfish prefer. In subsequent interspecific competition experiments, agonistic tilapia displaced sunfish from their preferred structured habitats. When a piscivore (largemouth bass) was present in the tank with both species, the survival of sunfish decreased. Based on these findings, if left unchecked, we predict that the proliferation of tilapia (and perhaps other aggressive aquaculture fishes) will have important detrimental effects on the structure of native food webs in shallow, structured coastal habitats. While it is likely that the impacts of higher trophic level invasive competitors will vary among species, these results show that consequences of unintended releases of invasive higher order consumers can be important.","[Martin, Charles W.; Valentine, Marla M.; Valentine, John F.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL USA; [Martin, Charles W.; Valentine, John F.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA","Martin, CW (corresponding author), Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL USA.",cwm301@jaguar1.usouthal.edu,,"Martin, Charles/0000-0001-9240-3824",Northern Gulf Institute; Dauphin Island Sea Lab; Department of Marine Sciences at the University of South Alabama,"Support for this project was provided through funding from the Northern Gulf Institute, Dauphin Island Sea Lab, and the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of South Alabama.

A geographical survey of four Hetaerina damselfly species in Mexico and Texas showed evidence for character displacement in both species pairs that regularly occurs sympatrically. Hetaerina titia, a species that typically has large black wing spots and small red wing spots, shifted to having even larger black spots and smaller red wing spots at sites where a congener with large red wing spots is numerically dominant (Hetaerina americana or Hetaerina occisa). Hetaerina americana showed the reverse pattern, shifting towards larger red wing spots where H. titia is numerically dominant. This pattern is consistent with the process of agonistic character displacement, but the ontogenetic basis of the shift remains to be demonstrated.","[Anderson, Christopher N.; Grether, Gregory F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Anderson, CN (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolutiva, Circuito Exterior S-N,Apdo Postal 70-275, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",cnanderson1980@gmail.com,"Grether, Gregory F./F-6286-2011",,UCMEXUS; UCLA Council on Research; Edward W.

This trade-off is broadly supported by intraspecific studies but has been difficult to test in an interspecific context, particularly in animals. We tested the fitness consequences of offspring size both intra-and interspecifically for seven species of ascidians (sessile, suspension-feeding, marine invertebrates) whose offspring volumes varied over three orders of magnitude. We measured two major components of fitness, juvenile growth rates and survival, in laboratory and field experiments encompassing several food conditions. Contrary to the predictions of life history theory, larger offspring size did not result in higher rates of growth or survival, and large offspring did not perform better under nutritional stress, either intraspecifically or interspecifically. In fact, two of the four species with small offspring grew rapidly enough to catch up in size to the species with large offspring in as little as eight weeks, under wild-type food conditions. Trade-offs between growth potential and defense may overwhelm and obscure any trade-offs between offspring size and survival or growth rate. While large initial size may still confer a competitive advantage, we failed to detect any consequences of interspecific variation in initial size. This implies that larger offspring in these species, far from being inherently superior in growth or survival, require compensation in other aspects of life history if reproductive effort is to be efficient. Our results suggest that the importance of initial offspring size is context dependent and often overestimated relative to other life history traits.","[Jacobs, Molly W.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Jacobs, Molly W.; Sherrard, Kristin M.] Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA; [Sherrard, Kristin M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Jacobs, MW (corresponding author), McDaniel Coll, Dept Biol, 2 Coll Hill, Westminster, MD 21157 USA.",mjacobs@mcdaniel.edu,,,"NSF GRFNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF); SICB; University of ChicagoUniversity of Chicago; Sigma Xi; Alan J.

Many pathogens initiate interactions with their host on mucosal surfaces and must compete with other members of the microflora for the same niche. Here we explore whether competitive interactions between microbes promote the acquisition of virulence characteristics. During model murine nasal colonization, Haemophilus influenzae outcompetes another member of the local flora, Streptococcus pneumoniae, by recruiting neutrophils and stimulating the killing of complement-opsonized pneumococci [4]. For S. pneumoniae, resistance to opsonophagocytic killing is determined by its polysaccharide capsule [5, 6]. Although there are many capsule types among different S. pneumoniae isolates that allow for efficient colonization, virulent pneumococci express capsules that confer resistance to opsonophagocytic clearance. Modeling of interspecies interaction predicts that these more virulent S. pneumoniae will prevail during competition with H. influenzae, even if production of a capsule is otherwise costly. Experimental colonization studies confirmed the increased survival of the more virulent S. pneumoniae type during competition. Our findings demonstrate that competition between microbes during their commensal state may underlie selection for characteristics that allow invasive disease.","[Brown, Sam P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Lysenko, Elena S.; Lijek, Rebeccah S.; Weiser, Jeffrey N.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Weiser, Jeffrey N.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Brown, SP (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",sam.brown@zoo.ox.ac.uk; weiser@mail.med.upenn.edu,"Brown, Sam/B-5234-2009","Brown, Sam/0000-0003-1892-9275; Weiser, Jeffrey/0000-0001-7168-8090","U.S. Public Health ServiceUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service [AI44231, AI78538, AI38446]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [082273/Z/07/Z]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R21AI044231, R01AI044231, R01AI038446, R01AI078538] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank M.

Species potentially competing for the same resource are considered to be able to co-exist if they occupy different niches. In an apparent example of this, Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins all feed predominantly on krill Euphausea superba at certain sites of sympatry in Antarctica and are proposed to exploit different niche hyper-volumes via differential area and depth utilization. 2. Patterns of foraging for 49 of these penguins breeding in sympatry were assessed using dead-reckoning loggers to examine foraging niche overlap. 3. Area use overlaps were 0 center dot 29 for Adelie boolean AND Chinstrap, 0 center dot 44 for Adelie boolean AND Gentoo, and 0 center dot 40 for Chinstrap boolean AND Adelie and depth use overlaps were 0 center dot 69 for Adelie boolean AND Chinstrap, 0 center dot 48 for Adelie boolean AND Gentoo, and 0 center dot 52 for Chinstrap boolean AND Gentoo Penguins. 4. Foraging efficiency was greatest for Adelie Penguins diving near surface waters (0-15 m) while Chinstraps were most efficient at medium depths (15-60 m) and Gentoo Penguins most efficient at deeper depths (> 60 m). There appear to be physiological reasons for this. Penguins primarily exploited those depths where they were most efficient. 5. The overlap for foraging periods was 0 center dot 47 for Adelie boolean AND Chinstrap, 0 center dot 26 for Adelie boolean AND Gentoo, and 0 center dot 40 for Chinstrap boolean AND Gentoo Penguins. Chinstraps foraged primarily at night, Gentoos during the morning and Adelies in the afternoon. Temporal differences in foraging may result in the three species exploiting krill at those depths where it is best adapted to pursue it, this being mediated by the diel vertical migration of krill. 6. Integration of all measured parameters together gives minimal overlap between species with total overlaps of 0 center dot 09 for Adelie boolean AND Chinstrap, 0 center dot 05 for Adelie boolean AND Gentoo, and 0 center dot 08 for Chinstrap boolean AND Gentoo Penguins so it appears that these penguins conform to conventional theory in avoiding competition in areas of sympatry. However, a model incorporating prey movement between hyper-volumes indicates that penguins may still compete, even in the virtual absence of hyper-volume overlap. 7. This study shows that Pygoscelid penguin do indeed exploit different hypervolumes in areas of sympatry but that such exploitation of different niches by sympatric species feeding on a common resource does not necessarily result in reduced competition if the mobility of prey is high.","Swansea Univ, Inst Environm Sustainabil, Sch Soc & Environm, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales","Wilson, RP (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Inst Environm Sustainabil, Sch Soc & Environm, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",r.p.wilson@swansea.ac.uk,,,Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Japanese Ministry for Education Science and Culture,"This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Japanese Ministry for Education Science and Culture.

Some animals gain information about nearby predators by eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls. Despite having well-developed ears, most lizards do not use vocal information for intraspecific communication, and few studies have shown practical use of the ears in wild lizards. Here, we show that the Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana (Oplurus cuvieri cuvieri) obtains auditory signals for predator detection. The Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana and the Madagascar paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone mutata) are syntopic inhabitants of the Ampijoroa dry deciduous forest of Madagascar. The iguana and the flycatcher have neither a predator-prey relationship nor resource competition, but they have shared predators such as raptors and snakes. Using playback experiments, we demonstrated that the iguana discriminates mobbing alarm calls of the flycatcher from its songs and then enhances its vigilance behaviour. Our results demonstrate the occurrence of an asymmetrical ecological relationship between the Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana and the paradise flycatcher through eavesdropping on information about the presence of predators. This implies that indirect interspecific interactions through information recognition may be more common than generally thought in an animal community.","[Ito, Ryo; Mori, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Ito, R (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",r.ito@ethol.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yang, Ruizhe/G-5801-2011",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Global COE ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A06]","The original idea for this study was inspired during discussions with M.

To examine how non-native brook trout may affect threatened juvenile Chinook salmon, we compared feeding behaviours and aggressive encounters between these sympatric fish in Summit Creek, Idaho. Snorkelers observed 278 focal fish and examined diets from 27 fish in late summer 2003. Differences in feeding behaviours and diets suggest that there was minimal current competition for prey, although individual Chinook feeding activity declined as their encounter rate with other fish increased. While difference in size between fish generally determined the outcome of encounters (larger fish 'winning'), it was surprising that in some interspecific encounters aggressive Chinook displaced slightly larger brook trout (< 20 mm longer). We suggest that in late summer, frequent intraspecific interactions may be more important than interspecific interactions in potentially limiting Chinook growth in Summit Creek and perhaps in other oligotrophic streams where they co-occur.","[Macneale, K.

Although it has received less attention, food availability may also affect competition through nutritional effects on behavior. One hypothesis linking nutrition and competition in ants posits that increased access to carbohydrates flavors greater investment ill worker traits that underlie behavioral dominance. We tested this hypothesis by varying dietary protein : carbohydrate (P:C) ratios and levels of interspecific interference for Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), a widespread invasive species. As predicted, colonies facing interference increased patrolling more when reared on low P:C diets: this result is the first demonstration of an interactive effect Of nutrition and interference on ant colonies. Several results suggest that ;this dietary effect on patrolling was due primarily to changes in colony size rather than worker behavior. Colonies on lower P:C diets had lower worker mortality and larger final colony sizes. Diet had little effect on per capita patrolling and worker behavior in performance assays depended more on previous exposure to interference than on diet. Our findings indicate that dietary P:C ratios can influence Argentine ant performance in a competitive environmental and suggest a mechanism by which monopolization of carbohydrate-rich resources can help invasive ants displace native ant competitors.","[Kay, Adam D.; Zumbusch, Taylor; Heinen, Justa L.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Biol, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Marsh, Tom C.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Chem, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Holway, David A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Kay, AD (corresponding author), Univ St Thomas, Dept Biol, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",adkay@stthomas.edu,,,University of St. Thomas; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI-CGP 2006-35302-17255]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 07-16966],"We thank Sara Seidl and Katie Theisen for help with data collection.

Microbiological studies that only consider pure cultures are not sufficient to adequately describe the natural behaviour of microbes. Several microbial interactions have been recognized to affect the growth or metabolism of others; e.g. syntrophic cometabolism, competition, production of inhibitors or activators, and predation. It is believed that third-party organisms easily affect the two-species relationships and these relationships form the basis of interspecies networks within microbial communities. A microbial network contributes to 'functional redundancy' or 'structural diversity' and the microbial communities effectively act as a multicellular organism. It is necessary to understand not only the physiological activity of members within microbial communities but also their roles to regulate the activity or population of others. To access the microbial network, we require (i) comprehensive determination of all possible interspecies relationships among microbes, (ii) knock-out experiments by which certain members can be removed or suppressed, and (iii) supplemental addition of microbes or activation of certain members. Microbial network studies have started using defined microbial communities, i.e. a mixed culture that is composed of three or four species. In order to expand these studies to microflora in nature, microbial ecology requires the help of mathematical biology.","[Haruta, Shin] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Tokyo 158, Japan; [Haruta, Shin; Kato, Souichiro; Yamamoto, Kyosuke; Igarashi, Yasuo] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan","Haruta, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Tokyo 158, Japan.",sharuta@tmu.ac.jp,"Kato, Souichiro/M-4151-2018; Yamamoto, Kyosuke/M-2924-2018","Kato, Souichiro/0000-0002-2527-7730; Yamamoto, Kyosuke/0000-0003-2450-779X; Haruta, Shin/0000-0002-3705-2459",,,,58,52,54,1,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1462-2912,1462-2920,,ENVIRON MICROBIOL,Environ.

Specialization, in turn, is often thought to be an evolutionary 'dead end,' with specialist lineages unlikely to evolve into generalist lineages. In host-parasite systems, this specialization can take the form of host specificity, with more specialized parasites using fewer hosts. We tested the hypothesis that specialists are evolutionarily more derived, and whether competition favours specialization, using the ectoparasitic feather lice of doves. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that complete host specificity is actually the ancestral condition, with generalists repeatedly evolving from specialist ancestors. These multiple origins of generalists are correlated with the presence of potentially competing species of the same genus. A competition experiment with captive doves and lice confirmed that congeneric species of lice do, in fact, have the potential to compete in ecological time. Taken together, these results suggest that interspecific competition can favour the evolution of host generalists, not specialists, over macroevolutionary time.","[Johnson, Kevin P.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Malenke, Jael R.; Clayton, Dale H.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Johnson, KP (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, 1816 S Oak St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",kjohnson@inhs.uiuc.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0107891, DEB-0612938, DEB-0608329, DEB-0107947, DEB-0614565]","We thank S.

However, empirical evidence from natural metacommunities necessary to evaluate the predictive power of theoretical models of species coexistence remains sparse. We use two African ant species, Cataulacus mckeyi and Petalomyrmex phylax, symbiotically associated with the myrmecophyte Leonardoxa africana africana, to examine spatio-temporal dynamics of species coexistence and to investigate which environmental and life-history parameters may contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in this guild of symbiotic ants. Using environmental niche partitioning as a conceptual framework, we combined data on habitat variation, social structure of colonies, and population genetics with data from a colonisation experiment and from observation of temporal dynamics. We propose that the dynamics of ant species colonisation and replacement at local and regional scales can be explained by a set of life history traits for which the two ants exhibit hierarchies, coupled with strong environmental differences between the different patches in the level of environmental disturbances. The role of the competition-colonisation tradeoff is discussed and we propose that interspecific tradeoffs for traits related to dispersal and to reproduction are also determinant for species coexistence. We therefore suggest that species-sorting mechanisms are predominant in the dynamics of this metacommunity, but we also emphasise that there may be many ways for two symbionts in competition for the same host to coexist. The results speak in favour of a more complete integration of the various metacommunity models in a single theoretical framework.","[Debout, Gabriel D.

Interspecific and intraspecific binary feeding choices were offered to the snail Helix aspersa. The choices were between: (1) plants of the invasive Senecio inaequidens and Senecio pterophorus derived from populations in the introduced range (Europe) and plants of three indigenous species (Senecio jacobea, Senecio vulgaris and Senecio malacitanus) from populations in Europe; (2) plants of the invasive S. inaequidens and S. pterophorus from populations in the introduced range (Europe) and from populations in the native range (South Africa). We did not find a clear pattern of preference for indigenous or alien species of Senecio. However, we found that European invasive populations of S. inaequidens and S. pterophorus were less palatable than South African native populations. Moreover, in contrast to the predictions of the EICA hypothesis, the invasive genotypes of both species also showed a higher total concentration of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and in the case of S. inaequidens we also found higher growth than in native genotypes. Our results are discussed with respect to the refinement of the EICA hypothesis that takes into account the difference between specialist and generalist herbivores and between qualitative and quantitative defences. We conclude that invasive populations of S. inaequidens and S. pterophorus are less palatable than native populations, suggesting that genetic differentiation associated with founding may occur and contribute to the plants' invasion success by selecting the best-defended genotypes in the introduced range.","[Cano, Lidia; Sans, F.

The reintroduction of gray wolves ( Canis lupus L., 1758) to Yellowstone National Park provides a rare opportunity to study interactions with coyotes ( Canis latrans Say, 1823), which had lived in the absence of wolves for >60 years. We evaluated direct interactions between wolves and coyotes to identify factors influencing the outcomes of interspecific interactions and describe the context and degree of competition and coexistence. Using radio-collared wolves, we documented 337 wolf-coyote interactions from 1995 to 2007. The majority (75%) of interactions occurred at ungulate-carcass sites. Wolves initiated the majority of encounters (85%), generally outnumbered coyotes (39%), and dominated (91%) most interactions. Wolves typically (79%) chased coyotes without physical contact; however, 25 interactions (7%) resulted in a coyote death. Interactions decreased over time, suggesting coyote adaptation or a decline in coyote density. In the majority (80%) of fatal interactions, wolves outnumbered coyotes. However, wolves did not outnumber coyotes in interactions (n = 18) where coyotes chased or attacked/harassed wolves. Our results suggest that wolves are the dominant canid, group size may influence the outcome of interactions, and coyotes must benefit from the access to carrion at wolf-killed carcasses.","[Merkle, J.

Variation in jaw shape can be a powerful predictor of feeding performance and habitat preference. Jaw morphology and habitat partitioning were examined among species in the Lake Malawi rock-dwelling species complex, Tropheops. Although Tropheops species varied in a variety of craniofacial characters, lower jaw shape was the focus of this study because of its close association with feeding performance in bony fishes. Significant differences were observed among five microhabitat variables measured in situ for six Tropheops species at two field sites in southern Lake Malawi in July and August, 2001. Depth was identified as a major axis of trophic niche partitioning, and species-specific differences In lower jaw shape and foraging strategy were correlated with depth distributions among species. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that competition for trophic resources (epilithic organisms) has led to habitat partitioning and the establishment and maintenance of distinct trophic morphologies within the Tropheops species complex. Detailed morphological analyses of inter- (and Intra-) specific trophic variation in Lake Malawi cichlids will likely lead to important insights into the proximate mechanisms that underlie cichlid trophic diversity.","Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Albertson, RC (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, 130 Coll Pl, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",rcalbert@syr.edu,,,,,,40,40,41,0,32,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,SEP 10,2008,,3,,,,,689,698,,10.1643/CG-07-217,,,10,Zoology,Zoology,349SF,WOS:000259302900028,,,,,2021-09-21,

Significant responses to both biotic and abiotic factors were found, with interspecific differences in species performance along competition, temperature and precipitation gradients. Q. ilex was the species most tolerant to competition while P. pinaster was the species most sensitive to climatic variation. Species relative positions shifted along gradients of these factors with rank reversals in species performance along size, competition and climatic gradients. The results based on average growth matched previous forestry classifications and experimental studies on relative growth rate (RGR).

If two species are distributed across an environmental gradient, and differ in their ability to cope with environmental conditions, the outcome of competitive interactions may be dependent on prevailing abiotic conditions. Two closely related species of poison frogs in north-central Peru were observed to occupy parapatric distributions across an elevation gradient. Ameerega bassleri is a highland endemic restricted to a small region of Peru, and A. trivittata is distributed throughout lowland Amazonia. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of an abiotic factor (elevation) on two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition), by measuring growth and survival in the larvae of A. trivittata and A. bassleri. Using mesocosm experiments arranged in a fractional factorial design, we found that (1) A. bassleri had a strong negative effect on the growth and survival of A. trivittata regardless of elevation, (2) A. trivittata had no effect on the growth of A. bassleri at either elevation, but did appear to reduce the survival of A. bassleri more strongly in the lowlands than highlands, (3) lowland conditions uniformly reduced survival in all treatments and in both species, and (4) competition was strongly asymmetric between A. bassleri and A. trivittata. We conclude that the perceived low density of A. trivittata in highland sites may be influenced by the presence of A. bassleri, but the lower limit to the distribution of A. bassleri cannot be explained by competition with A. trivittata and may be due to physiological constraints imposed by lowland conditions.","[Twomey, Evan; Summers, Kyle] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Morales, Victor] Univ Ricardo Palma, Fac Ciencias Biol, Lima, Peru","Twomey, E (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",emt0424@mail.ecu.edu,,,,,,66,14,15,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2008,117,8,,,,,1175,1184,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16676.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,335KE,WOS:000258288700006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Both Ca and Mg reduced Ni toxicity, while Na did not. Ni toxicity was not affected in the pH range of 5.7-7.5, but a further increase of pH up to 8.1 resulted in an increase of toxicity of the free Ni2+ ion. Based on the results of these experiments, a biotic ligand model (BLM) was developed in which the effects of Ca and Mg were modeled as single-site competition effects. Stability constants representing the binding strength between Ca2+ and Mg2+ and the biotic ligand (BL) were log K-CaBL = 3.10 and log K-MgBL = 2.47, respectively. The effect of pH could not be appropriately described by single-site competition between Ni2+ and H+. Since the overall variation of toxicity within the tested pH range was relatively small, we decided not to incorporate the effect of pH in the current model. The model was able to predict 48-h EC(50)s in all synthetic test solutions by an error less than factor 2. The model's predictive capacity was also evaluated using results of toxicity tests in Ni-spiked natural surface waters. For 15 out of 16 tested waters, 48-h EC50s were predicted by an error less than factor 2. Additionally, after calibration to account for interclonal or interspecies sensitivity differences, the model was able to accurately predict earlier published 48-h EC50s for another D. magna clone as well as for Ceriodaphnia dubia. Finally, the predictive capacity of the model was demonstrated to be better than that of previously proposed models that include a log K-NaBL, a log K-HBL and a log K-CaBL, but did not incorporate a log K-MgBL. An in-depth comparison of these models learned that (i) there is no need to incorporate a log K-NaBL, (ii) it is important to recognize the protective effect of Mg, and (iii) the incorporation of a log K-HBL does not adequately describe the effect of pH. Although our model seems very promising, further research, especially into the effects of elevated pH and alkalinity levels, is needed to allow further refinement. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Indirect effects, as when antagonistic or mutualistic interactions restrict geographic range and thereby elevate extinction risk, are probably widespread and may flow in both directions, as when species- or organismic-level factors increase extinction risk or speciation probabilities. Apparent contradictions across scales and levels have been neglected, including (1) the individualistic geographic shifts of species on centennial and millennial timescales versus evidence for fine-tuned coevolutionary relationships; (2) the extensive and dynamic networks of interactions faced by most species versus the evolution of costly enemy-specific defenses and finely attuned mutualisms; and (3) the macroevolutionary lags often seen between the origin and the diversification of a clade or an evolutionary novelty versus the rapid microevolution of advantageous phenotypes and the invasibility of most communities. Resolution of these and other cross-level tensions presumably hinges on how organismic interactions impinge on genetic population structures, geographic ranges, and the persistence of incipient species, but generalizations are not yet possible. Paleontological and neontological data are both incomplete and so the most powerful response to these problems will require novel integrative approaches. Promising research areas include more realistic approaches to modeling and empirical analysis of large-scale diversity dynamics of ostensibly competing clades; spatial and phylogenetic dissections of clades involved in escalatory dynamics (where prey respond evolutionarily to a broad and shifting array of enemies); analyses of the short- versus long-term consequences of mutualistic symbioses; and fuller use of abundant natural experiments on the evolutionary impacts of ecosystem engineers.","Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Jablonski, D (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",djablons@uchicago.edu,,,,,,392,169,171,4,117,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,2008,62,4,,,,,715,739,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00317.x,,,25,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,283MS,WOS:000254640900001,18387075,,,,2021-09-21,

Here we report on studies comparing the aphids Aphis nerii and A. asclepiadis that feed sympatrically on the milkweed Asclepias syriaca in northeastern North America. We sought to identify tradeoffs among species' attributes that might promote coexistence, but in most instances A. nerii was superior to A. asclepiadis. Aphis nerii was 84% more fecund, fed upon 880% more phloem sap, and was affected 70% less by intraspecific competition as compared to A. asclepiadis. In interspecific competition, A. nerii reduced A. asclepiadis abundance by 77%, whereas A. asclepiadis did not affect A. nerii. In dispersal trials, 10% of winged A. nerii but only 1% of A. asclepiadis successfully moved from non-host plants to A. syriaca. We also investigated whether there were differences in aphid interactions with milkweed cardenolides. Jasmonic acid increased milkweed cardenolides by 33%, a realistic amount similar to that induced by several leaf-chewing herbivores. Nevertheless, jasmonate-induced cardenolides failed to affect aphid performance and aphid feeding had no effect on milkweed cardenolide concentration. Yet cardenolides were important for aphid resistance to predators; A. nerii sequestered 25% more cardenolides and was preyed upon 50% less than A. asclepiadis. Interactions with cardenolides thus again favored A. nerii over A. asclepiadis. Given that A. nerii and A. asclepiadis are decidedly not equivalent in their demography, competitive ability, defense and dispersal, our results strongly refute the notion that neutral processes can explain coexistence of these aphids. Based on field observations, we propose two tradeoffs - timing of milkweed colonization and relationships with ants - as putative mechanisms for the coexistence of these congeners.","[Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Mooney, Kailen A.; Jones, Patricia; Agrawal, Anurag A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Mooney, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mooneyk@tritrophic.org,"Agrawal, Anurag A/Y-2497-2019","Agrawal, Anurag A/0000-0003-0095-1220",,,,53,53,59,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2008,117,3,,,,,450,458,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16284.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,269FE,WOS:000253634100016,,,,,2021-09-21,

However, detailed ecological information for the majority of species has been collected only at a local scale, and insufficient consideration has been given to geographical variation in intraspecific niche requirements. To evaluate the influence of environmental and biological factors on patterns of species distribution and abundance, we conducted a detailed, broadscale study across the tropical savannas of northern Australia on the ecology of three large, sympatric marsupial herbivores (family Macropodidae): the antilopine wallaroo (Macropus antilopinus), common wallaroo (M. robustus), and eastern grey kangaroo (M. giganteus). Using information on species abundance, climate,. re history, habitat, and resource availability, we constructed species' habitat models varying from the level of the complete distribution to smaller regional areas. Multiple factors affected macropod abundance, and the importance of these factors was dependent on the spatial scale of analyses. Fire regimes, water availability, geology, and soil type and climate were most important at the large scale, whereas aspects of habitat structure and interspecific species abundance were important at smaller scales. The distribution and abundance of eastern grey kangaroos and common wallaroos were strongly influenced by climate. Our results suggest that interspecific competition between antilopine wallaroos and eastern grey kangaroos may occur. The antilopine wallaroo and eastern grey kangaroo (grazers) preferred more nutrient-rich soils than the common wallaroo (grazer/browser), which we relate to differences in feeding modes. The abundance of antilopine wallaroos was higher on sites that were burned, whereas the abundance of common wallaroos was higher on unburned sites. Future climate change predicted for Australia has the capacity to seriously affect the abundance and conservation of macropod species in tropical savannas. The results of our models suggest that, in particular, the effects of changing climatic conditions on. re regimes, habitat structure, and water availability may lead to species declines and marked changes in macropod communities.","[Ritchie, Euan G.; Johnson, Christopher N.] James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Ritchie, Euan G.; Martin, Jennifer K.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Garnett, Stephen] James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Garnett, Stephen] Charles Darwin Univ, Inst Adv Studies, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia","Ritchie, EG (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",euan.ritchie@jcu.edu.au,"Krockenberger, Andrew K/C-1323-2010; Ritchie, Euan/N-1088-2014; Johnson, Chris N/A-7275-2008; Johnson, Christopher N/J-7894-2014; Garnett, Stephen/M-3877-2013","Ritchie, Euan/0000-0003-4410-8868; Johnson, Christopher N/0000-0002-9719-3771; Garnett, Stephen/0000-0002-0724-7060; Krockenberger, Andrew/0000-0003-2872-9939",,,,72,33,34,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

However, many forests have been altered due to century-long land-use practices, which complicates the reconstruction of past and current successional trajectories. For a better understanding of successional processes, we suggest studying the intra- and interspecific competition among single trees across time. We introduce a tree-ring based competition index to reconstruct the competitive dynamics of individual trees over time. This new retrospective dynamic competition index combines a temporal and a spatial component by calculating the yearly ratio between the basal area increments (bai) of the neighbouring trees and the subject tree. The new index is applied to mixed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) stands in the inner-Alpine dry-valley Valais, for which a change in species composition is hypothesised. The aim is to analyse current stand structures in terms of recent changes in the competitive interactions at the single tree level and to relate these competitive dynamics to land-use change and increasing drought due to climate change. On five plots, the positions of 456 trees were recorded and increment cores were taken to derive bai data. The individual dynamic competition index curves were aggregated in clusters, which define typical patterns of competitive dynamics in both tree species. A large percentage of the trees (87% in oak, 70% in pine) were clustered into a group of trees with constant competition at a relatively low level. However, a smaller group of pines (20%) had recently faced increasing competition. In addition, stand structure analyses indicated a change towards a higher proportion of oak. This change in the competitive ability between oak and pine was found to be related to drought, in that oak had a competitive advantage in dry years. Furthermore, the high proportion of dead branches in pines with decreasing competitive abilities indicated increasing competition for light as a consequence of natural development towards a later successional stage that favours the more shade-tolerant oak. The new retrospective dynamic competition index proved to be promising in studying forest succession. The tree-ring based method allows us to identify changes in the competitive ability of single trees with a high temporal resolution and without repeated assessments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The objective is to evaluate hypotheses on interaction webs and population regulation in these ensembles in the context of traditional and recent models of phylogeny and life-history evolution of plethodontids. Two ecological hypotheses evaluated are (1) Hairston's conjecture on differences in the kinds of interactions prevalent among biphasic species with an aquatic larval stage, versus terrestrial species with direct development; and (2) Grover's hypothesis on differences in the factors that limit the distribution of species along the moisture gradient from stream to forest. An evolutionary question concerns the supposition derived from recent phylogenetic reconstructions that the history of one major clade, the supergenus Desmognathus, involved an early transition or reversal from a simple life cycle (direct development) to a biphasic life cycle (larval development, metamorphosis), and that this transition promoted the subsequent adaptive radiation of the taxon. Chippindale et al. proposed that selection for life-history reversal in the genus Desmognathus was promoted by competition between direct-developing ancestral desmognathans and other terrestrial plethodontids. Experimental studies of interaction webs in extant ensembles of plethodontids in the southern Appalachians, in concert with data from descriptive studies of feeding and habitat use, demonstrate variation in the relative importance of competition and predation in population regulation of species in the several codistributed lineages of these salamanders. Whereas the existing ecological data do not refute the Chippindale et al. hypothesis, many unresolved questions require additional investigation.","Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA","Bruce, RC (corresponding author), 200 Breeze Way, Aurora, NC 27806 USA.",ebruce1563@aol.com,,,,,,100,13,13,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Competition indices based on density (number of trees, basal area, and spacing factor), distance-dependent and -independent size ratio (Hegyi's and Lorimer's), and crown characteristics (crown volume, surface area, and cross-sectional area) were tested. Transmittance was effectively predicted by crown competition indices followed closely by aspen basal area and size ratio indices. Models of spruce growth indicated better results for stem volume compared with diameter or height. Competition alone accounted for less than 60% of stem growth variation, with basal area and transmittance providing some of the best models. The predictive ability of spruce growth was increased up to 93% by adding initial size as a second explanatory variable. In this respect, initial diameter was superior to initial height, crown volume, and surface area. Relationships between competition, transmittance, and spruce growth were found to differ significantly between geographical locations. These results suggest the need for local development of models relating tree growth to competition.","Univ Alberta, Ctr Enhanced Forest Management, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Filipescu, CN (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Ctr Enhanced Forest Management, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",phil.comeau@ualberta.ca,"Comeau, Phil/AAB-6481-2020","Comeau, Phil/0000-0003-2578-4289",,,,61,37,39,1,26,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

However, for optimal farm design resulting in superior production and nutrition, an accurate assessment of plant inter- and intra-specific competition is required. In predominant shade tree-cocoa (Theobroma cacao) systems, inconclusive evidence remains on species interactions, limitations to resource availability and subsequent growth and nutritional response, particularly in early growth. We examined cocoa biomass and foliar nutrition as well as nutrient supply through rates of decomposition and N mineralization after 1-year growth. Our approach employed fertilization and mixed planting treatments in an additive design of cocoa in monoculture (control), under artificial shade, and intercropped under two separate shade species (Terminalia superba and Newbouldia laevis). Intercropping had no effect on cocoa biomass production in comparison to monoculture cocoa. However, artificial shading stimulated foliage and root production both with and without fertilization, suggesting strong effects of light regulation on growth in the absence of belowground competition. Nutritionally, intercropping suppressed K uptake in cocoa foliage as K concentration was reduced by 20-25%, signifying dilution of this nutrient, presumably due to interspecific competition for mobile elements. Foliar N content under N. laevis was raised, where N concentration kept up with growth under this intercropped species. Intercropping also delayed decomposition rates, suggesting slower but sustained release of available nutrients into the topsoil. Cocoa under artificial shade, both with and without fertilization, exhibited the greatest nutrient responses as compared to unfertilized monoculture cocoa, where P uptake was stimulated most (175 and 112%), followed by K (69 and 71%), and then N (54 and 42%). Intercropping with shade trees failed to increase cocoa biomass, however, nutrient uptake was sustained for N and P, suggesting low interspecific competition. When fertilizers are undesirable or unavailable, intercropping of appropriately selected shade trees will not competitively suppress early growth of cocoa but will improve light regulation and nutritional status of cocoa saplings.","Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Earth Sci Ctr, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada; Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Renewable Nat Resources, Kumasi, Ghana","Isaac, ME (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Earth Sci Ctr, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada.",marney.isaac@utoronto.ca,,,,,,39,33,34,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2007,298,1-2,,,,,243,254,,10.1007/s11104-007-9362-x,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,210MJ,WOS:000249460000019,,,,,2021-09-21,

However, there is a lack of pragmatic studies linking body size and interspecific competition to patterns in ecological communities. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of body size (mass) on competitive interactions between bird pairs and to investigate the influence of food guilds. Point-counts were carried out in nine sites every month from November 2002 to November 2003 in the Cuetzalan Region, Mexico, and we used presence/absence and abundance data for the analyses. To calculate the strength of competition we used the Angle Frequency Method to extract form factors from 20 pairwise interactions. A prototype competition interaction and random pairs were also constructed. We used clustering techniques (PCA) to calculate the dissimilarity scores (distances, D) of each of the pairwise interactions to the prototype competition and random pairs and one-way ANOVA to test for differences between the means of the random and competitive pairs. The ratio in body mass (lnBM) for each of the interacting pairs was calculated, and the association between the lnBM ratio and the strength of competition (D) was tested using a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. To test for the influence of foraging guilds we used a univariate general linear model. Our results demonstrate a significant negative relationship between bird body mass ratio and competition strength - i.e. competition strength increased when the body masses of the birds became more similar. We did not find a significant influence of foraging guild on the relationship between body mass ratio and competition strength. On the basis of these results, we suggest that high variation in body sizes amongst sympatric species promotes coexistence in communities.","Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Resource Ecol Grp, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands","Leyequien, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Resource Ecol Grp, Bldg 119, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands.",euridice@ecosur-qroo.mx,,,,,,55,35,36,3,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Anuran larvae have therefore been widely studied as a model system for competition. Body size and activity level are considered the most important factors that influence the outcome of competition between tadpoles. As species from temporary ponds normally show higher activity levels in order to achieve rapid growth and thus reduce the risk of desiccation, these species are often considered superior competitors. We designed several laboratory experiments to examine the intra- and interspecific effects on growth rate, mass at metamorphosis and survival to metamorphosis of six species in a Mediterranean area. Body size and activity level were used as explanatory covariables to determine competitive ability among species. An asymmetric and hierarchical relationship was found among the six species. Larger tadpole species were more successful in competitive interactions than smaller ones, but no relationship was found between activity level and competition effects. Species typically found in temporary ponds (Pelodytes punctatus and Bufo calamita) were considered poor competitors in contrast with other communities studied. Species with low competitive ability can persist by using refuges in which competition is reduced (e.g. ephemeral ponds).","Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Richter-Boix, A (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Av Diagonal 645, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",arichterboix@ub.edu,"Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012; Llorente, Gustavo A./I-3097-2015","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Llorente, Gustavo A./0000-0002-0310-8290",,,,75,12,13,1,22,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0173-5373,1568-5381,,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,Amphib.

In the United States and Europe, this pest is implicated in adverse ecological impacts involving changes in invaded communities through interspecific competition and intraguild predation. Additionally, HA can be a household nuisance, and affect human health and agricultural production. The beetle has now reached South Africa. A founder population has become established in the Western Cape province, and the species has also been collected in the Eastern Cape province. We present illustrated diagnoses of HA and selected resident South African Coccinellidae with which it may be confused.

The numbers of turtle specimens observed during our study declined drastically in polluted sites, despite a nearly identical field effort. The number of specimens of all turtle species declined considerably at all habitat types, but complete disappearance in polluted areas was found only with regard to one habitat type for Trionyx triunguis and two habitat types for Pelomedusa subrufa. The mean values of species dominance and diversity indexes were not statistically significant between pristine and altered areas. Based on the interspecific similarity in proportional frequencies of turtle specimens found in each habitat type, a multivariate set of analyses (UPGMA) showed that the turtles were arranged in three 'ecological' clusters: a group formed by Pelomedusa subrufa at both polluted and unpolluted areas and Trionyx triunguis at polluted areas; (ii) a group formed by Pelusios castaneus in polluted areas and Pelusios niger in polluted areas; (iii) a group formed by Pelusios castaneus in unpolluted areas and Pelusios niger in unpolluted areas; however, this latter cluster was not very close, as the linkage distance was close to 80% of Euclidean distance. Habitat use similarity among turtles in both polluted and unpolluted study areas was evaluated by the use of two types of overlap formulas (Pianka and Czechanowski) and the use of Monte Carlo randomisations in order to control for the eventual role of chance in the actual data matrix. These data indicated that, for a pair of species (Pelusios niger vs. Pelusios castaneus), there was a statistically significant increase in the similarity of habitat use in the polluted areas vs. the unpolluted areas, and that this pattern was not dependent on the chance. Considering that these two species are ecologically and morphologically similar, we conclude that the most likely consequence at the community level is an increase in the intensity of interspecific competition for space between Pelusios niger and Pelusios castaneus in the polluted areas. Although the direction of the intensification of this competition process could not be easily predicted, it is likely that the species which is least adapted to life in main rivers and creeks may be disadvantaged over the other competitor. The general implications for habitat preservation are also discussed.","Ctr Environm Studies Demetra & FIZV Ecol, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, Port Harcourt, Nigeria","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Studies Demetra & FIZV Ecol, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,37,20,20,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

We performed a whole-lake experiment by stocking a non-native top predator (pikeperch (Sander lucioperca)) to two residential piscivores (Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) and northern pike (Esox lucius)). By analyzing spatial distribution, diet composition, growth, and consumption rates of the piscivores before and after pikeperch introduction, we tested how both density-dependent and trait-mediated responses affected interactions between the three predators. Total piscivore biomass increased 1.5 times and annual consumption by the piscivores increased 1.7 times after stocking, attributable to the stocked pikeperch and increased northern pike abundances. Abundance, distribution, and consumption data indicated that northern pike was hardly affected by pikeperch stocking and even increased its biomass, whereas piscivorous perch shifted its habitat use towards the littoral lake areas in response to competition with pikeperch. Furthermore, all piscivores increasingly fed on small perch. The forced habitat shift of piscivorous perch in combination with increased predation on small perch led to a decreased abundance of large perch, attributable to the compensatory effects of intraguild predation and cannibalism.","Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12561 Berlin, Germany; Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12561 Berlin, Germany; Univ Constance, Inst Limnol, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Schulze, T (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Hydrobiol & Aquat Ecosyst Management, Dept Water Atmosphere & Environm, Max Emanuel Str 17, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",torsten.schulze@igb-berlin.de,"Holker, Franz/A-5683-2009; Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008","Holker, Franz/0000-0001-5932-266X; Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X",,,,63,28,28,1,33,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Galls were more abundant in shade than sun across sites. This finding is consistent with the Sink Competition Hypothesis, which predicts higher gall loads on plants with longer internodes (as those in shade) and hence less competition among sinks. Galled leaves were smaller and senesced more rapidly, and galled shoots grew less. In the sun, galled branches produced fewer flowers, but there was ultimately no relationship between gall load and seed production in the year sampled. Gall load was not correlated with seed predation in sun or shade, suggesting no indirect interactions between herbivores. This work suggests that gall insects negatively affect plant growth and reproduction, but manipulative experiments must be conducted to confirm this. Additionally, this study suggests that relationships between leaf gall load and plant fitness traits may not be clearly regulated by the availability of sunlight resources to the plant.","Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA","Leege, LM (corresponding author), Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, POB 8042, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",leege@GeorgiaSouthern.edu,,,,,,46,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,2006,184,2,,,,,203,212,,10.1007/s11258-005-9065-4,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,059PY,WOS:000238745900002,,,,,2021-09-21,

We present a simple model of two components of fitness, mortality and flowering rates, for two grassland species with very different patterns of competitive ability and life-stage. Achillea millefolium seedlings are poor competitors while the adults are good competitors. In contrast, Solidago missouriensis seedlings and adults have similar competitive ability. Models of the two species show that the overall effects of competition on growth are more important than interspecific differences in competitive ability in determining mortality and flowering rates, though the higher seedling competitive ability of S. missouriensis relative to A. millefolium seedlings does result in slightly lower mortality and higher flowering rates for the former species. Simulations where both average competitive ability and relative seedling and adult competitive ability are varied predict that dominant species with high overall competitive ability should experience no advantage or disadvantage from varying competitive ability through development. When overall competitive ability is moderate, the relative costs and benefits of differential competitive abilities among adults and seedlings are variable. High seedling competitive ability relative to adult competitive ability should be favored among species with low overall competitive ability. We predict that communities with high intensity of competition should have a high frequency of species with high seedling competitive ability, while communities with lower intensity of competition should have species with a wide range of relative seedling and adult competitive ability.","Univ Alberta, Dept Biol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Lamb, EG (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol, CW405 Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",elamb@ualberta.ca,"Lamb, Eric G/D-9319-2011; Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015","Lamb, Eric G/0000-0001-5201-4541; Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516",,,,41,22,23,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2006,112,3,,,,,502,512,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.14351.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,005CS,WOS:000234800800003,,,,,2021-09-21,

In this work we studied if, how, and why the nocturnal activity patterns of two gerbil species differed with respect to site, habitat, season, and inter-specific competition. The study system included two gerbil species-Gerbillus pyramidum and G. andersoni allenbyi in a sandy landscape composed of three habitats-shifting, semi-stabilized, and stabilized sand habitats. Conforming to previous studies, in the semi-stabilized sand habitat clear temporal partitioning in activity times occurred, with G. pyramidum being active earlier in the night and G. a. allenbyi being active in the later part of the night. As shown in previous studies in a different, more xeric site, removal of G. pyramidum demonstrated that this activity pattern is the result of interference competition by the latter on the former. Nocturnal activity pattern differed between habitats and seasons. Temporal partitioning occurred in the semi-stabilized sand habitat where both gerbil species were common. In the shifting sand habitat, G. pyramidum activity pattern was similar to that in the semi-stabilized sand habitat, but at a lower level. In the stabilized sand habitat where G. a. allenbyi occurred alone, its activity was the highest among the three habitats and was fairly constant throughout the night. Temporal partitioning occurred in the fall and early summer, but not in the early spring. The roles of predation risk, competition and resource dynamics in determining the gerbils' temporal activity together with their implications for community structure, are discussed.","Univ Wisconsin, USGS Wisconsin Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Russell Lab 218, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Wasserberg, G (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, USGS Wisconsin Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Russell Lab 218, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",wasserberg@wisc.edu,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; ",,,,35,24,24,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2006,112,3,,,,,573,579,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.14302.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,005CS,WOS:000234800800010,,,,,2021-09-21,

However, studies of such competition across large-scale space are conversely mere 'snapshots' in time. The current study aimed at measuring interference-competition at multiple scales in space and time. Different aspects of interference-competition were measured in a model community (encrusters of boulder communities, e.g. ascidians, bryozoans, polychaetes and sponges) at 3 tropical, 3 temperate and 2 polar sites at intervals of days, weeks, months and years. The 3 aspects of competition measured-transitivity (hierarchicalness), number of clades involved, prevalence of interspecific encounters-varied non-significantly with time (from days to years) but significantly in space (from the tropics to the poles). Thus the strong differences observed in space are robust along ecological time-scales; boulder communities may be highly dynamic at local scales, but overall measures of interference-competition amongst their encrusters seem to vary little within a region. Why low- and high-latitude encrusting communities should differ may be linked to past selection pressures-to survive spatial competition in the more stable warm seas and to be able to recolonise from local ice-scour and regional ice sheets in the high temperate and polar realms. The results of the current study suggest that, despite being 'snapshots', the many point-in-time studies of competition in the literature are likely to be valid on ecological time-scales and thus useful for meta-analyses.","British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",dkab@bas.ac.uk,,,"Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [dml011000, bas010008] Funding Source: researchfish",,,52,7,7,0,8,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The impact of the different predator communities (protists and metazoans) of prokaryotes was estimated by water fractionation (< 5 mu m: treatment filtered on 5 mu m, without ciliates and metazoans; UNF: unfiltered treatment with all planktonic communities). Enrichments of natural viruses (< 1.2 mu m: with a natural virus concentration; < 1.2 mu m V and VV: with enrichment leading to a double or triple concentration of viruses, respectively) were used to indirectly assess the control of virioplankton. Viral activity was estimated from the frequency of visibly infected cells (FVIC). PCC was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). In this study, PCC was affected by the eukaryote communities (especially flagellates), and viruses to a lesser extent. Cyanobacteria declined significantly during the experiment and were highly correlated with the FVIC. In addition, the 503-bp terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) disappeared in treatments with virus enrichments, suggesting possible viral-associated mortality processes, whereas the 506-bp T-RF was not affected in these treatments. On one hand, these results suggest a control of the PCC: first, by viral lysis of some dominant phylotypes and second, by interspecific competition between resistant strains for the uptake of substrates released by this lysis. The increase of Archaea may suggest that these cells benefit such resources. On the other hand, the disappearance and the stable proportion of some dominant phylotypes suggested a selection pressure due to the predatory activity on prokaryotes. In conclusion, prokaryotic abundance appears to be mainly controlled by flagellate protists, which also affected PCC, whereas viruses seemed to be essentially responsible for profound changes in PCC via direct and indirect actions.","Univ Clermont Ferrand, Lab Biol Protistes, CNRS, UMR 6023, F-63177 Aubiere, France","Bettarel, Y (corresponding author), Univ Clermont Ferrand, Lab Biol Protistes, CNRS, UMR 6023, F-63177 Aubiere, France.",didier.debroas@free.fr,"Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/M-4134-2019; Jardillier, Ludwig E/H-8486-2015","Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Jardillier, Ludwig E/0000-0003-4982-5807",,,,61,25,26,3,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Different availabilities of decorating materials had a positive correlation on decorating amount by juveniles, while the correlation was not so clear in subadults. The amount of decorating decreased with increasing density of conspecific crabs in the presence of a predator, but there was so clear relationship in the absence of a predator. The decrease in decorating under high density could be due to intra-specific aggression, because the superior crab, in fighting, was found to be decorated with more algae. Tiarinia cornigera was found to be superior to the co-occurring different majid species Micippa platipes in fighting. When T. cornigera and M. platipes were housed together, the former was decorated with more algae than the latter in the presence of a predator, but in the absence of a predator, the amount of algae was not different. Thus, presence of a predator may motivate intraspecific competition in T. cornigera as well as interspecific competition between T. cornigera and M. platipes for decorating materials.","Nara Womens Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Nara 6308506, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Seto Marine Biol Lab, Wakayama 6492211, Japan","Wada, K (corresponding author), Nara Womens Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Nara 6308506, Japan.",mbanzai@cc.nara-wu.ac.jp,,,,,,18,6,6,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Our model describes the effect of changing disturbance regime, age structure, density and interspecific competition as the habitat matures, enabling us to seek the evolutionarily stable reaction norm for seed dispersal rate as a function of time elapsed since population foundation. 2 Our model predicts that, in the context of ecological succession, selection should generally favour plastic strategies allowing plants to increase their dispersal rate with population age, contrary to previous predictions of models that have assumed genetically fixed dispersal strategies. 3 More complex patterns can evolve showing periods with high production of dispersing seeds separated by periods of intense local recruitment. These patterns are due to the interaction of individual senescence with change in ecological conditions within sites. 4 Evolution of plastic dispersal strategies affects the patterns of density variation with time since foundation and accelerates successional replacement. An interesting parallel can be drawn between the evolution of age-specific dispersal rates in successional systems and the evolution of senescence in age-structured populations. 5 Seed dispersal plasticity could be a potential mechanism for habitat selection in plants and have implications for range expansion in invasive species because recently founded populations at the advancing front may show different patterns to those in the established range.","Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier, France; Univ Paris 11, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France; ENGREF Arboretum Natl Barres, F-45290 Nogent Sur Vernisson, France; Univ Paris 06, Ecol Lab, F-75252 Paris, France","Ronce, O (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier, France.",ronce@isem.University-montp2.fr,"Gouyon, Pierre-Henri/A-9603-2013; Olivieri, Isabelle/E-5872-2016",,,,,48,39,39,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Theory predicts that abundant generalist species should be less affected by fragmentation than specialist species. In ant communities, the most abundant species is often behaviourally dominant. Thus, habitat fragmentation could alter competitive interactions between the dominant ant species and the other species. We tested this hypothesis in a long-term grassland fragmentation experiment. Fragments of different size (20.25 and 2.25 m(-2)) were isolated by a 5-m wide strip of frequently mown vegetation. Control plots were situated in adjacent undisturbed grassland. Ant density and species composition were assessed 3 and 6 years after initiation of the experimental fragmentation. The effect of the dominant ant species on the resource use of the other species was examined at natural sugar resources (aphids and extrafloral nectaries) and at artificial sugar baits. Lasius paralienus was the most abundant ant species (72% of nests) in the grasslands examined. Species richness and forager density in the other species decreased with increasing density of L. paralienus in fragments but not in control plots. The overall forager density of the other species was positively related to their habitat niche overlap with L. paralienus. The density of foragers of the other species at sugar resources was not affected by L. paralienus forager density. The experimental fragmentation resulted in an increase in natural sugar resources in fragments. This may have reduced the intensity of interspecific competition for sugar resources. Our study shows that the grassland fragmentation altered interactions between the dominant L. paralienus and the other ant species.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; Univ Basel, Dept Integrat Biol, Sect Conservat Biol NLU, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Braschler, B (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",bb11@york.ac.uk,"Braschler, Brigitte/N-6953-2017","Braschler, Brigitte/0000-0003-0088-3651",,,,44,10,11,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2005,143,2,,,,,291,300,,10.1007/s00442-004-1778-x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907SN,WOS:000227738400013,15619095,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

The theory of the evolution of secondary sexual traits through male-male competition is based on the assumption that these traits are reliable cues for an animal's fighting capacity. In this paper, we test whether a secondary sexual trait, dewlap size, is an honest predictor of bite strength in Anolis lizards. Since male anoles will bite one another during territorial fights, bite performance may play an important role in determining the outcome of male-male fights. 2. We measured dewlap size and bite force in a size series of adult males of three Jamaican anoles, i.e. Anolis grahami Gray 1845, A. lineatopus Gray 1840 and A. valencienni Dumeril 2 Bibron 1837. 3. In both A. grahami and A. lineatopus, males with relatively large dewlaps tend to bite relatively harder, while the relationship between relative dewlap size and bite force was clearly non-significant within the twig anole A. valencienni. 4. Our results thus suggest that dewlap size is an indicator of relative bite force in the former two species, but not in the latter. We argue that interspecific variation in territorial behaviour might explain this difference.","Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Vanhooydonck, B (corresponding author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",bieke.vanhooydonck@ua.ac.be,"Herrel, Anthony/C-3712-2013","Herrel, Anthony/0000-0003-0991-4434; Van Damme, Raoul/0000-0002-4585-6940",,,,35,95,96,0,28,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

When two or more species live in the same patch network, interspecific interactions may affect their dispersal, colonization and extinction rates, and it may be possible to incorporate competition affecting these parameters in metapopulation models. Here, we extend the territorial occupancy model proposed by Lande to competing species. Our model estimates an equilibrium proportion of habitat occupancy as a function of life-history parameters, dispersal behavior, habitat suitability and interspecific interactions. Moreover, it could prove to be useful as a tool in the assessment of potential management decisions. We apply the model to the golden Aquila chrysaetos and the Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus, two territorial raptors that coexist in the Mediterranean region, sharing food and nesting habitats. Over the last twenty years, while the golden eagle has maintained and, in some cases, increased its breeding numbers, Bonelli's eagle has suffered a marked decline, with many territories abandoned by the latter now occupied by the former. This suggests that the dynamics of these species could be influenced by interspecific competition. The model identified the relative importance of competition (stable equilibrium that allows long-term coexistence) and predicted that, when habitat overlap is slight as in the study area, intraspecific dynamics are much more important for the persistence of each species than interspecific ones. Our results suggest that the improvement of territorial bird survival and productivity are the most urgently needed actions to be undertaken in the case of the golden eagle, while for Bonelli's eagle efforts should be focused on improving territorial and non-territorial bird survival. As habitat conservation measures, the proportion of suitable exclusive habitat should be increased for both species.","Estac Biol Donana, Dept Appl Biol, E-41013 Seville, Spain; Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante 33012, Spain; Univ Murcia, Dept Ecol & Hidrol, Murcia 30100, Spain; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Carrete, M (corresponding author), Estac Biol Donana, Dept Appl Biol, E-41013 Seville, Spain.",martina@ebd.csic.es,"Carrete, Martina/A-6376-2009; Carrete, Martina/D-2618-2017; Sanchez-Zapata, Jose Antonio/H-1413-2015; Calvo, Jose Francisco/C-7076-2009","Carrete, Martina/0000-0002-0491-2950; Sanchez-Zapata, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-8230-4953; Calvo, Jose Francisco/0000-0002-3813-4333",,,,59,56,56,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2005,108,1,,,,,125,136,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.12942.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,877OA,WOS:000225578700012,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

S.F. Gray were examined both in the laboratory and on a shore of the Isle of Man, Irish Sea. The growth of germlings of both species declined with increasing density, irrespective of whether they were with cohorts or rival species, indicating that intra- and interspecific competition occurred between germlings. H. elongata suppressed the performance of F. serratus at the germling stage by virtue of its larger initial size, and at the 'mushroom' stage by forming a miniature canopy with the 'caps' of the adjacent plants. In a field experiment, the mortality of H. elongata juveniles generally increased in mixtures with F. serratus and was highest when F. serratus were 50% of the plants. At the juvenile stage, the negative effect of F. serratus on H. elongata was more severe than the other way round. This was because F. serratus grows predominantly upwards, whereas H. elongata had already begun to expand laterally at the distal end. If F. serratus survives in sparse mixed stands with H. elongata juveniles, it can overgrow them and inhibit their subsequent survivorship and growth, probably by both shading and physical sweeping. H. elongata and F. serratus maintain their discrete monospecific stands because of the varying outcomes of mutual competitive exclusion resulting from their differing growth patterns. Thus it is possible for them to co-occur at a similar shore height.","Wonkwang Univ, Fac Biol Sci, Iksan 570749, Chonbuk, South Korea; Univ Liverpool, Port Erin Marine Lab, Sch Biol Sci, Port Erin IM9 6JA, Man, England","Choi, HG (corresponding author), Wonkwang Univ, Fac Biol Sci, Iksan 570749, Chonbuk, South Korea.",hgchoi@wonkwang.ac.kr,,,,,,42,10,12,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Four studies were found with time series of at least five consecutive years; they all reported data on Collembola from temperate forests (as do the original data included). We applied the time tag analysis (regressions of Euclidian distance between communities on time tag) for detecting directional change of community composition, the partial rate autocorrelation function for detecting density dependence, and we regressed standard deviations of the logarithms of abundance on observation period for detecting the colour of the time series. Collembolan communities did not show directional change over time, and the composition of the community appeared to be predictable at a gross qualitative level.: dominant species tend to stay dominant over time. A high degree of density dependence could be detected, which might be responsible for the observed temporal stability of community composition. Intra- and interspecific competition and/or predation may cause deterministic community structure and the results of this study support the increasing body of evidence that Collembola communities are structured by intensive biotic interactions. Collembolan populations did not show any fluctuations characterised by scaling Laws. Either there actually exist point attractors and stable equilibria in Collembola (brought about by non-overcompensating density-dependent interactions), or Collembolan community trajectories are restarted every year by external forces. Due to the large time-scale of environmental. variation in forests, low-frequency noise in Collembola may be recognisable only in time series spanning at least some decades. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

This is because conspecifics share ecological needs and thus indicate habitat suitability. Here, we propose the heterospecific habitat copying hypothesis, which states that animals should use public information (i.e., information derived from the performance of others) from con- and heterospecifics sharing ecological needs. In a correlational approach we test some assumptions and predictions of this hypothesis with a data set from two sympatric bird populations, rollers (Coracias garrulus) and kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), using the same nest-boxes and exploiting similar food resources. Since kestrels are residents and breed earlier, we assumed that they are dominant over rollers for nest-box acquisition. The environment appears to be patchy for both species and temporally predictable for kestrels only. Two results suggest that the use of heterospecific public information in breeding habitat selection may be at work: (1) an increase in the reoccupancy probability by kestrels of previous roller nests with increasing nest success, and (2) an increase in roller breeding population with increasing local kestrel success. Most of the other observed patterns could be explained by alternative mechanisms such as natal philopatry, breeding fidelity, conspecific attraction, intraspecific habitat copying, and the effect of interspecific competition.","Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7625, Lab Environm & Evolut Syst Ecol, Paris, France; Univ Extremadura, Fac Vet, Catedra Biol & Etol, Caceres 10071, Spain; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7103, Lab Ecol Evolut Parasitaire, Paris, France; CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria 04001, Spain","Parejo, D (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7625, Lab Environm & Evolut Syst Ecol, Paris, France.",dparejo@unex.es,"Danchin, Etienne/AAB-2091-2021; Parejo, Deseada/L-3953-2014; Danchin, Etienne/A-2299-2009; Aviles, Jesus/K-3332-2014","Danchin, Etienne/0000-0002-5013-9612; Parejo, Deseada/0000-0002-7368-2378; Aviles, Jesus/0000-0002-1463-8393",,,,47,98,98,2,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

We examined interactions between larvae of two predatory ladybird species recently introduced to North America, Coccinella septempunctata (CS) and Harmonia axyridis (HA), and two indigenous ladybirds, Coccinella transversoguttata (CT) and Hippodamia convergens (HC). By pairing young and old larvae in the laboratory at low and high levels of aphid availability, we assessed the degree of asymmetry in intraguild predation (IGP), the strength of competitive effects on growth and development of larvae escaping predation, and the nature of attack and escape behavior among the species. Interactions were generally asymmetric, with larvae of introduced species acting most frequently as intraguild predators and larvae of indigenous species serving most frequently as intraguild prey ( the two Coccinella spp., however, preyed on each other at similar rates). Because they were especially aggressive and because other larvae were least successful in escaping their attacks, larvae of HA had stronger negative effects on larvae of the two indigenous species than did larvae of CS. Such negative effects, expressed most strongly when aphid availability was low, were especially adverse for the smaller of the two indigenous species, HC. In general, older larvae interacted with each other more strongly than young larvae did, and older larvae had especially strong negative effects on young larvae when interactions occurred between age classes. Our results suggest that HA more than CS may represent a threat to indigenous ladybirds as an intraguild predator, and that IGP in turn may play a stronger role for HA than for C. septempunctata in promoting the successful invasion of North America.","Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan; Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Yasuda, H (corresponding author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.",hyasuda@tds1.tr.yamagata-u.ac.jp,,,,,,63,121,125,0,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2004,141,4,,,,,722,731,,10.1007/s00442-004-1680-6,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,869QT,WOS:000224999800017,15338413,,,,2021-09-21,

When the tall plant species is little grazed by the herbivores, it can easily invade and dominate short vegetation. The tall-growing grass Elymus athericus dominates the highly productive stages of a salt-marsh succession in Schiermonnikoog and is not preferred by the herbivores which occur there, hares and geese. We studied how interspecific competition and herbivory affected performance during early establishment of this species with increasing productivity. Seedlings were planted in the field in a full factorial design, manipulating both interspecific competition and herbivory. The experiment was replicated along a natural productivity gradient. Competition reduced aboveground biomass production and decreased the number of ramets that were produced but did not affect survival of seedlings. The negative effects of competition on seedling performance increased with increasing productivity. In contrast to our expectations, herbivory strongly reduced seedling survival, especially at the unproductive sites and had only small effects on seedling growth. The present study shows that unpreferred tall-growing species cannot easily invade vegetation composed of short preferred species. Grazing by (intermediate-sized) herbivores can prevent establishment at unproductive sites, and increased competition can prevent a rapid invasion of highly productive sites. Herbivores can have a long-lasting impact on vegetation succession by preventing the establishment of tall-growing species, such as E. athericus, in a window of opportunity at young unproductive successional stages.","Univ Groningen, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, NL-9750 Haren, Netherlands","Kuijper, DPJ (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, POB 14, NL-9750 Haren, Netherlands.",d.p.j.kuijper@biol.rug.nl,,"Kuijper, Dries/0000-0002-0324-5893",,,,45,33,33,3,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2004,141,3,,,,,452,459,,10.1007/s00442-004-1664-6,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,863JJ,WOS:000224557300010,15309612,,,,2021-09-21,

While benthic communities in tropical and also Antarctic regions are thought to be mainly structured by intra- and interspecific interactions, these factors are proposed to be less important in northern high latitudes. Consequently, selective pressure for chemical defence should be low in these regions. To investigate the incidence of chemical defence against predation in northern high latitudes, crude extracts of 18 abundant sessile or slow-moving invertebrate species (4 sponges, 3 actinians, 1 soft coral, 4 bryozoans, 3 ascidians and the egg mass of a gastropod) from Kongsfjord (Spitsbergen) were tested for feeding deterrent activity. Laboratory assays were performed by offering artificial food with extracts to two different predators, the amphipod Anonyx nugax which is a common species in Kongsfjord, and the starfish Asterias rubens from the North Sea. Of the 18 extracts tested, 2 (Haliclona viscosa, Hormathia nodosa) exhibited significant feeding deterrent effects in the amphipod assay. Furthermore, 6 extracts had a significantly stimulating effect on the amphipod feeding, and 10 extracts did not affect consumption. In the starfish assay, only the crude extract of H. viscosa was significantly rejected. For H. viscosa, feeding deterrence could be established for two pure compounds, and for H. nodosa for one fraction. The present data show that feeding deterrent compounds are present in sub-Arctic marine invertebrates from Kongsfjord but are less abundant than in temperate, tropical and Antarctic species.

Moreover, by constructing a Liapunov function it is shown that the system has a globally stable positive equilibrium. Second, we consider a model with an arbitrary number of consumers and one single limiting resource.

When an interspecific competitor is introduced, an individual is often forced to shift its diet according to the intensity of the competitive pressure. In this paper, we explore whether the introduced American mink (Mustela vison Schreber) shifts its diet when the density of its potential competitor, the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra L.), is increased. We compared the diets of otter and mink at the same location but at two moments in time when the relative densities of these two species were different while controlling for the abundance of aquatic prey. Mink and otters are semi-aquatic mammals belonging to the same guild of mustelids and otters are expected to be the dominant competitor because they are larger and better at hunting underwater. The diets of otters and mink overlap to a great extent but while otters specialise mainly on aquatic prey, mink are able to exploit both aquatic and terrestrial prey. These observations prompted the hypothesis investigated in this work that at higher otter densities the diet of mink should change to include a higher proportion of terrestrial items. This hypothesis was supported by the data and at higher otter densities mink diet was observed to consist of a higher proportion of mammals and birds while fewer fish were present, although this pattern was present only in winter while no changes were observed in spring. Meanwhile the diet of otters remained basically unchanged. In the second part of the study, we investigated whether niche breadth and niche overlap between otter and mink changed at different otter densities. We found that niche overlap declined as the density of otters increased, in agreement with the prediction of habitat selection theory.","Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Bonesi, L (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",laura.bonesi@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,"Bonesi, Laura/0000-0003-3351-3892",,,,35,95,101,0,78,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2004,106,1,,,,,19,26,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12763.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,821CV,WOS:000221438300003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Results Significant predictors of variation in reproduction between territories (78% variance explained) were variables describing intra- and interspecific competition, plumage morph, laying date, precipitation levels and anthropogenic disturbances in the breeding territory. Competition and plumage morph seem to be particularly important, as these variables explained a high level of variation (81%) in the 1996 reproduction of this population.

We used multiple logistic regression to study habitat selection of this species at landscape, territory, and nest site scales in order to make recommendations about effective management. Habitat selection by the sympatric stripe-headed brush-finch (Buarremon torquatus) was examined with the same methods in order to analyse interspecific resource partitioning and potential competition. The pale-headed brush-finch selected semi-open habitat types with intermediate scrub heights, and avoided forests. Nest sites depended on the presence of vines or bamboo. By contrast, the stripe-headed brush-finch chose dense habitat with low ground cover under tall vegetation and avoided semi-open habitat. The two species had overlapping territories but differed significantly in microhabitat use and the use of vegetation strata. We found no convincing evidence that the stripe-headed brush-finch displaces the pale-headed brush-finch from optimal habitat. The preservation of semi-open scrubland maintained by low-intensity grazing is suggested for future conservation of the pale-headed brush-finch. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We performed a laboratory experiment to investigate the outcome of potential competitive interactions between tadpoles of the green frog (Rana clamitans) and the gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), and to examine the factors that may explain the outcome of the interaction. We found that competition between these two species was asymmetric. Hylaversicolor tadpoles were more affected by intraspecific competition than interspecific competition (i.e. grew faster when grown with heterospecifics than conspecifics); whereas, R. clamitans tadpoles were more affected by interspecific competition than intraspecific competition (i.e. grew faster when grown with conspecifics than heterospecifics). Based on behavioral observations, this result could not be explained on the basis of activity levels, a trait previously linked to competitive ability in tadpoles.

We analysed data collected during a 3-year predator reduction experiment to find out the effects of predators on population structure, reproductive parameters, and individual quality of Microtus voles (the field vole M. agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis) in western Finland. Voles were collected by snap trapping in April, June, August, and October during 1997-1999. The yearly reduction of predators from April to October had a clear positive effect on the abundance of sibling voles but did not significantly affect the densities of field voles. Predator reduction apparently also affected the age ratio and mean body size in late summer, as well as pancreatic weights of voles. However, all observed differences between predator reduction and control areas, except those in abundance, were small and may mainly reflect a generally higher survival leading to higher densities of voles in predator reduction areas. Our results also indicated a relative lack of high quality food at population peaks but not because of reduced foraging activity in the presence of predators. We conclude that the indirect effects of vole-eating predators on the population growth of main prey are small compared to the detrimental direct effects on prey survival. In the case of less preferred prey, indirect effects of predation through reduced interspecific competition may play a role at high densities.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Norrdahl, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",kainor@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X",,,,63,20,20,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2004,105,2,,,,,312,324,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12684.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,805RJ,WOS:000220383100011,,,,,2021-09-21,

For this reason it has been difficult to discover the degree to which these communities are structured, and by what processes. Interspecific competition for resources does occur, but its contemporary importance is limited because most pairs of potentially competing insects feed on different host plants(2). An alternative way in which species can interact is through shared natural enemies, a process called apparent competition(3). Despite extensive theoretical discussion there are few field demonstrations of apparent competition, and none in hyper-diverse tropical communities. Here, we experimentally removed two species of herbivore from a community of leaf-mining insects in a tropical forest. We predicted that other species that share natural enemies with the two removed species would experience lower parasitism and have higher population densities in treatment compared with control sites. In both cases ( on removal of a dipteran and a coleopteran leaf-miner species) we found significantly lower parasitism, and in one case ( removal of the dipteran) we found significantly higher abundance a year after the manipulation. Our results suggest that apparent competition may be important in structuring tropical insect communities.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Morris, RJ (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",r.j.morris@imperial.ac.uk,"Lewis, Owen T/B-9531-2011","Lewis, Owen/0000-0001-7935-6111",,,,29,199,207,0,135,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,MAR 18,2004,428,6980,,,,,310,313,,10.1038/nature02394,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,803SG,WOS:000220250200041,15029194,,,,2021-09-21,

Aims To investigate experimentally whether competition for nest cavities and/or food can explain aggressive behaviour between competing species. Methods The Collared Flycatcher's Ficedula albicollis responses to mounts of Great Tit Parus major (nest-site and food competitor), Chaffinch Fringillo coelebs (food competitor) and Dunnock Prunella modularis (control species) were tested. Trials were performed near flycatchers' nests during nest building, incubation and care of nestlings. Results The intensity of dive attacks and frequency of contact attacks showed that the aggression of Collared Flycatchers decreased in the direction: Great Tit > Chaffinch > Dunnock. The difference in aggressiveness was greater between Great Tit and Chaffinch than between Chaffinch and Dunnock. Aggression directed toward Great Tits increased from the nest building to the incubation stage and then decreased markedly in the nestling stage. Males were more aggressive than females. Conclusion These results suggest that competition for nest-sites, and to a lesser extent for food, may be of an interference nature and that the reproductive value hypothesis can only partly explain differences in the Collared Flycatcher's defensive behaviour found between sexes and stages of the breeding cycle.","Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Ornithol Lab, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; Museum Hist Nat, Olomouc 77173, Czech Republic","Krist, M (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Ornithol Lab, Tr Svobody 26, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",krist@prfnw.upol.cz,,,,,,32,13,13,0,11,BRITISH TRUST ORNITHOLOGY,THETFORD NORFOLK,"NUNNERY, NUNNERY PLACE, THETFORD NORFOLK IP24 2PU, ENGLAND",0006-3657,,,BIRD STUDY,Bird Stud.,MAR,2004,51,,1,,,,41,47,,10.1080/00063650409461331,,,7,Ornithology,Zoology,804NR,WOS:000220305900006,,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Most predator-prey studies, however, have ignored the interspecific game by focusing on how either predators or prey distribute themselves while holding the distribution of the other species fixed. We use genetic algorithms to examine how the distributional outcome of the game between predators and prey depends on how prey balance the costs of predation risk and the benefits of foraging success. We construct two prey fitness functions. The first prey fitness function has prey reproducing when they reach a threshold mass, which leads to prey choosing patches by minimizing the ratio of predation and foraging rates (mu/f). The second prey fitness function has prey reproducing at the end of a season with mass-dependent reproductive success, which leads to prey choosing patches by maximizing their increase in reproductive value over time. When prey minimize mu/f, predator and prey distributions are unaffected by the overall level of predation risk. In contrast, when prey maximize their increase in reproductive value, under conditions with low predation risk the distributions of prey and predators are shaped mainly by prey competition and the distribution of resources, and as the overall level of predation risk increases the distribution of prey is increasingly shaped by the distribution of predators. Thus, the dynamics of how predators and prey distribute themselves and interact may depend on factors that affect the overall level of predation risk, such as per predator capture rates, predator densities, and shelter from predation.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Luttbeg, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",btluttbeg@ucdavis.edu,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,27,31,31,1,25,SCIENCE FROM ISRAEL-DIVISION OF LASER PAGES PUBL LTD,JERUSALEM,"PO BOX 34299, JERUSALEM 91341, ISRAEL",0021-2210,,,ISR J ZOOL,Isr.

The present work assessed the relationship of clover competitive ability with morphophysiological traits, and the efficiency of direct and indirect selection procedures for increasing clover dry matter (DM) yield in MS. Some 165 large-leaved clover genotypes representative of Italian Ladino germplasm and 13 clover genotypes from an elite small leaved population were clonally evaluated for one year in pure stand (PS) and in MS environment with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) that reproduced the level of interspecific interference met by the clover over a multi-year crop cycle. Results for all genotypes and their Subsets indicated that the level of leaf size variation among tested genotypes can affect the results. Wider variation decreased the relative importance of clover genotype x evaluation environment interaction, because competitive ability was mainly correlated with traits (longer petiole; larger leaflet) contributing to scale foraging in MS and yielding ability in PS. Competitive ability tended to be more closely associated with other traits (high stolon density; plasticity of petiole elongation) contributing to foraging ability, i.e. the ability to make fine-scale exploitation of light and nutrients in MS, within germplasm of similar leaf size. Leaf size variation also affected the relative efficiency of selection procedures estimated from expected responses to clonal selection. Results for all entries indicated direct selection in MS as 23% more efficient than selection in PS based on a selection index including three traits associated with competitive ability (petiole length; stolon density; leaflet size) which, in turn, was predicted to be 16% more effective than selection in PS based on DM yield. The advantage in relative efficiency of direct selection was almost doubled when considering only large-leaved germplasm. In a second experiment, evaluating 16 clover half-sib progenies of elite large-leaved parents for 2 years in PS and in MS with Italian ryegrass, tall fescue and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.), direct selection was estimated to be over three-fold and 68% more effective than indirect selection in PS based on DM yield and the selection index, respectively, based on expected responses to genotypic selection. The selection index may improve the efficiency of preliminary, PS-based clonal selection. Further evaluation of elite genotypes and/or their polycross progenies in MS is recommended for final selection.","Ist Sperimentale Colture Foraggere, I-26900 Lodi, Italy","Annicchiarico, P (corresponding author), Ist Sperimentale Colture Foraggere, Viale Piacenza 29, I-26900 Lodi, Italy.",bred@iscf.it,,,,,,42,31,32,0,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-8596,1469-5146,,J AGR SCI-CAMBRIDGE,J.

We predicted that if aggression is (at least partly) related to competition for food, the hen harrier, Circus cyaneus, because of its large size and territorial system, should be more aggressive (both intra- and interspecifically) than the smaller, colonial Montagu's harrier, Circus pygargus. The intraspecific aggression rate of both harriers peaked early in the season, was mainly intrasexual and increased with the number of neighbours. These patterns support the mate competition hypothesis to explain intraspeciflc aggression in both species. Montagu's harriers were more aggressive towards conspecifics than hen harriers. Their aggression rates towards heterospecifics were high at the start of the season then decreased, supporting the hypothesis that interspecific aggression serves primarily for nest site defence. Hen harriers showed lower interspecific aggression rates in the prelaying period and a gradual increase throughout the breeding cycle, particularly by females, who hunt around the nest for food for the nestlings. These patterns correspond to food competition, as food resources around the nest are probably more important and interspecific intrusion more costly for territorial hen harriers than for colonial Montagu's harriers.

Theoretically, we show how niche partitioning between competing parasitoids can arise through differences in resource breadth and utilization. We demonstrate, empirically, how trade-offs between parasitoid larval competitive ability and wasp life history characters (adult wasp longevity and the ability to paralyze hosts) can be mediated. Differences. not only in the mean, but also in the variance of these life history traits can influence the outcome of competition, and we discuss how species life history trade-offs can promote species coexistence.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Bonsall, MB (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",m.bonsall@ic.ac.uk,,"Bonsall, Michael/0000-0003-0250-0423",,,,57,45,46,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2002,83,4,,,,,925,934,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0925:ETORPA]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,533HP,WOS:000174523800006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Generally, these experiments have used colonies grown from tissue explants (clonal replicates) surgically removed from mature colonies taken from natural populations. In contrast, experiments involving interspecific bouts between small, sexually produced colonies reveal that both the characteristics and outcomes of competition differ from previous studies. During competition between small sexually produced colonies, H. symbiolongicarpus exhibits directional growth toward P. carnea and produces nematocyte-rich hyperplastic stolons more readily than P. carnea does. Nevertheless, P. carnea can still overcome H. symbiolongicarpus if it initially grows away from the contact zone and subsequently flanks H. symbiolongicarpus. Overall, sexually produced colonies of H. symbiolongicarpus destroyed their P. carnea counterparts in more than 35% of competitive bouts, whereas P. carnea dominated their H. symbiolongicarpus counterparts in all similar encounters between clonally produced colonies. In natural populations, competition between small sexually produced colonies of H. symbiolongicarpus may predominate, and these results support the hypothesis that this species is adapted to competition early in colony development. More generally, studies of competition between sexually produced colonies should complement similar studies of clonally produced colonies.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA","Van Winkle, DH (corresponding author), No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",rip@niu.edu,,,,,,44,7,7,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0006-3185,1939-8697,,BIOL BULL-US,Biol.

By allowing species to partition habitat and avoid competition. habitat diversity should 1) facilitate the addition of an ecologically intermediate species into an existing community, and 2) reduce the negative effects of that species on existing members of the community. I tested these predictions with juveniles of three sympatric salmonid species: coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), steelhead trout (O. mykiss), and cutthroat trout (O. clarki), which in natural streams occupy deep low-velocity pools, shallow high-velocity riffles. and intermediate habitats, respectively. I introduced two (coho and steelhead) and three species communities into each of three artificial stream habitats: pools, riffles, and diverse. The results provide partial support for the predictions. Cutthroat trout grew fastest in the diverse stream habitat. Though habitat diversity did not eliminate the negative effects of competition, in the three species community coho and steelhead grew as fast in the diverse habitat as in either homogeneous habitat. The results are consistent with data on species number and evenness from natural communities, where variation along other niche axes confounds the relationship between habitat diversity, interspecific competition, and species diversity.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Ctr Appl Conservat Biol, 3041-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Young, KA (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Ctr Appl Conservat Biol, 3041-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",kyoung@interchange.ubc.ca,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,70,26,31,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2001,95,1,,,,,87,93,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.950110.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,495JZ,WOS:000172338600010,,,,,2021-09-21,

We assumed that species x and y are each exclusively superior in subhabitat 1 and subhabitat 2, respectively, and that population densities that exert intra-and interspecific competitive effects also impose pressures for migration of individuals from a subhabitat. If the two species are, respectively, abundant in the subhabitats in which either species is competitively superior, and the migration has a mixing effect, then, it would be intuitively expected that, as potential migration rates increase, the two species are mixed well and coexist in the whole habitat. An analysis of this competitive situation using our model under the assumption of linear diffusion predicted that, even though weak mixing maintains coexistence in the whole habitat, strong mixing collapses coexistence and leads to the exclusion of one species. The assumption that migrations occur due to self- and cross-population pressures provides different predictions: (i) weak dominance and strong mixing destabilize the coexistence state and lead to a monopolizing equilibrium of either species (bistability of monopolizing equiliblia); (ii) conspicuous weakness of the inferior species makes the mixing equilibrium stable, regardless of the potential migration rate; and (iii) tri-stability exists in between situations (i) and (ii). In the third case, the attainable state is the mixing equilibrium or either of the monopolizing equilibria, depending on the initial state. Migration mechanisms with self- and cross-population pressures tends to mediate spatial segregation and makes coexistence possible, even with strong mixing.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan","Nishimura, K (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan.",kinya@fish.hokudai.ac.jp,"Kishida, Osamu/B-7970-2011",,,,,35,9,9,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

We examined a version of this hypothesis using interspecific data to test whether exaggerated sexual swellings are associated with female mating competition, as measured using the adult sex ratio, female canine size, and expected female mating synchrony. The ratio of females to males and relative canine size declined over evolutionary transitions in swelling state, thus providing no support for the reliable indicator hypothesis. Expected female mating synchrony increased over evolutionary transitions in swelling state, but this pattern did not approach significance, and the patterns were opposite to predictions when controlling for the number of males in the group. In addition to these comparative tests, we reviewed evidence concerning individual attributes of females relative to characteristics of their swellings. Contrary to the reliable indicator hypothesis, the least fertile females, or those least likely to raise surviving offspring, often have larger swellings. We consider the statistical power of our tests, discuss the theoretical and empirical bases for our comparative predictions, and consider other lines of evidence needed to test the reliable indicator hypothesis. We also discuss an alternative hypothesis, the graded signal hypothesis, which combines the benefits of biasing and confusing paternity through a novel mechanism, and is testable in the field and the laboratory.","Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol Anthropol & Anat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Deutsch Primatenzentrum Gmbh, Abt Verhaltensforsch & Okol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Nunn, CL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",charlie.nunn@virginia.edu,,,,,,97,39,39,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The results show that once intraspecific parasitism has appeared (i.e., females start to spread their eggs over their own and other nests) the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest decreases. Two possible ESSs exist: (1) either the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest is larger than zero, and a fraction of the total number of eggs is laid parasitically (i.e., intraspecific parasitism); and (2) either the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest is zero and all eggs are laid parasitically Since all females lay parasitically, this could favor the evolution of obligate interspecific brood parasitism. The key parameter allowing the shift from intraspecific to obligate interspecific parasitism is the intensity of density-dependent mortality within broods (i.e., nestling competition). Strong nestling competition, as in altricial species, can lead to an ESS where all eggs are laid parasitically: Altricial species are, therefore, predicted to evolve more easily toward obligate interspecific parasitism than precocial species. These predictions fit the observed distribution of brood parasitism in birds, where only one species out of 95 obligate interspecific parasites exhibits a precocial mode of development. Different nestling survival functions provided similar findings (i.e., obligate brood parasitism is more likely to evolve in altricial species), suggesting that these results are robust with respect to the main assumption of the model.","Univ Paris 06, CNRS UMR 7625, Ecol Lab, Bat A,7eme Etate,7 Quai St Bernard,Case 237, F-75252 Paris 05, France","Robert, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS UMR 7625, Ecol Lab, Bat A,7eme Etate,7 Quai St Bernard,Case 237, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",mrobert@snv.jussieu.fr,,"Sorci, Gabriele/0000-0002-0799-3995",,,,46,21,21,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Interspecific competition can also he a strong limiting factor for carnivore populations, and the effects of competition help explain why some carnivore species are prone to extinction. Competition among carnivores is unusual in some ways, so some predictions from traditional models of competition do not hold. For example an increase in the density of prey can increase the effect of competition among carnivores, rather than weakening it. I used published data from African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) to highlight four complexities that can modify, the effects of competition on the population dynamics of carnivores: habitat fragmentation, counterintuitive effects of prey density predator-prey size ratios, and habitat type.","Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Creel, S (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",screel@montana.edu,,,,,,25,90,91,0,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

The extent of directional environmental change expected in the next century underscores the need to understand density-dependent population regulation. 2. Direct density dependence generated by intraspecific competition and/or predator-prey interactions should buffer environmentally produced changes in density-independent growth rates (r), Density dependence generated by interspecific competition should magnify sensitivity to changes in r. 3, We tested these predictions by assembling protist communities in laboratory microcosms and subjecting the communities to directional environmental change. Two experiments used pairs of competing protists (Colpidium striatum Stein and Tetrahymena thermophila Nanney & McCoy, and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn and Blepharisma americanum Suzuki) along with single-species controls, Two experiments used predator-prey pairs (Didinium nasutum Muller or Euplotes patella Ehrenberg preying on Colpidium) and controls containing only prey. We grew replicates of each species combination in two temperature regimes (constant or slowly increasing temperature). Independent of these experiments, we quantified the temperature dependence of r (intrinsic rate of increase) for each species. 4, Comparison of effects of temperature on r to effects on mean density revealed that intraspecific competition buffered species densities against temperature changes that increased r by over 200%, Interspecific interactions did not affect species responses to environmental change. Temperature change had weak effects on species densities, whether or not other species were present. 5, The results suggest that natural populations, regulated by direct density dependence, may be buffered against directional environmental change. Environmental change will have large effects when populations experience little density dependence, and when environmental change has different effects on the vital rates of different species.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",,,,,,,61,38,38,1,99,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The animal communities in phytotelmata-plant-held waters-are a convenient exception to this generalization. Tree holes, bamboo internodes, pitcher plants, tank bromeliads, and water-retaining plant axils contain a rich fauna, principally of arthropods, which constitute more or less complex, highly discrete food webs. They are widespread and replicated. The explanations for the community structure observed in these systems may call on bottom-up mechanisms such as simple environmental limitations, competition, predation, and facilitation, or they may adduce grander top-down theories, which explore biogeographic, energetic, dynamic, or biodiversity-related constraints. The existence of the bottom-up mechanisms is well established in experimental systems, and their consequences may be apparent in naturally occurring food webs. Top-down mechanisms demand a more holistic approach and are more difficult to test either by pattern analysis or experimental manipulation. The synoptic explanation of community composition and structure demands a multidimensional approach best expressed as a heuristic template. Phytotelmata represent nearly ideal natural instruments for further study of food web dynamics, and exciting opportunities exist for the development and testing of community theories through their manipulation.","Griffith Univ, Australian Sch Environm Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia","Kitching, RL (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Sch Environm Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",r.kitching@mailbox.gu.edu.au,"Kitching, Roger/C-5102-2009",,,,,184,140,150,3,73,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

Increasing aggregation increased intraspecific competition in barnyardgrass. At the same time, interspecific competition experienced by tomato from barnyardgrass decreased. Differences in the amount of shading of the tomato canopy by barnyardgrass contributed to yield loss differences for the various spatial arrangements. Clumped barnyardgrass caused significantly less average shading than barnyardgrass in regular or random arrangements. At a typical planting density of 10 tomato plants m(-1) of row, yield losses ranged from 10 to 35% (1993) or 8 to 50% (1994) when competing with a clumped arrangement of barnyardgrass.

Sixty-one published cases of character displacement involving closely related species (congeners) make up the observational data set. All cases involve divergence, even though parallel and convergent displacement are theoretically possible. Character ratios in sympatry were greatest when displacement was symmetric (mean 1.54) and least when asymmetric (mean 1.29), perhaps because the most symmetric resource distributions are also the broadest. Carnivores are vastly overrepresented in the data compared with other trophic groups, with herbivores the next most common category. I consider five hypotheses to explain this pattern, including the possibility that the likelihood of divergence via competition depends on position in food webs. Overall, the quality and completeness of observational data has improved in recent pars, as judged by the extent to which individual cases satisfy six standard criteria. All but one of the criteria are met in over half the cases. Most often lacking is independent evidence that the species involved compete for resources. For this reason, we cannot be sure that divergence in sympatry is usually the result of resource competition rather than some other interaction. Field experiments on character displacement, which explore how interaction strength changes per unit change in phenotypic traits, are only just beginning. I summarize research on threespine sticklebacks that used experiments in ponds to test three predictions: that present-day differences between sympatric species are a ghost of competition past; that adding a competitor alters natural selection pressures on a species already present, favoring divergence; and that divergent natural selection stemming from resource competition is frequency dependent. In total, the evidence suggests that character displacement occurs frequently in nature, and it probably plays an important role in the evolution of diversity in many adaptive radiations.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Ctr Biodivers Res, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Peter Wall Inst Adv Studies, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Schluter, D (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",,"Langerhans, R.

Caste-forming species produce some individuals that reproduce and others with worker functions that have few or no offspring(1). Morphologically specialized castes are well known in eusocial species like ants and termites(1), but castes have also evolved in less-studied groups like thrips, aphids and polyembryonic wasps(2-5). Because selection acts at both the individual and the colony level, ratios of investment in different castes are predicted to vary with environmental factors like competition and resources(6-8). However, experimental evidence for adaptive shifts in caste ratios is limited(9) owing to the experimental difficulty of manipulating factors thought to influence caste ratios(10-13), and because some species produce behaviourally flexible castes that switch tasks in response to colony needs(14,15). Unlike other caste-forming species, the broods of polyembryonic wasps develop clonally, so that increased production of one caste probably results in decreased production of the other(16). Here we show that the polyembryonic wasp Copidosoma floridanum alters caste ratios in response to interspecific competition. Our results reveal a distinct trade-off by C. floridanum between reproduction and defence, and show experimentally that caste ratios shift in an adaptive manner.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Strand, MR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",mrstrand@facstaff.wisc.edu,"Harvey, Jeffrey A/B-7439-2008","Harvey, Jeffrey A/0000-0002-4227-7935; Lavine, Laura/0000-0002-0262-359X",,,,28,78,81,1,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,JUL 13,2000,406,6792,,,,,183,186,,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,335BA,WOS:000088221100047,10910357,,,,2021-09-21,

However, under some circumstances the evolutionary response to a gradient may be opposite of the ecological response, a phenomenon known as countergradient variation. We had previously predicted that counter-gradient selection has occurred in pumpkinseed sunfish in response to a resource gradient created by competition with bluegill sunfish. Because competition only occurs when pumpkinseed are small, rapid growth has evolved to allow passage through the competing size classes as quickly as possible. We performed a common-garden experiment using juvenile pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill and from lakes without bluegill. Pumpkinseed were raised in cages without bluegill, or with a low density of bluegill, or with a high density of bluegill. Bluegill significantly decreased growth for all pumpkinseed, following the predicted ecological gradient. However, pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill grew faster than those from lakes without bluegill under all treatments, following the predicted evolutionary response.","SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Arendt, JD (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",,,,,,,32,60,65,0,24,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1999,80,8,,,,,2793,2798,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2793:CSFRGI]2.0.CO;2,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,264VR,WOS:000084204100028,,,,,2021-09-21,

The mechanisms of the replacement are not yet fully understood. We restated the commonly cited Interference Competition Hypothesis (ICH) that grey squirrels interfere with the behaviour of red squirrels in three possible ways: 1. by direct aggressive interactions; 2. by interrupting red squirrel mating-chases; or 3. by forcing red squirrels to actively avoid areas intensively used by grey squirrels. We compared the activity pattern, behaviour and reproductive performance of red squirrels in two study areas in northern Italy, one with only red squirrels (control area C1), the other with both species (experimental area E1). The following predictions were tested: 1. the total time spent in both intraspecific and interspecific interactions by red squirrels increases in the experimental area. 2. most interspecific interactions are aggressive, with grey squirrels being the dominant species; 3. the proportion of breeding female red squirrels that are unsuccessful at weaning offspring increases in area El; 4. grey squirrels take part and interfere with red squirrel mating-chases, and thereby decrease the reproductive output of red squirrel females. 5. the activity pattern of red squirrels in the mixed-species area is shifted with respect to that in the control area to the hours of the day during which grey squirrels show little activity; and 6. red squirrels will shift their home range (or at least their core-area) when grey squirrel densities increase to avoid interspecific core-area overlap. Our results supported only the first prediction of the ICH: they failed to support all the other predictions. Moreover, the increase in the percentage of active time red squirrels spent interacting with other squirrels in the experimental study area was very small (only 1-2 min/day). Red squirrels did not avoid the woodland patches most intensively used by grey squirrels and the interspecific core-area overlap was similar to red squirrel intraspecific core-area overlap. This suggested that red squirrels avoided spatial overlap with grey squirrels in a similar manner as with conspecifics and that an increase in grey squirrel numbers will augment the intensity of resource competition. We therefore conclude that our results do not lend support to the Interference Competition Hypothesis and that interference competition by grey squirrels cannot explain the large-scale replacement of red by grey squirrels that has occurred in Britain and in Piedmont.","Univ London Queen Mary & Westfield Coll, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England","Gurnell, J (corresponding author), Univ London Queen Mary & Westfield Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",,,,,,,40,66,68,2,75,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0179-1613,,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,DEC,1999,105,12,,,,,1053,1071,,10.1046/j.1439-0310.1999.10512488.x,,,19,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,266KH,WOS:000084298800004,,,,,2021-09-21,

We test the hypothesis that, on average, pollen specialist bee species occur more predictably at their floral hosts than pollen generalist bee species. Taxonomic floral specialization reaches its extreme among species of solitary, pollen-collecting bees, yet few studies have considered how pollen specialization by floral visitors influences their spatial constancy. We test this hypothesis using an unusually diverse bee guild that visits creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), the most widespread, dominant plant of the warm deserts of North America. Twenty-two strict pollen specialist and 80 + generalist bee species visit Larrea for its floral resources. The sites we sampled were separated by 0.5 to > 1450 km, and spanned three distinct deserts and four vegetation zones. We found that species of Larrea pollen specialist bees occurred at more sites and tended to be more abundant than generalists. Surprisingly, spatial turnover was high for both pollen specialist and generalist bee species at all distances, and species composition of samples from sites 1-5 km apart varied as much as repeat samples made at single sites. Nevertheless, the pattern of bee species turnover was not haphazard. As distance among sites increased faunal similarity of sites decreased. Faunal similarities among sites within 250 km of each other were generally greater than if randomly distributed over all sites (the null model). No single ecological category of species (widespread, localized, Larrea pollen specialist, floral generalist) accounted for this spatial predictability. Evidently, concordant local distribution patterns of many ecologically diverse species contribute to the non-random spatial pattern. The ecological dominance of creosote bush does not confer obvious ecological advantages to its specialist floral visitors. Spatial turnover is comparable to that found for bee guilds from other biogeographic regions of the world and is not therefore limited to those bee species that inhabit highly seasonal climates, such as deserts. Philopatry and differences in bloom predictability among sites are probably more important causes for spatial turnover of bee species than are interspecific competition for nest sites or floral resources.

Naturally occurring encounters were observed between juvenile C. sordidus and a variety of 'interactor' species that included different combinations of territorial, non-territorial, trophic competitors and non-trophic competitor species. Results showed that these interspecific encounters play an important role in determining the structure of juvenile scarid schools and may consequently contribute towards influencing juvenile susceptibility to predation. Moreover, log-linear analysis of data revealed significant correlations between PCP and behaviour of juvenile C. sordidus in response to these encounters.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Crook, AC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Cork, Ireland.",anne.crook@bureau.ucc.ie,,,,,,29,4,4,1,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1023-6244,1029-0362,,MAR FRESHW BEHAV PHY,Mar.

Venom is used for prey capture as well as for interactions with predators and competitors, The venom of every species has its own distinct complement of peptides. Some of the interspecific divergence observed in venom peptides can be explained by differential expression of venom peptide superfamilies in different species and of peptide superfamilies branching in various Conus lineages into pharmacologic groups with different targeting specificity. However, the striking interspecific divergence of peptide sequences is the dominant factor in the differences observed between venoms. The small venom peptides (typically 10-35 amino acids in length) are processed from larger prepropeptide precursors (ca. 100 amino acids). If interspecific comparisons are made between homologous prepropeptides, the three different regions of a Conus peptide precursor (signal sequence, pro-region, mature peptide) are found to have diverged at remarkably different rates, Analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates for the different segments of a prepropeptide suggests that mutation frequency varies by over an order of magnitude across the segments, with the mature toxin region undergoing the highest rate. The three sections of the prepropeptide which exhibit apparently different mutation rates are separated by introns, This striking segment-specific rate of divergence of Conus prepropeptides suggests a role for introns in evolution: exons separated by introns have the potential to evolve very different mutation rates, Plausible mechanisms that could underlie differing mutational frequency in the different exons of a gene are discussed.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Pathol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Olivera, BM (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,,"Hooper, David/0000-0001-8732-4291",NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [GM48677] Funding Source: Medline,,,37,143,144,0,11,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-192-8,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,1999,870,,,,,,223,237,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08883.x,,,15,Genetics & Heredity; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Genetics & Heredity; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BN31U,WOS:000081585400024,10415486,,,,2021-09-21,

This process often involves multiple species exploiting shared limiting resources. In classic coevolutionary models, populations of sympatric species are seen to diverge in one or more morphological, ecological, or behavioral traits to effect more even partitioning of resources and reduce levels of interspecific competition. Character displacement and resource partitioning are thought to be central not only to how species coexist on limited resources, but also to how species invade new resource niches. Hominid invasion of the predatory guild at least 2 my ago would have brought them into contact with a range of new selective pressures including competition with a number of large-bodied predators. This study explores resource partitioning between hominids and other Plio-Pleistocene large-bodied predators through analyses of predator food transport strategies. The anatomical content (head/limb MNE) of hominid transported faunal assemblages at Bed I Olduvai and FxJj 50 (Koobi Fora), when compared to modern predator control cases, suggests that Plio-Pleistocene hominids practiced food transport strategies intermediate between those of top predators such as wolves and those of confrontational scavengers such as spotted hyaenas. Plio-Pleistocene hominid food transport strategies do not resemble those of nonconfrontational scavengers such as brown and striped hyenas. The highly regular patterns differentiating bone assemblages accumulated by top predators, hominids, and confrontational and nonconfrontational scavengers suggest that hominid invasion of the predatory guild involved resource partitioning potentially based on some form of character displacement, (C)1998 Academic Press.","Univ Arizona, Dept Anthropol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Brantingham, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Anthropol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,,,,138,71,75,0,23,ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0278-4165,,,J ANTHROPOL ARCHAEOL,J.

The competitiveness of species is hierarchically ordered and the dynamics of the model are described by spatially local interactions of individuals. The size of the local neighborhood may depend on the species. The habitat consists of inhabitable and permanently destroyed sites. It was previously observed (Nee & May, 1992; Tilman et al., 1994, 1997) that destruction of habitat may aid the inferior species and cause the superior species to go extinct. These conclusions were based on an n-species model in which the spatial arrangement of destroyed sites was ignored. We examine the effects of different spatial arrangements of destroyed sites on survival and coexistence of the two species. We conclude that the spatial arrangement plays an important role and can influence the outcome qualitatively and quantitatively. The key quantity for predicting the outcome of habitat destruction on species survival is the relationship between the mean dispersal distance and the mean distance between inhabitable and destroyed sites. We contrast the hierarchical model with a version of the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition and show that habitat destruction can alter the dominance relationship between species by reducing intraspecific competition.

Sprout biomass of target plants 2 years after clipping was regressed against various measures of neighbor abundance within a 2 m radius around target E. multiflora individuals in which all vegetation except R. officinalis had been removed. The largest single influence on the biomass of sprouts produced was the previous biomass of the resprouting plant. The abundance of R. officinalis neighbors had a weak but detectable effect on resprouting of E. multiflora. Abundance of neighbors within 60 cm from target plants was the best predictor of regrowth. At this distance, two simple measures of neighbor abundance within the neighborhood, the number of neighbors and the sum of their heights, were significant in accounting for variation in resprouted biomass. None of the combinations of neighbor variables performed significantly better than single variables. The best models accounted for around 24 percent of the variation in resprout biomass. As in other studies, angular dispersion of neighbors never had a significant effect on performance of target plants. The weak but significant response of resprouting to variation in R. officinalis abundance suggests that the intensity of competition in the experiment was low because of the removal of other species.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Recerca & Aplicac Forestals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; Univ Bern, Geobot Inst, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; Royal Vet & Agr Univ, Dept Agr Sci, DK-2630 Taastrup, Denmark","Vila, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Recerca & Aplicac Forestals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",,"Vila, Montserrat/D-9339-2013; Weiner, Jacob/E-1839-2011; Stoll, Peter/A-8881-2010","Vila, Montserrat/0000-0003-3171-8261; Weiner, Jacob/0000-0002-0736-7943; Stoll, Peter/0000-0003-1509-1702",,,,39,7,8,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,1998,136,2,,,,,167,173,,10.1023/A:1009732532406,,,7,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,ZW553,WOS:000074422500004,,,,,2021-09-21,

From the life tables it was evident that the impact of egg predators accounted for 25-43% of the total generational mortality of Y. malinellus, more than any other known mortality factor. Percent parasitism varied from 18 to 30%, but the impact of parasitoids in relation to the total generational mortality of Y. malinellus from the life tables was remarkably constant at 11-14%. The loss of potential fecundity had an important influence on the generational mortality of Y. malinellus, but declined from 27% to 15% over the course of this study.

We conducted laboratory experiments to examine behavioral and chemical interference competition between tadpoles of the southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia) and those of the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea). Water preconditioned by R. utricularia tadpoles significantly decreased the growth and increased the mortality of H. cinerea tadpoles compared with control treatments. In addition, R. utricularia tadpoles inhibited the feeding rate of H, cinerea tadpoles by harassing them, and these interactions significantly decreased the growth and increased the mortality of the H. cinerea tadpoles. Rana utricularia tadpoles apparently use both chemical interference and aggressive behavior in securing a competitive advantage over H. cinerea tadpoles, and the H. cinerea tadpoles suffer from these interactions. Intraspecific chemical and behavioral interference competition also significantly decreased the growth of larval H. cinerea.

Burrow architecture differed specifically, Diets were qualitatively similar at insect family level but different at the species level, partly because of local variation in availability and partly because of distinct preferences of M. apiaster for small beetles, ants and termites and of NI, persicus for large dragonflies and cicadas. Merops persicus was less specialized than M. apiaster and had an airborne insect prey spectrum nearly twice as broad. Diets were more alike where the two birds foraged together than where they foraged separately, There was a high incidence of egg and nestling loss by predation and starvation. We speculate that each species may prove to breed more successfully in mixed than in monospecific colonies. We propose that the two bee-eaters do not compete for nest sites but may compete for food and coexist unaggressively by trading off food competition against improved breeding success in mixed colonies.","Nat Reserve Bryanski Les, Stn Nerussa, Suzemski Rayon 242180, Bryanskaya Obla, Russia; Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Al Khod 123, Oman","Kossenko, SM (corresponding author), Nat Reserve Bryanski Les, Stn Nerussa, Suzemski Rayon 242180, Bryanskaya Obla, Russia.",,,,,,,31,16,18,0,11,BRITISH ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,TRING,"C/O NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, SUB-DEPT ORNITHOLOGY, TRING, HERTS, ENGLAND HP23 6AP",0019-1019,,,IBIS,Ibis,JAN,1998,140,1,,,,,2,13,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.1998.tb04535.x,,,12,Ornithology,Zoology,YR717,WOS:000071523200001,,,,,2021-09-21,

The analyses are based on 23 Linear variables. Univariate analyses indicate that similar ontogenetic patterns of cranial sexual dimorphism are present; however, interspecific differences exist in timing. Ontogenetic scaling is present in both species' crania; however, it is more prevalent in C. albifrons. Several departures are present in cranial regions associated with orbital shape, the dental arcade, and the muscles of mastication. The latter two indicate that sexual differences in diet and/or foraging strategies may exist. Sexual selection is suggested as being the primary selective regime underlying the observed patterns of cranial sexual dimorphism in each species. Interspecific comparisons confirm that C. apella possesses a more dimorphic cranium than C. albifrons and that sexual dimorphism in C. apella begins earlier in development. Although interspecific ontogenetic scaling is present in some cranial variables, C. apella is not just a scaled-up version of C. albifrons. These sympatric congeners seem to be differentiated by variables related to the orbital region and the masticatory apparatus, as indicated by both departures from ontogenetic scaling and results of the discriminant function analysis. Ecological selection, rather than varying degrees of sexual selection, is likely to be responsible for this finding given that C. apella is known to consume hard-object foods. This is consistent with the predicted outcome of the competitive exclusion principle.

To enhance the prediction of ingrowth uneven-aged mixed species stands, we developed a height-growth model for juvenile trees (less than or equal to 1.3 m). The model predicts the actual periodical 5-year height increment by adjusting the corresponding potential height increment using: (1) the competition of the remaining overstory, (2) the intra-and interspecies competition among the regeneration itself, and (3:) a modifier for the edge effected incidence of light. Data for this study came from 240 sample plots located in uneven-aged mixed species stands consisting of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst), fir(Abies alba Mill.), and common beech (Fagus silvatica L.). The number of trees on each plot was recorded by species and height class. One typical tree was selected to determine the tree height and the height increment of the past five years of growth for each species and height class. The sample consists of 265 spruce: 139 fir, and 286 beech trees. Additionally, we measured the distance to the stand edge along with the maximum possible angle of incidence for sunlight. For all trees in the overstory (height > 1.3 m), we recorded the diameter at breast height, the tree height, and the height to the crown base. The results demonstrate two things: first, the two competition measures and the modifier for the edge effected incidence of light were important for spruce and beech regeneration, while the competition among the regeneration for fir had no significant impact. Second, except for the smallest height class of fir and beech (less than or equal to 20 cm), which showed a slight tendency to overestimate 5-year height increment rates, the resulting models produce unbiased predictions.

A direct, competitive effect of R. padi on D. noxia was observed only at extraordinarily high aphid densities (>2,000 individuals per greenhouse seedling). Lacewing predators significantly reduced the rate of increase of D. noxia in each experiment, but they were sometimes less effective on plants that received a mixture of both aphid species than they were on plants that received an equivalent number of D. noxia alone. The presence of R. padi may have reduced predation on D. noxia because the former species is more accessible to lacewing predators or because its faster growth rate caused it to outnumber D. noxia on plants that initially received an equal ratio of both species.

I tested whether invasions were more likely to succeed when fewer species were present using the records of passeriform birds introduced to four acclimatization districts in New Zealand. I also tested whether introduction effort, measured as the number of introductions and the total number of birds released, could predict invasion outcomes, a result previously established for all birds introduced to New Zealand. I found patterns consistent with both competition and introduction effort as explanations for invasion success. However, data supporting the two explanations were confounded such that the greater success of invaders arriving when fewer other species were present could have been due to a causal relationship between invasion success and introduction effort. Hence, without data on introduction effort, previous studies may have overestimated the degree to which the number of potential competitors could independently explain invasion outcomes and may therefore have overstated the importance of competition in structuring introduced avian assemblages. Furthermore, I suggest that a second pattern in avian invasion success previously attributed to competition, the morphological overdispersion of successful invaders, could also arise as an artifact of variation in introduction effort.",,"Duncan, RP (corresponding author), LINCOLN UNIV,DEPT PLANT SCI,POB 84,CANTERBURY,NEW ZEALAND.",,"Duncan, Richard P/E-7899-2013; Duncan, Richard/ABD-4099-2020","Duncan, Richard P/0000-0003-2295-449X; Duncan, Richard/0000-0003-2295-449X",,,,34,108,108,1,41,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

Such systems are conveniently modeled within a difference-equation framework. Here, we examine the dynamic behavior of discrete-time models for an exploited predator-prey system. We contrast the dynamic properties of an aggregate production model and an age-structured model in which recruitment and mortality are explicitly considered. The joint effects of harvesting and interspecific interactions on the stability of the system are defined and contrasted with results for single species systems. We demonstrate that harvesting is a potentially stabilizing factor in the production model and in an age-structured model in which juveniles are harvested and that the relative magnitude of the interaction between predator and prey strongly affects the exploitation levels at which stabilization occurs. In contrast, harvesting is potentially destabilizing (i.e., results in complex dynamics) in an age-structured model with harvesting of adults only; again, the magnitude of the interaction determines the stability boundaries, with stronger interactions leading to a broader range of stable parameter space. In both the aggregate production model and the age-structured model with harvesting of juvenile predator and prey, exploitation effectively reduces the intrinsic rate of increase of the populations; for prey, this effect is amplified by high predation mortality rates. Sustainable levels of exploitation for both predators and prey are lower for the case where juveniles are harvested. Predators and resource harvesters can be viewed as competitors for the prey, and sustainable harvest levels are directly affected by the magnitude of predation mortality. These considerations expand the scope of issues to be resolved in fishery management to include factors such as trade-offs between mean yield and the potential for intrinsic variability and the role of predator-prey interactions in shaping the dynamics of exploited systems.

Overlap between food types consumed by the two species was particularly high during periods of lowest fruit availability, when they resorted to a common food supply, primarily the pod exudates of two emergent species of legume trees (Parkia nitida and Parkia pendula) and nectar of Symphonia globulifera. Within-group interspecific competition did not covary with independent measures of resource availability, contrary to predictions based on resource partitioning models. A greater number of both saddle-back and moustached tamarins were able to feed for longer patch residence periods within larger and more productive food patches, whereas small and clumped patches could be monopolized by the socially and numerically dominant moustached tamarins to the physical exclusion of the smaller-bodied saddle-back tamarins. Overall rates of interspecific aggression were extremely low, however, partly because patches that could be monopolized contributed with a minor proportion of either species' diet. Saddle-backs foraged at lower levels in the understory and encountered smaller food patches more often, whereas moustached tamarins foraged higher and encountered more larger patches in the middle canopy. Although the two species led one another to differently-sized patches, moustached tamarins initiated most feeding bouts and encountered significantly larger and more productive patches that tended to accommodate the entire mixed-species group.

Tapes philippinarum occurred at significantly higher densities and occupied a deeper stratum in the sediment than Anomalocardia squamosa, which is a species protected by a much thicker shell. Both species showed an aggregated pattern of spatial distribution over the scale of 10(1) to 10(-2) m. There was no correlation between the densities of the two bivalves nor was there any relationship between body condition and burying depth of Tapes philippinarum. However, individuals of Anomalocardia squamosa residing in the 2-4 cm depth stratum had a significantly higher condition index than their counterparts in the 0-2 cm stratum. The three-dimensional distribution pattern of the two bivalves in relation to density and presence of the other species was investigated by using tagging experiments in the laboratory whereby the exact three-dimensional position of the individuals was recorded in the form of an x,y,z coordinate. The same relative vertical distribution pattern of the bivalves as in the field was maintained while nearest neighbour analysis using the three- (x,y,z coordinates) or two-dimensional (only the x,y coordinates) data yielded different conclusions about the distribution pattern of the bivalves. The three-dimensional analysis consistently suggested an aggregated pattern whereas horizontal distribution was mostly random in the sediment matrix. Both horizontal, vertical and total displacement by individuals of Tapes philippinarum, but not Anomalocardia squamosa, were significantly affected by manipulations of the densities of conspecifics and/or A. squamosa. The latter species, however, was responsive to manipulations in terms of their burying depth. Both species showed considerable movements over the 2-week experimental period. The presence of a predator Portunus pelagicus did not significantly change the vertical distribution pattern of the two bivalves but the mortality of Tapes philippinarum was significantly higher than that of Anomalocardia squamosa. The results suggest that short-term responses such as emigration may be an important response to potential competitive interaction among infaunal bivalves and that such interaction may reduce the usefulness of long-term indicators such as growth and mortality. Whereas burying depth of infaunal bivalves may be influenced intra-specifically by trade-off between predation risk and hunger level, the soft tissue: shell weight (approximate to defence) ratio seems to be a more general predictor of vertical distribution in intra- as well as inter-specific comparisons.","UNIV HONG KONG,SWIRE INST MARINE SCI,HONG KONG,HONG KONG","Lee, SY (corresponding author), UNIV HONG KONG,DEPT ECOL & BIODIVERS,POKFULAM RD,HONG KONG,HONG KONG.",,"Lee, Joe S.

Three commonly occurring species, which exhibited complementary distribution patterns, were numerically and behaviorally dominant to other species in the communities in which they occurred. Field observations and laboratory experiments showed that negative inter-specific interactions were important in maintaining the exclusive territories of the dominant species. Habitat also played a role in determining the distribution of dominant species. Pairwise tests of association among all species revealed dominant species were commonly positively associated with their own non-overlapping group of subordinate species, forming a large-scale mosaic distribution pattern of dominant and subordinate species. Baiting experiments, conducted with and without the dominant species removed, demonstrated that the presence of the dominant species decreased: (1) the proportion of baits occupied by other species, and (2) overall ant species diversity, at rich food resources. In ant communities where one of the three recognized dominant species was present, the outcome of negative interspecific interactions among species was more predictable than in communities without a recognized dominant. The same patterns were evident regardless of which of the three dominant species was present in the community. These patterns of community organization observed in this relatively newly assembled fauna are very similar to those reported from studies of older ant communities in mainland areas.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DIV BIOL SCI, SECT EVOLUT & ECOL, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA; UNIV CALIF DAVIS, CTR POPULAT BIOL, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA",,,"Morrison, Lloyd W/A-8949-2013","Morrison, Lloyd W/0000-0002-9375-843X",,,,73,85,88,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1996,107,2,,,,,243,256,,10.1007/BF00327909,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VA148,WOS:A1996VA14800013,28307311,,,,2021-09-21,

Age-0 yellow perch consumed primarily Daphnia and copepods until the Daphnia stocks were depleted then switched to benthic prey. Small age-0 gizzard shad primarily selected Daphnia and copepods while larger individuals consumed fewer zooplankton and more phytoplankton. Data from 1984 through 1993 indicated no direct effect of interspecific competition on growth rates of either species. The decrease in Daphnia populations in years with abundant age-0 gizzard shad occurs later in the year than in years with abundant age-0 yellow perch, and we suggest that this timing is crucial for the outcome of fish interactions. When Daphnia decline later in the season, larger age-0 yellow perch can switch to benthic prey and larger age-0 gizzard shad to phytoplankton; thus, the outcome of these interactions differs from the depression of age-0 bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) by competition from age-0 shad reported from many reservoirs.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, BIOL FIELD STN, BRIDGEPORT, NY 13030 USA",,,,"Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838",,,,37,43,43,0,8,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

However, later demographic changes could be explained by within-community ecological processes, not detected in presence of human gatherers. Competition for food, predation and recruitment, were explanatory hypothesis for such changes, and they were tested at the study site for two species: Fissurella picta and Fissurella limbata. At present, F. limbata does not occur at areas protected of the north winds, and F. picta shows a decreasing density in exposed areas. The competition hypothesis was tested at the exposed area through enclosure experiments. Predation over adult individuals was examined by means of a diet analysis for five predator species, from our data base of the Marine Reserve and other studies in that area and from other localities of the Chilean coast. Recruitment failure was studied on a long-term basis, using data on size structure accumulated in our data base. No inter or intraspecific competition was detected between the two species in the enclosure experiment, since neither species affected survivorship or biomass of the other. No evidence of an alternative to man predator of adults was found, but only a very low predation exerted by Larus dominicanus, Sicyases sanguineus. Stichaster striatus and Rattus rattus. A recruitment failure was detected for F. picta at the exposed area, and we detected the entry of individuals smaller than 30 mm during the last three years in the protected area.

In Belgium, they occupy overlapping territories and form mixed-species winter hocks. Earlier, we found environmental stress to govern foraging strategies of first year Crested Tits (subordinates) in unispecific flocks. I here test whether niche shifts of Willow Tits (subordinates) in mixed flocks with Crested Tits (dominants) are in the direction expected if interspecific competition governs foraging site segregation when wind velocity increases. At high wind velocity, Willow Tits shifted to sites higher up and further out in trees in the presence, but downward and inward in the absence of Crested Tits. In the latter case, they used similar positions to allopatric Willow Tits. At high wind velocity, foraging shifts of Willow Tits decreased the niche overlap with Crested Tits foraging in the same tree, but there were no such shifts when foraging in neighbouring ones. The fact that Willow Tits frequently join coherent flocks with Crested Tits on windy days, suggests that environmental stress might govern flocking strategies adopted by subordinate tit species in dominance-structured associations.",,"Lens, L (corresponding author), UNIV INSTELLING ANTWERP,DEPT BIOL,UNIV PL 1,B-2610 WILRIJK,BELGIUM.",,,"Lens, Luc/0000-0002-0241-2215",,,,45,16,16,0,4,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0908-8857,,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

We predicted that resource use by foxes and skunks would differ along one or more niche dimensions, and that both species would have broader niches or higher densities compared with mainland relatives. Island foxes and island spotted skunks differed to some extent in habitat use, diets, and circadian activity, which may account for their long-term coexistence. Nonetheless, substantial overlap between skunks and foxes in spatial, dietary, and temporal dimensions suggests that competition between the two species does occur. Moreover, competition may be asymmetric, affecting skunks more than foxes. Compared with mainland foxes, island foxes have smaller body size, smaller home range, increased population density, increased diurnal activity, and behavior that is more highly inquisitive and less flight-prone - all common features of insular faunas. Island skunks, however, apparently have not developed these changes, perhaps due to asymmetric competition with foxes in conjunction with severe ecosystem disturbances caused by feral sheep.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT WILDLIFE FISH & CONSERVAT BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616",,,,,,,,58,50,50,4,25,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,1995,104,3,,,,,301,307,,10.1007/BF00328365,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TE433,WOS:A1995TE43300006,28307586,,,,2021-09-21,

The model assumes that patches only vary with respect to host species present and encounter rates of parasitoids and hosts. It predicts that L. heterotoma should visit patches consisting of decaying stinkhorn mushrooms. This prediction is insensitive to values of model parameters and assumptions. However, field data show that L. heterotoma females rarely visit stinkhorn patches. This leads us to consider predation risk and interspecific competition on all patch types in the field. Predation was never observed, and generalist predators did not prey on our parasitoids. We hypothesise that L. heterotoma females avoid visiting stinkhorn patches because another. closely related, parasitoid species (Leptopilina clavipes) is often present on these patches. Subsequent experiments shaw that L. heterotoma females can recognise odours emanating From patches where adult L. clavipes females are present, and that they avoid visiting these patches. We show that L. clavipes is the superior competitor. Hence. by refraining to visit patches with L. clavipes, L. heterotoma females avoid strong interspecific competition. When interspecific competition is included in the model, predictions closely match field observations, indicating that avoidance of competition is an important factor for patch selection by L. heterotoma.","LEIDEN UNIV, INST EVOLUT & ECOL SCI, LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","JANSSEN, A (corresponding author), UNIV AMSTERDAM, DEPT PURE & APPL ECOL, KRUISLAAN 320, 1098 SM AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.",,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,48,52,53,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1995,73,3,,,,,356,366,,10.2307/3545959,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TA648,WOS:A1995TA64800007,,,,,2021-09-21,

The question becomes more complex when competition occurs between size-structured populations of predators in which the nature of the interaction extends beyond exploitative competition. I conducted a field experiment examining the interactions between fingerling brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis (total length 78-101 mm), and larval spring salamanders, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (snout-vent length 35.7-62.4 mm), in an array of replicate experimental streams. Brook trout affected both the growth and survival of larval spring salamanders, reducing survival by 50% and growth by > 90% for mass and 44% for SVL. Brook trout also altered the habitat use of larval G. porphyriticus. G. porphyriticus had no effect on any of the responses of fingerling S. fontinalis. These results parallel those found in an earlier experiment on interactions between small adult brook trout and larval spring salamanders. Interactions between size-structured populations of G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis are characterized by strong asymmetry in favor of S. fontinalis across a wide range of relative body sizes. This calls into question the mechanisms allowing continued coexistence of G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis, and in general, the persistence of stream salamanders with predatory fish. Persistence is likely a complex function of the interactions between the life history and local demography of both G. porphyriticus and S. fontinalis, coupled with characteristics of the local environment, rather than the result of classic mechanisms of species coexistence such as niche divergence or alpha selection. Such complex mechanisms of species coexistence are likely more common in situations involving competition between size-structured populations than single factor explanations based on models of exploitative competition between competitors of fixed body sizes and life stages.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,,,,,,72,47,48,0,21,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,1995,73,2,,,,,188,198,,10.2307/3545907,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH162,WOS:A1995RH16200006,,,,,2021-09-21,

A general natural pattern forms the basis of the model: organisms which are most similar compete, those which are less similar may enter into a predator-prey relationship, and those which are most different may be mutualistic. In this model, contrary to some previously published studies, increasing the number of species increased stability of community matrices. The rate of change in phenotype was varied to assess the response of community characteristics. At the highest rate of random phenotypic change there were the most species; the minimum number of species was found at intermediate rates of change. The models were run in the absence of predation, competition, or mutualism. The absence of mutualism led to more extinction. The absence of competition caused communities to quickly reach a population ceiling.

This species has male-dominated haremic groups. Time partitioning could not be measured exactly. Instead, the numbers of intra- and interspecific interactions, foraging, resting, swimming, and maintenance behaviors of each sex were measured during the observation periods. The proportion of acts in each category out of the total number of acts, termed effort, was used in comparisons. Males were predicted to devote more effort toward intra- and interspecific interactions compared to females and to maximize reproductive success. Females were predicted to devote more effort towards foraging, compared to males. This behavior maximizes reproductive effort. Both were predicted to engage in greater intra- and interspecific interactions during the pre-courtship period, corresponding both to the approaching time of courtship and to increases in the numbers of potential spatial and trophic competitors. Intra- and interspecific interactions of both males and females were greater during the pre-courtship period. Differences in all classes of behavior between sexes were only weakly significant for two, however. Males had greater effort in intra- and interspecific interactions. Females had greater effort only in maintenance behavior. Both differences were evident only during the pre-courtship period. Foraging behavior by both sexes was virtually absent during daylight and pre-courtship periods. Fish sought shelter and were not incidentally observed foraging after dusk, suggesting that thin species actively forages later at night or during early morning hours, just prior to and during sunrise.","KYUSHU UNIV,FAC AGR,DEPT FISHERIES,HIGASHI KU,FUKUOKA 812,JAPAN",,,,,,,,23,8,9,1,6,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive relationships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously identified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these ''classic'' types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference competition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed ''apparent predation'' and ''indirect defense'' were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35%) and apparent competition (25%) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8%) was least common in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect effects accounted for approximate to 40% of the change in community structure resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24-61%. The proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with web species richness, indicating that strong direct interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level of alteration of community structure regardless of the lever of web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias toward manipulation of consumers over manipulation of basal species, some predator-initiated indirect effect types were scarce while some basal species-initiated types were common. While the frequency of exploitation competition may have been underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this effect should have been detected in many of the studies and reported: and the most intensively studied individual webs did not report frequencies differing much from the average. This analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of theory.",,"MENGE, BA (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA.",,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012",,,,,146,576,595,2,279,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Comparisons of observed versus predicted weekly growth increments over the entire 9-year study (1982 and 1985-1992) yielded r = 0.789 (N = 77; P < 0.01) for age-1 fish and r = 0.522 (N = 70; P < 0.01) for age-2 fish. Based on daily comparisons of observed versus predicted mean fork length, the model was able to predict growth in 1991 and 1992 with mean squared errors (MSE) of 3.0 and 1.8 mm for age-1 fish and 6.5 and 21.2 mm for age-2 fish. Results were similar to those previously described for 1982 and 1985-1989. The model failed noticeably in 1990 for age-1 fish (MSE = 48.6), and model fit for age-2 fish (MSE = 29.9) was the poorest of the 9 years examined. Poor model fit for both year-classes in 1990 was attributed to a divergence of observed from predicted growth; observed growth began lagging predicted growth about the third week of July. By the end of August, predicted mean length exceeded observed length by 13.6 mm for age-1 fish and 12.8 mm for age-2 fish. Data suggest that the divergence in growth began at the time of a massive immigration of least ciscoes C. sardinella into the delta. We speculate that the presence of least ciscoes may have overtaxed the trophic carrying capacity of the delta, thereby curtailing the growth of young broad whitefish.","LGL LTD,SIDNEY,BC V8L 3Y8,CANADA; LGL ALASKA RES ASSOCIATES INC,ANCHORAGE,AK 99508","FECHHELM, RG (corresponding author), LGL ECOL RES ASSOCIATES INC,1410 CAVITT ST,BRYAN,TX 77801, USA.",,,,,,,26,2,2,0,3,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

The major objectives were to describe distributional overlap and evaluate the predatory impact by larval fish. The study was carried out across Dogger Bank in the North Sea, August-September 1991. Sampling transects crossed tidal fronts off the Bank and plankton at all trophic levels showed peak abundance within frontal zones. Also vertically there was a significant overlap in distributional patterns of the plankton. Seven species of fish larvae were abundant, of these sprat (Sprattus sprattus) dominated. The abundance of one group of fish larvae peaked in the shallow water close to the Bank, whereas other species, including sprat, were found in deeper water. Prey preference and predation pressure of fish larvae were assessed using information on prey sizes and growth rates of larvae and the copepod prey. We estimated larval removal of preferred prey sizes to 3-4% day(-1), counterbalanced by a 3-7% day(-1) replenishment from copepod production and growth. Additional predation pressure on copepods by an invertebrate predator was estimated to 1-3% day(-1). In conclusion, the dynamics of fish larvae and other zooplankters were closely linked. At peak abundances of fish larvae (>35 mg dry weight m(-2)), the accumulated predation on specific size ranges of copepods, exerted by larvae and other predators, could exceed the ability of copepod replenishment and intra-/interspecific competition among predators might take place.","NATL ENVIRONM RES INST,DEPT MARINE ECOL & MICROBIOL,DK-4000 ROSKILDE,DENMARK","MUNK, P (corresponding author), DANISH INST FISHERIES & MARINE RES,CHARLOTTENLUND CASTLE,DK-2920 CHARLOTTENLUND,DENMARK.",,,"Nielsen, Torkel Gissel/0000-0003-1057-158X; Munk, Peter/0000-0002-0968-6083",,,,38,41,42,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0142-7873,,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

B.S.P.) plantations and predicting losses in tree growth as measured by the relative growth rate (RGR). The severity of the competing vegetation (expressed in terms of density and height) around 300 planted tree seedlings, and the growth status of the seedlings (expressed in terms df total height and current height growth increment), were analyzed simultaneously with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), with one level of light quantity (photosynthetically active radiation) reaching the upper one-half of the tree seedlings as the predictor variable. This study showed that it is possible to establish a competitive status based on light interception, thus allowing a grouping of seedlings with similar growth characteristics and severity of competition. Canonical analysis showed that 60% of full sunlight reaching the upper one half of spruce seedlings can be defined as a threshold to significantly discriminate between stressed and unstressed tree seedlings, based on the above-mentioned variables and also based on spruce basal stem diameter. For spruce total height, current height increment, and basal stem diameter, significant differences were found between plots above and below this threshold, averaging 18.5, 44.7, and 23.2%, respectively. Measuring the intensity of light reaching the upper one half of the spruce seedlings also significantly explains spruce relative growth rates, expressed in terms of height growth increment and basal stem diameter growth increment over the following two growing seasons. The light threshold used in the MANOVA and the ANOVA showed significant differences between plots above and below the threshold, averaging 70 and 58% for spruce height and basal stem diameter RGRs, respectively. Instead of measuring competing vegetation variables and relative height of a crop species to infer light interception, this study demonstrated that a direct measure of light attenuation at the tree seedling level can be used to assess the competitive status and predict losses in tree growth for the period of time required by the seedlings to emerge from the Vegetation cover. Moreover, this study demonstrated that canonical relations, rather than linear relations, explain the pattern of competition for light between young spruce seedlings and brushlike vegetation. The light threshold suggested in this study has potential for assessing interspecific competition problems in young black spruce plantations and is proposed as a tool to support a containment strategy of vegetation management.","UNIV LAVAL,FAC FORESTERIE & GEOMAT,CTR RECH BIOL FORESTIERE,QUEBEC CITY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA","JOBIDON, R (corresponding author), MINIST RESSOURCES NAT QUEBEC,DIRECT RECH FORETS,2700 RUE EINSTEIN,ST FOY,PQ G1P 3W8,CANADA.",,,,,,,25,31,31,0,7,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We observed interspecific aggression much more frequently than intraspecific aggression. Although aggression by Yellow Warblers was directed at a minimum of 37 species, resident and migrant alike, attacks on Magnolia Warblers (Dendroica magnolia) comprised 35% of the total observed. We found that individual Magnolia Warblers use overlapping home ranges where one warbler tends to be the predominant occupant of a single Yellow Warbler territory. Overlap between neighbors was promoted by the aggressive chasing of Yellow Warblers. Arthropos were twice as abundant in the canopy as in understory shrubs. Exclosure experiments showed that birds harvested approximately 80% of the arthropods available in the canopy and 50% of those available in the understory vegetation. Yellow Warbler defense may be responsible for this difference in density in foliage arthropods between the canopy and understory. To avoid aggression, subordinate species depended on the presence of refugia, comprised of dense understory vegetation. Maintaining the structural heterogeneity of arroyo vegetation may provide critical habitat for many species of migratory birds in cattle pastures. Taken together, the interspecific aggression, intraspecific territoriality, and high rates of resource depletion indicate that competition plays an important role in determining the carrying capacity of second-growth remnants for migratory birds and their use of habitats.","UNIV MICHOACANA SAN NICOLAS HIDALGO, MORELIA, MICHOACAN, MEXICO","GREENBERG, R (corresponding author), NATL ZOOL PK, SMITHSONIAN MIGRATORY BIRD CTR, WASHINGTON, DC 20008 USA.",,,,,,,38,30,30,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,JUL,1994,111,3,,,,,672,682,,,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,PM425,WOS:A1994PM42500017,,,,,2021-09-21,

They can arise in two general ways: through linked chains of direct interactions, and when a species changes the interactions among species. Indirect effects have been uncovered largely by experimental studies that have monitored the response of many species and discovered ''unexpected results,'' although some studies have looked for specific indirect effects predicted from simple models. The characteristics of such approaches make it likely that the many indirect effects remain uncovered, but the application of techniques such as path analysis may reduce this problem. Deterministic theory indicates that indirect effects should often be important, although stochastic models need exploration. Simulation models indicate that some indirect effects may stabilize multi-species assemblages. Five simple types of indirect effects have been regularly demonstrated in nature: exploitative competition, trophic cascades, apparent competition, indirect mutualism, and interaction modifications. Detailed experimental investigations of natural communities have yielded complicated effects. Indirect effects have the potential to affect evolutionary patterns, but empirical examples are limited. Future directions in the study of indirect effects include developing techniques to estimate interaction strength in dynamic models, deriving more efficient approaches to detecting indirect effects, evaluating the effectiveness of approaches such as path analysis, and investigating mechanisms in which a species changes how other species interact.",,"WOOTTON, JT (corresponding author), UNIV CHICAGO,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT,1101 E 57TH ST,CHICAGO,IL 60637, USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012; Wootton, J.

These indices can be useful in assessing the desirability of vegetation control and stand thinnings, and in simulating stand development. Static competition indices, however, have fundamental limitations which should be more widely considered. Competition is usually a constraint to growth, not a determinant of growth, so any measurement of competition alone is fundamentally limited in its ability to predict individual crop tree performance. Differences in the microsite effects of competitors and the autecological responses of crop species result in wide variation in the size of the functional competitive arena, and suggest the need for distinct weightings of competitive intensity for different combinations of species and site. Site differences and weather variation, when coupled with species differences in above- and below-ground allocation, will alter the mode and intensity of competition within a stand and from year to year. The phenology of competitors and focal species will likewise alter interference patterns within a year, making one-time measurements sometimes misleading. Suggested alternatives for determining the importance and intensity of competition include the maintenance of competition-free seedlings (''phytometers'') in order to gauge the competitive constraints experienced elsewhere in a plantation. Simulation models of tree growth and stand development also show promise, but they must incorporate the dynamics of noncrop vegetation development. In developing guidelines for the assessment of noncrop interference and the advisability of vegetation control, there is still a need to determine, in a generalizable manner, appropriate survey plot sizes and critical competition thresholds for different combinations of site type, crop species, and vegetation complex.",,"BURTON, P (corresponding author), UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,DEPT FOREST SCI,VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4,BC,CANADA.",,"Burton, Philip J./X-5808-2019","Burton, Philip J./0000-0002-5956-2716",,,,99,97,100,0,9,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

It seems that a group model of life without hierarchic relations is appropriate for this species. In mixed groups, FF dominated over AA. Over the course of time, the stabilization of interspecific relations and decrease of interspecific conflicts were observed.

Some of their phytoseiid predators, however, show the reverse pattern. We test the hypothesis that this different seasonal phenology can be attributed to distinct saturation deficit tolerance spectra. Eggs of various species c.q. strains of phytoseiids, originating from different climate zones, were screened for their tolerance to a range of saturation deficits and compared with the tolerance spectrum of tetranychid species collected from cassava. In total 19 species/strains of predatory mites were compared with six tetranychid species. The response curves for all predators were sigmoidal with a narrow and specific region of saturation deficits where egg hatch success fell from 100% to 0%. Using probit analysis this region was characterized by the SD50, the saturation deficit at which only 50% of the eggs hatch. The response curves for the herbivores were trapezoid. In contrast to the phytoseiids the latter do not differ in the range of saturation deficits tolerated, but in the magnitude of the response. It appeared that inter-strain differences in the Phytoseiidae are sometimes larger than interspecific differences. We demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between population-specific SD50-values and long term average relative humidity in the collection site. The implications of this finding are discussed in terms of condition specific competition.","CTR INT AGR TROP,CALI,COLOMBIA","BAKKER, FM (corresponding author), UNIV AMSTERDAM,DEPT PURE & APPL ECOL,POPULAT BIOL SECT,KRUISLAAN 302,1098 SM AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.",,"Bakker, F.M./AAF-5380-2019","Bakker, F.M./0000-0002-1447-3285",,,,0,50,52,0,8,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

In central Oklahoma, two species of predaceous, pit-building ant lion larvae (Myrmeleon immaculatus and M. crudelis) coexist in a narrow, high-density (> 50 animals/m2) zone at the base of sandstone cliffs, where they are sheltered from rain and afternoon sun. Although larval movement is frequent and abundance within the zone varies seasonally, ant lions are rarely found > 2 m from the cliff base. I used field experiments and observations to test four hypotheses that could explain the maintenance of the ant lion zone: (1) zonation because of habitat availability; (2) zonation because of food availability; (3) zonation because of increased surface temperatures in exposed microhabitats; (4) zonation because of increased soil moisture and disturbance in exposed microhabitats. Ant lions are probably not limited to the cliffbase by the presence of rocks or vegetation, because there was no correlation between ant lion density and available habitat. The availability of prey also does not appear to limit ant lion distribution: ant abundance in pitfall traps was significantly higher outside the ant lion zone than within. Outside the ant lion zone, soil surface temperatures reach lethal levels in the afternoon sun. However, third-instar larvae of M. immaculatus transplanted in dry, sifted soil suffered little mortality over a 4-d period. Larvae transplanted into exposed sites gained significantly more mass than larvae transplanted into the ant lion zone, probably because of differences in food availability. Small-scale manipulations within the ant lion zone revealed that ant lion numbers decreased significantly over a 5-d period in response to both moisture (misting) and disturbance (pit-filling). In a recolonization experiment, the recovery time of patches exposed to a single ''rainfall'' treatment was extremely long: defaunated ''rainfall'' patches did not achieve the pit densities of defaunated control patches until after 84 d. Rainfall limits ant lion distribution through an interaction with temperature. Transplant experiments on natural substrata revealed the nature of this interaction. Within the ant lion zone, the soil remains dry and ant lion larvae bury themselves more rapidly in the sun than in the shade. Outside the ant lion zone, rainfall leads to the formation of a persistent soil crust. Larvae are unable to penetrate this crust, and they succumb to high temperatures in the sun. Because both species of ant lions are restricted to a narrow spatial zone, the probability of interspecific and intraspecific interactions (including competition, predation, and cannibalism) is increased. Such interactions may affect the density of both species within the ant lion zone. The abundances of M. crudelis and M. immaculatus were negatively correlated in quadrats from the center of the ant lion zone. Across the ant lion zone, the relative abundance of the two species also differed significantly, although the differences were not consistent among sites. Because of overriding abiotic constraints, neither species can achieve an ideal free distribution with respect to food resources. High-density predator aggregations may also affect prey community structure. Arthropod abundance was low within the ant lion zone, perhaps because of direct predation by ant lions or predator avoidance behavior by prey. Although the ant lion zone is caused by the interaction of abiotic factors, high-density predator aggregations have important biotic consequences for the population dynamics of the predators and the spatial distribution of their prey.","UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA",,,,,,,,48,84,88,0,29,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,226,237,,10.2307/1939517,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500023,,,,,2021-09-21,

Yet, the recruitment process may be extremely important, especially for space-limited communities. Here, we are specifically concerned with how the interspecific interactions involved in recruitment of nonbreeding floaters to breeding adults will influence the ecological stability of the populations' densities and the longer-term persistence stability of the competing species. The conclusions we draw are only applicable to communities for which there are ecologically stable equilibria. We formulate and compare three deterministic models that differ only in the way nonbreeding floaters and breeding adults of each species influence recruitment of floaters into the breeding population. The simplest of these models is the Density Independent Recruitment (DIR) model, in which floaters are recruited into the breeding subpopulations of each species at a constant rate. In the Adult Dependent Recruitment (ADR) model, recruitment of floaters is dependent on the density of adults of both species. When adult density is high (near carrying capacity) recruitment is reduced. Finally, in the Community Dependent Recruitment (CDR) model, all components (floaters and adults of both species) of the community influence recruitment. The CDR model incorporates the effect of adults in the same way as the ADR model. Additionally, recruitment of floaters also depends on the relative frequencies of floaters of each species in the total floater subpopulation. If the pool of available floaters is predominantly of one species, that species enjoys a higher rate of recruitment than its competitor. We used mathematical analyses to determine the time to return to equilibrium after a perturbation and to define the relative sizes of parameter sets that allow stable coexistence. Our findings suggest that if recruitment is dependent on the relative frequencies of competing floaters (CDR model), the community is more likely to exhibit density variation over ecological time relative to communities without such frequency dependence (DIR and ADR models). This frequency dependence also severely restricts the range of demographic parameters compatible with coexistence, thus making coexistence over evolutionary time less likely,","UNIV OSLO, DEPT BIOL, DIV ZOOL, N-0316 OSLO 3, NORWAY","DANIELSON, BJ (corresponding author), IOWA STATE UNIV SCI & TECHNOL, DEPT ANIM ECOL, AMES, IA 50011 USA.",,"Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016","Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399",,,,62,4,4,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1992,65,1,,,,,34,44,,10.2307/3544885,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JH676,WOS:A1992JH67600005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Cluster-analyses of vertical distribution information and diet characteristics revealed that while large groups of species overlapped (> 60%) in either vertical distributions or diet, when both niche parameters were considered together, little interspecific or intraspecific (size class) overlap occurred. Our data suggest that for myctophids, trophic competition is reduced through resource-partitioning, although with considerable overlap at niche boundaries. Niche separation presumably is the result of competition during the evolution of the ecosystem and is maintained presently as diffuse competition: the effect on a species of the combined competition from all other species at that trophic level. We suggest that the large degree of niche overlap enables the packing of over 50 myctophid species in the epipelagic zone at night. Our calculations indicate that myctophid predation nightly removes 2% of the zooplankton biomass. Myctophid predation is selective in that greatest pressure is on certain size classes and types of prey (copepods, ostracods and euphausiids). In the case of copepods, impact is greatest on the larger, more mature stages and hence on the breeding population. It is estimated that myctophids account for at least one-third of the daily production of zooplankton removed from the epipelagic zone by micronekton in the eastern Gulf.","FLORIDA MARINE RES INST,DEPT NAT RESOURCES,ST PETERSBURG,FL 33701","HOPKINS, TL (corresponding author), UNIV S FLORIDA,DEPT MARINE SCI,140 7TH AVE S,ST PETERSBURG,FL 33701, USA.",,,,,,,62,98,101,0,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Male G. pulex from a pure population and from mixed G. pulex IG. duebeni populations were given a choice between G. pulex and G. duebeni females. Males discriminate between conspecific and congeneric females during grabbing and holding of the females, and this behaviour increases in frequency towards G. duebeni females the closer those females are to moulting. Male G. pulex with no prior experience of congenerics appear to require a more thorough period of assessment in order to determine species. However, G. pulex males rarely enter interspecific precopula guarding and appear not to copulate with G. duebeni females, thus avoiding the deleterious effects this would have on both male and female fitness. We conclude that, with G. pulex, proximate mechanisms of species discrimination preclude interspecific pairing and mating, which cannot therefore bc invoked to explain the superior competitive ability of this species over G. duebeni. The results are discussed in terms of the general applicability of the sterile interspecific mating hypothesis to explain patterns of coexistence, exclusion, habitat choice and displaced breeding periods among Gammarus species.

Two lines of evidence (spatial patterning of trees and correlates of tree performance with neighbourhood density) were used to infer the importance of competition, (2) Intraspecific competition among D. dacrydioides trees appeared to be intense. Mean radial growth rate (MGR) was significantly negatively correlated with the number of conspecific neighbours, and patterns of non-random mortality resulted in a shift in spatial pattern from a significantly clumped to a significantly regular distribution. In contrast, intraspecific competition among D. cupressinum was less intense. D. cupressinum had a low rate of mortality, predominantly random spatial patterns of mortality. and a weak correlation between MGR and the number of conspecific neighbours. (3) Differences in the relative importance of intraspecific competition in affecting survival and growth of the two species was attributed to differences in the distribution and availability of suitable establishment sites. D. dacrydioides preferentially established on abundant level or slightly elevated sites, and in patches reached densities where resources were limiting. In contrast, the number and distribution of D. cupressinum were determined primarily by the availability of suitable elevated establishment sites that were scattered throughout the stand. The resticted number of suitable sites limited D. cupressinum to densities where resources were not severely limiting. (4) There was no evidence of interspecific competiton.

I suggest that in real systems it may be difficult to discriminate the relative contributions of parasitism and intraspecific competition to the limitation of host populations.","UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL,CTR POPULAT BIOL,ASCOT SL5 7PY,BERKS,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,31,17,17,1,10,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1991,61,3,,,,,297,306,,10.2307/3545237,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ477,WOS:A1991GJ47700003,,,,,2021-09-21,

The diets of perch and ruffe in relation to food resources were quantified over a 5-mo period in one lake of moderate and one lake of high productivity. The abundance of perch decreased and that of ruffe increased along the productivity gradient. Large perch ate fish over the whole season in the more productive lake, but rarely ate fish in May and June in the less productive lake. All size classes of ruffe fed mainly on macrobenthos in both lakes. The diversity of macrobenthos was higher in the lake of low productivity, as was the diet breadth of ruffe. The abundance patterns of perch and ruffe are likely related to the simultaneous effect of increasing prey abundance and decreasing light penetration with increasing productivity. Furthermore, the abundance of perch is likely affected by increasing interspecific competition and that of ruffe by decreasing predation pressure as productivity increases.",,"BERGMAN, E (corresponding author), DEPT ECOL,POB 65,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN.",,"Bergman, Eva/R-8464-2016; Bergman, Eva/AAR-8368-2021","Bergman, Eva/0000-0003-2220-1615; Bergman, Eva/0000-0003-2220-1615",,,,44,60,61,1,16,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

The community was dominated by barnacles and several species of macroalgae. The successional sequence was determined at three different sites by clearing sets of plots in a way that mimicked natural disturbance. Succession at each of these sites followed the same general sequence. A barnacle, Chthamalus dalli, first colonized the plots and was later replaced by a second barnacle, Balanus glandula. The macroalgae Pelvetiopsis limitata, Fucus distichus, and Endocladia muricata colonized the plots only after Balanus was established. While the order of species arrival and departure was consistent, the rate of succession varied greatly among sites. The sequence of community development that was observed at one site over a 36-mo period occurred in < 12 mo in a nearby area. Differences in the rate of succession appeared to result from variation in the timing of successful Balanus recruitment. The mechanisms of succession were investigated in a series of field experiments. An experiment with Balanus-removal, Chthamalus-removal, and control plots was used to assess the interactions between barnacles. A direct interaction, competition for space with Balanus, caused Chthamalus to decrease in abundance as succession proceeded. Chthamalus did not affect the establishment of Balanus. Successful Balanus recruitment depended on occasional periods of larval settlement followed by periods of favorable weather. At all three sites, algal colonization was dependent on the presence of barnacles. Balanus greatly facilitated algal colonization, while Chthamalus only weakly facilitated algal colonization. Facilitation of algal colonization by epoxy-filled barnacle tests indicated that facilitation resulted from barnacle tests altering the substrate, rather than the activities of the living animals. A factorial experiment involving manipulations of barnacle and consumer (limpet) abundances demonstrated that the facilitation of algae by barnacles is an indirect interaction that is mediated by limpets. Barnacles decreased limpet foraging activity and thereby increased algal abundance. Succession in this community is complicated by several processes that are not included in traditional views of succession. (1) Not all early successional species have the same effect on the establishment of later successional species. This results in spatial variation in the rate of succession. (2) The model of succession is different in each step in the successional sequence. The Chthamalus-Balanus interaction is an example of the tolerance model, while the barnacle-algae interaction is an example of the facilitation model. (3) Both direct and indirect interactions between species determine the course of succession. The results of this study support a general model that predicts the effect of consumers on the rate of succession. Consumers slowed succession in this community in two ways. First, limpets delayed the establishment of Balanus and the competitive exclusion of Chthamalus. Second, limpets delayed the establishment of macroalgae. Previous studies in marine and terrestrial habitats have found that consumers may slow, accelerate, or have no effect on the rate of succession and these observations are consistent with the predictions of this general model.","OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,CORVALLIS,OR 97331",,,"Langerhans, R.

J,"SCUDO, FM",,,,"SCUDO, FM",,,ON COMPETITION AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE - A CRITIQUE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF DARWINIAN-VOLTERRIAN THEORIES,RIVISTA DI BIOLOGIA-BIOLOGY FORUM,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Competition is considered here mostly in terms of biocoenotics, emphasizing Volterra's analysis that contrasts the dynamics of dissipative interspecific association - i.e. in which both intra- and inter-specific competition are present - with the conservative limit case in which both are totally absent. Biocoenotic processes would tend to this limit were it not that any association is bound to collapse much before approaching it, also because drastic rearrangements of the interactions would necessarily occur at some point in this process. From the outset this tradition was closely associated to theories such as Schiapparelli's, viewing evolution as an essentially <<regulated>>, discrete or discontinuous process, dealt with quantitatively by <<translating>> functional morphology and its changes into <<topological>> parameters. Till recently these approaches were hampered by serious technical difficulties - i.e. Schiapparelli-like approaches were hardly applicable before Thom's extensions and axiomatization, the strong non-linearity of biocoenotic dynamics was poorly understood also topology-wise, and both approaches faced serious problems of <<measurability>> by dealing with continuous variables that do not admit additive representations. These bodies of theory concour with the genetic-selectionist theories such as by Wright and Schmalbausen, particulary on points such as the maintenance of morphogenetic <<norms>> or <<standards>> and on the essential role of inter-population selection, operating on differences mostly due to internal genomic drives and random drift, in critical phases of transformations. The latter tradition heavily relies on reasoning in terms of constant fitness differences among phenotypes within population - i.e. an excellent approximation to most genetic-selectionist problems within species that are close to steady state demographic conditions, though it can be utterly misleading in other situations. Modern biocoenotic theories are discussed by contrasting their predictions with those of alternative theoretical bodies, that might be characterized by being constructed so as to avoid the technical difficulties previously encountered by Schiapparelli-Volterra-like theories, and by not even considering the main tenets of the Wright-Schmalbausen theories. Such bodies consist of a close <<social>> association between two traditions - the <<modern synthesis>> and the <<niche>> approach to competitive exclusion - that are mutually exclusive logically, each being also logically self-contradictory. Thus Hutchinsons-Mc Arthur-Levins <<niche>> approach is essentially based on a failure to distinguish between ephemeral assemblages brought about by any accidental process and stable associations brought about by long co-evolution, and on disregarding the major qualitative differences between real dissipative systems and their ideal, conservative limits. As a result, any patter of interspecific interactions is justified mostly in terms of competition both as proximal and ultimate causative agent and, at the same time, through a <<competitive exclusion>> - e.g. there cannot be more <<consumer>> than <<producer>> species - that only appears to hold true in some sense for competition-free, <<conservative>> systems. On the other hand the Fisher-Mayr <<synthetic>> tradition is based on considering just fitness differences - usually in terms such as to result in an intrinsecally <<conservative>>, or competition-free approach - as the only legitimate theory, alternative to the struggle for existence. In this approach morphogenetic processes are effectively disregarded by not accepting the conditions of life as one of their main, proximal causative agents, and artificially rendering them highly <<degenerate>> with respect to natural selection by projecting them onto a fitness line. A still more basic difference between Darwinian and <<synthetic>> traditions concerns what is meant be species. <<Syntheticists>> regard specific differences as being primarily or solely genotypic, connected with failure to cross-breed and - except when associated to differences in ploidy - almost necessarly arising from a major round of drift in a single, <<bottleneck>> population. According to Darwinian theories, instead, speciation is most unlikely to take place in such a way and, if it were, most unlikely to result in long-surviving lineages. For Darwinian theorists, species has some precise meaning - in terms of morpho-functional distinctiveness and population dynamical distinctiveness - only within suitably restricted taxa and ecological conditions, and if associated to substantial genotypic differentiation (very different levels of it, depending on mechanisms of divergence characteristic of taxa, while population dynamical units that are not appreciably differentiated genotypically are denoted by different, special terms).",,"SCUDO, FM (corresponding author), CNR,IST GENET BIOCHIM & EVOLUZ,VIA ABBIATEGRASSO 207,I-27100 PAVIA,ITALY.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,0,UNIV PERUGIA,PERUGIA,"C P 317, 06100 PERUGIA, ITALY",0035-6050,,,RIV BIOL-BIOL FORUM,Riv.

Most evidences of competition are from controlled indoor trials with few species, and it remains a challenge to estimate competition among multiple species in the field. Here, we analyze stable isotopes and distributional data from 51 fish taxa in six locations in the southwestern Atlantic to predict intraspecific trophic pressure (ITP) and the potential competitive strength among species in a trophic-based framework. We used two proxies built upon 2-dimensional isotopic space (813C vs. 815N), its predicted overlap, and fish density to calculate winner and loser taxa in potential paired interspecific competitive interactions. The intraspecific proxy indicated that cryptobenthic fishes are under high among-individual trophic pressure (high densities and small niche sizes). Also, cryptobenthic behavior together with feeding specialization and extremely small-sizes were the most important traits related to low success in interspecific simulations. Although cryptobenthic fishes face strong competitive pressures, there are some known inherent trade-offs to cryptobenthic life such as trophic and habitat use specializations. These seem to compensate and ensure coexistence among cryptobenthic fishes and non-cryptobenthic species. Habitat loss/degradation via urbanization, invasive species and climate-change-driven sea-level rise can reduce the suitability of habitat and increase competition on cryptobenthic species, especially in shallow reefs and intertidal shores.","[Andrades, Ryan; Joyeux, Jean-Christophe; Macieira, Raphael M.] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, CCHN, Dept Oceanog & Ecol, Lab Ictiol, Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Andrades, Ryan; Jackson, Andrew L.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin, Ireland; [Andrades, Ryan; Reis-Filho, Jose Amorim; Giarrizzo, Tommaso] Univ Fed Para, Nucleo Ecol Aquat & Pesca Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Godoy, Bruno Spacek] Univ Fed Para, Inst Amazon Agr Familiares INEAF, Belem, Para, Brazil","Andrades, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, CCHN, Dept Oceanog & Ecol, Lab Ictiol, Vitoria, ES, Brazil.; Andrades, R (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin, Ireland.; Andrades, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Para, Nucleo Ecol Aquat & Pesca Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil.",ryanandrades@gmail.com,"Andrades, Ryan/AAU-2078-2021; Macieira, Raphael/G-2808-2011","Andrades, Ryan/0000-0003-2418-1072; Macieira, Raphael/0000-0002-8871-8724","Espirito Santo State Research and Innovation Foundation (FAPES) [67504876]; Trindade Island Research Program [CNPq 405426/2012-7]; CAPES-DSCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CAPES-PDSECoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88881.132520/2016-01]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001]; FAPESFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Espiritu Santo (FAPES) [67504876, 007/2014]; CNPQConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [441243/2016-9]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [311078/2019-2, 304274/2016-0]","This project was funded by the Espirito Santo State Research and Innovation Foundation (FAPES, 67504876) and Trindade Island Research Program (CNPq 405426/2012-7).

In order to conserve these threatened species, various conservation interventions and strategies are adopted, among which is re-introduction of captive stocks of species into the wild habitats where they vanished from. Captive breeding is one of the promising tools for endangered species preservation. Providing social enrichment to the captive stocks is an important step in the management, in particular for stocks, which are aimed for re-introduction. The subject species of this study, i.e., Punjab urial (Ovis vignei punjabiensis) and Indian gazelle (Gazella bennettii) are being reared in captivity with the aim of re-introduction. As there is scarcity of information regarding the behavioral aspects of captive species, especially ungulates, this study aimed at understanding the dynamics of their interactions. The current study reported that Punjab urial, being the dominant species, exerts itself on the submissive and subordinate species, the Indian gazelle. This negative interference can possibly lead to negative ramifications in the form of stress and injuries in the short term, while negative effects on population growth in the long term. Thus, this study recommends separate rearing of these species to eliminate the hazardous competition between them. Natural wildlife habitats are regularly subjected to anthropogenic pressures for different purposes, which are heading the biodiversity towards drastic decline. Several endangered wild species are raised in captivity with the aim of re-introduction. In some instances, mixed herds' rearing approach in captivity is adopted for providing social enrichment to captive stocks; however, the impacts of species on each other are least documented. We tested our prediction that keeping mixed herds of captive wild sheep and antelopes provides adequate social enrichment to the captive stocks: if interspecific interactions are balanced. In the current study, we studied the interspecific competition between mixed herds of captive Punjab urial (Ovis vignei punjabiensis) and Indian gazelle (Gazella bennettii) at Manglot Wildlife Park, Nowshera District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan. We documented the negative effects of behavioural interference by Punjab urial on the feeding behaviour of Indian gazelle. The outcome of the current study revealed that Punjab urial are highly intolerant towards Indian gazelle, with high interference during feeding. Out of the total aggressive events, 77% (N = 1259) of events ended up with win/loss, in which Punjab urial dominated the Indian gazelle 3.5 times. Moreover, lopsided dominance by Punjab urial resulted in increased intraspecific competition among Indian gazelle (p < 0.001). Current study divulged Indian gazelle to be the subordinate species, with less intake of food. Instead of providing social enrichment by heterospecifics, the Punjab urial is negatively affecting the Indian gazelle, therefore, the results of our study discourage the practice of admix captive breeding for wild sheep and antelopes.","[Khattak, Romaan Hayat; Teng, Liwei; Zhang, Zhirong; Liu, Zhensheng] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Mehmood, Tahir] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Nat Sci SNS, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Rehman, Ejaz Ur] Snow Leopard Trust, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan","Teng, LW; Liu, ZS (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",romaanhayatkhattak@nefu.edu.cn; tenglw1975@163.com; tahime@gmail.com; ejazrehman53@gmail.com; zhang_zr@126.com; zhenshengliu@163.com,,"Khattak, Romaan Hayat/0000-0002-8047-1835","National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31870512]; fundamental research funds for the central universitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572014CA03]; Heilongjiang Touyan innovation team program for forest ecology and conservation, Ningxia Helan Mountains National Nature Reserve","This study was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (31870512), and the fundamental research funds for the central universities (2572014CA03).

Carcasses of different sizes were monitored in two study areas of South Africa: one with both lions and hyaenas and the other with hyaenas only. We found evidence of both symmetric exploitative competition and asymmetric interference competition. Interactions were strongly conditioned by carcass size, and co-occurrence was mostly recorded at large ungulate carcasses. Interference competition seemed to dominate interspecific interactions, with lions having preferential access. However, interference while feeding did not exert any cost on the subordinate hyaenas, in terms of amount of ingested food and consumption rate, probably thanks to the reward provided by large carcasses in the form of abundant carrion, the use of lions to detect carcasses, and spatiotemporal segregation at the carcass-scale. Securing a diverse carrion supply in terms of carcass size, including megaherbivore carcasses, may favor the coexistence of the largest African carnivores, especially in small protected areas. Overall, our study reveals mechanisms related to both the food resource heterogeneity and the competitor behavior that allow the coexistence of strongly interacting species.","[Amoros, Mar] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Barcelona, Spain; [Gil-Sanchez, Jose M.; Moleon, Marcos] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain; [Moleon, Marcos] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Lopez-Pastor, Beatriz de las N.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Biol Aplicada, Alicante, Spain","Gil-Sanchez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain.",jmgilsanchez@yahoo.es,"Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/AAW-1016-2021; Moleon, Marcos/K-2875-2014","Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria/0000-0002-7052-8332; Moleon, Marcos/0000-0002-3126-619X",Spanish Ministry of Education (Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011); Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R+D+I [SEV-2012-0262]; Ramon y Cajal ProgramSpanish Government [RYC-2015-19231]; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL2017-89905-R]; ERDF funds,"MM was supported by postdoctoral grants from the Spanish Ministry of Education (Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011), the Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R+D+I (SEV-2012-0262) and the Ramon y Cajal Program (RYC-2015-19231).

One important factor driving the degree of interspecific territoriality is competition for resources. Other influential factors are, for instance, population density, phylogenetic relatedness, fighting asymmetries, and shared predation. Although the degree of competition is usually a composite of several factors potentially influencing competition, it is possible to determine the degree of competition without knowing all influential factors and their importance. In line with this, we used the strength of behavioural interactions between species under standardized experimental conditions. In particular, we investigated the degree of interspecific competition using the territorial song of male Eurasian Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) as a low-risk response variable and the crossing flights and nearest approach distance to an intruder as high-risk defence behaviours. To simulate an interspecific intruder, we used male song playbacks of phylogenetic-related and more or less coexisting species. In line with our predictions, we found territorial defence to be most intense against conspecifics (positive control) and virtually non-existent against the allopatric Subalpine Warblers (S. cantillans) (negative control). In terms of the defence reaction to sympatric interspecific intruders, the response seemed strongest in relation to the Garden Warbler (S. borin) and weakest in relation to the Barred Warbler (S. nisoria). Our results further show that the vegetation characteristics of a territory influence behavioural responses to intruders, but only in relation to low-risk defence.","[Darolova, Alzbeta; Kristofik, Jan] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia; [Knauer, Felix] Univ Vet Med, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Savoyenstr 1, A-1160 Vienna, Austria; [Hoi, Herbert] Univ Vet Med, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Savoyenstr 1a, A-1160 Vienna, Austria","Darolova, A (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia.",alzbeta.darolova@savba.sk,,,"Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA)Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA) [2/0097/16]","This study was funded by Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA Grant Nr. 2/0097/16).",,59,3,3,4,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Here we address this question by analyzing patterns of range overlap between related species of birds ('sister pairs') co-occurring on a tropical elevational gradient. We explicitly contrast the behavioral dimension of interspecific competition (interference competition) with similarity in resource acquisition traits (exploitative competition). Specifically, we ask whether elevational range overlap in 118 sister pairs that live along the Manu Transect in southeastern Peru is predicted by proxies for competition (intraspecific territorial behavior) or niche divergence (beak divergence and divergence times, an estimate of evolutionary age). We find that close relatives that defend year-round territories tend to live in non-overlapping elevational distributions, while close relatives that do not defend territories tend to broadly overlap in elevational distribution. In contrast, neither beak divergence nor evolutionary age was associated with patterns of range limitation. We interpret these findings as evidence that behavioral interactions - particularly direct territorial aggression - can be important in setting elevational range limits and preventing coexistence of closely related species, though this depends upon the extent to which intraspecific territorial behavior can be extended to territorial interactions between species. Our results suggest that interference competition can be an important driver of species range limits in diverse assemblages, and thus highlight the importance of considering behavioral dimensions of the niche in macroecological studies.","[Freeman, Benjamin G.; Schluter, Dolph] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Freeman, Benjamin G.; Schluter, Dolph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Tobias, Joseph A.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, London, England","Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Freeman, BG (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",freeman@zoology.ubc.ca,,"Tobias, Joseph/0000-0003-2429-6179; Freeman, Benjamin/0000-0001-6131-6832",,,,60,14,14,3,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,NOV,2019,42,11,,,,,1832,1840,,10.1111/ecog.04606,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JI8UM,WOS:000493738800003,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

Addressing this issue is particularly tractable along elevational gradients in tropical mountains that feature substantial abiotic gradients and rates of species turnover. We examined elevational patterns of avian community structure on 2 mountains in Malaysian Borneo to assess changes in the relative strength of biotic interactions and abiotic constraints. In particular, we used metrics based on (1) phylogenetic relatedness and (2) functional traits associated with both resource acquisition and tolerance of abiotic challenges to identify patterns and causes of elevational differences in community structure. High elevation communities were composed of more phylogenetically and functionally similar species than would be expected by chance. Resource acquisition traits, in particular, were clustered at high elevations, suggesting low resource and habitat diversity were important drivers of those communities. Traits typically associated with tolerance of cold temperatures and low atmospheric pressure showed no elevational patterns. All traits were neutral or overdispersed at low elevations suggesting an absence of strong abiotic filters or an increased influence of interspecific competition. However, relative bill size, which is important for thermoregulation, was larger in low elevation communities, suggesting abiotic factors were also influential there. Regardless of metric, clustered and neutral communities were more frequent than overdispersed communities overall, implying that interspecific competition among close relatives may not be a pervasive driver of elevational distribution and community structure of tropical birds. Overall, our analyses reveal that a diverse set of predominantly biotic factors underlie elevational variation in community structure on tropical mountains.","[Boyce, Andy J.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Shakya, Subir; Sheldon, Frederick H.] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Shakya, Subir; Sheldon, Frederick H.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Moyle, Robert G.] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Moyle, Robert G.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Martin, Thom E.] Univ Montana, US Geol Survey, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Boyce, Andy J.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA","Boyce, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Boyce, AJ (corresponding author), Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA.",andyjboyce@gmail.com,,"Shakya, Subir/0000-0002-3561-2336; Boyce, Andy/0000-0003-3508-6599","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1241041, DEB-1651283, IOS-1656120]; AOU Graduate Student Research Grant; Wesley M.

The recent recovery of the White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla (WTE) population throughout its range indicates the return of the largest predator of the raptor communities there. In this study, we assess the importance of habitat overlap and spatial distribution to the reproduction of the Lesser Spotted Eagle Clanga pomarina (LSE), a species that breeds sympatrically in areas of high WTE density near the Baltic Sea, but is three times smaller than the latter. Fewer water bodies surround the nesting sites of the LSE, and it uses agricultural areas and transitional habitats more frequently than the WTE. The same breeding territories are faithfully occupied by the LSE annually, irrespective of the distance between these and those of the WTE. We found that the breeding success of the LSE was not affected by the proximity or breeding output of the nearest pair of WTEs, nor was this affected by the number of WTE pairs present within a 3-km radius of nests. Our data suggest that the smaller LSE coexists with an abundant top predator without any obvious adverse effects on its population dynamics.","[Dementavicius, Deivis; Vaitkuviene, Daiva; Dagys, Mindaugas; Treinys, Rimgaudas] Nat Res Ctr, Akad St 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dementavicius, Deivis; Rumbutis, Saulius] T Ivanauskas Zool Museum, Laisves Ave 106, LT-44253 Kaunas, Lithuania","Treinys, R (corresponding author), Nat Res Ctr, Akad St 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania.",rimga.t@gmail.com,,"Vaitkuviene, Daiva/0000-0001-6353-3291; Treinys, Rimgaudas/0000-0003-3446-9686",,,,56,3,4,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Predictive models of their distributions are typically correlative rather than mechanistic, and based on only abiotic variables describing putative environmental requirements despite extensive evidence of competitive interactions leading to displacements. Here we review putative roles of competition contributing to distribution changes where the two species meet. The strongest evidence for competitive displacements comes from multiple examples of habitat segregation where the two species co-occur and massive reductions in the range and abundance of A. aegypti attributable to A. albopictus invasions in the southeastern U.S.A. and Bermuda (U.K). We summarize evidence to support the primacy of asymmetric reproductive interference, or satyrization, and larval resource competition, both favoring A. albopictus, as displacement mechanisms. Where evidence of satyrization or interspecific resource competition is weak, differences in local environments or alternative ecologies or behaviors of these Aedes spp. may explain local variation in the outcomes of invasions. Predictive distribution modeling for both these major disease vectors needs to incorporate species interactions between them as an important process that is likely to limit their realized niches and future distributions. Experimental tests of satyrization and resource competition are needed across the broad ranges of these species, as are models that incorporate both reproductive interference and resource competition to evaluate interaction strengths and mechanisms. These vectors exemplify how fundamental principles of community ecology may influence distributions of invasive species.","[Lounibos, L.

The biotic interactions are thus considered to be a possible driver of differential geographical distributions often observed between closely related sexuals and asexuals: a pattern referred to as geographical parthenogenesis (GP). We tested the RQH in Hieracium alpinum L., a vascular plant species exhibiting a striking pattern of GP, by assessing the frequency and intensity with which seed predator specialists occur and the level of interspecific plant-plant competition expressed through both the surrounding vegetation density and the species richness across its distributional range. Furthermore, we tested whether there were negative associations between intra-population genetic diversity, as assessed by amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, and incidences of seed predation. Our results indicate no significant differences in frequency and intensity of seed predation nor in the level of interspecific plant-plant interactions between diploid sexual and triploid asexual populations. Furthermore, there were no consistent latitudinal and/or altitudinal patterns for the assessed parameters. Contrary to our expectations, there were either positive or non-significant associations between genetic diversity and the level of seed predation. To conclude, the RQH cannot thoroughly explain the GP in H. alpinum, and other alternative scenarios should be considered and tested.","[Hartmann, Matthias; Stefanek, Michal; Zdvorak, Pavel; Chrtek, Jindrich; Mraz, Patrik] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic; [Herman, Petr] Krivoklat 190, CZ-27023 Krivoklat, Czech Republic; [Chrtek, Jindrich] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic","Hartmann, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic.",m.hartmann301187@gmail.com,"Mraz, Patrik/I-5965-2016; Mraz, Patrik/ABD-9484-2020; Hartmann, Matthias/A-8142-2018; Hartmann, Matthias/AAL-8753-2021","Mraz, Patrik/0000-0002-1415-070X; Mraz, Patrik/0000-0002-1415-070X; Hartmann, Matthias/0000-0001-9721-0925; Hartmann, Matthias/0000-0001-9721-0925",Czech Science Foundation (GACR)Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-02858S],"We thank V.

This series of aggressive contests between species may result in an interspecific dominance hierarchy. Such hierarchies are of interest because they could be used to address a variety of research questions, for example, do similarly ranked species tend to avoid each other in time or space, and what will happen when such species come into contact as climates change? Here, we propose a method for creating a continental-scale hierarchy, and we make initial analyses based on this hierarchy. Leveraging the existing network of citizen scientists from Project FeederWatch, we collected the data with which to create a continent-spanning interspecific dominance hierarchy that included species that do not currently have overlapping geographic distributions. We quantified the extent of intransitivities (rock-paper-scissors relationships) in the hierarchy, as intransitivities can promote local species' coexistence. Overall, the hierarchy was nearly linear, and largely predicted by body mass, although there were clade-specific deviations from the average mass-dominance relationship. Warblers and orioles, for instance, were more dominant than expected based on their body mass, while buntings, grosbeaks, and doves were less dominant than expected. Intransitive relationships were rare. Few interactions were reported between close relatives and ecological competitors like Mountain and Black-capped Chickadees, as such species often have only marginally overlapping geographic distributions, restricting opportunity for observation. Yet, these species' ranks-emergent properties of the network-were often in agreement with targeted studies of dominance relationships between them.","[Miller, Eliot T.; Bonter, David N.; Eldermire, Charles; Greig, Emma I.; Hochachka, Wesley M.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Miller, Eliot T.; Harmon, Luke J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr,MS 3051, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Freeman, Benjamin G.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 4200-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Harmon, Luke J.] Univ Idaho, Inst Bioinformat & Evolutionary Studies IBEST, 875 Perimeter Dr,MS 3051, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Lisle, Curtis] KnowledgeVis LLC, 2602 Chinook Trail, Maitland, FL 32751 USA","Miller, ET (corresponding author), Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.; Miller, ET (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr,MS 3051, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",eliot.isaac@gmail.com,"Hochachka, Wesley M./J-9768-2012; Bonter, David/H-1313-2013","Hochachka, Wesley M./0000-0002-0595-7827; Harmon, Luke/0000-0002-4985-5750; Bonter, David/0000-0003-1768-1941; Eldermire, Charles/0000-0002-2711-2331",National Science Foundation fellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1402506]; Edward W.

Reef-building corals exemplify high biodiversity competing for a few limiting resources via several mechanisms. Thus, corals represent fertile ground for exploring competition and nontransitivity. This article aimed to test hypotheses about the effects of species-level traits on competitive outcomes, specifically, that more upright growth, larger corallites, smaller ranges, and difference in commonness co-occur with competitive superiority. Further aims were to test whether closely related species show less predictable competitive outcomes and greater nontransitivity and to examine the level of nontransitivity among a large number of species. These goals were addressed by fitting a mixed-effects model to outcomes of 2,322 interspecific interactions. Among species-level traits, corallite width had the greatest impact on outcome, followed by geographical range size, growth form, and the typical commonness of conspecifics in assemblages. These fixed effects had smaller estimated impacts than a random effect associated with species pair, suggesting a primary role for idiosyncratic species-pair or other factors. Closely related species hadmore variable, less predictable interaction outcomes. Nearly a quarter of three-way species relations were nontransitive. The observed degree of competitive nontransitivity and extent of idiosyncratic species-pair effects together provide an empirical baseline for further investigations of mechanisms of species coexistence.","[Precoda, Kristin; Allen, Andrew P.; Grant, Liesl; Madin, Joshua S.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Precoda, K (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",kpre5355@uni.sydney.edu.au,,"Allen, Andrew/0000-0003-0304-7544; Madin, Joshua/0000-0002-5005-6227",,,,61,8,8,3,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The temporal window represented by LVF and BAT was crucial in the shaping of the current Iberian mammalian structure because it corresponds to the initial stages of a faunal turnover episode and regional environmental change at similar to 9.5-8.5Ma (Vallesian-Turolian transition), associated with an increase in the seasonality of precipitation. Herbivore and carnivore C-13 and O-18 values do not point to significant changes in either the vegetation cover (a woodland to mesic C-3 grassland) or the hydrological regime during the time lapse represented between LVF and BAT. This suggests that the environmental shift recorded around the Vallesian-Turolian boundary may have occurred later in time, since LVF and BAT ages are synchronic with the onset of the turnover event. From the standpoint of predator-prey evaluation by means of stable isotope analysis, statistical post hoc tests, mixing model output, and the assessment of niche occupation by LVF and BAT carnivores point to high levels of interspecific competition among large active carnivores, albeit some genera, such as the amphicyonid Magericyon and specially the hyaenid Lycyaena, seemed to avoid competition by taking prey from a more open habitat. Despite the drop in diversity and change in faunal components observed between the LVF and BAT assemblages, a high degree of resource and habitat competition is evident from stable isotope data.","[Domingo, Laura] CSIC UCM, Inst Geociencias, Dept Geol Sedimentaria & Cambio Medioambiental, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Domingo, Laura; Soledad Domingo, M.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Paleontol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Domingo, Laura; Koch, Paul L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Earth & Planetary Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Soledad Domingo, M.] CSIC, Dept Ecol Evolut, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Morales, Jorge; Teresa Alberdi, M.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Paleobiol, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Domingo, L (corresponding author), CSIC UCM, Inst Geociencias, Dept Geol Sedimentaria & Cambio Medioambiental, Madrid 28040, Spain.; Domingo, L (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Paleontol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.; Domingo, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Earth & Planetary Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",lauradomingo@geo.ucm.es,"Domingo, M.

Understanding how these competitors cope with one other can inform strategies for their conservation. We tested how mechanisms of niche partitioning promote coexistence by quantifying patterns of prey selection and the use of space and time by all members of the large carnivore guild within Liuwa Plain National Park in western Zambia. Lions and hyenas specialized on wildebeest, whereas wild dogs and cheetahs selected broader diets including smaller and less abundant prey. Spatially, cheetahs showed no detectable avoidance of areas heavily used by dominant competitors, but wild dogs avoided areas heavily used by lions. Temporally, the proportion of kills by lions and hyenas did not detectably differ across four time periods (day, crepuscular, early night, and late night), but wild dogs and especially cheetahs concentrated on time windows that avoided nighttime hunting by lions and hyenas. Our results provide new insight into the conditions under which partitioning may not allow for coexistence for one subordinate species, the African wild dog, while it does for cheetah. Because of differences in responses to dominant competitors, African wild dogs may be more prone to competitive exclusion (local extirpation), particularly in open, uniform ecosystems with simple (often wildebeest dominated) prey communities, where spatial avoidance is difficult.","[Droge, Egil; Creel, Scott; Becker, Matthew S.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Droge, Egil; Creel, Scott; Becker, Matthew S.] Zambian Carnivore Programme, Mfuwe, Eastern Provinc, Zambia; [M'soka, Jassiel] Dept Natl Pk & Wildlife, Lusaka, Zambia",,egil@zambiacarnivores.org,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1145749]; African Parks; WWF Netherlands; Painted Dog Conservation Inc.

Hutchinson argued that environmental fluctuations would promote coexistence when the timescale for environmental change is comparable to the timescale for competitive exclusion. Using a consumer-resource model, we do find that timescales of processes are important. However, it is not the time to exclusion that must be compared with the time for environmental change but the time for resource depletion. Fast resource depletion, when resource consumption is favored for different species at different times, strongly promotes coexistence. The time for exclusion is independent of the rate of resource depletion. Therefore, the widely believed predictions of Hutchinson are misleading. Fast resource depletion, as determined by environmental conditions, ensures strong coupling of environmental processes and competition, which leads to enhancement over time of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition as environmental shifts favor different species at different times. This critical coupling is measured by the covariance between environment and competition. Changes in this quantity as densities change determine the stability of coexistence and provide the key to rigorous analysis, both theoretically and empirically, of coexistence in a variable environment. These ideas apply broadly to diversity maintenance in variable environments whether the issue is species diversity or genetic diversity and competition or apparent competition.","[Li, Lina; Chesson, Peter] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Chesson, P (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",pchesson@u.arizona.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1119784]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1119784] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We are grateful for comments on the article from J.

In Neotropical hummingbirds, closely related species often co-occur less frequently than expected (overdispersion) when compared to a regional species pool. While this pattern has been attributed to interspecific competition, it is important to connect these findings with local scale mechanisms of coexistence. We measured the importance of the presence of competitors and the availability of resources on selectivity at experimental feeders for Andean hummingbirds along a wide elevation gradient. Selectivity was measured as the time a bird fed at a feeder with a high sucrose concentration when presented with feeders of both low and high sucrose concentrations. Resource selection was measured using time-lapse cameras to identity which floral resources were used by each hummingbird species. We found that the increased abundance of preferred resources surrounding the feeder best explained increased species selectivity, and that related hummingbirds with similar morphology chose similar floral resources. We did not find strong support for direct agonism based on differences in body size or phylogenetic relatedness in predicting selectivity. These results suggest closely related hummingbird species have overlapping - resource niches, and that the intensity of interspecific competition is related to the abundance of those preferred resources. If these competitive interactions have negative demographic effects, our results could help explain the pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion observed at regional scales.","[Weinstein, Ben G.; Graham, Catherine H.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Weinstein, BG (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",benjamin.weinstein@stonybrook.edu,"Graham, Catherine/A-9560-2011; Graham, Catherine/AAN-1237-2020","Graham, Catherine/0000-0001-9267-7948; Graham, Catherine/0000-0001-9267-7948",National Geographic GrantNational Geographic Society [9382-13]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX11AO28G],"We would like to thank the staffs of Maquipucuna and Santa Lucia Ecolodges, especially Dr. Rebecca Justicia, for their dedication to promoting science in Ecuador.

Alternatively, they may represent the end product of historical processes acting over long time frames (fundamental niche partitioning). Niche partitioning is often detected by analysing patterns of resource use within communities, but experiments are rarely conducted to test whether patterns of non-overlapping resource use reflect realized or fundamental niche partitioning. We studied a community of restio leafhoppers from the genus Cephalelus and their host plants, the Restionaceae (restios). We used network and experimental approaches to determine whether network modularity (a measure of niche partitioning within local communities) reflects fundamental or realized niche partitioning. Using a weighted modularity index for two party networks (e.g. insect-plant), we determined whether the network of this community is modular (i.e. consists of groups of species interacting strongly, with weak interactions between groups). We also aimed to identify specific Cephalelus - restio modules (groups). Using knowledge of module membership to design experiments, we tested whether Cephalelus species from two different modules, Cephalelusuncinatus and Cephaleluspickeri, prefer and perform better on restios from their own modules vs. restios from other modules. These experiments were performed under controlled conditions, eliminating the influences of competition and predation on host choices. The Cephalelus - restio community was modular, implying niche partitioning. Cephalelus also preferred and performed better on restios from their own modules in the absence of local contemporary factors. Most niche partitioning in the investigated Cephalelus community is not caused by local interactions, and thus, host use patterns represent fundamental niches. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding local community structure in the light of processes extrinsic to the local community context.","[Augustyn, Willem J.; Anderson, Bruce; Ellis, Allan G.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Augustyn, WJ; Ellis, AG (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",wjaugustyn@gmail.com; agettis@sun.ac.za,"Ellis, Allan/H-1105-2011","Ellis, Allan/0000-0001-6310-2870; Anderson, Bruce/0000-0002-7264-4505",NRF South African Biosystematics Initiative [74458]; Stellenbosch University,"We acknowledge Genevieve Theron, Andre Vermeulen and Caroli de Waal for field assistance and several anonymous reviewers for useful comments on the manuscript.

Other recent research suggests that not only multiyear increment rates but also growth resistance and recovery of beech during, respectively, after dry years may differ between pure and mixed stands. Thus, we combined dendrochronological investigations and wood stable isotope measurements to further investigate the impact of neighborhood diversity on long-term performance, short-term drought response and soil water availability of European beech in three major geographic regions of Germany. During the last four decades, target trees whose competitive neighborhood consisted of co-occurring species exhibited a superior growth performance compared to beeches in pure stands of the same investigation area. This general pattern was also found in exceptional dry years. Although the summer droughts of 1976 and 2003 predominantly caused stronger relative growth declines if target trees were exposed to interspecific competition, with few exceptions they still formed wider annual rings than beeches growing in close-by monocultures. Within the same study region, recovery of standardized beech target tree radial growth was consistently slower in monospecific stands than in the neighborhood of other competitor species. These findings suggest an improved water availability of beech in mixtures what is in line with the results of the stable isotope analysis. Apparently, the magnitude of competitive complementarity determines the growth response of target beech trees in mixtures. Our investigation strongly suggest that the sensitivity of European beech to environmental constrains depends on neighborhood identity. Therefore, the systematic formation of mixed stands tends to be an appropriate silvicultural measure to mitigate the effects of global warming and droughts on growth patterns of Fagus sylvatica.","[Metz, Jerome; Annighoefer, Peter; Schall, Peter; Ammer, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Zimmermann, Jorma] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci Plant Ecol & E, Grisebachstr 1 & 1a, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Kahl, Tiemo] Univ Freiburg, Silviculture, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Schulze, Ernst-Detlef] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoell Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Metz, J (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",jmetz@gwdg.de,"Ammer, Christian/ABG-4629-2020; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Annighofer, Peter/AAS-8418-2021; Schall, Peter/Q-5962-2019; Ammer, Christian/ABG-7360-2020","Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135; Annighofer, Peter/0000-0001-8126-5307; Schall, Peter/0000-0003-4808-818X; ",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [Am-149/7-1],"We thank the managers of the three Exploratories, Kirsten Reichel-Jung, Swen Renner, Katrin Hartwich, Sonja Gockel, Kerstin Wiesner, and Martin Gorke for their work in maintaining the plot and project infrastructure; Christiane Fischer and Simone Pfeiffer for giving support through the central office, Michael Owonibi for managing the central data base, and Markus Fischer, Eduard Linsenmair, Dominik Hessenmoller, Jens Nieschulze, Daniel Prati, Ingo Schoning, Francois Buscot, Wolfgang W.

Populations of coral reef fish are structurally complex, so it is important to understand how these populations are shaped as a result of an individual's suite of traits and those of its competitors. We conducted a 2 x 2 factorial field experiment that manipulated body condition (high or low, manipulated through a feeding regime) and residency (resident or intruder, where the resident arrived at the habitat 3 h before the intruder) to evaluate effects on competitive ability and survival. Prior residency alleviated the disadvantage of a low body condition with respect to aggression, which was similar between low-condition residents and high-condition intruders. However, high-condition residents displayed a significantly greater level of aggression than intruders, regardless of whether intruders were from high- or low-condition treatments. For intruders to have a high probability of becoming dominant, they needed to have a large body condition advantage. Mortality trajectories suggested that body condition modified the effect of prior residency, and intruders were more likely to suffer mortality if they had a low body condition because residents pushed them away from shelter. Our results highlight that the negative effects of some traits may be compensated for by the positive effects of other traits, and that the specific ecological context an individual faces (such as the characteristics of its competitors) can have a major influence on successful establishment and persistence.","[Poulos, Davina E.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Poulos, Davina E.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Poulos, DE (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",davina.poulos@my.jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council,"We would like to thank L.

We investigated the interspecific niche relationships to assess potential for competition between sympatric coyote and a similar-sized felid - bobcat Lynx rufus - throughout the highland zones (elevation >1000m) of Olympic National Park, Olympic Peninsula, Washington. Through systematic collection and analyses of scats for both carnivores (May-September 2005-2006), we determined food habits (composition, diversity, overlap of diets) and habitat use patterns. To ensure correct determination of carnivore species, we used mtDNA analysis of scats. Scat analysis indicated extensive dietary overlap between coyote and bobcat (Pianka's overlap index=0.97). For both carnivores medium-sized mammals comprised the predominant prey: mountain beaver Aplodontia rufa and snowshoe hare Lepus americanus; each occurring in about 50% of the scats. High dietary similarity indicated the potential for interspecific exploitative competition for mammalian prey, especially in harsh climatic conditions of high mountains. However, observed patterns of habitat selection inferred from scat distribution showed differences between coyotes and bobcats, implying some degree of habitat partitioning. Bobcats preferred relatively dense montane forests (canopy cover >40%) at lower elevations, and avoided the alpine zone, while coyotes inhabited mainly alpine and subalpine zones and mostly avoided forest. We conclude that observed habitat separation may alleviate foraging competition between coyote and bobcat. Whether this habitat separation will decrease potential negative effects of coyote colonization on bobcat abundance, or whether it indicates ongoing displacement of bobcats by coyotes, remains an open question.","[Witczuk, J.; Mills, L.

The degree of individual specialization in resource use differs widely among wild populations where individuals range from fully generalized to highly specialized. This interindividual variation has profound implications in many ecological and evolutionary processes. A recent review proposed four main ecological causes of individual specialization: interspecific and intraspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. 2. Using the isotopic signature of subsampled whiskers, we investigated to what degree three of these factors (interspecific and intraspecific competition and ecological opportunity) affect the population niche width and the level of individual foraging specialization in two fur seal species, the Antarctic and subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and Arctocephalus tropicalis), over several years. 3. Population niche width was greater when the two seal species bred in allopatry (low interspecific competition) than in sympatry or when seals bred in high-density stabilized colonies (high intraspecific competition). In agreement with the niche variation hypothesis (NVH), higher population niche width was associated with higher interindividual niche variation. However, in contrast to the NVH, all Antarctic females increased their niche width during the interbreeding period when they had potential access to a wider diversity of foraging grounds and associated prey (high ecological opportunities), suggesting they all dispersed to a similar productive area. 4. The degree of individual specialization varied among populations and within the annual cycle. Highest levels of interindividual variation were found in a context of lower interspecific or higher intraspecific competition. Contrasted results were found concerning the effect of ecological opportunity. Depending on seal species, females exhibited either a greater or lower degree of individual specialization during the interbreeding period, reflecting species-specific biological constraints during that period. 5. These results suggest a significant impact of ecological interactions on the population niche width and degree of individual specialization. Such variation at the individual level may be an important factor in the species plasticity with significant consequences on how it may respond to environmental variability.","[Kernaleguen, Laetitia; Arnould, John P.

However, the mechanisms that modify interaction strengths, and their effects on food web persistence are not fully understood. Using food webs containing different combinations of predator, prey, and nonprey species, we investigated how predation risk of susceptible prey is affected by the presence of species not directly trophically linked to either predators or prey. We predicted that indirect alterations to the strength of trophic interactions translate to changes in persistence time of extinction-prone species. We assembled interaction webs of protist consumers and turbellarian predators with eight different combinations of prey, predators and nonprey species, and recorded abundances for over 130 prey generations. Persistence of predation-susceptible species was increased by the presence of nonprey. Furthermore, multiple nonprey species acted synergistically to increase prey persistence, such that persistence was greater than would be predicted from the dynamics of simpler food webs. We also found evidence suggesting increased food web complexity may weaken interspecific competition, increasing persistence of poorer competitors. Our results demonstrate that persistence times in complex food webs cannot be predicted from the dynamics of simplified systems, and that species not directly involved in consumptive interactions likely play key roles in maintaining persistence. Global species diversity is currently declining at an unprecedented rate and our findings reveal that concurrent loss of species that modify trophic interactions may have unpredictable consequences for food web stability.","[Hammill, Edd] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Kratina, Pavel] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Vos, Matthijs] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Zool Biodivers, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Vos, Matthijs] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Petchey, Owen L.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Anholt, Bradley R.] Bamfield Marine Sci Ctr, Bamfield, BC, Canada; [Anholt, Bradley R.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada","Hammill, E (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",edd_hammill@hotmail.com,"Kratina, Pavel/O-5192-2019; Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Kratina, Pavel/0000-0002-9144-7937; Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Canada Research Chairs programCanada Research Chairs; NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We would like to thank Anita Narwani, Trisha Atwood and Finn Hamilton for their insightful comments and discussions.

The best opportunity to test whether ongoing competition contributes to niche differentiation is to test for behavioral shifts by the subordinate competitor in controlled experiments in which the abundance of the dominant competitor is manipulated. Because these circumstances are difficult to coordinate in natural settings for wide-ranging species, researchers seize opportunities presented by species reintroductions. We tested for new competition between reintroduced wolves and resident cougars in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem to assess whether wolves might be impacting the realized niche of sympatric cougars. Results: Between 2002 and 2012, a period during which wolves increased from 15 to as high as 91 in the study area, cougars significantly increased the percentage of deer and decreased the percentage of elk in their diet in summer. Our top models explaining these changes identified elk availability, defined as the number of elk per wolf each year, as the strongest predictor of changing cougar prey selection. Both elk and deer were simultaneously declining in the system, though deer more quickly than elk, and wolf numbers increased exponentially during the same time frame. Therefore, we concluded that prey availability did not explain prey switching and that competition with wolves at least partially explained cougar prey switching from elk to deer. We also recorded 5 marked cougar kittens killed by wolves and 2 more that were killed by an undetermined predator. In addition, between 2005 and 2012, 9 adult cougars and 10 cougar kittens died of starvation, which may also be in part explained by competition with wolves. Conclusions: Direct interspecific predation and shifting cougar prey selection as wolves increased in the system provided evidence for competition between recolonizing wolves and resident cougars. Through competition, recolonizing wolves have impacted the realized niche of resident cougars in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem (SYE), and current resident cougars may now exhibit a realized niche more reflective of an era when these species were previously sympatric in the Yellowstone Ecosystem.","[Elbroch, L.

Changes in pollinator visitation rates (e.g. through facilitation or competition for pollinators) are usually thought to exert the predominant influence on plant fecundity. However, the transfer of conspecific relative to heterospecific pollen between individuals may also play an important role. Indeed, the relative importance of these determinants of fecundity is expected to depend on the density, relative abundance and spatial arrangement of con- and heterospecifics. We investigated the effects of con- and heterospecific density and spatial distribution pattern on pollinator visitation and plant fecundity within and between two annual, self-incompatible co-flowering species [Dimorphotheca pinnata and Ursinia cakilefolia (Asteraceae)] by manipulating their relative abundance, overall patch density and dispersion patterns in experimental arrays in Namaqualand, South Africa. We quantified pollinator visitation rates and fruit set in arrays of varying density and aggregation. This enabled us to determine which mechanism(s) were driving variation of fecundity, particularly through their influence on visitation rates, mate availability and heterospecific pollen interference. To test whether autogamy offers reproductive assurance when individuals are scattered among a dense population of heterospecifics, we included an autogamous species (U.anthemoides) in a separate experiment. We found that increased fecundity with increasing conspecific density was not the result of higher visitation rates, but rather increased mate availability. Furthermore, increased spatial aggregation of conspecifics at low density significantly increased fecundity through reduced heterospecific interference. In contrast to results for self-incompatible species, fruit set in U.anthemoides was consistently high and unaffected by scattered distribution patterns. This suggests that autogamy may offer reproductive assurance when mates are limited and the potential for interspecific pollen transfer (IPT) is high.Synthesis. In this study of annual daisies, variation in fruit set is primarily driven by factors that affect the transfer of conspecific relative to heterospecific pollen, independent of pollinator visitation rate. Our findings demonstrate that mate limitation and IPT negatively affect fruit set and that these effects can be mitigated by intraspecific aggregation and the ability to autonomously self-pollinate.","[de Waal, Caroli; Anderson, Bruce; Ellis, Allan G.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Ellis, AG (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",dewaalc@gmail.com; agellis@sun.ac.za,"Ellis, Allan/H-1105-2011","Ellis, Allan/0000-0001-6310-2870; Anderson, Bruce/0000-0002-7264-4505",Stellenbosch University Subcommittee B funding; National Research Foundation; Fynbos Forum/Table Mountain Fund; Ernst and Ethel Eriksen Trust,"We thank Dr James Rodger for statistical and general advice, Sheree Muller and Marelise Diener for field assistance, SAN Parks (Arid Region Parks: Kamieskroon office) and Ben-Jon Dreyer for accommodation and facilities and two anonymous referees for useful comments on the manuscript.

Though many of these interactions occur in the soil, our understanding of how plants alter root growth and the patterns of soil occupancy in response to neighbours is limited. This is in contrast to a rich literature on the animal behavioural responses to changes in the social environment. For plants, root behavioural changes that alter soil occupancy patterns can influence neighbourhood size and the frequency or intensity of competition for soil resources; issues of fundamental importance to understanding coexistence and community assembly. Here we report a large comparative study in which individuals of 20 species were grown with and without each of two neighbour species. Through repeated root visualization and analyses, we quantified many putative root behaviours, including the extent to which each species altered aspects of root system growth (e.g. rooting breadth, root length, etc.) in response to neighbours. Across all species, there was no consistent behavioural response to neighbours (i.e. no general tendencies towards root over-proliferation nor avoidance). However, there was a substantial interspecific variation showing a continuum of behavioural variation among the 20 species. Multivariate analyses revealed two novel and predominant root behavioural strategies: (i) size-sensitivity, in which focal plants reduced their overall root system size in response to the presence of neighbours, and (ii) location-sensitivity, where focal plants adjusted the horizontal and vertical placement of their roots in response to neighbours. Of these, size-sensitivity represents the commonly assumed response to competitive encounters-reduced growth. However, location sensitivity is not accounted for in classic models and concepts of plant competition, though it is supported from recent work in plant behavioural ecology. We suggest that these different strategies could have important implications for the ability of a plant to persist in the face of strong competitors, and that location sensitivity may be a critical behavioural strategy promoting competitive tolerance and coexistence.","[Belter, Pamela R.; Cahill, James F., Jr.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Cahill, JF (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",cahillj@ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"This work was supported by a Discovery Grant, and Discovery Accelerator, awarded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to J.F.C.",,52,34,35,1,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2015,7,,,,SI,,,,plv059,10.1093/aobpla/plv059,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CO3MD,WOS:000359061000001,26019230,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

In mixed-species groups, how species respond to the presence of other species remains a poorly explored question although it might give crucial insights into mechanisms underlying the interspecific coexistence. We studied temporary mixed-species groups of large herbivores in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe) between the common impala (Aepyceros melampus), the focal species here, and bigger species including the plains zebra (Equus quagga), the greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) or the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). In the Hwange savanna, the focal and smaller species are exposed to a larger range of predators than the associated species. In this context, we investigated how impalas adjusted their vigilance with group size comparing impala-only and mixed-species groups and whether the identity of heterospecifics affected vigilance of impalas. Our study showed that the time impalas spent in vigilance significantly decreased with group size when they formed impala-only groups, whereas it did not significantly vary with group size in mixed-species groups. Moreover, in mixed-species groups, impalas did not adjust their time spent in vigilance with the proportion of conspecifics and the identity of the associated species. Thus, the mechanism underlying the difference of impalas' behavioural adjustment of vigilance with group size between single- and mixed-species groups seemed to be related to the presence but not to the number and the identity of heteropecifics. Finally, we discuss the concept that larger and dominant heterospecifics were likely to increase competition for food access, thereby forcing higher vigilance of impalas, outweighing any reduction from collective vigilance.","[Pays, Olivier] Univ Angers, Grp Ecol & Conservat, F-49045 Angers, France; [Pays, Olivier; Ekori, Alice; Fritz, Herve] Hwange Main Camp Res, CNRS HERD Programme Hwange LTER, Hwange Np, Dete, Zimbabwe; [Ekori, Alice; Fritz, Herve] Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5558, F-69365 Lyon, France","Pays, O (corresponding author), Univ Angers, Grp Ecol & Conservat, Campus Belle Beille,2 Bd Lavoisier, F-49045 Angers, France.",olivier.pays@univ-angers.fr,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661",CNRS INEE ('Institut Ecologie et Environnement'); 'Zones Ateliers' programme; Agence National de la Recherche FEAR projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-08-BLAN-0022]; CIRAD; French 'Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres'; Ambassade de France au Zimbabwe,"The Director General of the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority is acknowledged for providing the opportunity to carry out this research.

We employed structural equation modelling of the influence of the relative density of woodland and habitat generalist predators and landscape features at the nest, site, patch and landscape scales on the probability of nest predation. We found little support for the Additive Predation Model, with no significant influence of the density of woodland predators on the probability of nest predation, although landscape features at different spatial scales were important. Within woodlands fragmented by agriculture in eastern Australia, the presence of noisy miner colonies appears to influence ecological processes important for nest predation such that the Additive Predation Model does not hold. In the absence of colonies of the aggressive native bird, the noisy miner, the influence of woodland predators on the risk of artificial nest predation was low compared with that of habitat generalist predators. Outside noisy miner colonies, we found significant edge effects with greater predation rates for artificial nests within woodland patches located closer to the agricultural matrix. Furthermore, the density of habitat generalist predators increased with the extent of irrigated land-use, suggesting that in the absence of noisy miner colonies, nest predation increases with land-use intensity at the landscape scale.","[Robertson, Oliver; Maron, Martine; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [House, Alan] Ecosure, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Robertson, O (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia.",olyrobertson@gmail.com,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011; Buckley, Yvonne/B-1281-2008","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789; Buckley, Yvonne/0000-0001-7599-3201; McAlpine, Clive/0000-0003-0457-8144","Cotton CRCAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Stuart Leslie Bird Research Award",These data were collected with permission from the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (reference no. 811108) and a scientific purposes (non-protected areas) permit (permit no.

Thus, interspecific competition affects different age classes differently. Adults of sympatric species often show distinct foraging niche segregation, but juvenile resource use might overlap with adult competitors of similar body size. Resultant negative effects on juveniles can have important consequences for population dynamics, yet such interactions have received little attention in studies of mammalian communities. Using GPS tracking devices, time-depth recorders and stable isotope data, we compared diving depth, activity time, trophic position and foraging habitat characteristics to investigate foraging niche overlap between similar-sized sympatric juvenile Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) and adult Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and compared each group with much larger-bodied adult Galapagos sea lions. We found little indication for direct competition but a complex pattern of foraging niche segregation: juvenile sea lions and adult fur seals dived to shallow depths at night, but foraged in different habitats with limited spatial overlap. Conversely, juvenile and adult sea lions employed different foraging patterns, but their foraging areas overlapped almost completely. Consistency of foraging habitat characteristics between juvenile and adult sea lions suggests that avoidance of competition may be important in shaping foraging habitat utilization. Resultant specialization on a limited habitat could contribute to low sea lion numbers that contrast with high fur seal abundance. Our data suggest that exploitation by multiple predators within spatially restricted foraging ranges of juveniles might negatively impact juvenile foraging success and ultimately influence population dynamics.","[Jeglinski, Jana W.

Throughout Ohio, two closely related and ecologically similar salamander species, Plethodon cinereus and P. electromorphus, occur in similar habitats and in many localities are found in sympatry. Geographic and behavioral patterns previously described between these two species could be the result of interspecific competition, a hypothesis that also predicts distinct patterns of resource use, morphological variation, or both when the two species occur in sympatry. Here we tested these predictions by examining patterns of resource use and morphology in sympatry and compared them to patterns observed in allopatric populations of each species. We found that morphological differences in head shape between species were location-specific, with morphological divergence occurring at some sympatric locations and convergence occurring at others. The degree of food-use overlap was also variable between locations but, in general, the two species used similar food resources.","[Deitloff, Jennifer; Petersen, Jessica D.; Adams, Dean C.] Iowa State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol Dept, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Petersen, Jessica D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Geneva, NY 14456 USA","Deitloff, J (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",jenneymd@gmail.com,,"Dean, Adams/0000-0001-9172-7894",USDA IFAFS Multidisciplinary Graduate Education Training Grant [2001-52100-11506],"We thank C.

Results were completely consistent: no matter how favorable the weather conditions for using the ground (mainly characterized by temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain), A. sagrei did not do so if the predator was present. Hence, great behavioral plasticity enabled A. sagrei to adjust its use of space very quickly. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first field demonstration for anoles (and possibly for other animals as well) of how time-varying environmental conditions and predator presence interact to produce short-term changes in utilization along a major niche axis.","[Lopez-Darias, Marta] CSIC, IPNA, Isl Ecol & Evolutionary Res Grp GEEI, Tenerife 38206, Canary Islands, Spain; [Schoener, Thomas W.; Spiller, David A.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Losos, Jonathan B.] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Lopez-Darias, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Terr Ecol Grp, IMEDEA, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Balearic Island, Spain.",mdarias@ipna.csic.es,"Lopez-Darias, Marta/G-3596-2010","Lopez-Darias, Marta/0000-0002-7611-1298",EUEuropean Commission [221638]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"This study was supported by the EU Seventh Framework Programme ([FP7/2007-2013] under grant agreement no. 221638) in the form of a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship to M.

The recent expansion of the pine marten into the intensively cultivated plain of the River Po (NW Italy), where previously only stone marten occurred, offered an interesting opportunity to analyse their relationships. We studied the distribution and diet of Martes species and trophic niche overlap between martens and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in two study areas, each with two pseudoreplicates, by analysing genotyped faeces. Our results seem to confirm the displacement of the stone marten from one study area, the pine marten being the only Martes species occurring where previously the stone marten had been reported. We found a large food niche overlap between red fox and both stone and pine martens, but with evidence of size-related differences in the consumption of some food items. We hypothesised that, due to the poor prey-base of the environment, highly altered by intensive crop cultivation, intense interspecific competition originally occurred between the red fox and stone marten. The heightening of interspecific competition caused by the entry of the pine marten in the predator guild may have caused the displacement of the stone marten, at least temporarily. The mechanism of such displacement needs to be clarified through further surveys in areas where the three species occur sympatrically.","[Remonti, Luigi; Balestrieri, Alessandro; Capelli, Enrica; Prigioni, Claudio] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz; Gomez-Moliner, Benjamin J.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Zool & Anim Cell Biol, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz; Gomez-Moliner, Benjamin J.] Univ Basque Country, CIEA Lucio Lascaray Ctr Res & Adv Studies, Systemat Biogeog & Populat Dynam Res Grp, Vitoria 01006, Spain","Remonti, L (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Taramelli 24, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",luigi.remonti@gmail.com; alebls@libero.it; aritz.ruiz@ehu.es; benjamin.gomez@ehu.es; capelli@unipv.it; prigioni@unipv.it,"GONZALEZ, ARITZ RUIZ/P-3384-2019; Gomez, Benjamin/AAA-4119-2019","GONZALEZ, ARITZ RUIZ/0000-0001-7409-4634; GOMEZ MOLINER, BENJAMIN JUAN/0000-0002-3054-8806","River Po Park (Vercelli province); River Po Park (Alessandria province); Basque Government through the Research group on Systematics, Biogeography and Population Dynamics [IT317-10, GIC10/76]; Dept. of Education Universities and Research of the Basque Government [BFI09.396]","This study has been partially supported by the River Po Park (Vercelli and Alessandria provinces) and by the Basque Government through the Research group on Systematics, Biogeography and Population Dynamics (Ref.

The response of adult female whiteflies was observed on 4 classes of leaf: (1) uninfested (2) previously fed upon by spidermite nymphs, (3) spidermite nymphs and webbing present, and (4) spidermite adults present. Likewise, adult female spidermite response was observed on (1) leaves uninfested with whiteflies, (2) leaves previously fed upon by whitefly nymphs, (3) leaves with whitefly nymphs present, and (4) leaves with whitefly adults present. Spidermites generally had a greater effect on whitefly behavior than vice versa. Whitefly feeding duration decreased while labial tapping duration and frequency increased on all 3 types of mite-infested leaves compared to uninfested leaves. Although whitefly oviposition duration and frequency did not change on leaves infested with spidermite nymphs, whitefly fecundity decreased compared to untreated leaves. Although whitefly effects on spidermite behavior were less marked, nevertheless, duration and frequency of cheliceral tapping by spidermites did increase in the presence of whiteflies, although duration or frequency of feeding did not. Thus, one would predict that spidermites would win out in competition with whiteflies on a common host plant. Behavioral observations of interactions between herbivores can provide valuable insight into competitive relationships which should, however, be verified by field studies.","[Stansly, Philip A.] Univ Florida, SW Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Immokalee, FL 33934 USA; [Xu, CaiXia; Wang, XingMin; Ren, ShunXiang] Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Biol Control, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Vegetables & Flowers, Beijing 10081, Peoples R China","Stansly, PA (corresponding author), Univ Florida, SW Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Immokalee, FL 33934 USA.",pstansy@ufl.edu,,,Special Scientific Research Fund for Commonwealth Trade of China [200803005]; National Basic Research and Development Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [973-2006CB102005]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [20100480372]; Florida Agricultural Experiment Station,"We thank Jerald C.

However, these plastic responses may also have an interaction cost, which is assessed by the strength of interspecific interactions such as increased vulnerability to other predators or a reduction in competitive ability. This study assesses experimentally the effects of induced morphological defenses triggered by the carnivorous rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli, on the competitive ability of two herbivorous populations, and the reciprocal dominance between the rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Brachionus havanaensis. Our results support the existence of a trade-off between the expression of induced morphological defenses and competitive ability in aquatic animals. Specifically, we show that: (i) a consumer which reduces its vulnerability to predation via induced defenses increases its resource requirement to maintain zero population growth; and (ii) the expression of induced defenses promotes a qualitative shift in the relative competitive performance of the two herbivores over a single resource gradient. These results reinforce the general idea of functional community consequences of phenotypic plasticity, in particular the expression of inducible defenses of prey.","[Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo] Fdn Univ Chile, Ctr Nacl Medio Ambiente, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Bustamante, Ramiro O.] Inst Ecol & Biodivers IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo; Bustamante, Ramiro O.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ecol & Recursos Nat, Santiago, Chile","Aranguiz-Acuna, A (corresponding author), Fdn Univ Chile, Ctr Nacl Medio Ambiente, Av Larrain 9975, Santiago, Chile.",a.aranguiz@cenma.cl,"BUSTAMANTE, RAMIRO/I-7353-2019; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo/F-3160-2013","Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana/0000-0002-9409-1147",CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [ICM-P05-002]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1090132],A.A.-A. acknowledges the support of a CONICYT doctoral scholarship and grant ICM-P05-002 to Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity.

The barrier includes several hundred kilometers without suitable habitat and is the convergence zone of major ocean currents. Within the barrier region, along-shore larval transport is expected to be erratic, with water moving offshore to form long-lived eddies. Through comparison of central and range edge populations, we test for evidence of recruitment limitation and interspecific competition with the whelk, Haustrum vinosum, which occurs sympatrically at the range edge. We found similar levels of recruitment and allozyme genetic variation within centre and edge populations where H. vinosum was absent, implying that populations are strongly interconnected. Nevertheless, recruitment and abundance of M. marginalba were lower at its extreme range limit, where it occurs with H. vinosum. Indeed, we detected significant inverse correlations between the abundance of these species, although their habitat use was similar and they consumed similar prey. These lines of evidence suggest a restricted recruitment across the barrier limits the range of M. marginalba but emphasize that multiple factors may act to set species range limits.

Several conservation initiatives are aiming to improve the status of the rapidly dwindling populations of tiger Panthera tigris. However, possible cascading effects of intra-guild competition on other sympatric carnivores are rarely considered while planning such recovery programmes. 2. In this study, we examine how, following the reduction of anthropogenic pressures by relocation of pastoralists, a recovering tiger population affects leopards Panthera pardus in the Chilla Range of Rajaji National Park (RNP), India. By combining data gathered over 4 years (2004-2005 to 2007-2008) on prey availability, food habits and population density of the two predators, we investigate some of the mechanisms of niche partitioning. 3. Based on existing information, we predicted that there would be high dietary overlap between the two predators. Over time, optimal habitats would be dominated by tigers forcing leopards to the periphery of the protected area where they would subsist on small prey and domestic livestock. Consequently, leopards would occur at a lower density where sympatric with tigers. 4. Our results confirmed that annual dietary overlap (0 center dot 89, 0 center dot 82, 0 center dot 78, 0 center dot 77) between the two predators was high during the study. As expected, we observed a shift in the diet of leopards towards a significantly higher intake of domestic prey (similar to 6 center dot 8% to similar to 31 center dot 8%) and small prey (similar to 9% to similar to 36%). Mean leopard density declined from 9 center dot 76 animals per 100 km2 in 2004-2005 to 2 center dot 07 per 100 km2 in 2007-2008, while the mean density of tigers increased from 3 center dot 31 per 100 km2 to 5 center dot 81 per 100 km2 over the same period. 5. Synthesis and applications. Although based on small sample sizes, our study revealed that over the 4 years following the relocation of pastoralists out of RNP, the tiger population recovered but leopard densities declined sharply. The concurrent shift in leopard diet indicated heightened livestock depredation from the surrounding area. Therefore, it is important that conservation initiatives targeting the recovery of tigers should be preceded by careful examination of interspecific interactions with sympatric carnivores. Comprehensive human-carnivore conflict management measures like monitoring the extent of livestock depredation, improving livestock management and providing adequate compensation and/or insurance schemes are critical for successfully implementing such conservation efforts.","[Harihar, Abishek; Pandav, Bivash; Goyal, Surendra P.] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Harihar, Abishek] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Dept Anthropol, Canterbury CT2 7NR, Kent, England","Harihar, A (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, POB 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",harihar.abishek@gmail.com,"Harihar, Abishek/AAY-5092-2020","Harihar, Abishek/0000-0002-2446-6345",Save the Tiger Fund; WII; WWF-International; Kaplan Graduate Award; Kathryn Fuller Doctoral Fellowship,"We wish thank the Director and Dean of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the Uttarakhand Forest Department for providing permissions.

Heterospecific occupants of Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavities (cavity kleptoparasites) exacerbate the limitation of cavities. However, heterospecifics do not maintain the resin barrier, which deteriorates without upkeep. Thus, we predicted that heterospecific occupants of Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavities should suffer rates of nest predation higher than the Red-cockaded Woodpecker's. We compared the daily nest-survival rates of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker and two heterospecific occupants of its cavities, the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) and Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), in two forests in northern Florida. Results from both forests supported the differential-predation hypothesis. Although during incubation the three species' daily nest-survival rates were similar, the primary cause of failure was hatching failure for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers but predation for the two heterospecific occupants. During the nestling stage, daily nest success was significantly higher for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers than for Red-bellied Woodpeckers or Great Crested Flycatchers and similar for the latter two species (i.e., Red-cockaded Woodpecker >> Red-bellied Woodpecker >= Great Crested Flycatcher); predators destroyed 3-6% of Red-cockaded Woodpecker nests and 21-37% of kleptoparasite nests. We hypothesize that rat snakes have an indirect positive effect on the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (increased cavity availability) by preying differentially on heterospecific occupants of its cavities.","[Kappes, John J., Jr.; Sieving, Kathryn E.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Kappes, JJ (corresponding author), Pine Woods Ecol Res, 910 N Saylor St, Southern Pines, NC 28387 USA.",jjkappes@gmail.com,"Sieving, Kathyrn E/I-6058-2013","Sieving, Kathyrn E/0000-0002-0849-8101",Florida Army National Guard at Camp Blanding Training Site; Department of Forestry at Goethe State Forest; U.

A previous study showed that fallow deer can actively exclude roe from feeding areas. Here I show that 81% out of 42 aggressive interactions were fallow-roe deer aggressions, whereas 19% were roe-fallow aggressions. No aggressive interaction involved physical contact between opponents and roe deer were displaced in all events. When roe deer avoided fallow deer, the probability of remaining feeding increased significantly with respect to when aggression occurred. Fallow deer males, especially yearlings, were more aggressive than females to all roe deer sexes/age classes. For fallow deer, aggression was an efficient way to monopolise the access to foraging space. For roe deer, spatial avoidance of fallow was a way to remain at feeding areas.","Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Ferretti, F (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, Via T Pendola 62, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",francescoferretti@libero.it,,"Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0002-0414-1615",MRP Agency,"I am indebted to S.

In this study, we examined the distribution of the Sardinian warbler Sylvia melanocephala along two grassland-to-forest gradients, one in a high-diversity area (Albera-Aspres chain in Catalonia: eight Sylvia warbler species) and one in a low-diversity area (Mount Hymittos in Greece: four species). In Catalonia, distribution models suggested that the apparent exclusion of S. melanocephala from the open and forest ends of the gradient may be explained entirely by the preference of S. melanocephala for mid-successional shrublands. However, a joint analysis of both data sets revealed that: 1) S. melanocephala was more evenly distributed along the vegetation gradient in Greece, suggesting ecological release in the low-diversity area; and 2) a distribution model assuming interspecific competition (based on the distribution of Sylvia species showing a negative co-occurrence pattern with S. melanocephala) had a significantly higher predictive ability than a distribution model based on habitat variables alone. Our study supports the view that species turnover along ecological gradients generally results from a combination of intrinsic preferences and interspecific competition [Current Zoology 57 (3): 307-317, 2011].","[Guillaumet, Alban; Prodon, Roger] EPHE, CEFE CNRS UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Guillaumet, Alban] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA","Guillaumet, A (corresponding author), EPHE, CEFE CNRS UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",aguillaumet@cfr.msstate.edu,,,,,,43,1,1,0,19,CURRENT ZOOLOGY,BEIJING,"CHINESE ACAD SCIENCES, INST ZOOLOGY, BEICHEN XILU, CHAOYANG DISTRICT, BEIJING, 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-5507,,,CURR ZOOL,Curr.

In gape-limited predators, body size asymmetries determine the outcome of predator-prey interactions. Due to ontogenetic changes in body size, the intensity of intra- and interspecific interactions may change rapidly between the match situation of a predator-prey system and the mismatch situation in which competition, including competition with the prey, dominates. 2. Based on a physiologically structured population model using the European perch (Perca fluviatilis), analysis was performed on how prey density (bream, Abramis brama), initial size differences in the young-of-the-year (YOY) age cohort of the predator, and phenology (time-gap in hatching of predator and prey) influence the size structure of the predator cohort. 3. In relation to the seasonality of reproduction, the match situation of the predator-prey system occurred when perch hatched earlier than bream and when no gape-size limitations existed, leading to decreased size divergence in the predator age cohort. Decreased size divergence was also found when bream hatched much earlier than perch, preventing perch predation on bream occurring, which, in turn, increased the competitive interaction of the perch with bream for the common prey, zooplankton; i.e. the mismatch situation in which also the mean size of the age cohort of the predator decreased. 4. In between the total match and the mismatch, however, only the largest individuals of the perch age cohort were able to prey on the bream, while smaller conspecifics got trapped in competition with each other and with bream for zooplankton, leading to enlarged differences in growth that increased size divergence. 5. The modelling results were combined with 7 years of field data in a lake, where large differences in the length-frequency distribution of YOY perch were observed after their first summer. These field data corroborate that phenology and prey density per predator are important mechanisms in determining size differences within the YOY age cohort of the predator. 6. The results demonstrate that the switch between competitive interactions and a predator-prey relationship depended on phenology. This resulted in pronounced size differences in the YOY age cohort, which had far-reaching consequences for the entire predator population.","[Borcherding, Jost; Beeck, Peter; Scharf, Werner R.] Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Ecol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, Biol Resources Div, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [DeAngelis, Donald L.] Univ Miami, US Geol Survey, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Borcherding, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Zool, Ecol Res Stn Grietherbusch, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",jost.borcherding@uni-koeln.de,"Borcherding, Jost/A-1142-2011","Borcherding, Jost/0000-0003-3411-5861","German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG BO1507/5-1]; U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources DivisionUnited States Geological Survey","We gratefully acknowledge the help of Joscha Groddeck, Lisa Heermann, Martina Heynen, Stephanie Kiel, Ulrike Konig, Andreas Scharbert, Ralph Urbatzka and many volunteer helpers during the field sampling.

However, the role of behavioral interactions in promoting species coexistence is under-represented in the literature. We studied the behavioral interactions of two coexisting small mammals, the Namaqua rock mouse Micaelamys namaquensis (Rodentia) and the Rock sengi Elephantulus myurus (Macroscelidae), which have high dietary and microhabitat overlap. Using wild-caught individuals, intra-and interspecific dyadic encounters were staged in tanks on a neutral rocky outcrop. Interspecific dyads displayed significantly more active avoidance behavior. There was no support for the prediction that the larger, more specialist species, E. myurus, is behaviorally dominant over M. namaquensis. Intraspecific encounters of E. myurus showed significantly more passive avoidance and amicable behavior, whereas the behavior of M. namaquensis did not differ between intra-and inter-specific encounters, both of which were characterized by low levels of aggression and amicability. Thus, due to the lack of aggression, direct competition appears weak and instead mutual avoidance may reduce or minimize interspecific interactions, potentially promoting coexistence [Current Zoology 56 (4): 395-400, 2010].","[Lancaster, Jennifer; Pillay, Neville] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa","Lancaster, J (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",jenny@gecko.biol.wits.ac.za,,,National Research Foundation [2069110]; University of the Witwatersrand,Funding was provided by the National Research Foundation (Grant number: 2069110) and the University of the Witwatersrand.

We examined the spatiotemporal distribution of the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the associated specialist and generalist predators Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus on bean plants. Tetranychus urticae is a key pest on numerous agricultural crops. Both predators are used singly and in combination for biological control of spider mites. Population development and within-plant distribution of the spider mites and the predators were compared among five treatments: T. urticae without predators, with either predator alone and with both predators in combination at full and half densities. The spider mites were suppressed to zero density in both predator combination treatments but not in the single predator treatments. The predators determined the spatiotemporal distribution of the spider mites through density- and behaviour-mediated effects, and these effects were linked to diet specialisation. The specialist P. persimilis exerted stronger density-mediated effects on the spider mite distribution than did the generalist N. californicus. Either predator induced in the spider mites early upward migration on plants. The predators also affected each other's distribution. The aggregation level of N. californicus was lowered by P. persimilis but not vice versa. In combination, the predators were more dispersed than when alone, reducing the predator-free space and leading to the local extinction of T. urticae.","[Walzer, A.; Schausberger, P.] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Appl Plant Sci & Plant Biotechnol, Inst Plant Protect, Vienna, Austria; [Moder, K.] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Vienna, Austria","Walzer, A (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Appl Plant Sci & Plant Biotechnol, Inst Plant Protect, Vienna, Austria.",andreas.walzer@boku.ac.at,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; European Community (CRAFT)European Commission,Andreas Walzer was financially supported by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the European Community (CRAFT).,,56,21,22,0,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-4853,,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

Despite the theoretical advances provided by such models, they are restricted to questions about community-wide features. The individual-based modeling offers an opportunity to link bionomic features to patterns at the community scale, allowing us to understand how trait-based assembly rules can arise by dynamical processes. The present paper introduces an individual-based model of community assembly, and discusses some of the major advantages and drawbacks of this approach. The model was framed to deal with predation among size-structured populations, incorporating allometric constraints to energetic requirements, movement, life-history features and interaction relationships among individuals. A protocol of assembly procedure is proposed, in which a period of intense species introductions is followed by a period without introductions. The resultant communities did not present any pattern of trait over-dispersion, meaning that the multivariate distances of bionomic features among co-occurring species were neither larger nor more regular than expected in a random collection of species. It suggests a weak influence of interspecific interactions in the model environment and individualistic rules of coexistence, driven mainly by the spatial structure. This highlights that trait over-dispersion and resource partitioning should not be considered a necessary condition for coexistence, even in communities entirely structured by internal processes like predation and competition.

Knowledge of basic ecology and systematics of the pleurocerid and hydrobiid gastropods is lacking. Pleurocerids are most diverse in southeastern USA, and we know that periphyton food limits their growth, and that their grazing, in turn, limits periphyton biomass. However, we know little about the effects of spates and current velocity on pleurocerid populations, and more work is needed to determine whether interspecific competition or significant risk from predation occurs, Hydrobiids are extremely diverse, but many species inhabit only a few springs (especially in and western USA) and are at risk of extinction.

Augmentative releases of EPN have been used to enhance biological control of pests in agroecosystems. Pest managers strive to achieve a trophic cascade whereby natural-enemy effects permeate down throguh the food web to suppress host herbivores and increase crop production. Although trophic cascades have been studied in diverse aboveground arthropod-based systems, they are infrequently investigated in soil systems. Moreover, no overall quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of EPN in suppressing hosts with cascading benefits to plants has been made. Toward synthesizing the available but limited information on EPN and their ability to suppress prey and affect plant, yield, we surveyed the litrerature and performed a meta-analysis of 35 published studies. Our analysis found that effect sizes for arthropod hosts as a result of EPN addition were consistently negative and indirect effects on plants were consistently positive. Results held across several different host metrics (abundance, fecundity and survival) and across measures of plant performance (biomass, growth, yield and survival). Moreover, the relationship between plant and host effect sizes was strikingly and significantly negative. That is, the positive impact on plant responses generally increased as the negative effect of EPN on hosts intensified, providing strong support for the mechanism of trophic cascades. We also review the ways in which EPN might interact antagonistically with each other and other predators and pathogens to adversely affect host suppression and dampen trophic cascades. We conclude that the food web implications of multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN are little studied, but, as management techniques that promote the long-term persistence of EPN are improved, antagonistic interactions are more likely to arise. We hope that the likely occurrence of antagonistic interactions in soil food webs should stimulate researchers to conduct field experiments explicitly designed to examine multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN and their cascading effects to hosts and plants.","[Denno, Robert F.; Gruner, Daniel S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kaplan, Ian] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Denno, RF (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dsgruner@umd.edu,"Gruner, Daniel S./A-5166-2010","Gruner, Daniel S./0000-0002-3153-4297",,,,128,44,46,0,40,SOC NEMATOLOGISTS,MARCELINE,"PO BOX 311, MARCELINE, MO 64658 USA",0022-300X,,,J NEMATOL,J.

The fields of biological control and insect pest management have generally been slow to adopt PCR-based diagnostics in comparison with other fields of science. However, there has been increasing interest in the use of molecular diagnostic tools in arthropod biological control. In applied entomology, molecular techniques have generally been used for insect identification and systematics; however, PCR-based techniques are increasingly becoming recognized as valuable tools in ecological studies. Here, we review research that has used PCR-based techniques for parasitoid and predator/prey identification and detection, and place these studies in the context of their contributions to biological control of arthropods.

Interspecific co-occurrence was observed in 80% of the resource patches (= Trollius fruits) in the two communities studied. Isolated larvae from all species had a similar food intake, but differed in development time and size at emergence Different species exhibit contrasting resource exploitation strategies with specific mining patterns and a partial temporal shift. Two species exhibited particularly singular strategies. C. rotundiventris escaped from strong interactions with other species because it was the first species to develop and the only one to exploit the central pith of Trollius fruits. The key role of this species as the main pollinator of the host-plant appears to be a by-product of constraints imposed by occupying a restricted niche. Although the resource is ephemeral due to seed dispersal, C. dentifera, the last species to oviposit, is not disadvantaged because it has a short development time and rapid food intake. The different patterns can partly explain the stability of Chiastocheta communities, but do not prevent competition to occur at high larval densities. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS.

We investigated avoidance of intra- and interspecific conflicts in a four-species community of shrews [Sorex minutus Linnaeus, 1766, S. araneus Linnaeus, 1758, Neomys anomalus Cabrera, 1907, and N. fodiens (Pennant, 1771)], using the method of dyadic encounters in a neutral arena. We tested whether the use of passive (habituation, reduction of mobility, increase of inter-individual distance, and stillness) and active ('to-and-fro' and 'keeping distance' behaviours) forms of conflict avoidance depends on species, size or domination rank. The duration of conflicts was positively correlated with mobility and negatively with inter-individual distance, whereas it was unrelated to time of stillness and the active forms. The repertoire of conflict avoidance mechanisms was not species -specific and the display of these mechanisms depended rather on the size and domination rank of animals participating in a given interaction. In contrast to rodents, shrews did not avoid conflicts by the most passive forms: freeze and stillness reactions. All other forms were used with a higher or lower efficiency by all species. However, consistent with our predictions, large shrews (as N. fodiens) used mainly the passive mechanisms of conflicts avoidance ('wait-and-see' strategy), whereas small shrews (as S. minutus) invest proportionally more time in active forms (escape' strategy).","Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Dept Systemat Zool, PL-61701 Poznan, Poland; Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland","Rychlik, L (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",lrychlik@bison.zbs.bialowieza.pl,"Zwolak, Rafal/AAA-2174-2019; Rychlik, Leszek/B-2956-2013; zwolak, rafal/E-6578-2011","Zwolak, Rafal/0000-0002-7665-5033; Rychlik, Leszek/0000-0002-1479-1443; zwolak, rafal/0000-0002-7665-5033",,,,85,19,19,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0001-7051,,,ACTA THERIOL,Acta Theriol.,SEP,2005,50,3,,,,,289,308,,10.1007/BF03192627,,,20,Zoology,Zoology,972DH,WOS:000232433700001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Here, we develop a spatially explicit individual-based model of a complex marine epibenthic community and test its ability to predict the dynamics and structure of the natural community on which the model is based. We studied a natural epibenthic community on small-scale patches of jetty wall to estimate the outcomes of pair-wise interactions among individuals of different species, neighbour-specific growth rates, and species-specific recruitment and mortality rates. The model is defined with rules acting at two spatial scales: (1) between individual cells on the spatial landscape that define the nature of interactions, growth and recruitment at a scale of 1 cm(2), and (2) at the scale of whole colonies (blocks of contiguous cells) that define size-specific mortality and limitations to the maximum size of colonies for some species for scales up to 1000 cm(2). The model is compared to the existing patches on the jetty wall and proves to be a good descriptor of the large range of possible communities on the jetty, and of the multivariate variances of the patches. The high variability in community structure predicted by the model, which is similar to that observed in the natural community, arises from observed variability in parameters of interaction outcomes, growth, recruitment, and mortality of each species. Thus if the processes we modelled operate similarly in nature, our results suggest that it is difficult to attempt to predict the precise trajectory of the community in a particular patch. Our results show that it is possible to develop a testable, predictive spatial model where the patch-scale community patterns of structure and dynamics are emergent, arising from local processes between colonies and species-specific demography.

However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. I studied a system of marine reserves in the San-Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. I surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (Nuttallia obscurata, Mya arenaria, and Venerupis philippinarum). Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, V. philippinarum, was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in Venerupis biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (Protothaca staminea) did not differ between reserves and non-reserves. I followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high Venerupis densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial Protothaca, and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, Venerupis had no direct effect on itself or Protothaca; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of Venerupis, whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that Cancer productus, an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult Venerupis at least 1.7 times over Protothaca. Venerupis' high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to Protothaca can be explained by its shallower burial depth. By growing quickly and residing near the surface, Venerupis apparently absorbs the brunt of harvest pressure while Protothaca maintains high biomass even outside of reserves.","Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","Byers, JE (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Zool, 46 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",jebyers@unh.edu,,"Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287",,,,60,47,51,2,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2005,86,2,,,,,487,500,,10.1890/03-0580,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,906IM,WOS:000227634400024,,,,,2021-09-21,

The leading hypothesis for this displacement is exclusion via resource competition; however, the proximate mechanism producing a competitive advantage for A. albopictus over A. aegypti has Dot been identified. We performed laboratory experiments to test the hypotheses that these species differ in feeding behavior, and that these differences result in differences in survival when resources are scarce. Differences in feeding behavior were assessed in three environments with food (growing microorganisms) available: 1) in fluid only; 2) on leaf surfaces only; 3) or both in fluid and on leaf surfaces. We determined behavior of larvae in these environments, recording their positions (bottom, wall, leaf, top, or middle) and activities (browsing, filtering, resting, or thrashing) using instantaneous scan censuses. A. albopictus spent significantly more time at leaf surfaces, whereas A. aegypti spent more time engaging in nonfeeding activities. Both species showed a significant shift in foraging activity toward leaves when leaves were available. In a second experiment, we recorded survivorship for individuals raised in two treatment combinations: whole or half 17-mm disks of live oak leaves, with or without direct access to the leaf surface (controlled using nylon mesh, which allowed movement of microscopic organisms, but prevented mosquito larva movement between container sides). After 31 d, survivorsbip of A. albopictus was significantly greater than that of A. aegypti regardless of treatments. Moreover, A. albopictus showed significantly greater survivorship compared with A. aegypti when deprived of access to leaf surfaces and in whole leaf disk treatments, suggesting superior resource-harvesting ability for A. albopictus. Our experiments suggest that differences in foraging behavior contribute to the competitive advantage of A. albopictus over A. aegypti that has been observed in North America.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Yee, DA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",dayee@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI051374, R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15 AI051374, R01 AI044793] Funding Source: Medline",,,45,35,40,0,13,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706 USA",0013-8746,,,ANN ENTOMOL SOC AM,Ann.

We examined group-choice decisions by individuals in armored and nonarmored species and predicted that either (1) the oddity effect would result in preference for conspecific groups for solitary individuals of both species, or (2) individuals in the armored species would prefer to associate with groups containing individuals of the more vulnerable species. Armored brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans) and nonarmored fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) have the same predators and often occur together in streams. In mixed-species shoals, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) attacked minnows earlier and more often than sticklebacks. We tested whether solitary minnows and sticklebacks preferred to associate with conspecific or heterospecific shoals under conditions of both low and high predation risk. When predation risk was high, minnows preferred to associate with conspecifics over heterospecifics, as predicted by the oddity effect. In contrast, sticklebacks preferentially associated with groups of minnows over groups of conspecifics when predation risk was high. When predation risk was low, solitary individuals of both species preferentially associated with conspecific over heterospecific shoals. Stickleback shoal choices under low-risk conditions may have been influenced by interspecific competition for food. In feeding experiments, minnows were more efficient foragers than sticklebacks, so it should benefit sticklebacks to avoid minnows unless predation risk is high. Therefore, for armored prey, the benefits of associating with more vulnerable prey appear to override the costs of both the oddity effect and food competition when predation risk is high.","SW Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Springfield, MO 65804 USA; Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada","Mathis, A (corresponding author), SW Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Springfield, MO 65804 USA.",sam477f@smsu.edu,,,,,,39,39,42,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Larval anuran communities fall along a gradient of pond permanency and pond permanency also affects the type of top predator present. These environmental factors combine to create distinct categories of pond types. In this study, I quantified the predator avoidance trait burst swim speed and related traits for 14 anuran species found in three pond types and within three taxonomic families. Absolute swim speed differed significantly among species and among taxonomic families. Inclusion of size in the model revealed a three-way interaction between size, habitat and taxonomic family. Tail beat frequency and body shape differed significantly among species, but with no pattern by family or habitat. Functional relationships among traits also did not differ among family by habitat groups. The evolution of swim speed was significantly correlated with the evolution of increased size. In general, these results suggest that anurans have invaded new pond types using multiple mechanisms to cope with the predators that are present.","Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Richardson, JML (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",,"Richardson, Jean/D-2702-2014",,,,,58,13,14,0,12,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

The aphid, Chaitophorus populicola, is found only in association with ants, which provide tending services and protection from predators. As a consequence, aphid abundance declined by 88% on host plants located greater than or equal to6 m from an ant mound. Differences in host plant quality resulted in aphid fecundity being greatest on narrowleaf cottonwoods, 7-22% less on backcross hybrids, 37-46% less on F-1 hybrids, and 57-61% less on Fremont cottonwoods. Due to the combined effects of these factors, we found that the realized aphid habitat was only 21% of their potential habitat. On trees where aphids and tending ants are present, aphids and ants greatly outnumber any other arthropod species; therefore, we examined the hypothesis that the factors affecting aphid density and distribution are also determinants of arthropod community structure. On a per-tree basis, observational data showed that arthropod species richness was 51% greater and abundance was 67% greater on trees where aphid-ant mutualists were absent relative to trees where they were present. When aphids were experimentally removed and ants abandoned the tree, we found the same pattern. On a per-tree basis, arthropod species richness increased by 57%, and abundance increased by 80% where aphid-ant mutualists were removed, relative to control trees. Overall, a total of 90 arthropod species were examined in this study: 56% were found only on trees without aphid-ant mutualists, 12% were found only on trees with aphid-ant mutualists, and 32% were common to both. Specific guilds were also affected; the aphid-ant mutualism had a negative effect on herbivores, generalist predators, and other species of tending ants, and a positive effect on specialist enemies of aphids. These results suggest that, by examining the factors responsible for the population dynamics of a common herbivore, we may also uncover mechanisms that determine arthropod community structure. Furthermore, studies that address the role of mutualism in shaping communities are underrepresented in the literature; these results emphasize the importance of mutualism in ecological communities.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Wimp, GM (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",,"Wimp, Gina/AAT-3776-2020",,,,,66,138,150,1,59,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2001,82,2,,,,,440,452,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[0440:BCOPAH]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,403VX,WOS:000167064100012,,,,,2021-09-21,

All of these factors influence coral richness but their effects vary with spatial scale, position on the reef, and regional location. Species richness of corals along depth gradients shows a unimodal, hump-shaped curve that peaks at intermediate depths. Moreover, the peak of the curve is higher in regions with larger species pools. This regional enrichment of the local community appears in line transect samples as small as 10 m in length. The pattern suggests that ecological factors operating over scales of tens of meters and regional/historical factors operating over thousands of kilometers can both affect local richness. Regional factors probably include differences in speciation relative to extinction rates among regions and proximity of local sites to richness hotspots. Plausible factors operating at the local scale are species interactions, disturbance, and productivity which combine in different ways to produce the unimodal pattern. Shallow areas support few species because extinction rates are high due to frequent disturbance or because of environmental extremes. In addition, high productivity encourages rapid growth and thus the potential for intense interspecific competition. In areas where branching acroporids are abundant, exclusion by these dominant competitors is possible. Deep areas may be depauperate because few species can tolerate the low light levels found there. Areas of intermediate depth have the richest communities because they are open for colonization by many species and because extinction rates are low. Several theories may explain this openness and species persistence: 1. Occasional disturbance coupled with low growth rates results in glacially slow exclusion by the dominant competitor. 2. Aggregation of corals creates spatial variation in the intensity of competition and thus refuges from competition within a spatial landscape. Inferior competitors persist because they are superior at dispersal and refuge colonization. 3. Specialist predators focus on high-density juvenile populations near the parent, creating ecological space for colonization by non-prey. 4. Coral competitive abilities are roughly equal and recruitment into the community is a probabilistic event. The community thus exhibits random drift and exclusion is an extremely lengthy process. Based upon empirical evidence, these theories are listed in order of plausibility, but still need to be rigorously tested.","Univ Delaware, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA","Cornell, HV (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",cornell@udel.edu,,,,,,65,63,65,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,MAR,2000,19,1,,,,,37,49,,10.1007/s003380050224,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,312WA,WOS:000086965900005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Meta-analysts will vary in the criteria they use to screen studies and select data within studies, even when addressing exactly the same question. We summarize some of the many decisions that an ecologist must make in deciding what data to include in a synthesis. We then show, using multiple meta-analyses taken from the same literature on stream predation experiments, that meta-analytic conclusions can be colored by selection criteria that are not specifically a function of the relevance of the data. As a consequence, we recommend that meta-analysts perform several meta-analyses using different selection criteria to examine the robustness of reported findings. We also advise ecological meta-analysts to minimize use of selection criteria that are based on judgments of study quality when extracting data from the literature, because of the potential for unconscious bias. The influence of quality criteria on patterns in the data set can then be examined empirically. Our comparisons of mean effect size,for studies included vs. excluded on the basis of quality criteria, provided no evidence that rejected studies were aberrant or more variable than acceptable studies. One result of excluding such studies was a loss of statistical power. We urge ecologists to be more explicit about how data are selected for a meta-analysis, to examine the robustness of the patterns they report, and to conduct meta-analyses to describe as well as to infer.","Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Englund, G (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",,"Englund, Goran/A-7434-2008","Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602",,,,40,132,140,1,46,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1999,80,4,,,,,1132,1141,,10.2307/177060,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,215EG,WOS:000081368500004,,,,,2021-09-21,

We studied the spatial distribution of avian microtine predators using data from 19 study areas on the tundra of northern Siberia. 2. Numbers of snowy owls, and long-tailed skuas and pomarine skuas depended strongly on Iemming density. However, a significant relationship between lemming density and number of rough-legged buzzards appeared first after removal of the effect of snowy owl abundance on the distribution of rough-legged buzzards. 3. We applied a recently developed method (Manly 1995) to examine co-occurrences of species and found that rough-legged buzzards and snowy owls did not co-occur while snowy owls, long-tailed skuas and pomarine skuas did. 4. There are large differences in nest construction and chick behaviour between rough-legged buzzards and the three other species. Moreover, the snow owl is a polyphagous predator preying also on large birds including raptor chicks. Therefore, we propose that reduced risk of nest predation favours rough-legged buzzards nesting away from snowy owls. 5. Variations in abundance of the two lemming species did not seem to influence the distributions of snowy owls and rough-legged buzzards. Neither was it likely that latitudinally related factors such as breeding season length affected the distribution of rough-legged buzzards.","Gothenburg Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Anim Ecol, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Lund, Dept Anim Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Wiklund, CG (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Dept Zool, Sect Anim Ecol, Med Aregatan 18, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,"Wiklund, Christer G/0000-0003-3898-0289",,,,58,26,26,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Mosquito larvae are their most common prey. Holes colonized naturally by predators and prey had lower densities of mosquitoes if odonates were present than if they were absent. Using artificial tree holes placed in the field, we tested the effects of odonates on their mosquito prey while controlling for the quantity and species of predator, hole volume, and nutrient input. In large and small holes with low nutrient input, odonates depressed the number of mosquitoes present and the number that survived to pupation. Increasing nutrient input (and consequently, mosquito abundance) to abnormally high levels dampened the effect of predation when odonates were relatively small. However, the predators grew faster with higher nutrients, and large larvae in all three genera reduced the number of mosquitoes surviving to pupation, even though the abundance of mosquito larvae remained high. Size-selective predation by the odonates is a likely explanation for this result; large mosquito larvae were less abundant in the predator treatment than in the controls. Because species assemblages were similar between natural and artificial tree holes, our results suggest that odonates are keystone species in tree holes on BCI, where they are the most common large predators.",,"Fincke, OM (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA,DEPT ZOOL,NORMAN,OK 73019, USA.",,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Yanoviak, Stephen/0000-0001-6425-1413; Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,45,79,84,2,21,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1997,112,2,,,,,244,253,,10.1007/s004420050307,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YA693,WOS:A1997YA69300015,28307577,,,,2021-09-21,

Showy, flower-like pseudoflowers caused by the rust fungus Puccinia monoica on Arabis holboellii (Brassicaceae) commonly co-occur with flowers of Anemone patens (Ranunculaceae). I evaluated the effects of pseudoflowers and anemone on each other's visitation, and the effect of pseudoflowers on the seed set of anemone. I expected that at low overall ''flower'' densities visitation would be facilitated in patches containing a mixture of these species. At low densities, pseudoflowers or flowers alone may be too rare to attract sufficient visitors, but the addition of the other species could make mixtures more attractive and thus increase visitation rates. At high densities I expected that ''flowers'' in mixtures would compete for pollinators because it is more energy efficient for pollinators to concentrate visits on the most rewarding species. I used artificial arrays to separate the effects of ''flower'' density and relative frequency on visitation. Local density was not a good predictor of the influence of one species on the other. Instead, visitation patterns depended most strongly on the kind of visitor (flies vs. bees). Visitation to A. patens by flies was facilitated by the presence of pseudoflowers at both high and low densities, whereas visitation to pseudoflowers was not significantly influenced by A. patens at either density. Local density affected visitation by bees, but relative frequency did not. In addition to observing visitation, I also quantified the effects of interspecific movement of both pollen and spores on the reproductive success of A. patens. Although the presence of pseudoflowers sometimes facilitates visitation to A. patens, this effect could be counterbalanced by competition through interspecific insect movement: sticky pseudoflowers remove pollen from visiting insects, and fungal spermatia deposited on flower stigmas reduce seed set.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,CTR POPULAT BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616","Roy, BA (corresponding author), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL,GEOBOT INST,CH-8044 ZURICH,SWITZERLAND.",,,"Roy, Bitty A./0000-0003-1666-5624",,,,65,36,38,0,37,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1996,77,8,,,,,2445,2457,,10.2307/2265745,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VY497,WOS:A1996VY49700016,,,,,2021-09-21,

Previous studies have suggested that Enallagma damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) invaded aquatic habitats with large dragonflies as the top predators at least twice, and large changes in morphological structures (e.g., caudal lamellae acid abdomen), which should increase swimming speed, are associated with these invasions. This is significant because these species swim away from attacking predators, whereas species in the ancestral habitat (habitats with fish as the top predators) do not swim from attacking predators. We quantified swimming speed over a large ontogenetic size range for larvae of seven Enallagma species, two in dragonfly lakes and five in fish lakes. Results of analysis of covariance and a modification of Felsenstein's method of evolutionary contrasts indicate that a large evolutionary increase in the slope of the ontogenetic relationship between swimming speed and log(e)(body length) is associated with invasions into dragonfly lakes, and this shift results in larvae of dragonfly-lake species being faster swimmers, especially in larger size classes, than larvae of fish-lake species. We also present experimental results demonstrating that damselflies with larger lamellae are faster swimmers and have higher survival when exposed to dragonfly predation. The results of this study indicate that the change in selective environment associated with habitat shifts into dragonfly lakes promoted adaptations for increased swimming speed in Enallagma lineages. The potential ramifications of this adaptation for community structure are discussed.","BUCKNELL UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LEWISBURG, PA 17837 USA","McPeek, MA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

This lake is sited outside the natural range of the ruffe and has a lower fish diversity and a different fish species composition than within its native range. From June through September the ruffe was planktivorous and mainly caught at 4 to 6 m depth in the benthic zone. At other times of year ruffe was feeding on zoobenthos and caught deeper in the benthic zone. Ruffe was mainly day active. Zooplankton feeding during summer is the dearest difference compared to ruffe populations living within its natural range. Presence of large zooplankton organisms available for ruffe is suggested as the main reason for the difference found in food choice. The availability of large zooplankton is probably due to community structure caused by a predator and lack of interspecific competition for zooplankton in the deeper parts of the lake. Piscivorous brown trout, Salmo trutta, restrict the habitat of threespined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to the zone of littoral vegetation, allowing high densities of larger zooplankton species like Bythotrephes longimanus to be present in the lake.

Migrants arrive at their breeding areas later than their main avian predators, European Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). We provide evidence that avian predators are a major factor modifying the breeding bird assemblage of a large field. The distribution of kestrels (hence, predation) was manipulated using nest boxes, which are the only nesting places in open farmland. We counted birds on nine 25-ha plots in which a kestrel pair bred, and on nine control areas situated >1000 m from the nearest kestrel nest in large agricultural fields during early summer 1992. We also counted birds on 15 transect lines (length 1000 m, width 100 m) radiating away from kestrel nests. Observations of the hunting behavior of breeding kestrels showed that kestrels mostly captured their prey items <1000 m from their nest. Breeding bird density was higher on control areas than on areas close to a kestrel nest. In particular, densities of migratory and small birds (body mass <140 g), which are potential prey of kestrels, were lowest near the predator nests. In contrast, the densities of nonmigratory and large-sized birds (body mass >140 g) were independent of the presence of kestrel nests. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis), the most abundant migratory species in the study area, bred less often near kestrel nests than farther away. The results of line transect counts corroborated results of area counts. Our conclusion is that predation risk influences habitat selection of small migratory species in open habitats where scarce vegetative cover gives little protection.","UNIV JYVASKYLA, DEPT BIOL, SF-40351 JYVASKYLA, FINLAND; UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT ZOOL, DIV ECOL, SF-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND; UNIV TURKU, DEPT BIOL, ECOL ZOOL LAB, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND",,,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Suhonen, Jukka/0000-0001-8546-8945",,,,65,84,87,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1994,75,6,,,,,1626,1634,,10.2307/1939623,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE267,WOS:A1994PE26700011,,,,,2021-09-21,

We conducted a 2-year study of Anolis nebulosus Weigman with the aim of understanding the effects of seasonality and predation on the behaviour of this tropical, mainland anole. The study was carried out in a deciduous forest at the Estacion de Biologia Chamela on the Pacific coast of Mexico. This area has a severe 6-7 month dry season and the largest seasonal fluctuations in arthropod numbers and biomass yet recorded for a tropical habitat. As is characteristic of mainland anoles, the A. nebulosus population in the Chamela forest experiences high predation rates and low annual survivorship. 2. Our results indicate that seasonality and predation are major forces shaping the foraging strategies, activity levels, and social behaviour of A. nebulosus. In response to the wet season flush of insects, males and females shift from ground to arboreal foraging and increase feeding rates 5-10-fold. Males also travel further to capture prey and change their foraging mode, switching from trunk-ground, sit-and-wait foraging in the dry season to trunk-crown, mobile foraging in the wet season. 3. During the dry season, male and female A. nebulosus are the most sedentary lizards known, moving only once or twice per hour, and travelling a maximum of 8-9 m day- 1. During the wet season females are 2-3 times and males 5-10 times more active. Following the brief breeding period, however, both males and females retreat into unexposed hiding places and are emergent and active for only 1 or 2 days week-1. This reclusive behaviour and the exceptional levels of inactivity found in this species are most likely adaptations that reduce the risk of predation. 4. During the wet season breeding period, male A. nebulosus increase display rates 15-30-fold and expand their home ranges 10-15-fold. Compared to insular populations of A. nebulosus, however, the Chamela males invest significantly less time courting females (49% vs. 95%) and more time hiding and resting (44% vs. 1%). Such differences suggest that mainland males are trading off the probability of encountering and mating with females for enhanced safety. 5. Time budget analysis reveals that females devote more time to foraging than males during both wet and dry seasons. This strategy may enhance female fitness by increasing growth rate, fat reserves, and egg production. Males divide their time equally between resting/hiding and foraging and allocate only a small proportion of their day to social activities, except during the breeding period when the majority of their time and energy is invested in reproductive behaviour.","UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO,ESTAC BIOL,CHAMELA,JALISCO,MEXICO","LISTER, BC (corresponding author), NORTHEASTERN UNIV,DEPT BIOL,BOSTON,MA 02115, USA.",,,,,,,96,97,102,1,34,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Once plants become autotrophic, interactions within and between plant species may occur and these interactions may range from antagonistic to mutualistic. This full range of potential interactions needs to be considered to ensure successful revegetation. At the intraspecific level, we propose the development and use of density-yield diagrams for rangeland species. These diagrams would be based on the self-thinning principle, that aboveground biomass is related to plant density and to the dynamic process of density-dependent mortality. The proposed approach would be used to determine optimum seeding rates, and to predict future biomass of revegetated rangeland. At the interspecific level, competitive relationships of species used to reseed rangelands need to be identified to enhance the probability that species will coexist and thereby facilitate greater species diversity on the site. A diversity of species and growth forms may provide a more stable cover and productivity than a monoculture on sites characterized by environmental variability while potentially enhancing nutrient status for the site.","TEXAS A&M UNIV SYST, DEPT RANGELAND ECOL & MANAGEMENT, COLLEGE STN, TX 77843 USA; UTAH STATE UNIV, CTR ECOL, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA","PYKE, DA (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT RANGE SCI, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,"Pyke, David A./AAW-8291-2020","Pyke, David A./0000-0002-4578-8335",,,,120,61,62,0,24,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

The site is unusual in that the amphipod Corophium volutator is absent. In flats where the above polychaetes and Corophium co-occur, fish and shorebird predators significantly affect Corophium abundance but not polychaete abundance. Experiments were performed at Porter Point to determine whether fish and shorebirds depress polychaete abundance in the absence of their preferred prey. Caging experiments, with cages erected in late May 1985 and sampled in early July and in late August, revealed that Tharyx abundance was significantly higher within cages, demonstrating a significant effect of epibenthic predators. No other species showed significant differences in abundance between caged and control areas. Experiments demonstrate that fish prey on Tharyx but shorebirds do not. No species showed significant differences in abundance between caged and control areas in October collections. Winter ice, present between mid-December and mid-March, did not lead to a decline in the abundance of any taxon.

Three of the problems that have been identified are (i) the absence of frequency-dependence, which is important for long-term coexistence of species, (ii) the need to take unmeasured (often unmeasurable) variables influencing individual performance into account (e.g. spatial variation in soil nutrients or pathogens) and (iii) the need to separate measurement error from biological variation. Methods We modified the classical Lotka-Volterra competition models to address these limitations. We fitted eight alternative models to pin-point cover data on Festuca ovina and Agrostis capillaris over 3 years in an herbaceous plant community in Denmark. A Bayesian modeling framework was used to ascertain whether the model amendments improve the performance of the models and increase their ability to predict community dynamics and to test hypotheses. Important Findings Inclusion of frequency-dependence and measurement error, but not unmeasured variables, improved model performance greatly. Our results emphasize the importance of comparing alternative models in quantitative studies of plant community dynamics. Only by considering possible alternative models can we identify the forces driving community assembly and change, and improve our ability to predict the behavior of plant communities.","[Damgaard, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosdence, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Weiner, Jacob] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, DK-1871 Frederiksberg, Denmark","Damgaard, C (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosdence, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.",cfd@bios.au.dk,"Weiner, Jacob/E-1839-2011; Damgaard, Christian/G-2441-2010","Weiner, Jacob/0000-0002-0736-7943; Damgaard, Christian/0000-0003-3932-4312",Danish Environmental Protection Agency,We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers who provided valuable suggestions on previous versions of the manuscript.

Key interactions may take place between individuals of the same species but also between individuals belonging to different species. However, the most accepted definition of social behavior only considers interactions between conspecifics. Here, we argue that the distinction between intra- and interspecific interactions is largely artificial and hinders the integration of the historically separately developed concepts. At the ultimate level, given that the ecological landscape of organisms is composed both by interactions with conspecifics and with heterospecifics, and both types of interactions may have evolutionary consequences. Although intraspecific interactions usually have a higher impact in fitness because in most species interactions relevant for reproduction (mating, parenting) exclusively involve conspecifics, and interactions relevant for survival are more probable between conspecifics because they share the same ecological niche, hence competing for the same resources (e.g., food, shelter), there are notable exceptions in both fitness components (e.g., heterospecific mating in parthenogenic all-female species; heterospecific brood parasitism; heterospecific aggression in sympatric species that compete for shared resources). At the proximate level, behaviors and cognitive decision-making rules used to interact with other organisms may be shared between intra- and interspecific interactions, and the mechanistic differences between conspecific social behaviors used in distinct functional domains, such as mating, aggression, or parenting, can be more expressive than those found within the same functional domain between conspecific and heterospecific behavior. Therefore, there are neither fundamental conceptual (ultimate) reasons, nor key differences in mechanisms underlying behaviors involved in conspecific vs. heterospecific interactions that support the exclusion of interspecific interactions from the conceptual framework of social behavior.","[Oliveira, Rui F.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal; [Oliveira, Rui F.] ISPA Inst Univ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Oliveira, Rui F.] Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, Lisbon, Portugal; [Bshary, Redouan] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Neuchatel, Switzerland","Oliveira, RF (corresponding author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Oeiras, Portugal.",ruiol@ispa.pt,,,,,,191,1,1,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,OCT,2021,127,10,,,,,758,773,,10.1111/eth.13194,,,16,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,UO3OI,WOS:000694606400004,,,,,2021-09-21,

As nocturnal mammals, bats are often adversely affected by ALAN, yet some light-opportunistic species exploit it by hunting insects swarming near lights. Here we used two potentially competing pipistrelle species as models, Kuhl's (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and common (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) pipistrelles, both known to forage in artificially illuminated areas. We set our study in a mountainous area of central Italy, where only recently did the two species become syntopic. We applied spatial modelling and radiotracking to contrast potential vs. actual environmental preferences by the two pipistrelles. Species distribution models and niche analysis showed a large interspecific niche overlap, including a preference for illuminated areas, presenting a potential competition scenario. Pipistrellus pipistrellus association with ALAN, however, was weakened by adding P. kuhlii as a biotic variable to the model. Radiotracking showed that the two species segregated habitats at a small spatial scale and that P. kuhlii used artificially illuminated sites much more frequently than P. pipistrellus, despite both species potentially being streetlamp foragers. We demonstrate that ALAN influences niche segregation between two potentially competing species, confirming its pervasive effects on species and community dynamics, and provide an example of how light pollution and species' habitat preferences may weave a tapestry of complex ecological interactions.

Models of character displacement often ascribe interspecific competitive interactions to a single character, but multiple characters contribute to competition, and their effects on selection can be nonadditive. Focusing on one character, we ask if other characters that affect competition alter evolutionary outcomes for the focal character. We address this question using the variable environment seed bank model for two species with two traits. The focal trait is the temporal pattern of germination, which is evolutionary labile. The other trait is the temporal pattern of plant growth, which is assumed fixed. We ask whether evolutionary divergence of germination patterns between species depends on species differences in plant growth. Patterns of growth can affect selection on germination patterns in two ways. First, cues present at germination can provide information about future growth. Second, germination and growth jointly determine the biomass of plants, which determines demand for resources. Germination and growth contribute to the selection gradient in distinct components, one density-independent and the other density-dependent. Importantly, the relative strengths of the components are key. When the density-dependent component is stronger, displacement in germination patterns between species is larger. Stronger cues at germination strengthen the density-independent component by increasing the benefits of germinating in years of favorable growth. But cues also affect the density dependent component by boosting a species' biomass, and hence its competitive effect, in good years. Consequently, cues weaken character displacement when growth patterns are similar for two competitors, but favor displacement when growth patterns are species-specific. Understanding how these selection components change between contexts can help understand the origin and maintenance of species differences in germination patterns in temporally fluctuating environments.

These predators compete over sites that either enable the construction of suitable traps, are prey rich, or simply satisfy their abiotic requirements. We examined the effect of intraspecific competition over suitable space in pit-building wormlions. As expected, the ability of wormlions to select their favorable microhabitats-shaded or deep sand over lit or shallow sand-decreased with increasing density. Favorable microhabitats were populated more frequently by large than by small individuals and the density of individuals in the favorable microhabitat decreased with their increase in body mass. The advantage of large individuals in populating favorable microhabitats is nevertheless not absolute: both size categories constructed smaller pits when competing over a limited space compared to those constructed in isolation. The outcome of competition also depends on the type of habitat: deep sand is more important for large wormlions than small ones, while shade is similarly important for both size classes. Finally, in contrast to previous reports, cannibalism is shown here to be possible in wormlions. Its prevalence however is much lower compared to that documented in other trap-building predators. Our findings show that the advantage of large individuals over small ones should not be taken for granted, as it can depend on the environmental context. We present suggestions for the relative lack of competitive advantage of large wormlion individuals compared to other trap-building predators, which may stem from the absence of obvious weaponry, such as sharp mandibles.","[Scharf, Inon; Reshef, May Hershkovitz; Avidov, Bar] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Ovadia, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel","Scharf, I (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",scharfi@tauex.tau.ac.il,,,Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [442/16],We thank the Israel Science Foundation (Grant No. 442/16) for funding this study.,,80,1,1,3,3,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JUN 17,2021,11,1,,,,,,,12733,10.1038/s41598-021-92154-7,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,SX0HU,WOS:000664893900002,34140585,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

Examining competition for carrion in a risk-reward framework allows for a better understanding of how predator guilds compete for and benefit from carrion. We used trail camera data to compare wintertime carrion use and vigilance behavior of four carnivores in Denali National Park and Preserve. We found that carrion use was dominated by wolves (Canis lupus) and wolverines (Gulo gulo), followed by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and coyotes (Canis latrans). Wolves and wolverines were twice as likely to visit a carcass as foxes and coyotes, and their visits were longer and more numerous. Our results suggest scavenging animals reduced their risk exposure primarily by reducing their use of carrion, with some evidence of increased vigilance at busy sites. We found that carrion use and behavior at carcass sites were influenced by the mortality type of the carcass, the age of the carcass, and the long-term intensity of wolf use in the area. Our results also suggest that wolves are the top scavenger, and indicate that intraguild competition for carrion strongly affects which species benefit from carrion, with larger and more aggressive species dominating.","[Klauder, Kaija J.; Sivy, Kelly J.; Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Coll Environm, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Borg, Bridget L.] Natl Pk Serv, Denali Natl Pk & Preserve, POB 9, Denali Natl Pk, AK 99755 USA","Klauder, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Coll Environm, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kaijaklauder@gmail.com,,,National Park Service (CESU) [P15AC01013]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1652420],"The authors thank T.

Thus, understanding how composition of the plant community responds to different management practices under given soil and climatic conditions is crucial for making best use of grasslands. modeling approaches may be used to explain the manifold interactions involved to sustain this diversity. We developed the dynamic, process-based ecological model DynaGraM to simulate the seasonal aboveground vegetation dynamics of semi-natural grasslands. The model allows specifying plant community by any number of species. The predictive power of the model was assessed by simulating the dynamics of a virtual mountain grassland in response to four typical management scenarios under constant climatic conditions over several decades. In our experiments, we modelled an assemblage of seven species representing contrasted plant functional types. We compared model outputs to compositions inferred from floristic records conducted in the French Jura Mountains. Irrespective of initial conditions, the simulated community converged to four distinct compositions that primarily reflected management. Overall, the results matched the functional composition inferred for each of the scenarios from the botanical records. Convergence in functional composition was reached in less than 15 years under grazing scenarios, but not less than 50 years under mowing scenarios. At quasi-equilibrium, the highest vegetation diversity was obtained for extensive grazing and the lowest for extensive mowing. Overall, this study introduces a novel and relatively simple approach to model competition and adaptation processes in plant community dynamics, thus providing a response to the key challenge of modeling multi-species grasslands.","[Moulin, Thibault; Calanca, Pierluigi] Agroscope, Agroecol & Environm, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Moulin, Thibault; Perasso, Antoine; Gillet, Francois] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR Chronoenvironm 6249, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France","Moulin, T (corresponding author), Agroscope, Agroecol & Environm, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.; Moulin, T (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR Chronoenvironm 6249, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France.",thibault.moulin@posteo.net; antoine.perasso@univ-fcomte.fr; pierluigi.calanca@agroscope.admin.ch; francois.gillet@univ-fcomte.fr,"Gillet, Francois/B-6160-2008","Gillet, Francois/0000-0002-3334-1069; Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",,,,62,2,2,5,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

To do so, we developed a new analytical approach that combines camera trap data (spatial location, visitor species, date and time, activity) and tailored null models that allowed us to infer spatial-temporal interactions (attraction, avoidance or indifference) between pairs of frugivore species. To illustrate our approach, we chose to study the system composed by the Mediterranean dwarf palm,Chamaerops humilis, the Iberian pear tree,Pyrus bourgaeana, and their shared functionally diverse assemblages of vertebrate frugivores in a Mediterranean area of SW Spain. We first assessed the extent to which different pairs of frugivore species tend to visit the same or different fruiting individual plants. Then, for pairs of species that used the same individual plants, we evaluated their spatial-temporal relationship. Our first step showed, for instance, that some prey frugivore species (e.g. lagomorphs) tend to avoid thoseC.humilisindividuals that were most visited by their predators (e.g. red foxes). Also, the second step revealed temporal attraction between large wild and domestic frugivore ungulates (e.g. red deer, cows) and medium-sized frugivores (e.g. red foxes) suggesting that large mammals could facilitate theC.humilisandP.bourgaeanaexploitation to other smaller frugivores by making fruits more easily accessible. Finally, our results allowed us to identify direct interaction pathways, that revealed how the mutualistic and antagonistic relations between animal associates derived into indirect effects on both plants seed dispersal success. For instance, we found that large-sized seed predators (e.g. ungulates) had a direct positive effect on the likelihood of visits by legitimate seed dispersers (e.g. red foxes) to both fleshy fruited plants. Then, seed predators showed an indirect positive effect on the plants' reproductive success. Our new analytical approach provides a widely applicable framework for further studies on multispecies interactions in different systems beyond plant-frugivore interactions, including plant-pollinator interactions, the exploitation of plants by herbivores, and the use of carcasses by vertebrate scavengers.","[Selwyn, Miriam; Garrote, Pedro J.; Castilla, Antonio R.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves CEABN InBIO, Lisbon, Portugal; [Fedriani, Jose M.] Ctr Invest Desertificac CIDE CSIC, Carretera Moncada Naquera, Valencia, Spain; [Fedriani, Jose M.] Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, Seville, Spain","Selwyn, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves CEABN InBIO, Lisbon, Portugal.; Fedriani, JM (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Desertificac CIDE CSIC, Carretera Moncada Naquera, Valencia, Spain.; Fedriani, JM (corresponding author), Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, Seville, Spain.",mimselwyn@gmail.com; fedriani@csic.es,"Castilla, Antonio R./A-3877-2019","Castilla, Antonio R./0000-0002-4124-738X; Selwyn, Miriam/0000-0002-3773-1734","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades [PGC2018-094808-B-I00]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BD/130527/2017]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission; Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission; Consejeria de Educacion, Junta de Castilla y LeonJunta de Castilla y Leon","This study has been funded by a grant from the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades, PGC2018-094808-B-I00, to Jose M.

In coastal Newfoundland, Canada, capelin Mallotus villosus is the focal forage fish species that many top predators feed on during the summer: however, inshore availability varies throughout the boreal summer when abundant aggregations migrate inshore to spawn. We investigated the interactions and responses of Great Shearwaters Ardenna gravis and Sooty Shearwaters A. grisea during their non-breeding season to supplemental food supply under changing natural prey availability (higher and lower capelin availability) by conducting an at-sea experiment during July-August (2015/2016) in coastal Newfoundland. Supplemental food was offered every 30 s over 10 min (`experimental period'), which was preceded and followed by 10-min control periods (i.e., no food provided). The number of both species increased during the experimental periods, indicating that both species were attracted to the food supplementation experiment. Great Shearwaters were 7.6-13.8 times more likely than Sooty Shearwaters to land near the experimental platform and 95.2 times more likely than Sooty Shearwaters to fight over supplemental food items with individuals of the same or different species. These species-specific tendencies remained consistent as prey availability varied within years, but both species increased in their abundance and interactions with other species (including Herring Gulls Larus argentatus and Northern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialis) during prey capture at lower relative to higher prey availability, as evidenced by lower proportions of flying birds and a greater likelihood of landing on the water. Overall, we suggest that when Great and Sooty shearwaters feed in close association, Great Shearwaters are the more competitively dominant species, which may lead to higher risks of by-catch mortality, especially when the availability of natural prey decreases.","[Carvalho, Paloma C.; Maynard, Laurie D.; Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Carvalho, PC (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",ccpaloma@gmail.com,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2014-06290, 470195-2015, 486208-2016]; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship; CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education PersonnelCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001203/2013-04]","This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (2014-06290) to GKD; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Ship Time Grants (470195-2015, 486208-2016) to GKD; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support Program grants (2015-2016) to GKD; Manitoba Graduate Fellowship to LDM, and CAPES Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (001203/2013-04) to PCC.

Both conflict and cooperation in animal societies are often environmentally regulated, yet how individuals alter their cooperative and competitive investments as environmental quality changes remain unclear. Using game theoretic modelling, we predict that individuals of all ranks will invest more in cooperation and less in social conflict in harsh environments than individuals of the same ranks in benign environments. Counterintuitively, low-ranking subordinates should increase their investment in cooperation proportionally more than high-ranking dominants, suggesting that subordinates contribute relatively more when facing environmental challenges. We then test and confirm these predictions experimentally using the Asian burying beetleNicrophorus nepalensis.

The effects of these two stressors on coral physiology are relatively well studied, but their impact on biotic interactions between corals are poorly understood. While coral-coral interactions are less common on modern reefs, it is important to document the nature of these interactions to better inform restoration strategies in the face of climate change. Using a mesocosm study, we evaluated whether the combined effects of ocean acidification and warming alter the competitive interactions between the common coralPorites astreoidesand two other mounding corals (Montastraea cavernosaorOrbicella faveolata) common in the Caribbean. After 7 days of direct contact,P.astreoidessuppressed the photosynthetic potential ofM.cavernosaby 100% in areas of contact under both present (similar to 28.5 degrees C and similar to 400 mu atmpCO(2)) and predicted future (similar to 30.0 degrees C and similar to 1000 mu atmpCO(2)) conditions. In contrast, under present conditionsM.cavernosareduced the photosynthetic potential ofP.astreoidesby only 38% in areas of contact, while under future conditions reduction was 100%. A similar pattern occurred betweenP.astreoidesandO.faveolataat day 7 post contact, but by day 14, each coral had reduced the photosynthetic potential of the other by 100% at the point of contact, andO.faveolatawas generating larger lesions onP.astreoidesthan the reverse. In the absence of competition, OA and warming did not affect the photosynthetic potential of any coral. These results suggest that OA and warming can alter the severity of initial coral-coral interactions, with potential cascading effects due to corals serving as foundation species on coral reefs.","[Johnston, Nicole K.; Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Johnston, Nicole K.; Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Aquat Chem Ecol Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Campbell, Justin E.] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL USA; [Campbell, Justin E.; Paul, Valerie J.] Smithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL USA","Johnston, NK (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.; Johnston, NK (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Aquat Chem Ecol Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",njohnston7@gatech.edu,"Hay, Mark E/D-9752-2011","Hay, Mark E/0000-0002-6130-9349",Smithsonian/Link Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Teasley Endowment,"This research was funded by a Smithsonian/Link Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship granted to NKJ and the Teasley Endowment to the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Competitive performance is often interpreted in terms of biological species traits such as fecundity, resource use, and predation. However, many studies only measure competitive ability when species enter an environment simultaneously, and thus do not consider how the relative timing of species' arrival may determine competitive outcome (i.e., priority effects). Whether priority effects may influence competition inTriboliumremains to be tested. The present study examined the importance of priority effects in competitions between two common species of flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae):Tribolium castaneumandT.confusum. To investigate whether priority effects confer competitive advantages toTriboliumbeetles, relative introduction times ofT.castaneumandT.confusumto competitive arenas were manipulated, and adult populations were measured for seven months. Four important patterns were noted: (1)Triboliumspecies given two-weeks priority access to experimental arenas attained larger populations than their late-arriving competitor, (2) when founding adults were introduced simultaneously,T.castaneumwas competitively dominant, (3)T.castaneumbenefited more from priority arrival thanT.confusum, and (4) available bran resources largely predicted population decline in adult beetles toward the end of the experiment. These results suggest competitive outcome inTriboliumis not always predicted by species' identity, and that performance could instead be determined by the timing of species' arrivals and available resources.","[Holditch, Zane; Smith, Aaron D.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Smith, Aaron D.] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Smith, AD (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.; Smith, AD (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",Pimeliinae@gmail.com,,"Smith, Aaron/0000-0002-1286-950X",NSF ARTS program [DEB-1523605],This study was funded by the NSF ARTS program (DEB-1523605).,,59,0,0,0,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUL 9,2020,15,7,,,,,,,e0235289,10.1371/journal.pone.0235289,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,MQ0QU,WOS:000552602700069,32645709,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

Although competition and predation are known to act simultaneously in communities, theory and empirical study of these processes continue to be developed largely independently. Here, we integrate modern coexistence theory and food web theory to simultaneously quantify the relative importance of predation and environmental fluctuations for species coexistence. We first examine coexistence in a theoretical, multitrophic model, adding complexity to the food web using machine learning approaches. We then apply our framework to a stochastic model of the rocky intertidal food web, partitioning empirical coexistence dynamics. We find the main effects of both environmental fluctuations and variation in predator abundances contribute substantially to species coexistence. Unexpectedly, their interaction tends to destabilise coexistence, leading to new insights about the role of bottom-up vs. top-down forces in both theory and the rocky intertidal ecosystem.","[Shoemaker, Lauren G.] Univ Wyoming, Bot Dept, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Barner, Allison K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Barner, Allison K.] Colby Coll, Dept Biol, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Bittleston, Leonora S.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bittleston, Leonora S.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Teufel, Ashley, I] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Teufel, Ashley, I] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Shoemaker, LG (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Bot Dept, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.; Barner, AK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Barner, AK (corresponding author), Colby Coll, Dept Biol, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",lshoema1@uwyo.edu; allison.barner@colby.edu,,"Bittleston, Leonora/0000-0003-4007-5405; Barner, Allison/0000-0001-9909-5713; Shoemaker, Lauren/0000-0002-4465-8432","James S.

In recent studies, models of competitive interactions failed predictive tests, thereby casting doubt on results of many past studies. We believe these model failures owe at least partly to heterogeneity in unmodeled factors (e.g., nutrients, soil pathogens) that affect both target plants and neighboring competitors. Such heterogeneity is ubiquitous, and models that do not account for it will suffer omitted variable bias. We used instrumental variables analysis to test for and correct omitted variable bias in studies that followed common protocols for measuring plant competition. In an observational study, omitted variables caused competition to seem like mutualism. In a quasi-experiment that partially controlled competitor abundances with seeding, omitted variables caused competition to seem about 35% weaker than it really was, even though the experiment occurred in an abandoned agricultural field where environmental heterogeneity was expected to be relatively low. Despite decades of research, consistently accurate estimates of competitive interactions remain elusive. The most foolproof way around this problem is true experiments that avoid omitted variable bias by completely controlling competitor abundances, but such experiments are rare.","[Rinella, Matthew J.; Strong, Dustin J.; Vermeire, Lance T.] ARS, USDA, 243 Ft Keogh Rd, Miles City, MT 59301 USA","Rinella, MJ (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, 243 Ft Keogh Rd, Miles City, MT 59301 USA.",matt.rinella@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,43,4,4,4,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2020,101,6,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.3020,,APR 2020,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LU9YA,WOS:000523634900001,32083313,,,,2021-09-21,

The reported first genome sequence of a tropical rubber tree pathogen R. microporus should contribute to the better understanding of how the fungus is able to facilitate wood decay and nutrient cycling as well as tolerate latex and utilize resinous extractives.","[Oghenekaro, Abbot O.] Univ Benin, Fac Life Sci, Dept Plant Biol & Biotechnol, PMB 1154, Benin, Nigeria; [Oghenekaro, Abbot O.; Kovalchuk, Andriy; Raffaello, Tommaso; Liu, Mengxia; Ren, Fei; Wen, Zilan; Zeng, Zhen; Asiegbu, Fred O.] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Camarero, Susana; Martinez, Angel T.; Javier Ruiz-Duenas, Francisco; Serrano, Ana] CSIC, Ctr Invest Biol, Ramiro Maeztu 9, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Gressler, Markus] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Hans Knoll Inst, Dept Pharmaceut Microbiol, Jena, Germany; [Henrissat, Bernard] Aix Marseille Univ, Architecture & Fonct Macromol Biol, CNRS, UMR 7257, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; [Henrissat, Bernard] INRA, USC1408, Architecture & Fonct Macromol Biol, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Henrissat, Bernard] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Jeddah 23218, Saudi Arabia; [Lee, Juna; Mihaltcheva, Sirma; Pangilinan, Jasmyn; Riley, Robert; Barry, Kerrie; Grigoriev, Igor, V] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miettinen, Otto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ren, Fei] Univ Helsinki, Mycol Unit, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Bot Museum, POB 7, Helsinki, Finland; [Thon, Michael R.] Chinese Acad Forestry, Forestry Expt Ctr North China, Beijing 102300, Peoples R China; [Grigoriev, Igor, V] Univ Salamanca, Inst Hispano Luso Invest Agr CIALE, Villamayor, Spain; [Martin, Francis] Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA, Lab Excellence Adv Res Biol Tree & Forest Ecosyst, UMR 1136, Champenoux, France; [Martin, Francis] Univ Lorraine, Lab Excellence ARBRE, UMR 1136, Champenoux, France; [Oghenekaro, Abbot O.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Plant Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Asiegbu, FO (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Fred.Asiegbu@helsinki.fi,"Thon, Michael R/M-9463-2014; Ruiz-Duenas, Francisco J/L-9837-2015; Serrano, Ana/AAY-5404-2021; Henrissat, Bernard/J-2475-2012","Thon, Michael R/0000-0002-7225-7003; Ruiz-Duenas, Francisco J/0000-0002-9837-5665; Serrano, Ana/0000-0002-7057-0418; Henrissat, Bernard/0000-0002-3434-8588; Zeng, Zhen/0000-0002-4351-1244; Asiegbu, Fred O/0000-0003-0223-7194; Oghenekaro, Abbot/0000-0003-3725-9529; Kovalchuk, Andriy/0000-0001-8704-4644; Barry, Kerrie/0000-0002-8999-6785; Raffaello, Tommaso/0000-0002-4074-0682; Riley, Robert/0000-0003-0224-0975","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [307580]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; EnzOx2 EU project [BBI-PPP-2015-2-720297]; GENOBIOREF project of the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [BIO2017-86559-R]; FEDER fundsEuropean Commission","This project was financially supported by Academy of Finland (Grant No. 307580).

Niche traits (those that describe a species' niche) are not constant within a species, and the importance of intraspecific variation is increasingly appreciated. However, little is known about the extent of niche variability across species. This study investigated variation in dietary and temporal niches of ant species in two tropical rainforests. 2. Ants were collected from baits reflecting seven different natural resources and from pitfalls at 128 grid points. Sampling was done separately for day and night. Co-occurrence analyses were used to estimate the monopolisation capacity of each species. 3. It was expected that species would show similar dietary and temporal preferences across sites. Therefore, species with high or low niche variability between grid points (within a site) should show similar tendencies when comparing sites. It was predicted that between sites, intraspecific variability should be lower than interspecific variability, and that numerically dominant species should have higher monopolisation rates and lower intraspecific niche variability than less common ones. 4. These results showed that niche traits such as temporal activity and realised food niche shifted drastically between conspecifics of different sites. Even the most common species showed different food or temporal preferences between sites. In general, species with the highest monopolisation rates displayed lower niche variability. 5. This study also demonstrates that niche characterisation via combined continuous rather than categorical values permits a quantification of a species' niche variability. Categorising niche traits without considering context dependency may be misleading if one tries to assess niche width and a species' ability to cope with environmental change.","[Houadria, Mickal; Menzel, Florian] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool, Fac Biol, Mainz, Germany; [Houadria, Mickal] Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Houadria, M (corresponding author), Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",mickal.houadria@free.fr,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [ME 3842/1-1],"We thank the SaBC, DVMC and SEARPP for permission to carry out research in Danum and Malua.

Interspecies interactions occur between species in mixed biofilms promoting different outcomes to each species. Here we describe the interactions between E. coli and S. Enteritidis strains, and their control using specific phages. Single-species biofilms presented more cells compared to dual-species biofilms. The spatial organization of strains, observed by confocal microscopy, revealed similar arrangements in both single- and dual-species biofilms. The EPS matrix composition, assessed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, disclosed that the spectra extracted from the different dual-species biofilms can either be a combination of both species EPS matrix components or that the EPS matrix of one species predominates. Phages damaged more the single-species biofilms than the mixed biofilms, showing also that the killing efficacy was greatly dependent on the phage growth characteristics, bacterial growth parameters, and bacterial spatial distribution in biofilms. This combination of methodologies provides new knowledge of species-species and phage-host interactions in biofilms of these two major foodborne pathogens.","[Milho, Catarina; Silva, Maria Daniela; Alves, Diana; Oliveira, Hugo; Azeredo, Joana] Univ Minho, LIBRO Lab Invest Biofilmes Rosario Oliveira, Ctr Biol Engn, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Clara] Univ Porto, Fac Pharm, Chem Sci Dept, REQUIMTE,LAQV, P-4050313 Porto, Portugal; [Pastrana, Lorenzo M.; Sillankorva, Sanna] INL Int Iberian Nanotechnol Lab, Av Mestre Jose Veiga, P-4715330 Braga, Portugal","Sillankorva, S (corresponding author), INL Int Iberian Nanotechnol Lab, Av Mestre Jose Veiga, P-4715330 Braga, Portugal.",sanna.sillankorva@inl.int,"Pastrana, Lorenzo/AAZ-9606-2020; Sillankorva, Sanna/AAF-9356-2021; Oliveira, Hugo/O-5972-2015; Milho, Catarina/AAD-7116-2021; Milho, Catarina/Q-4744-2018","Pastrana, Lorenzo/0000-0002-6637-3462; Sillankorva, Sanna/0000-0002-8408-8550; Oliveira, Hugo/0000-0001-9564-5714; Milho, Catarina/0000-0002-9074-8498; Milho, Catarina/0000-0002-4176-765X; Silva, Maria Daniela/0000-0003-2495-6026; Sousa, Clara/0000-0002-7206-8771; Alves, Diana/0000-0001-8750-5439","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [713640, 778388]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/BIO/04469/2013]; COMPETE 2020 [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006684]; BioTecNorte operation - European Regional Development Fund under the scope of Norte2020 - Programa Operacional Regional do Norte [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000004]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/94434/2013, SFRH/BD/128825/2017]","This project also received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements No 713640, and No. 778388.

Our objective was to investigate how fire, rodent activity, and competition among plant species modify plant community structure, invasion patterns, and vulnerability to altered fire regimes. We imposed experimental fires, and reduced rodent density using fencing in a full factorial design and quantified competitive interactions among plant species in the northeast Mojave Desert that has experienced dramatic increases in plant invasion and fire in recent years. Vegetation surveys were conducted in the experimental plots to determine plant density, cover, and biomass of herbaceous plants over a 5-year period. Rodent exclusion increased the density, cover, and biomass of Bromus rubens, an invasive annual grass, and density of forb species. In contrast, rodent exclusion decreased the density, cover, and biomass of Schismus spp. another dominant annual invader. Fire increased Schismus spp. and forb species density, cover, and biomass but decreased B. rubens density. Negative spatial correlation between B. rubens and Schismus spp., and forbs indicated interspecific competition among the dominant plant species. Fire reduced rodent community diversity (Shannon's) 2.5-fold, which was correlated with increases in B. rubens cover and biomass, and native forb diversity. Fire, high rodent diversity, and competition from the other plant species may decrease fire potential in our study system by reducing the density and biomass of B. rubens, which because of its taller growth form tends to ignite and carry fire better than Schismus spp. and forbs.","[Bishop, Tara B.

To date, there have been numerous studies of niche differentiation in local ant communities, but little attention has been given to the macroecology of niche differentiation, including the extent to which particular biomes show distinctive patterns of niche structure across their global ranges. We investigated patterns of niche differentiation and competition in ant communities in tropical rainforests, using different baits reflecting the natural food spectrum. We examined the extent of temporal and dietary niche differentiation and spatial segregation of ant communities at five rainforest sites in the neotropics, paleotropics, and tropical Australia. Despite high niche overlap, we found significant dietary and temporal niche differentiation in every site. However, there was no spatial segregation among foraging ants at the community level, despite strong competition for preferred food resources. Although sucrose, melezitose, and dead insects attracted most ants, some species preferentially foraged on seeds, living insects, or bird feces. Moreover, most sites harbored more diurnal than nocturnal species. Overall niche differentiation was strongest in the least diverse site, possibly due to its lower number of rare species. Both temporal and dietary differentiation thus had strong effects on the ant assemblages, but their relative importance varied markedly among sites. Our analyses show that patterns of niche differentiation in ant communities are highly idiosyncratic even within a biome, such that a mechanistic understanding of the drivers of niche structure in ant communities remains elusive.","[Greve, Michael E.; Houadria, Mickal; Menzel, Florian] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Fac Biol, IOME, Mainz, Germany; [Greve, Michael E.] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Anim Populat Ecol, Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth, Germany; [Houadria, Mickal] Univ South Bohemia, Inst Entomol, Biol Ctr Acad Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Houadria, Mickal] Univ South Bohemia, Inst Entomol, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Andersen, Alan N.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Trop Ecosyst Res Ctr, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Andersen, Alan N.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia","Grev, ME (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Anim Ecol 1, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",michael.greve@uni-bayreuth.de,"Andersen, Alan N/F-8763-2010","Andersen, Alan N/0000-0003-1487-3323",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [ME 3842/1-1],"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), Grant/Award Number: ME 3842/1-1",,70,7,7,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Our aim was to identify how sympatric estuarine species of differing phenotypes form mixed-species group associations, and to identify changes to group structure of fish that migrate between mono- and mixed-species groups. We used sympatric yellow-eyed mullet (Aldrichetta forsteri), kahawai (Arripis trutta), and Australian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), representing different phenotypes for the mixed-species group, and yellow-eyed mullet for the mono- and mixed-species comparison. Group formation and structure was quantified in predator and foraging treatment groups. We used previous research in mono-species yellow-eyed mullet to compare behavioural plasticity with the current study. Our novel results suggest similar behavioural traits in mono- and mixed-species fish groups have beneficially co-evolved and importantly, behavioural plasticity is necessary for migration between groups.
