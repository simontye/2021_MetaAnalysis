In this context, intrinsic properties emerging from microbial interactions, such as efficient organization optimizing growth and activities in multispecies biofilms, may become the object of fitness selection. However, little is known on the nature of underlying interspecies interactions during establishment of a predictable spatial organization within multispecies biofilms We present a comparative metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial strains residing in triple-species and four-species biofilms, aiming at deciphering molecular mechanisms underpinning bacterial interactions responsible of the remarkably enhanced biomass production and associated typical spatial organization they display. Metatranscriptomic profiles concurred with changes in micro-site occupation in response to the addition/removal of a single species, being driven by both cooperation, competition, and facilitation processes. We conclude that the enhanced biomass production of the four-species biofilm is an intrinsic community property emerging from finely tuned space optimization achieved through concerted antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, where each species occupies a defined micro-site favoring its own growth. Our results further illustrate how molecular mechanisms can be better interpreted when supported by visual imaging of actual microscopic spatial organization, and we propose phenotypic adaptation selected by social interactions as molecular mechanisms stabilizing microbial communities.","[Liu, Wenzheng; Sorensen, Soren J.] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Food & Pharmaceut Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jacquiod, Samuel; Brejnrod, Asker; Russel, Jakob; Burmolle, Mette; Sorensen, Soren J.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Sect Microbiol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jacquiod, Samuel] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, Franche Comte, France","Sorensen, SJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Food & Pharmaceut Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Sorensen, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Sect Microbiol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",sjs@bio.ku.dk,"Sorensen, Soren Johannes/N-2120-2019; Jacquiod, Samuel/M-2259-2014","Sorensen, Soren Johannes/0000-0001-6227-9906; Jacquiod, Samuel/0000-0002-0713-7996; Brejnrod, Asker/0000-0002-1327-2051","Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [DFF-1323-00235]; Villum Foundation [10098, 11735]","This study was partly funded by grants from The Danish Council for Independent Research; ref no.

The delta N-15 ratios of fishes were significantly higher in the northern Lake than in the southern part. Furthermore, the trophic overlaps were higher in the south than in the north. Trophic niche width of C. auratus was the smallest as their food sources were easy to acquire, and consumers tended to specialize and narrow their trophic niches when food resource is abundant. S. asotus, a predator species, was short of animal food sources due to heavy fishing pressure. Therefore, its diet broadened, and the trophic niche width was the largest.","[Wang, Yuyu; Lei Guangchun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 10083, Peoples R China; [Zhang Huan] Nanchang Univ, Minist Educ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Poyang Lake Environm & Resource Utilizat, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Chen YuWei; Zhang Lu] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Poyang Lake Lab Wetland Ecosyst Res, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Lei, GC (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 10083, Peoples R China.",guangchun8099@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41301077],This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41301077).

Rapid evolution can occur over ecological time-scales, potentially resulting in altered temporal variation in abundance and complicating inferences about the consequences of temporal variation. We assessed whether evolution altered the temporal variability in species' abundances in simple assemblages of species. We then compared experimental results to predictions from two-species models to better understand our results in the context of competitive and predator-prey interactions. We compared founder populations and their evolved descendants in experimental communities of ciliates and rotifers. Using a series of orthogonal contrasts, we then evaluated whether: (a) evolutionary history of invaders or (b) residents, (c) co-evolution among invaders and residents, and (d) invasion itself altered temporal variability in species abundances following invasion by a novel species. Using two-species competition and predator-prey models, we also generated predictions to better understand the effects of evolution on temporal variation in the abundances of interacting species. Finally, we compared experimental and modelling results to aid in the interpretation of which interspecific interactions might be affected by ongoing evolution in our communities. In experimental populations, differing evolutionary histories resulted in significant differences among treatments in abundances and temporal variation in abundances of both resident and invading species. For the contrasts, we found evidence that evolutionary history of the invader and residents, co-evolution among invaders and residents, and invasion itself affected temporal variability in abundance, but the importance of each differed for the two communities and the species within those communities. When comparing experimental results to model predictions, the increased abundance and decreased temporal variation in one invader, Euplotes daidaleos, are potentially consistent with evolution resulting in reduced attack rates in the novel community. Evolutionary history alone can affect temporal variation in the abundances of species, generating important consequences for interspecific interactions among species and complicating inferences about the consequences of temporal variability in biological communities.","[Faillace, Cara A.; Morin, Peter J.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Faillace, Cara A.] Natl Ctr Sci Res France, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Moulis, France","Faillace, CA (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",c.faillace@gmail.com,,,Rutgers University; Rutgers University Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution,Rutgers University; Rutgers University Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolution,,50,4,4,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

(Hymenoptera: Vespidae), is a eusocial insect native to Eurasia that was accidentally introduced in the island of Sardinia (Italy) in 2010. This alien generalist predator could impact on native insect species through predation or competition by modifying interspecific relations in sensitive island ecosystems. As part of the Interreg project ALIEM, the present work regarded the first monitoring activity of the European hornet conducted in Sardinia by means of verified citizen science. The main goals of this study were to define the distribution area of the wasp in 2018 and evaluate the profile and the performance of citizen scientists. Our results showed that V. crabro is mainly located in north-eastern Sardinia and that the hotspot was probably the commercial port of Olbia. Furthermore, data provided by contributors were very accurate and none of the parameters considered to define the participants (age, gender, education level, job category) was a true predictor of a volunteer's ability to recognise the wasp. In conclusion, this small-scale study suggests that citizen scientists could be a valuable aid to monitor already-established alien species and could be part of a surveillance network for early detection of other potentially invasive alien species not yet introduced in Sardinia, such as the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, which is already present in northern Italy.","[Pusceddu, Michelina; Floris, Ignazio; Mannu, Roberto; Cocco, Arturo; Satta, Alberto] Univ Sassari, Sez Patol Vegetale & Entomol, Dipartimento Agr, Viale Italia 39, I-07100 Sassari, Italy","Satta, A (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Sez Patol Vegetale & Entomol, Dipartimento Agr, Viale Italia 39, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",albsatta@uniss.it,"Mannu, Roberto/L-7709-2015; Satta, Alberto/K-8597-2015; Cocco, Arturo/P-3006-2014","Mannu, Roberto/0000-0003-0693-0949; Satta, Alberto/0000-0003-1296-3835; Cocco, Arturo/0000-0002-8769-461X",Interreg ALIEM project Action pour Limiter les risques de diffusion des especes Introduites Envahissantes en Mediterranee,The Interreg ALIEM project Action pour Limiter les risques de diffusion des especes Introduites Envahissantes en Mediterranee (PC IFM 2014-2020) financially supported the present study.,,50,3,3,1,12,PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,SOFIA,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",1619-0033,1314-2488,,NEOBIOTA,NeoBiota,OCT 2,2019,,50,,,,,97,108,,10.3897/neobiota.50.37587,,,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JC9ZA,WOS:000489633900001,,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

The number of co-flowering species, floral density and floral trait diversity can be major determinants of pollinator-mediated plant-plant interactions in a community. However, evaluation of how each one of these co-flowering components affects the pollination success of a single focal plant species, and how these effects vary at different spatial scales, is lacking. 2. Here, we evaluated the effects of functional diversity (flower morphology and colour), taxonomic diversity (reflecting potential sampling effects) and flower density (conspecific and heterospecific), on the pollinator environment (i.e. visitation rate and pollinator diversity) and pollination success (i.e. pollen load size and number of pollen tubes per style) of Cakile edentula (Brassicaceae). We applied structural equation models (SEMs) at the floral-neighbourhood (plot level) and community-wide scales to uncover the factors that mediate co-flowering community effects on C. edentula pollination success. 3. We found that co-flowering community effects at the community level are more important than fine-scale floral-neighbourhood differences in mediating plant pollination success in our study species. Increasing plant functional diversity decreased pollinator visitation rate but increased the diversity of pollinator functional groups visiting C. edentula flowers. Taxonomic diversity negatively affected pollinator diversity suggesting that other unmeasured floral traits may be relevant or that single-species effects (sampling effects) may be important. Overall, our results suggest that functional floral trait diversity in a community may be the most important factor influencing pollination success of species in a community. We also found evidence for intra- and interspecific pollinator competition mediated by flower density, but none of these effects seemed to have a significant impact on pollination success. 4. This study is an important step towards understanding the complexity of co-flowering community effects on the pollination success of individual plant species at multiple spatial scales. This study further reveals the potential importance of plant functional diversity in a community in helping predict competitive and facilitative interactions in co-flowering communities. 5. Synthesis. Floral density and taxonomic and functional co-flowering diversity are important drivers of pollination success in flowering plants. The effects of the co-flowering diversity on the pollination success of plant species can largely depend on the spatial scale being studied. Only evaluating the outcomes of pollinator-mediated plant-plant interactions at multiple stages of the pollination process can lead to a complete understanding of their ecological consequences in nature.","[Albor, Cristopher; Garcia-Franco, Jose G.] Inst Ecol AC, Red Ecol Func, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Parra-Tabla, Victor] Univ Autonoma Yucatan, Dept Ecol Trop, Campus Ciencias Biol & Agr, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Diaz-Castelazo, Cecilia] Inst Ecol AC, Red Interacc Multitrof, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Arceo-Gomez, Gerardo] East Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Johnson City, TN 37614 USA","Arceo-Gomez, G (corresponding author), East Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Johnson City, TN 37614 USA.",gomezg@etsu.edu,"Albor, Cristopher/J-4028-2013","Albor, Cristopher/0000-0002-9870-4094; Parra-Tabla, Victor/0000-0001-5920-0881","INECOL; Instituto de Ecologia A.

As such, similar species breeding sympatrically are expected to have a high potential for competition and, thus, may have developed strategies to reduce niche overlap to allow coexistence. We combined GPS tracking and stable isotope analysis (delta N-15, delta C-13) to simultaneously compare multiple behavioral and dietary niche dimensions of common murres (Uria aalge) and razorbills (Alca torda) breeding at nearby colonies (55 km apart) on the northeastern Newfoundland coast under varying prey availability in 2017. Though foraging ranges of species had high potential overlap (5000 km(2)), foraging areas of the two species were spatially segregated. Dive characteristics also differed, as predicted based on body size and dive capacity. These differences contrasted a high degree of overlap in diet, habitat characteristics, and diurnal foraging patterns, suggesting that spatial segregation may be the most important factor to allow coexistence of these similar species for the same limited resources. As prey availability increased later in the breeding season, individual murres and razorbills foraged closer to their respective colonies and population-level diet composition changed, indicative of reduced energy costs and dietary plasticity to take advantage of highly available prey, capelin (Mallotus villosus). Foraging areas, however, remained segregated. Seabirds and marine systems face many potential threats, the greatest of which may be climate change. Thus, understanding variation in space, time, and habitat selection among similar species allowed for a more comprehensive view of the possible ways these species may partition their niche and how future changes to resource availability could impact interspecific relationships.","[Gulka, Julia; Davoren, Gail K.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Ronconi, Robert A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N6, Canada","Gulka, J (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",juliagulka@gmail.com,,"Gulka, Julia/0000-0002-5695-233X","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [2014-06290, 486208-2016, 501154-2017]; University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support program; National Geographic Young Explorers GrantNational Geographic Society [WW-075ER-17]; World Wildlife Fund-Canada [G-0618-583-00-D]; Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service; Atlantic Ecosystems Initiative","Principal funding was provided by National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery (2014-06290) and Ship Time Grants (486208-2016 and 501154-2017 to GKD), along with University of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork Support program grants (2016, 2017) to GKD.

We estimate the single and interactive effects of competition and extreme weather events on the performance of the global legume invader Lupinus polyphyllus (Lindl.). In three experimental studies we assessed (i) the stress tolerance of seedling and adult L. polyphyllus plants against extreme weather events (drought, fluctuating precipitation, late frost), (ii) the competitive effects of L. polyphyllus on native grassland species and vice versa, and (iii) the interactive effects of extreme weather events and competition on the performance of L. polyphyllus. Drought reduced growth and led to early senescence of L. polyphyllus but did not reduce adult survival. Fluctuating precipitation events and late frost reduced the length of inflorescences. Under control conditions, interspecific competition reduced photosynthetic activity and growth of L. polyphyllus. When subjected to competition during drought, L. polyphyllus conserved water while simultaneously maintaining high assimilation rates, demonstrating increased water use efficiency. Meanwhile, native species had reduced performance under drought. In summary, the invader gained an advantage under drought conditions through a smaller reduction in performance relative to its native competitors but was competitively inferior under control conditions. This provides evidence for a possible invasion window for this species. While regions of high elevation or latitude with regular severe late frost events might remain inaccessible for L. polyphyllus, further spread across Europe seems probable as the predicted increase in drought events may favour this non-native legume over native species.","[Vetter, V.

However, tests of this hypothesis usually use food-hoarding animals with a single load or a small load size. How multiple-load animals place their caches between food sources and nests remains largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that multiple-load animals, compared to single-load animals, may not necessarily sequester food items but adopt alternative hoarding strategies due to their multiple-load ability. In this study, we presented seeds at different distances from the nests of the multiple-loading Siberian chipmunk, Tamias sibiricus, and mapped the spatial distribution of their caches in multiple-compartment enclosures to test our hypothesis that a multiple-prey loader will consistently establish caches near nests rather than rapidly sequester near the seed source. By using multiple-compartment enclosures with different distances between the seed source and nests, and given potential intra- and interspecific competition, we found chipmunks consistently placed their caches near nests but away from the seed source. Cache placement near nests may serve as an alternative strategy that not only guarantees a maximum harvest rate at the seed source but also ensures effective cache defence near nests. Moreover, scatter-hoarding seeds near nests may alternatively guarantee a food supply if larder-hoarded seeds are depleted or lost. Unlike seeds sequestered near food sources, caches near nests imply long dispersal distances for seeds in our study. Therefore, scatter hoarding by multiple-prey loaders is expected to be ecologically important for the structure and function of tree communities, especially in ecosystems in which seeds depend on food-hoarding animals for dispersal and germination.

Multiple factors operate simultaneously and interact in complex ways to shape community assembly. Understanding the organisation of communities including species interactions and the importance of driving factors (food, temperature, nutrients, oxygen concentration, etc.) is a central topic in ecology. Intra-annual variation in zooplankton and the factors that drive them are described in the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) conceptual model. However, there has been little empirical evidence quantifying the relative contribution of abiotic and physical factors to plankton seasonality in zooplankton communities. 2. Using a long-term time series of zooplankton abundances and environmental conditions, we investigated which physical, chemical, and biotic factors structure zooplankton communities. We quantified their importance in seasonal changes in species composition by exploring networks of interacting species in the Rimov Reservoir (Czech Republic). We investigated how these factors were associated with seasonal and intra-annual (across all seasons) patterns of temporal variation in zooplankton. 3. We predicted that: (1) the zooplankton community in the Rimov Reservoir follows the general seasonal PEG pattern; (2) abiotic factors play an important role in the temporal distribution of zooplankton at the intra-annual scale, but their influence on the community declines at the seasonal scale; and (3) the network of interacting species is more complex at the seasonal scale than at intra-annual scale, so biotic drivers most strongly influence zooplankton patterns at seasonal scales. 4. The intra-annual pattern of zooplankton abundance was mainly determined by the physical environment. As expected, the roles of abiotic drivers of community assembly changed between seasons. There were more interactions between abiotic factors and species structuring the community at the intra-annual scale than at the seasonal scale. Additionally, these interactions were weaker at the seasonal scale than the intra-annual scale. The intra-annual zooplankton community of the Rimov Reservoir was the most stable, while the summer zooplankton community was the most variable. 5. Our results provide evidence that the network of interacting zooplankton taxa is composed of positive and negative relationships, which suggests facilitative, competitive, and predator-prey interactions. Although zooplankton species interactions have an influence year-round, the network of interacting species is more complex during the vegetative period and especially in summer, when species richness and abundance are high. Our results suggest that the zooplankton community is structured by both the biotic network at the seasonal scale and by the physical environment at the intra-annual scale. 6. Seasonal succession in zooplankton communities of temperate lakes is a well-known pattern. However, the influence of interspecific interactions within seasons on this pattern has not been clearly shown until this study. Exploring the community in only one season may provide incomplete knowledge of the factors and species interactions driving the whole community.","[Gabaldon, Carmen; Hejzlar, Josef; Simek, Karel; Znachor, Petr; Nedoma, Jiri; Sed'a, Jaromir] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Devetter, Miloslav] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Soil Biol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Sed'a, J (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",seda@hbu.cas.cz,"Devetter, Miloslav/AAE-1676-2021; Nedoma, Jiri/F-9063-2014; Seda, Jaromir/F-9072-2014; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014; Simek, Karel/F-8930-2014; Znachor, Petr/AAC-2289-2021; Hejzlar, Josef/AAE-3963-2020; Znachor, Petr/AAH-5088-2020; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014; Simek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021","Znachor, Petr/0000-0002-9356-5996; Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [15-24309S],"Czech Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 15-24309S",,93,3,3,3,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Host-parasite interactions are shaped by the broader web of community interactions, from interspecific competition to predator-prey dynamics. Heterospecific scavengers might also affect parasite transmission from infectious carcasses, which can be an important source of infections for some wildlife diseases. 2. A robust scavenger community can quickly remove carcasses and tissue and thus prevent secondary transmission by necrophagy or contact with infectious carcasses. Alternatively, by spreading infectious particles and tissues throughout the environment, scavengers may increase rates of casual contact with pathogens and thus overall transmission. However, there has been little empirical consideration of the contrasting roles that scavengers might play in infectious disease dynamics. 3. We carried out a series of studies to determine the efficiency with which scavenging invertebrates remove carcasses of Long-toed Salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) larvae and their role in the transmission of frog virus 3 (Genus: Ranavirus, Family: Iridoviridae) from carcasses. We then estimated the functional response of one efficient invertebrate scavenger (Family: Dytiscidae) to increasing carcass densities in field conditions in order to determine the capacity of scavenging invertebrates to consume large amounts of carcass tissue, as may be present at high prevalence sites. 4. We found that removal of infectious carcasses by scavengers strongly reduced transmission to naive larvae. Scavengers were as effective at reducing transmission from a carcass as a physical barrier preventing contact with the carcass. There was little evidence that scavenging released sufficient infectious tissues into the water column to rival direct contact as a route of infection. Moreover, while scavenging rates saturated at increasing carcass densities, consistent with a type II functional response, there were sufficient densities of dytiscid larvae, not to mention other scavenging invertebrates, in a surveyed pond to theoretically prevent transmission from carcasses. 5. Our results suggest that at least in systems in which conspecific necrophagy is common, the scavenger community can play an important role in reducing transmission.","[Le Sage, Mitchell J.; Towey, Bailey D.; Brunner, Jesse L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Le Sage, MJ (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",mitchell.lesage@vumc.org,"Brunner, Jesse L./B-1692-2013","Brunner, Jesse L./0000-0003-4894-8274",Washington State University School of Biological Sciences Carl H.

The arbovirus vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus compete as larvae, but this mechanism is insufficient to explain patterns of coexistence and exclusion. Inviable interspecies matings-known as reproductive interference-is another candidate mechanism. Here, we analyse mathematical models of mosquito population dynamics and epidemiology which include two Aedes-specific features of reproductive interference. First, as these mosquitoes use hosts to find mates, reproductive interference will only occur if the same host is visited. Host choice will, in turn, be determined by behavioural responses to host availability. Second, females can become sterilized after mis-mating with heterospecifics. We find that a species with an affinity for a shared host will suffer more from reproductive interference than a less selective competitor. Costs from reproductive interference can be 'traded-off' against costs from larval competition, leading to competitive outcomes that are difficult to predict from empirical evidence. Sterilizations of a self-limiting species can counterintuitively lead to higher densities than a competitor suffering less sterilization. We identify that behavioural responses and reproductive interference mediate a concomitant relationship between vector ecological dynamics and epidemiology. Competitors with opposite behavioural responses can maintain disease where human hosts are rare, due to vector coexistence facilitated by a reduced cost from reproductive interference. Our work elucidates the relative roles of the competitive mechanisms governing Aedes populations and the associated epidemiological consequences.","[Paton, Robert S.; Bonsall, Michael B.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Math Ecol Res Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Paton, Robert S.] Univ Oxford Balliol Coll, Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BJ, England; [Bonsall, Michael B.] St Peters Coll, New Inn Hall St, Oxford OX1 2DL, England","Paton, RS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Math Ecol Res Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.; Paton, RS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford Balliol Coll, Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BJ, England.",robert.paton@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,"Paton, Robert/0000-0002-4512-9399","NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002612/1]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/H01814X/1, BB/L00948X/1]",R.S.P. was supported by aNERC studentship (NE/L002612/1) and is a CASE student with the Pirbright Institute.

In this study, we used stable isotope analyses (SIA) to explore trophic status of an introduced population of northern crayfish (Faxonius virilis) in Buffalo Lake, Washington. Northern crayfish are an important prey item for introduced warmwater and coldwater fish species in this lentic system and may buffer competitive interactions between largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka). In 2017, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of liver samples from 208 crayfish informed proportional diet estimates. Crayfish diets were comprised of 8 littoral sources and were examined for cannibalism, temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic trophic shifts. There was no significant spatial or temporal trophic shift detected in this crayfish population. Seasonal delta N-15 values among all crayfish size classes mirrored seasonal abundance shifts of littoral macroinvertebrates. A multiple-source stable isotope mixing model and relative trophic positions provided evidence for an ontogenetic trophic shift between juvenile and adult crayfish, from a generalist detritivore to a predatory diet dominated by Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera. The trophic status of Buffalo Lake crayfish may affect salmonid management goals if interspecific competition for food between crayfish and sport fish is biologically significant. Our research is an important first step to understanding crayfish trophic status in a lentic food web, and should inform fish stocking regimes and fishery regulations in management efforts to achieve long-term sustainability of this diverse fishery.","[Loffredo, John R.; Moore, Barry C.; Lanouette, Brian; Katz, Stephen L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Lee, Raymond W.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Cross, Benjamin K.] Colville Confederated Tribes, Nespelem, WA USA","Loffredo, JR (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",john.loffredo@wsu.edu,"Moore, Barry/AAB-6459-2020; Loffredo, John/AAC-3411-2020","Loffredo, John/0000-0003-2038-1229",Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,"The primary author would like to thank the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation for providing funding and generously donating the biological specimens for this research.

Yet, little is known about the influence of intraspecific aggregation on the co-occurrence of species in natural, species-rich communities. Here, we focus on early plant succession and ask how changes in intraspecific aggregation of colonizing plant species influence the pattern of species co-existence, richness and turnover. We studied the early vegetation succession in a six ha constructed catchment within the abandoned part of a lignite mine in NE Germany. At two spatial scales (1- and 25-m(2) plots), we compared for each pair of species the intraspecific degree of aggregation and the pattern of co-occurrence and compared observed relationships with temporal changes in important species functional traits. The majority of species occurred in an aggregated manner, particularly in the first 2 years of succession. In pairwise comparisons, we found an excess of segregated species occurrences leading to a positive link between intraspecific aggregation and pairwise species segregation as predicted by the aggregation hypothesis, particularly at the lower spatial resolution. The degree of intraspecific aggregation was negatively correlated with the community-wide level of species spatial turnover and with plot species richness. Our results are the first direct confirmation that increasing intraspecific aggregation and interspecific competitive interactions counteract in shaping plant community structure during succession. The respective effects of aggregation were strongest at intermediate states of early succession.","[Ulrich, Werner] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Ecol & Biogeog, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Zaplata, Markus Klemens] Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Hydrol & Water Resources Management, Siemens Halske Ring 10, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany; [Winter, Susanne] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Fac Forest & Environm, Sect Appl Ecol & Zool, Alfred Moller Str 5, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Fischer, Anton] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci, Dept Geobotany, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Ulrich, W (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Ecol & Biogeog, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",ulrichw@umk.pl,,"Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619; Zaplata, Markus/0000-0001-7707-5578","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Bonn)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TR 38]; Brandenburg Ministry of Science, Research and Culture (MWFK, Potsdam); Polish National Science Centre [2014/13/B/NZ8/04681]","This study was part of the TransRegio Collaborative Research Centre 38 (SFB/TR 38: ecosystem assembly and succession), which was financially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Bonn) and the Brandenburg Ministry of Science, Research and Culture (MWFK, Potsdam).

Understanding the trophic ecology of such reassembling systems is necessary for predicting recovery dynamics, guiding management, and testing general theory. Yet, there are few studies of recovering large-mammal communities, and fewer still that have characterized food-web structure with high taxonomic resolution. In Gorongosa National Park, large herbivores have rebounded from near-extirpation following the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992). However, contemporary community structure differs radically from the prewar baseline: medium-sized ungulates now outnumber larger bodied species, and several apex carnivores remain locally extinct. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition of Gorongosa's 14 most abundant large-mammal populations. We tested five hypotheses: (i) the most abundant populations exhibit greatest individual-level dietary variability; (ii) these populations also have the greatest total niche width (dietary diversity); (iii) interspecific niche overlap is high, with the diets of less-abundant species nested within those of more-abundant species; (iv) partitioning of forage species is stronger in more structurally heterogeneous habitats; and (v) selectivity for plant taxa converges within guilds and digestive types, but diverges across them. Abundant (and narrow-mouthed) populations exhibited higher among-individual dietary variation, but not necessarily the greatest dietary diversity. Interspecific dietary overlap was high, especially among grazers and in structurally homogenous habitat, whereas niche separation was more pronounced among browsers and in heterogeneous habitat. Patterns of selectivity were similar for ruminants-grazers and browsers alike-but differed between ruminants and non-ruminants. Synthesis. The structure of this recovering food web was consistent with several hypotheses predicated on competition, habitat complexity, and herbivore traits, but it differed from patterns observed in more intact assemblages. We propose that intraspecific competition in the fastest-recovering populations has promoted individual variation and a more nested food web, wherein rare species use subsets of foods eaten by abundant species, and that this scenario is reinforced by weak predation pressure. Future work should test these conjectures and analyse how the taxonomic dietary niche axis studied here interacts with other mechanisms of diet partitioning to affect community reassembly following wildlife declines.","[Pansu, Johan; Guyton, Jennifer A.; Potter, Arjun B.; Atkins, Justine L.; Daskin, Joshua H.; Kartzinel, Tyler R.; Pringle, Robert M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Daskin, Joshua H.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT USA; [Daskin, Joshua H.] Yale Univ, Yale Inst Biospher Studies, New Haven, CT USA; [Wursten, Bart] Online Floras Mozambique & Zimbabwe, Meise, Belgium; [Kartzinel, Tyler R.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Pansu, J; Pringle, RM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",johan.pansu@gmail.com; rpringle@princeton.edu,,"Becker, Justine A./0000-0003-4168-8350","Princeton UniversityPrinceton University; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [9459-14]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1355122, DEB-1457697, IOS-1656527]; Greg Carr Foundation; Cameron Schrier Foundation","Princeton University; National Geographic Society, Grant/Award Number: 9459-14; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1355122, DEB-1457697 and IOS-1656527; Greg Carr Foundation; Cameron Schrier Foundation",,128,20,20,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

In southeast Louisiana, Myriophyllum spicatunt L (milfoil) and Ruppia maritime L. (widgeongrass) are dominant species existing across fresh to brackish areas. Though frequently co-occurring across the range of salinity and light conditions, their individual responses to changing environmental conditions from restoration, weather and climate may determine overall species distribution, and biomass abundance. We compared milfoil and widgeongrass growth (i.e., biomass increase) across a range of salinity and light, in monoculture (salinity: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20; light: high (similar to) 50% ambient; low (similar to) 20% ambient), and in mixture (salinity: 0, 10, 20; light: high, low). In monoculture, milfoil growth was reduced at high salinity (20) versus low salinity (0), while biomass allocation differed significantly with greater allocation to shoots under high light, compared to low light. Widgeongrass was minimally affected by salinity, with reduced stem densities at high salinity compared to low salinity. In mixture, both species under yielded compared to monoculture with milfoil reduced with high salinity and light, and low salinity and light; widgeongrass under-yielded with low salinity and high light, and mid salinity (10) and low light. These differences in species' responses suggest that salinity and light contribute to the distribution of milfoil and widgeongrass, with higher salinities and light favoring widgeongrass growth, and lower light possibly decreasing both species' growth, and ultimately, distribution. With continued changes occurring and predicted from both coastal restoration and climate change, understanding drivers of habitat forming species remains critical to inform future landscapes.","[Hillmann, Eva R.] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [La Peyre, Megan K.] Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr,Louisiana Fish & Wildlife Cooperat Res Un, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","La Peyre, MK (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr,Louisiana Fish & Wildlife Cooperat Res Un, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",mlapeyre@agcenter.lsu.edu,,"La Peyre, Megan/0000-0001-9936-2252","U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, South Central Climate Science Center","This work was supported by funding provided through a grant to MKL from the U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, South Central Climate Science Center.

Nonetheless, little is known about the effects of stocked Rainbow Trout on native non-game species. We conducted experiments in an artificial stream to assess the effects of hatchery Rainbow Trout on home range and behaviour of Warpaint Shiners (Luxilus coccogenis Cope), a common minnow frequently found in stocked Southern Appalachian streams. We used the LoCoH algorithm to generate polygons describing the home ranges used by Warpaint Shiners. When a stocked trout was present Warpaint Shiners: (a) increased home range size by 57%, (b) were displaced into higher velocity mesohabitats, and (c) reduced mean overlap between the home ranges of individual warpaint shiners. Rainbow Trout did not significantly affect the edge/area ratio of Warpaint Shiner home ranges. Warpaint Shiner density (two and five fish treatments) did not significantly affect any response variable. Displacement from preferred microhabitats and increases in home range size likely result in increased energy expenditure and exposure to potential predators (i.e., decreased individual fitness) of Warpaint Shiners when stocked trout are present.","[Elkins, Duncan; Nibbelink, Nathan P.; Grossman, Gary D.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Grossman, GD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",grossman@uga.edu,,"Grossman, Gary/0000-0002-4432-1645; Elkins, Duncan/0000-0001-5798-5873",Georgia Department of Natural Resources [2021RR272]; Warnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources; USDA McIntire-Stennis Program [GEOZ-0176-MS],"Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Grant/Award Number: 2021RR272; Warnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources; USDA McIntire-Stennis Program, Grant/Award Number: GEOZ-0176-MS Grossman",,55,0,0,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

In temperate climates, food limitation and energetic stress are higher during winter and, thus, winter diets might reveal competition that is not apparent during the rest of the year. We compared autumn and winter diets of the invasive common waxbill Estrilda astrild in northwest Iberia, and of the native bird most similar to it in foraging behaviour, the European serin Serinus serinus. Both bird species forage for seeds in open habitats, mostly in or around agricultural areas. We found that food preferences of the two species were substantially different when foraging on the same agricultural landscape. Contrary to the prediction that food scarcity in winter would make diets more similar, the diets of waxbills and serins diverged in winter, indicating low potential for detrimental interspecific competition. Differences in diet were in part due to foraging on non-native plants. Non-native seeds represented a large part of the waxbill diet in autumn (a non-native grass), and a small part of serin's (a non-native forb), substantially decreasing their diet similarity. Our results are consistent with the view that waxbills are using a vacant niche in human-modified habitats, in this case involving non-crop plants associated with agricultural practices (e.g. irrigation, tillage, harvest) that are underexploited by the native fauna. Understanding which invasive animals fill those vacant niches and, thus, may interfere minimally with native faunas, helps to prioritize conservation actions.","[Cardoso, Goncalo C.; Rodrigues, Goncalo Carvalho; Alves, Paulo; Vicente, Joana R.; Honrado, Joao P.] Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Porto, Portugal; [Cardoso, Goncalo C.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol Grp, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Vicente, Joana R.] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CITAB Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, Vila Real, Portugal; [Honrado, Joao P.] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Porto, Portugal","Cardoso, GC (corresponding author), Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Porto, Portugal.",gcardoso@cibio.up.pt,"Alves, Paulo J.

Dust-bathing sites represent a distinctive behavior-specific habitat, differing from other habitats as they are used for short durations and infrequently. However, we have little understanding of selection, potential interspecific overlap, and partitioning of dust-bathing sites among sympatric species. In this study, we examined overlap and selection of dust-bathing sites of 3 sympatric montane galliform species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: Blood Pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), Szechenyi's Partridge (Tetraophasis szechenyii), and White Eared-Pheasant (Crossoptilon crossoptilon). We identified dust-bathing scrapes and measured habitat characteristics of dust-bathing sites along 10 transects established in Gexigou National Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China, from April to August in 2015. In total, we identified 105 dust-bathing scrapes and established 58 dust-bathing site quadrats. More than one-third of dust-bathing scrapes and similar to 20% of dust-bathing sites were used by multiple species. The 3 species showed no significant differences in the dimensions or soil particle size distributions of their dust-bathing scrapes, nor did we find that habitat features of dust-bathing sites differed significantly among the 3 species (all pairwise overlap indices >0.6). All 3 species preferred surrounding fir forests with dense tree and shrub strata, good concealment that could provide sufficient protection from predators and precipitation, and sparse grass cover with suitable substrates containing finer soil particles for better dust-bathing. Our results suggest that the 3 sympatric galliform species had similar habitat requirements that led to overlap in selection for dust-bathing sites. We recommend further monitoring of temporal use of dust-bathing sites by the 3 galliform species to test potential temporal partitioning mechanisms that may minimize competition between heterospecific and conspecific individuals.","[Wang, Bin; Zhang, Bo; Wu, Yongjie; He, Xingcheng; Ran, Jianghong; Zeng, Tao] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Bioresource & Ecoenvironm, Minist Educ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] China West Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Southwest China Wildlife Resources Conser, Nanchon, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] China West Normal Univ, Inst Ecol, Nanchong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yu] Guizhou Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yu] Pingdingshan Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Pingdingshan, Peoples R China","Ran, JH; Zeng, T (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Bioresource & Ecoenvironm, Minist Educ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",ranjianghong@scu.edu.cn; zengtao_slt@126.com,"Xu, Yu/AAD-9820-2021","Xu, Yu/0000-0002-9437-3267","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31301896, 31172105]; Fundamental Research Funds of China West Normal University [17E075]; Doctoral Foundation of Guizhou Normal University","Funding for this research was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31301896 and No. 31172105), the Fundamental Research Funds of China West Normal University (No. 17E075), and the Doctoral Foundation of Guizhou Normal University (2016).

The study of mesopredator interactions is a growing area of research in tropical forests and shedding new light on inter-guild competition between threatened vertebrate species that were previously little understood. Here, we investigate sympatry between the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) and Asiatic golden cat (Pardofelis temminckii) living in the Sumatran rainforests of Indonesia. We investigate: i) spatial overlap of predator-prey species using a combination of single-species occupancy modelling and Bayesian two-species modelling, while controlling for the possible influence of several confounding landscape variables; and, ii) temporal overlap between mesopredators and their shared prey through calculating their kernel density estimate associations. From four study areas, representing lowland, hill, sub-montane and montane forest, 28,404 camera trap nights were sampled. Clouded leopard and golden cat were respectively detected in 24.3% and 22.6% of the 292 sampling sites (camera stations) and co-occurred in 29.6% of the sites where they were detected. Golden cat occupancy was highest in the study area where clouded leopard occupancy was lowest and conversely lowest in the study area where clouded leopard occupancy was highest. However, our fine-scale (camera trap site) analyses found no evidence of avoidance between these two felid species. While both mesopredators exhibited highest spatial overlap with the larger-bodied prey species, temporal niche separation was also found. Clouded leopard was more nocturnal and, consequently, had higher temporal overlap with the more nocturnal prey species, such as porcupine and mouse deer, whereas the more diurnal golden cat had higher overlap with the strictly diurnal great argus pheasant. The Bayesian two species occupancy modelling approach applied in our study fills several important knowledge gaps of Sumatra's lesser known mesopredators and provides a replicable methodology for studying interspecific competition for other small-medium sized carnivore species in the tropics.","[Haidir, Iding Achmad] Indonesian Minist Environm & Forestry, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Haidir, Iding Achmad; Macdonald, David Whyte] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit WildCRU, Tubney, England; [Linkie, Matthew] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bogor, Indonesia","Haidir, IA (corresponding author), Indonesian Minist Environm & Forestry, Jakarta, Indonesia.; Haidir, IA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit WildCRU, Tubney, England.",iding.haidir@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,"Achmad Haidir, Iding/0000-0002-1568-5650",Robertson Foundation; World Animal Protection; Rufford Small Grant [15258-1]; Dr Holly Reed Conservation Fund; Panthera Foundation,"Funding was provided by Robertson Foundation, World Animal Protection, Rufford Small Grant (15258-1), Dr Holly Reed Conservation Fund and Panthera Foundation.

Competition for pollinators can result in direct fitness costs via reduced seed set or indirect costs via heterospecific pollen transfer (HPT), causing subsequent gamete loss and unfit hybrid offspring production. Autonomous selfing may alleviate these costs, but to preempt HPT, selfing should occur early, before opportunities for HPT occur (i.e., preemptive selfing hypothesis). We evaluated conditions for this hypothesis in Collinsia sister species, C. linearis and C. rattanii. In field studies, we found virtually identical flowering times and pollinator sharing between congeners in sympatric populations. Compared to allopatric populations, sympatric C. linearis populations enjoyed higher pollinator visitation rates, whereas visitation to C. rattanii did not differ in sympatry. Importantly, the risk of HPT to each species in sympatry was strongly asymmetrical; interspecies visits comprised 40% of all flower-to-flower visits involving C. rattanii compared to just 4% involving C. linearis. Additionally, our greenhouse experiment demonstrated a strong cost of hybridization when C. rattanii was the pollen donor. Together, these results suggest that C. rattanii pays the greatest cost of pollinator sharing. Matching predictions of the preemptive selfing hypothesis, C. rattanii exhibit significantly earlier selfing in sympatric relative to allopatric populations.","[Randle, April M.] Univ San Francisco, Dept Environm Sci, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Spigler, Rachel B.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Kalisz, Susan] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37919 USA; [Kalisz, Susan] Carnegie Museum Nat Hist, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Randle, AM (corresponding author), Univ San Francisco, Dept Environm Sci, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.",amrandle@usfca.edu; rachel.spigler@temple.edu,,"Spigler, Rachel/0000-0002-5997-9781","EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [FP-91634501-2]; Native Plant Society of Oregon; Sigma XI; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0709638, DEB 0324764]","We thank Cory Kohn, Aileen Butera, Craig Beight, and Melisa Faigeless for help in the field and greenhouse experiment; Steve Tonsor, Tia-Lynn Ashman, Valerie Oke, and John Willis for comments on earlier versions of this manuscript; and we thank Seema Sheth for help with GIS mapping.

Resource partitioning may be facilitated by behavioural differentiation along three main niche dimensions: habitat, food and time. In this study, we investigate the extent to which these mechanisms can explain the coexistence of an assemblage of five sympatric felids in Borneo. Using multi-scale logistic regression, we show that Bornean felids exhibit differences in both their broad and fine-scale habitat use. We calculate temporal activity patterns and overlap between these species, and present evidence for temporal separation within this felid guild. Lastly, we conducted an all-subsets logistic regression to predict the occurrence of each felid species as a function of the co-occurrence of a large number of other species and showed that Bornean felids co-occurred with a range of other species, some of which could be candidate prey. Our study reveals apparent resource partitioning within the Bornean felid assemblage, operating along all three niche dimension axes. These results provide new insights into the ecology of these species and the broader community in which they live and also provide important information for conservation planning for this guild of predators.","[Hearn, Andrew J.; Ross, Joanna; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit WildCRU, Oxford, England; [Cushman, Samuel A.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Goossens, Benoit] Danau Girang Field Ctr, Sabah Wildlife Dept, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Goossens, Benoit] Sabah Wildlife Dept, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Goossens, Benoit] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Biosci, Organisms & Environm Div, Sir Martin Evans Bldg,Museum Ave, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Goossens, Benoit] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Pl Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Hunter, Luke T.

One important invasive species worldwide is Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which has invaded many regions of the world, threatening the native and endemic coccinellid assemblages due to negative interspecific interactions. These interactions have been widely studied at a local scale, but have been less studied at regional scales. Our aim was to estimate and analyse the potential spatial interaction associated with the co-occurrence of H.axyridis with native and endemic species in Chile, considering bioclimatic and land cover variables. First, we created species distribution models (SDM) for H.axyridis, native and endemic coccinellids and six representative coccinellid species using maximum entropy technique. Then, we overlapped each SDM with land cover types to estimate the bioclimatic suitability within each land cover type. Finally, we identified the co-occurrences of organisms according to the SDM and the land cover types, estimating in what land covers H.axyridis and the other coccinellids are more likely to co-occur. Our results show that the suitable area for H.axyridis occurs from 30 degrees to 42 degrees S in Chile, while for native and endemic species this area is greater. The six selected species are mainly concentrated in central Chile, but differ in their potential suitable areas; Adalia angulifera Mulsant and Scymnus bicolor (Germain) have the largest range, and Mimoscymnus macula (Germain) has the most restricted one. The highest level of potential spatial interactions with H.axyridis occurs in central Chile, specifically in croplands and scrublands, and the lowest in primary native forest for all the species. Our results provide a spatially explicit baseline for coccinellid conservation and management of this invasive species.","[Alaniz, A. J.; Grez, A.

Further insight into the temporal relationships of pollinators and their flowering partners is required to inform conservation efforts. Here we examined the phenology of British: (i) pollinator activity; (ii) insect-pollinated plant flowering; and (iii) extinct and endangered pollinator and plant species. Over 1 million records were collated from the historical databases of three British insect monitoring organisations, a global biodiversity database and an authoritative text covering the national flora. Almost two-thirds (62%) of pollinator species have peak flight observations during late-summer (July and August). This was the case across three of the groups studied: aculeate wasps (71% of species), bees (60%), and butterflies (72%), the exception being hoverflies (49%). When species geographical range (a proxy for abundance) was accounted for, a clear late-summer peak was clear across all groups. By contrast, there is marked temporal partitioning in the flowering of the major plant groups: insect-pollinated tree species blossoming predominantly during May (74%), shrubs in June (69%), and herbs in July (83%). There was a positive correlation between the number of pollinator species on the wing and the richness of both flowering insect pollinated herbs and trees/shrubs species, per calendar month. In addition, significantly greater extinctions occurred in late-summer-flying pollinator species than expected (83% of extinct species vs. 62% of all species). This trend was driven primarily by bee extinctions (80% vs. 60%) and was not apparent in other groups. We contend that this is principally due to declines in late-summer resource supplies, which are almost entirely provisioned by herbs, a consequence of historical land-use change. We hypothesize that the seasonality of interspecific competition and the blooming of trees and mass-flowering crops may have partially buffered spring flying pollinators from the impacts of historical change.","[Balfour, Nicholas J.; Castellanos, Maria Clara; Ratnieks, Francis L.

Here, we present evidence against trophic equivalence of these sibling species based on flounder size and space-stratified analyses of stomach content data from 5,724 flounder sampled from the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) during summer 2007-2016. We found that interspecific trophic niche separation occurred at sizes up to 39cm FL before convergence at larger size-classes. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that foraging efficiency differences arise due to divergence in gill raker counts. Arrowtooth Flounder, which have more gill rakers than Kamchatka Flounder, consistently consumed more zooplankton than Kamchatka Flounder, while Kamchatka Flounder typically consumed more benthic fishes. Although a benthivory-zooplanktivory axis of resource partitioning is common among sympatric trophic polymorphs in freshwater ecosystems, our findings are novel for marine sibling species and flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes). Abundance estimates for both Arrowtooth Flounder and Kamchatka Flounder have substantially increased in Alaska during recent years, and we suggest that trophic niche separation alleviates interspecific competition, which may buffer sympatric carrying capacities for these two flatfishes.","[Rohan, Sean K.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Buckley, Troy W.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, 7600 Sand Point Way Northeast, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Rohan, SK (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",skrohan@uw.edu,,"Rohan, Sean/0000-0001-6626-658X",,,,75,3,3,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

The bullhead, Cottus gobio, is a species of great conservation interest threatened by the massive introduction of hatchery-reared brown trout, Salmo trutta, for angling purposes. The aims of this research were: i) to present a case-study of interspecific and intraspecific competition in dwelling fish from two Mediterranean streams ( central Italy); ii) to evaluate the bullhead population status before and after the alien brown trout removal, and iii) to investigate the influence of the environmental parameters on the abundance of both species. For the bullhead populations the abundances and the young-of- the-year percentage significantly increased after the removal activities. The growth analysis showed that, after the trout removal, bullhead were distinguished by greater performance and larger sizes in all age classes in comparison to the pre-removal period, while the condition factor (Kn) showed no differences, suggesting that the effects of trout population control acted mainly through predator-prey dynamics. An inverse correlation between the abundance of bullhead and its body condition suggested that the beneficial effects due to the reduction of predation could be compensated by the intraspecific competition due to the increase of the bullhead population density.","[Lorenzoni, Massimo; Carosi, Antonella; La Porta, Gianandrea] Univ Perugia, Dept Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Via Elce Sotto, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Giovannotti, Massimo; Splendiani, Andrea; Barucchi, Vincenzo Caputo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy","Carosi, A (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Via Elce Sotto, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",acarosi@libero.it,"Carosi, Antonella/M-4474-2016; lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014; La Porta, Gianandrea/F-3545-2014; Carosi, Antonella/AAE-4635-2020; Giovannotti, Massimo/AAZ-3563-2020","Carosi, Antonella/0000-0003-0513-7287; La Porta, Gianandrea/0000-0002-6465-5423; Giovannotti, Massimo/0000-0001-7622-3583",Lifethorn TROTA Project [LIFE12 NAT/IT/0000940],"This work was funded by Lifethorn TROTA Project (LIFE12 NAT/IT/0000940) for the recovery and conservation of Mediterranean trout (Salmo trutta complex) in the central Apennines (Italy), within the framework of the European Commission Life Projects.

To assess this, we examined the relationship between functional diversity (FD, functional trait relatedness) and phylogenetic diversity (PD, evolutionary relatedness) during grassland restoration. Temporal changes in FD and PD were used to examine the effect of two biotic filters during community assembly: intraspecific variation in dominant species (different population sources) and interspecific variation among subordinate species (phylogenetically distinct species pools). The experimental grassland restoration contained whole plots sown with either cultivars or local ecotypes of three dominant grasses (Sorghastrum nutans, Andropogon gerardii, and Schizachyrium scoparium). Each whole plot contained subplots sown with three phylogenetically distinct pools of subordinate species. Cover of all species was measured in permanent sampling areas for ten years, and 10 functional traits were measured for 88 species, allowing calculation of PD and FD, respectively. Overall, the communities establishing with local ecotypes of the dominant grasses were functionally more dissimilar than when established with cultivars, particularly among the Asteraceae, suggesting competitive exclusion of functionally dissimilar species by cultivars. This result was opposite to our prediction that cultivars through limiting similarity would exclude more similar species more so than would local ecotypes. The effect of the dominant grass population source was contingent upon interactions with species pools. A supplemental propagule addition of functionally dissimilar species four years since initial sowing increased FD, but this effect varied among species pools. A lack of relationship between FD and PD in this system indicated that measuring PD alone without inclusion of functional traits may miss additional factors affecting species coexistence. In addition, the variation in FD between population sources and among species pools indicated that the measured traits were more sensitive to these factors than to their phylogenetic relationships. This analysis of long-term data from a field experiment showed new consequences of using different seed sources and species pools (as biotic filters), and supplemental seeding on PD and FD of restored grassland. Quantifying relevant functional traits in a phylogenetic framework could help identify plant population sources that enhance coexistence of desirable species.","[Khalil, Mohammed I.; Gibson, David J.; Baer, Sara G.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 1263 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Khalil, Mohammed I.; Gibson, David J.; Baer, Sara G.] Southern Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, 1263 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Willand, Jason E.] Missouri Southern State Univ, Dept Biol, 3950 Newman Rd, Joplin, MO 64801 USA; [Khalil, Mohammed I.] Univ Garmian, Dept Biol, Bardesur 46021, Kalar, Iraq","Gibson, DJ (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 1263 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.; Gibson, DJ (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, 1263 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",djgibson@siu.edu,,"Gibson, David/0000-0002-0308-7506",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0516429]; HCED (The Higher Committee for Education Development in Iraq),Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation (DEB0516429) and HCED (The Higher Committee for Education Development in Iraq).

We investigated the relative abundance and microhabitat selection of Northern Pygmy Salamander and Southern Pygmy Salamander in 3 forest types of different elevations across the mountains of North Carolina during the summer of 2015. We conducted 2-h time-constrained searches at 4 sites in Picea rubens (Red Spruce)-Abies fraseri (Fraser Fir) forests, northern hardwood forests, and mountain cove forests for each species. We quantified microhabitat characteristics at each pygmy salamander location and at a corresponding random location 2-30 m away. We captured a total of 98 pygmy salamanders (D. organi = 41, D. wrighti = 57): 52 in spruce-fir forests, 26 in northern hardwood forests, and 20 in cove forests, and recorded 655 other salamanders representing 15 species. Relative abundance of pygmy salamanders was greater in spruce-fir forests than in cove forests, but was not significantly different between spruce-fir and northern hardwood forests. Microhabitat did not differ between Northern Pygmy Salamander and Southern Pygmy Salamander for any of the variables examined, except for soil moisture, which was greater at Northern Pygmy Salamander locations and may have been a spurious result. We observed pygmy salamanders almost exclusively beneath wood cover-objects, and size of cover objects did not differ from the size available in the surrounding environments. Total area of small-sized down woody debris (DWD) and total area of large-sized DWD were the only variables associated with the presence of pygmy salamanders, suggesting that pygmy salamanders avoid predation and interspecific competition by selecting sites that minimize encounters with larger salamanders.","[Rossell, C.

In this study, we assessed tree growth, aboveground carbon accumulation, and belowground carbon sequestration in 26-year-old monocultures of C. hystrix (C-100(26)), 26-year-old monocultures of P. massoniana (P-100(25)), 50-year-old monocultures of P. massoniana (P-100(50)), and even- and uneven-aged (C-50(26) + P-50(26) and C-50(26) F-50(50), respectively) mixed plantations.

Positive interactions can buffer plant communities from abiotic stress and consumer pressure caused by climatic extremes, but limited research has explored this empirically. We tested the hypothesis that the mechanism of shrub facilitation on an annual plant community can change with precipitation extremes in deserts. During years of extreme drought and above-average rainfall in a desert, we measured plant interactions and biomass while manipulating a soil moisture gradient and reducing consumer pressure. Shrubs facilitated the annual plant community at all levels of soil moisture through reductions in microclimatic stress in both years and herbivore protection in the wet year only. Shrub facilitation and the high rainfall year contributed to the dominance of a competitive annual species in the plant community. Precipitation patterns in deserts determine the magnitude and type of facilitation mechanisms. Moreover, shrub facilitation mediates the interspecific competition within the associated annual community between years with different rainfall amounts. Examining multiple drivers during extreme climate events is a challenging area of research, but it is a necessary consideration given forecasts predicting that these events will increase in frequency and magnitude.","[Filazzola, Alessandro; Liczner, Amanda Rae; Lortie, Christopher J.] York Univ, Dept Biol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Westphal, Michael] US Bur Land Management, Cent Coast Field Off, 940 2nd Ave, Hollister, CA 93933 USA","Filazzola, A (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Biol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",fitz90@yorku.ca,"lortie, christopher j/F-6241-2014","lortie, christopher j/0000-0002-4291-7023; Filazzola, Alessandro/0000-0001-6544-2035",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Bureau of Land Management Grant; York University Faculty of Graduate Studies,"We would like to thank Mercey Hot Springs for providing water during a difficult drought year.

We assume that the domain is bounded and that there is no flux into or out of the domain. The motion of the species is along fitness gradients which allow the species to seek out a resource. In the case of competition, species which exploit the resource alone will disperse while avoiding one another. In the case where one of the species is a predator or generalist predator which exploits the other species, that species will tend to move toward the prey species, while the prey will tend to avoid the predator. We focus on three primary types of interspecies interactions: competition, generalist predator-prey, and predator-prey. We discuss the existence and stability of uniform steady states. While transient behaviors including clustering and colony formation occur, our stability results and numerical evidence lead us to believe that the long-time behavior of these models is dominated by spatially homogeneous steady states when the spatial domain is convex. Motivated by this, we investigate heterogeneous resources and hazards and demonstrate how the advective dispersal of species in these environments leads to asymptotic steady states that retain spatial aggregation or clustering in regions of resource abundance and away from hazards or regions or resource scarcity.","[Kurowski, Lawrence; Krause, Andrew L.; Mizuguchi, Hanako; Grindrod, Peter; Van Gorder, Robert A.] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Radcliffe Observ Quarter, Andrew Wiles Bldg,Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England","Van Gorder, RA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Radcliffe Observ Quarter, Andrew Wiles Bldg,Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",Robert.VanGorder@maths.ox.ac.uk,"Krause, Andrew L/J-8237-2014","Krause, Andrew L/0000-0001-9638-7278",,,,31,10,10,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0092-8240,1522-9602,,B MATH BIOL,Bull.

Interactions are mediated by antagonistic mechanisms, which determine the combative outcome: either deadlock, where neither mycelium loses any territory, or replacement, where one mycelium displaces the other. These mechanisms function aggressively and/or defensively, and include changes in primary metabolism and growth, as well as secondary metabolite production and stress mitigation responses. This chemical warfare may occur as a constitutive defence through modification of the territory occupied by an individual, and the deposition of antimicrobial compounds within. Following detection of a competitor, the metabolite and enzymic profile of a mycelium alters both qualitatively and quantitatively, and different mechanisms may be stimulated when confronted with different competitors. Biotic and abiotic factors, even small alterations, can affect the deployment of these antagonistic mechanisms, altering the general hierarchy of combative ability between species and making it impossible to predict outcomes with certainty. Here we explore recent advances in our understanding of combative interactions between wood decayers, and explain why future research priorities involving the application of emerging biochemical and molecular technologies must focus on interactions in more ecologically realistic and meaningful scenarios.

Recent studies have shown that the deep, cold and seemingly unproductive profundal zone can also offer underutilised resources and facilitate specialised individuals, and can contribute to lake food webs via methane-derived carbon pathways. Despite numerous examples from salmonid fish species, such intraspecific niche segregation along a littoral-profundal resource axis has not been reported in percids or other predominantly littoral benthivorous fishes. Here, we describe a case of ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua: Percidae) populations consisting of shallow- and deep-water dwelling individuals in two post-mining lakes in the northern Czech Republic. Results from stable isotope (N-15 and C-13) mixing models indicated that littoral and profundal food resources dominated the long-term diets of ruffe individuals caught from shallow- and deep-water habitats, respectively. No similar niche segregation along the littoral-profundal gradient was observed in coexisting perch (Perca fluviatilis: Percidae) which used more pelagic food than the benthivorous ruffe. The observed littoral-profundal niche segregation in ruffe was more pronounced in the macrophyte-rich and poorly oxygenated Lake Milada, where high habitat complexity and strong interspecific interactions in the littoral zone as well as the absence of competing fish species in the profundal zone likely promote narrow trophic niches of shallow- and deep-water dwelling ruffe Our study provides novel evidence of littoral-profundal niche segregation in a predominantly benthivorous fish species. The results also show that intraspecific niche variation can be affected by lake ecosystem characteristics, in particular by the availability of and competition for littoral and profundal resources. Although more research is needed to confirm potential early divergence of shallow- and deep-water dwelling ruffe as well as cascading effects on lake ecosystem processes (e.g. nutrient cycling and competitive and predatory interactions), our study indicates that individual ruffe may show limited habitat and food-web coupling due to their restricted use of shallow or deep resources.","[Eloranta, Antti P.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Trondheim, Norway; [Vejrikova, Ivana; Cech, Martin; Vejrik, Lukas; Holubova, Michaela; Smejkal, Marek; Frouzova, Jaroslava; Peterka, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Vejrikova, Ivana] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Kiljunen, Mikko; Jones, Roger I.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland","Eloranta, AP (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Trondheim, Norway.",antti.eloranta@nina.no,"Smejkal, Marek/E-1269-2017; Eloranta, Antti Pekka/AAA-1426-2020; Vejrik, Lukas/E-1607-2017; Cech, Martin/C-5797-2014; Peterka, Jiri/C-7218-2014; Holubova, Michaela/L-8347-2019; Vejrikova, Ivana/E-1624-2017; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011","Smejkal, Marek/0000-0002-7887-6411; Vejrik, Lukas/0000-0001-8911-9128; Cech, Martin/0000-0003-1350-4286; Holubova, Michaela/0000-0003-0475-307X; Vejrikova, Ivana/0000-0001-9113-2815; Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264","Norwegian Financial Mechanism [7F14316]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LM2015075]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); state budget of the Czech Republic [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0204]","Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2009-2014, Grant/Award Number: 7F14316; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic programme Projects of Large Infrastructure for Research, Development, and Innovations, Grant/Award Number: LM2015075; European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic, Grant/Award Number: CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0204",,51,4,4,2,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Yet, environmental changes in many coastal regions are likely altering the composition of ecological communities, the interspecific interactions sharks have within coastal waters, and subsequently the ecological roles sharks play within these ecosystems. As such, understanding interactions among sharks, and how extrinsic factors shape these interactions, is important for predicting the consequences of future human impacts and environmental changes. Elucidating the contexts under which species co-occur and the implications of co-occurrence is an important step in developing such a predictive framework. Blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) concentrations were quantified using long-term coastal gill net survey data across five bay systems in Texas. Relationships between co-occurrence, and environmental factors and shark sizes were examined within and across species. Co-occurrence of blacktip sharks and bull sharks varied spatially and temporally, with a significant increase in interspecific co-occurrence from the 1970s to 2010s, and a significant decrease in bull shark concentrations through time. Changes in environmental conditions, specifically increasing salinities, may have been responsible for increased blacktip and bull shark co-occurrence, and potential interspecific competition, which in turn may have led to decreased bull shark concentrations to reduce intraspecific competition. However, more refined questions are needed before predictive frameworks can be developed concerning the contexts under which cooccurrence is prevalent. Quantifying resource use among coastal sharks will help elucidate the drivers and implications of co-occurrence, and the potential for competitive interactions within and across species.","[Matich, Philip] Sam Houston State Univ, Texas Res Inst Environm Studies, 2424 Sam Houston Ave Ste B-8, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA; [Mohan, John A.; TinHan, Tom; Wells, R.

While many advances show how the network architecture of these communities severely constrains such tendencies, one of the most fundamental properties of network structure, i.e. degree heterogeneity-the variability of the number of links associated with each species, deserves further study. Here we show that the effects of degree heterogeneity on stability vary with different types of interspecific interactions. Degree heterogeneity consistently destabilizes ecological networks with both competitive and mutualistic interactions, while its effects on networks of predator-prey interactions such as food webs depend on prey contiguity, i.e. the extent to which the species consume an unbroken sequence of prey in community niche space. Increasing degree heterogeneity tends to stabilize food webs except those with the highest prey contiguity. These findings help explain why food webs are highly but not completely interval and, more broadly, deepen our understanding of the stability of complex ecological networks.","[Yan, Gang] Tongji Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Martinez, Neo D.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Liu, Yang-Yu] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Channing Div Network Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Liu, Yang-Yu] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Liu, YY (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Channing Div Network Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Liu, YY (corresponding author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",yyl@channing.harvard.edu,"Yan, Gang/B-9020-2009; Yan, Gang/AAK-9537-2020; Martinez, Neo/A-5312-2008","Yan, Gang/0000-0001-6196-2615; Martinez, Neo/0000-0002-1130-5550",John Templeton Foundation [51977]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Thousand Young Talents Program in China; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1642894] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Y.-Y.L. gratefully acknowledges the support from the John Templeton Foundation (award no. 51977).

When cavities are limited, niche overlap can result in interspecific competition, with negative consequences for threatened populations. Vinaceous-breasted Parrots (Amazona vinacea) are endangered cavity nesters endemic to the subtropical Atlantic Forest, where cavities are scarce. We examined nest niche overlap among Vinaceous-breasted Parrots and 9 potential competitors (birds and mammals >140 g, and social insects) in Argentina, considering (1) timing of breeding, (2) characteristics of cavities (depth, entrance diameter, height), trees (diameter at breast height [DBH], species, condition), and habitat (surrounding land use, distance to edge), and (3) interspecific cavity reuse. During 10 breeding seasons we studied nests and roosts, measured their characteristics, and monitored cavities to detect reuse. We used multinomial logistic regression to determine whether the 6 most abundant taxa differed in nest and roost site characteristics. Timing of breeding overlapped for all bird species except the White-eyed Parakeet (Psittacara leucophthalmus). No combination of cavity, tree, and habitat characteristics predicted the taxa that utilized cavities. Moreover, 8 of the 10 taxa reused cavities interspecifically. The high level of overlap in realized nest niche, combined with previous evidence that cavities could limit bird density in our study area, suggest the possibility of interspecific competition for cavities among multiple taxa. Although models did not perform well at classifying cavities by taxon, some characteristics of cavities, trees, and habitat were selected more by Vinaceous-breasted Parrots than by other taxa, and we recommend targeting conservation efforts toward cavities and trees with these characteristics (740 cm entrance diameter, >10 m high, DBH >55 cm). We found 62% of Vinaceous-breasted Parrot nests on farms (vs. <= 50% for other taxa), highlighting the importance of working with local farmers to conserve cavities in anthropogenic habitats as well as in protected areas.","[Bianca Bonaparte, Eugenia; Cockle, Kristina L.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, UNSa, IBIGEO, Inst Bio & Geociencias NOA, Rosario De Lerma, Salta, Argentina; [Bianca Bonaparte, Eugenia; Cockle, Kristina L.] Proyecto Selva Pino Parana, San Pedro, Misiones, Argentina; [Bianca Bonaparte, Eugenia] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Cordoba, Argentina; [Cockle, Kristina L.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Bonaparte, EB; Cockle, KL (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, UNSa, IBIGEO, Inst Bio & Geociencias NOA, Rosario De Lerma, Salta, Argentina.; Bonaparte, EB; Cockle, KL (corresponding author), Proyecto Selva Pino Parana, San Pedro, Misiones, Argentina.; Bonaparte, EB (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Cordoba, Argentina.; Cockle, KL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",ebbonaparte@gmail.com; kristinacockle@gmail.com,,"Cockle, Kristina/0000-0002-6502-923X; Bonaparte, Eugenia Bianca/0000-0001-9306-3980",Association of Field Ornithologists; Rufford Foundation; Columbus Zoo and Aquarium; CREOI; Neotropical Bird Club; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Killam Foundation; Aves Argentinas; British Ornithologists' Union; Cleveland Zoo; Explorers' Club; Idea Wild; Lindbergh Foundation; Oregon Zoo,"The study was funded by the Association of Field Ornithologists, Rufford Foundation, Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, CREOI, Neotropical Bird Club, NSERC, CONICET, Killam Foundation, Aves Argentinas, British Ornithologists' Union, Cleveland Zoo, Explorers' Club, Idea Wild, Lindbergh Foundation, and Oregon Zoo.

Detecting spatial pattern of tree mortality and examining the possible driving factors are critical to understand the determinants of tree death. In 2015, we conducted a census of snags (with dbh >= 10 cm) of woody plants in the 25-ha Badagongshan (BDGS) forest dynamics plot. Based on this survey data, we used the univariate, bivariate pair correlation function, g(r), to analyze the spatial distribution pattern of snags and the association between snags and living trees. In addition, we used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to examine the relative importance of neighbor and topographical factors on tree mortality. Analyses demonstrated two main results. First, at the community level, snags showed a consistent aggregated distribution at 0-30 m scales, and snags and living trees were significantly negatively correlated at 1-12 m scales. At the species level, 10 of the 18 common species (with >= 25 snag individuals) displayed significant negative associations between living trees and snags at different scales in the 0-50 m range. Second, both basal area of conspecific neighbors and basal area of heterospecific neighbors showed a significant positive relationship on the occurrence of snags at different levels (community, guild and species). Topographic factors showed limited correlations with the occurrence of snags. Additionally, tree size was significantly negatively correlated with adult and large tree mortality, but non-significantly correlated with old trees. In summary, tree mortality is nonrandom and mainly driven by interspecific competition and intraspecific negative density dependence in this subtropical mountain evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest in China. Topographic conditions had little relation on tree mortality, but tree size was an important predictor of tree death at the community level. Our study demonstrates that interactions of species tended to be more important in affecting tree mortality than habitat variables in this forest, which can further improve our understanding of forest dynamics and provide guidance to forest management.

Because establishment, persistence, and spread determine invasion success, this prediction requires detailed demographic information. Explicit study of the impact of pattern on demographic response is particularly important for species that are naturally patchy, such as the invasive grass, Aegilops triuncialis. In the northern California Coast Range, where climate change may increase or decrease mean annual rainfall, we conducted a field experiment to understand the interaction of climate change and local-scale patterning on the demography of A. triuncialis. We manipulated precipitation (reduced, ambient, or augmented), seed density, and seeding pattern. Demographic and environmental data were collected for three years following initial seeding. Pattern and scale figure prominently in the demographic response of A. triuncialis to precipitation manipulation. Pattern interacts with precipitation and seeding density in its influence on per-plant seed output. Although per-plot seed production was highest when seeds were not aggregated, per-plant seed output was higher in aggregated patches. Results suggest aggregation of invasive A. triuncialis reduces the detrimental impact of interspecific competition in its invaded community, and that interspecific competition per se has a stronger impact than intraspecific competition.","[Thomason, Meghan J.

We scored each factor according to its impact on the species. According to our results, the giant-striped mongoose, Galidictis grandidieri, is the most likely species to next become extinct.

Several studies have shown that populations in small and highly isolated habitat patches are prone to strong environmental and demographic stochasticity and increased risk of extinction. Based on community assembly theory, we predict recent rapid forest fragmentation to cause a decline in species and functional guild richness of forest birds combined with a high species turnover among habitat patches, and well defined dominance structures, if competition is the major driver of community assembly. To test these predictions, we analysed species co-occurrence, nestedness, and competitive strength to infer effects of interspecific competition, habitat structure, and species' traits on the assembly of bird species communities from 12 cloud forest fragments in southern Kenya. Our results do not point to a single ecological driver of variation in species composition. Interspecific competition does not appear to be a major driver of species segregation in small forest patches, while its relative importance appears to be higher in larger ones, which may be indicative for a generic shift from competition-dominated to colonisation-driven community structure with decreasing fragment size. Functional trait diversity was independent of fragment size after controlling for species richness. As fragmentation effects vary among feeding guilds and habitat generalists, in particular, tend to decline in low quality forest patches, we plead for taking species ecology fully into account when predicting tropical community responses to habitat change.","[Ulrich, Werner] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Chair Ecol & Biogeog, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Lens, Luc] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Terr Ecol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Tobias, Joseph A.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Habel, Jan C.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Ulrich, W (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Chair Ecol & Biogeog, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",ulrichw@umk.pl,,"Lens, Luc/0000-0002-0241-2215; Tobias, Joseph/0000-0003-2429-6179; Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)FWO [G.0258.01N, G.0055.08N, G.0149.09N, G.0308.13N]; Flemish Interuniversity Council [02/6/7-338-607]; FWO research community [WO.037.10N]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I028068/1]; Polish National Science Centre [NCN 2014/13/B/NZ8/04681]","Fieldwork was funded by research grants G.0258.01N, G.0055.08N, G.0149.09N and G.0308.13N of Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), by Flemish Interuniversity Council project 02/6/7-338-607, and through contacts facilitated by FWO research community WO.037.10N.

The foraging syndrome hypothesis posits a suite of concurrent traits that vary with foraging mode; however, comparative studies testing this hypothesis are typically interspecific. While foraging modes are often considered typological for a species when predicting foraging-related traits or mode-specific cascading impacts, intraspecific mode switching has been documented in some lizards. Mode-switching lizards provide an opportunity to test foraging syndromes and explore how intraspecific variability in foraging mode might affect local ecological communities. Because lizard natural history is intimately tied to habitat use and structure, I tested for mode switching between populations of the Aegean wall lizard, Podarcis erhardii, inhabiting undisturbed habitat and human-built rock walls on the Greek island of Naxos. I observed foraging behavior among 10 populations and tested lizard morphological and performance predictions at each site. Furthermore, I investigated the diet of lizards at each site relative to the available invertebrate community. I found that lizards living on rock walls were significantly more sedentary-sit and wait-than lizards at nonwall sites. I also found that head width increased in females and the ratio of hindlimbs to forelimbs in both sexes increased as predicted. Diet also changed, with nonwall lizards consuming a higher proportion of sedentary prey. Lizard bite force also varied significantly between sites; however, the pattern observed was opposite to that predicted, suggesting that bite force in these lizards may more closely relate to intraspecific competition than to diet. This study demonstrates microgeographic variability in lizard foraging mode as a result of human land use. In addition, these results demonstrate that foraging mode syndromes can shift intraspecifically with potential cascading effects on local ecological communities.","[Donihue, Colin M.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Donihue, Colin M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Donihue, CM (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",colin_donihue@fas.harvard.edu,,"Donihue, Colin/0000-0003-1096-8536",National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [W277-13]; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies,"National Geographic Society, Grant/Award Number: W277-13; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies.",,64,11,12,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here, we experimentally investigate the effects of macronutrient (NPK) enrichment on litter quality of six species of sedge (Carex sp.), which we relate to litter decomposition rates in a nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich environment. Our research focused on four levels: we examined how eutrophication alters (1) fresh litter production (productivity shift), (2) litter stoichiometry within the same species (intraspecific shift), (3) overall litter stoichiometry of the vegetation under the prediction that low-competitive species are outcompeted by fast-growing competitors (interspecific shift), and (4) litter decomposition rates due to an altered external environment (e.g., shifts in microbial activity; exogenous shift). Eutrophication triggered a strong increase in fresh litter production. Moreover, individuals of the same species produced litter with lower C:N and C:P ratios, higher K contents, and lower lignin, Ca and Mg contents (intraspecific shift), which increased litter decomposability. In addition, species typical for eutrophic conditions produced more easily degradable litter than did species typical for nutrient-poor conditions (interspecific shift). However, the effects of nutrient loading of the external environment (exogenous shift) were contradictory. Here, interactions between litter type and ambient nutrient level indicate that the (exogenous) effects of eutrophication on litterdecomposition rates are strongly dependent of litter quality. Moreover, parameters of litter quality only correlated with decomposition rates for litter incubated in nutrient-poor environments, but not in eutrophic environments. This suggests that rates of litter decomposition can be uncoupled from litter stoichiometry under eutrophic conditions. In conclusion, our results show that eutrophication affects litter accumulation and -decomposition at multiple levels, in which stimulatory and inhibitory effects interact. The cumulative effect of these interactions ultimately determine whether peatlands remain sinks or become sources of carbon under eutrophic conditions.","[Emsens, W. -J.; Aggenbach, C. J.

Whereas competition seems to prevail in less severe environments, facilitation tends to increase in importance in harsh environments. Hence, facilitation is expected to play an important role in degraded tropical areas with high irradiance, heat loads, and evapotranspiration, where conditions are far from optimum for most forest species. We planned a restoration project on the southeastern Brazilian coastal plain to compare growth and survival of tree seedlings planted at two densities (isolated or aggregated) in a factorial experiment with nutrient addition, We monitored survival, height, ground level diameter, and crown projection of 4132 saplings from 19 species that ranged along a successional gradient, over an 18-month period. We used mixed-effect models to analyze the relationship between species performance and treatments, and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to select the models, The best, model showed higher survival in aggregated plantations (indicating facilitation) for non-pioneer (slower growing) species, In contrast, we found lower diameter growth in aggregated plantation (indicating competition), Fertilizer addition did not affect survival in clusters, but, surprisingly, it had a negative effect on isolated plants of both pioneer and non-pioneer species. Fertilizer addition had a positive effect on diameter and crown projection growth in aggregated plantations (reducing competition), especially for pioneer species. Thus, whether facilitation or competition was the predominant interaction depended on the effect analyzed. As establishment of non-pioneer species in disturbed sites can be challenging, restoration designs could take advantage of higher survival rates in clusters and use resource addition to ameliorate growth and decrease competition for limited resources.","[Bertoncello, Ricardo] Minist Educ Brazil, CAPES Fdn, BR-70040020 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Oliveira, Alexandre A.; Pansonato, Marcelo P.; Martini, Adriana M.

The role of the foraging behaviour in promoting species coexistence was also examined. We used giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial food patches to measure the patch use of rodents and video trapping to directly record the foraging behaviour, vigilance, and interspecific interactions. Three potential mechanisms of coexistence were evaluated (1) microhabitat partitioning; (2) spatial heterogeneity of resource abundance with a tradeoff in foraging efficiency vs. locomotion; and (3) temporal partitioning on a daily scale. Compared to M. meridianus, D. sagitta generally possessed lower GUDs, spent more time on patches, and conducted more visits per tray per capita, regardless of microhabitat. However, M. meridianus possessed advantages in average harvesting rates and direct interference against D. sagitta. Our results only partly support the third mechanism listed above. We propose another potential mechanism of coexistence: a tradeoff between interference competition and safety, with M. meridianus better at interference competition and D. sagitta better at avoiding predation risk. This mechanism is uncommon in previously studied desert rodent systems.","[Shuai, Ling-Ying; Song, Yan-Ling; Zeng, Zhi-Gao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kotler, Burt P.; Embar, Keren] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Sede Boker Campus, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Zeng, ZG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zengzhg@ioz.ac.cn,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Shuai, Ling-Ying/AAB-8639-2020","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; ",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31201722],This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31201722].,,37,4,5,1,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

In this study, we applied a digital proximity logging device recently developed for terrestrial animals to a freshwater fish, the brown trout (Salmo trutta L.). After preliminary calibration and quantification of detection errors, we recorded the interactions occurring between five male and four female brown trout in an artificial channel during one week of the spawning season. The 55,637 logs recorded allowed us to describe the encounter network and its fine scale evolution. In particular, the time spent with females varied a lot across males, from two to 24 h in a five-day period, and the males, which spent the most time with females tended to mate more. At the individual level, the temporal distribution of encounters reflected shifts in dominance status, with males sequentially taking over exclusive proximity with females before spawning. Beyond sexual encounters, the method presented here could be applied to many processes interesting to fish ecologists, such as predator-prey interactions, intra and interspecific competition or disease transmission.","[Tentelier, Cedric; Aymes, Jean-Christophe; Spitz, Basile; Rives, Jacques] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, ECOBIOP, INRA, F-64310 St Pee Sur Nivelle, France","Tentelier, C (corresponding author), Univ Pau & Pays Adour, ECOBIOP, INRA, F-64310 St Pee Sur Nivelle, France.",cedric.tentelier@univ-pau.fr,"Tentelier, Cedric/AAH-6038-2019; Tentelier, Cedric/L-7195-2017","Tentelier, Cedric/0000-0003-2178-4900; Aymes, Jean-Christophe/0000-0002-1181-3010",French national institute for agronomic research (INRA) through its Innovative projects program,We thank Stephane Glise for his help in running the Lapitxuri experimental facility and John Burt for his technical support on Encounternet.

It is not rare to observe more species than the number of limiting resources, especially in plankton communities. However, such high species diversity is hard to achieve in theory under the competitive exclusion principles, known as the plankton paradox. Previous studies often focus on the coexistence of predefined species and ignore the fact that species can evolve. We model multi-resource competitions using evolutionary games, where the number of species fluctuates under extinction and the appearance of new species. The interspecific and intraspecific competitions are captured by a dynamical payoff matrix, which has a size of the number of species. The competition strength (payoff entries) is obtained from comparing the capability of species in consuming resources, which can change over time. This allows for the robust coexistence of a large number of species, providing a possible solution to the plankton paradox.","[Huang, Weini] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Dept Evolutionary Theory, Plon, Germany; [Huang, Weini] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts Canc Inst, Ctr Tumour Biol, London, England; [de Araujo Campos, Paulo Roberto] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Phys, Evolutionary Dynam Lab, Recife, PE, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Viviane Moraes] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Phys, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Ferrreira, Fernando Fagundes] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Complex Syst, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Huang, WN (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Dept Evolutionary Theory, Plon, Germany.; Huang, WN (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Barts Canc Inst, Ctr Tumour Biol, London, England.; Ferrreira, FF (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Complex Syst, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",huang@evolbio.mpg.de; ferfff@usp.br,"Campos, Paulo/G-2459-2012; Campos, Paulo/AAC-7734-2019; de Oliveira, Viviane Moraes/AAZ-1514-2020","Campos, Paulo/0000-0002-7823-1998; Campos, Paulo/0000-0002-7823-1998; ",Brazilian research agencies CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE)Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE) [APQ-0464-1.05/15]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/18942-2]; Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK [TBYG1P5R]; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX,"PRAC and VM are partially supported by the Brazilian research agencies CNPq.

This is particularly true of summer dormancy, an adaptation common in summer-dry Mediterranean-type climates. In addition, though theory predicts superior drought survival results in lower potential productivity, studies rarely measure both drought survival and growth under optimal conditions. Methods Physiological and functional ecological approaches were integrated to quantify interspecific variation in foliar and root traits in a suite of eight California perennial grass species. In a glasshouse experiment, summer dormancy, foliar functional trait variation, and seasonal growth and phenology under non-limiting water conditions and dehydration tolerance under progressive drought were quantified. In a second glasshouse study, root functional traits were quantified under non-limiting water conditions in rhizotrons. Key Results Summer dormancy was associated with higher dehydration tolerance, and negatively associated with traits conferring dehydration avoidance. Species with greater summer dormancy were characterized by greater springtime productivity, earlier reproduction, and a shallow and fine root system, which are indicative of dehydration escape. Summer dormancy was associated with an acquisitive, competitive functional strategy in spring, and a conservative strategy in summer. Conclusions Both the escape and acquisitive springtime strategies observed in summer dormant perennial taxa are typically associated with annual grasses. California grasslands were once dominated by perennial species, but have been overtaken by non-native Mediterranean annual grasses, which are expected to be further favoured by climate change. Owing to functional similarity with these exotic annuals, it is suggested that native summer dormant taxa may play an important ecological role in the future of both natural and restored California grasslands.","[Balachowski, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bristiel, Pauline M.; Volaire, Florence A.] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, INRA USC 1338, CEFE UMR 5175,CNRS,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Balachowski, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Davis, John Muir Inst Environm, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Balachowski, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Balachowski, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, John Muir Inst Environm, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jbalachowski@ucdavis.edu,,,"LabEx CeMEB, Mediterranean Centre for Environment and Biodiversity; Fulbright fellowship; National Science Foundation REACH Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (NSF-DGE) [0801430]","We thank Pascal Chapon for his dedicated technical help, and the 'Terrain d'experience' platform at CEFE-CNRS for providing all facilities and technical support.

Some species of scorpions avoid temporal or spatial overlap of their surface activities, which may differ depending on species, age group or gender, and thus reduce intra-and interspecific competition and predation. We examined the surface activity of males, females and juveniles (sex-age class) of the scorpion Brachistosternus ferrugineus (Thorell, 1876) in an area of Arid Chaco, and also its microhabitat preference and behavior by each sex-age class. The month-by-month activity of each sex-age class was different, but all the classes were observed each month. The most frequently used microhabitat was soil (64.8%), while leaf litter and vegetation were used in similar proportions. The behavior most frequently observed was ambush (68.3%), followed by walking and less frequently feeding, doorkeeping and courting. Each sex-age class performed one particular behavior with more frequency than the others. Analyzing combinations of microhabitat, behavior and sex-age class, we found the juveniles were associated with feeding on vegetation, males with walking on leaf litter, while females were related to ambush on soil. No marked temporal distribution between sex-age classes was observed. However, the spatial distribution and frequency of behaviors were highly dependent on developmental stage and sex. These differences may facilitate understanding of the coexistence of different age-sex classes of B. ferrugineus.","[Nime, M. F.; Mattoni, C.

Individual specialization (IS) is influenced by ecological opportunity, intraspecific competition, and interspecific competition, although the effects of these parameters are inconsistent across studies. We investigated IS in five species of frogs and toads, Anaxyrus americanus, A. fowleri, Lithobates catesbeianus, L. clamitans, and L. sphenocephalus. We used the natural history and ecology of each species to predict which parameters would influence IS. Our predictions were supported for some species but not others. We predicted IS would be positively influenced by resource diversity in all species, but this prediction held for only three species, with the relationship significant in A. fowleri and L. catesbeianus and marginally significant in A. americanus. We also predicted that interspecific competition would have a negative relationship with IS in L. clamitans because L. catesbeianus is competitively superior to L. clamitans and likely to suppress its foraging options. This prediction was upheld. Finally, we predicted that IS in A. americanus, A. fowleri, and L. clamitans would be influenced by intraspecific competition. However, IS was not influenced by intraspecific competition in any species, a surprising result given that intraspecific competition has traditionally been assumed to be the ecological parameter with the strongest effects on IS. Many previous studies did not simultaneously consider all three ecological parameters, which may have increased the apparent importance of intraspecific competition for IS. Our results revealed that the ecological parameters affected IS differently even across closely related and ecologically similar species, and demonstrated that these differences are sometimes predictable based on natural history. This study also suggests that sympatric ecological speciation based on IS may be rare because the ecological parameters driving IS are inconsistent across species, and the strength of their effects on intraspecific diet variation varies in space.","[Cloyed, Carl S.] Natl Great Rivers Res & Educ Ctr, East Alton, IL 62024 USA; [Eason, Perri K.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Cloyed, CS (corresponding author), Natl Great Rivers Res & Educ Ctr, East Alton, IL 62024 USA.",ccloyed@lc.edu,,,Kentucky Society of Natural History; University of Louisville College of Arts and Sciences,"We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments, which greatly improved the manuscript.

However, the dynamics of water use patterns by coexisting plants that respond to soil moisture pulses are scarcely known in the semiarid alpine ecosystems of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, particularly for deep-rooted grasses such as Achnatherum splendens in the Qinghai Lake watershed. Hence, we used the stable deuterium isotope method to detect the potential water sources for A. splendens during two growing seasons of 2013 and 2014. Our results indicate that SWC and delta D values of shallow soil layer (0-10 cm) showed the highest variations in comparison with those in other soil layers during the growing seasons due to the combined effect of evaporation and precipitation inputs. A. splendens depended largely on shallow soil water availability at the early growing season. At the peak of the growing season, this deep-rooted grass A. splendens and shallow-rooted grass Leymus chinensis showed a high degree of response in the water use source to the changes in soil moisture pulses and shifted their water source from shallow to deep soil layer because water in the shallow soil layer became less available due to a long-time rainless days with strong evaporation effect on the shallow soil layer. In contrast, shallow soil water was utilized by all coexisting plants owing to an abrupt increase in shallow SWC with large events or long-lasting small events. At the late growing season, A. splendens used water from the shallow (0-10 cm) and middle soil layer (10-30 cm), while L. chinensis mainly relied on the shallow soil layer water. Comparatively, shallow-rooted herbs (Heteropappus altaicus and Allium tanguticum) predominantly used water from the shallow soil layer (0-10 cm) over the entire growing seasons regardless of soil water availability. Overall, the contrasting water use patterns by coexisting plants demonstrate their adaptations to the fluctuations of soil moisture pulses in water-limited ecosystems.","[Wu, Huawu; Li, Xiao-Yan; Chen, Huiying; Ma, Yujun; Huang, Yongmei] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huawu; Li, Xiao-Yan; Jiang, Zhiyun; Chen, Huiying; Ma, Yujun; Huang, Yongmei] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Resources Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huawu] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Li, XY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Li, XY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Resources Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",xyli@bnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC 41130640, 91425301, 41321001, 41301013]; PCSIRTProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT_15R06]; projects from the State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology","We thank Zongchao Li and Yifei Zhou for their field assistance in this study.

To reduce competitive interactions, species may shift their behavior when in sympatry to gain greater access to resources, resulting in patterns of habitat partitioning. Previous studies have described structural microhabitat partitioning in Phelsuma geckos with the likely cause being interference competition. Such interference competition also may lead to temporal microhabitat partitioning. We investigated the presence of temporal habitat partitioning in Phelsuma geckos from Mauritius and the relation of partitioning to competition. We found temporal variation in microhabitat use for Mauritian Phelsuma. However, this variation was not clearly associated with the presence of other focal Phelsuma species, suggesting competition may not be responsible for the observed pattern. Temporal habitat partitioning in Mauritian Phelsuma geckos may be attributable to historical competition or other factors such as thermoregulation, food availability, or predator avoidance. We encourage future studies to investigate the mechanisms of temporal microhabitat variation.","[Hagey, Travis J.; Davidson, Daniel; Henricks, Anthony; Harmon, Lisa L.; Harmon, Luke J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Cole, Nik] Mauritian Wildlife Fdn, Grannum Rd, Vacoas, Mauritius; [Cole, Nik] Durrell Wildlife Conservat Trust, Les Augres Manor, Milan, Italy","Hagey, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",tjhagey@uidaho.edu,"Hagey, Travis J/H-5140-2019","Harmon, Luke/0000-0002-4985-5750; Hagey, Travis/0000-0002-3960-6814",Mauritian Wildlife Foundation,"We thank the Harmon lab, Journal of Herpetology Associate Editor, and two reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript; Mauritian Wildlife Foundation for their support and assistance with access to sites; and the National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of the Agro-Industry, Mauritius, for permission to conduct this research.

Knowledge and understanding of the species' interactions with the environment and with native fish are important to stop and prevent the further spread of the species. Creating species distribution models is a useful technique to determine which factors influence the occurrence and abundance of a species. We applied three different modelling techniques: general additive models, random forests and fuzzy habitat suitability modelling (FHSM) to assess the habitat suitability of topmouth gudgeon. The former two techniques indicated that the abundance of native fish (i.e. biotic variables) was more important than environmental variables when determining the abundance of topmouth gudgeon in Flanders (Belgium). Bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), stone loach (Barbatula barbatula), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and predator abundance were selected as the most important biotic variables and implemented in the FHSM to investigate species interactions. Depending on the preferred food source and spawning behaviour, either coexistence or interspecific competition can occur with bitterling, stone loach and three-spined stickleback. In contrast, the presence of predators clearly had a top down effect on topmouth gudgeon abundance. These findings could be applied as a biological control measure and implemented in conservation strategies in order to reduce the abundance of earlier established populations of topmouth gudgeon.","[Verhelst, Pieterjan; Boets, Pieter; Goethals, Peter L.

Theory suggests that asymmetric reproductive interference, in which one species induces higher reproductive costs on another species, may be more important in delimiting species boundaries than interspecific competition over resources. However, the underlying mechanisms of such asymmetry remain unclear. Here, we test whether differences in within-species reproductive costs determine the between-species asymmetry of costs using three allopatric Drosophila species belonging to the melanogaster subgroup. Our results support this hypothesis, especially in a pair of insular species. Males of one species that induce costs to their conspecific females led to a 5-fold increase of heterospecific females mortality with dead flies bearing spectacular large melanized wounds on their genitalia. Males of the other species were harmful neither to their conspecific nor heterospecific females. Comparative studies of within-species reproductive costs may therefore be a valuable tool for predicting between-species interactions and community structures.","[Yassin, A.] Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, 425G Henry Mall,Genet Biotech Bldg, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [David, J.

Nevertheless, surprisingly little is known about the global response of the microbial community to particular carbohydrates. Recent in vivo dietary studies have demonstrated that the species composition of the human faecal microbiota is influenced by dietary intake. There is now potential to gain insights into the mechanisms involved by using in vitro systems that produce highly controlled conditions of pH and substrate supply. Results: We supplied two alternative non-digestible polysaccharides as energy sources to three different human gut microbial communities in anaerobic, pH-controlled continuous-flow fermentors. Community analysis showed that supply of apple pectin or inulin resulted in the highly specific enrichment of particular bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs; based on 16S rRNA gene sequences). Of the eight most abundant Bacteroides OTUs detected, two were promoted specifically by inulin and six by pectin. Among the Firmicutes, Eubacterium eligens in particular was strongly promoted by pectin, while several species were stimulated by inulin. Responses were influenced by pH, which was stepped up, and down, between 5.5, 6.0, 6.4 and 6.9 in parallel vessels within each experiment. In particular, several experiments involving downshifts to pH 5.5 resulted in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii replacing Bacteroides spp. as the dominant sequences observed. Community diversity was greater in the pectin-fed than in the inulin-fed fermentors, presumably reflecting the differing complexity of the two substrates. Conclusions: We have shown that particular non-digestible dietary carbohydrates have enormous potential for modifying the gut microbiota, but these modifications occur at the level of individual strains and species and are not easily predicted a priori. Furthermore, the gut environment, especially pH, plays a key role in determining the outcome of interspecies competition. This makes it crucial to put greater effort into identifying the range of bacteria that may be stimulated by a given prebiotic approach. Both for reasons of efficacy and of safety, the development of prebiotics intended to benefit human health has to take account of the highly individual species profiles that may result.","[Chung, Wing Sun Faith; Walker, Alan W.; Louis, Petra; Duncan, Sylvia H.; Flint, Harry J.] Univ Aberdeen, Rowett Inst Nutr & Hlth, Microbiol Grp, Aberdeen AB21 9SB, Scotland; [Walker, Alan W.; Parkhill, Julian] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Pathogen Genom Grp, Hinxton CB10 1SA, Cambs, England; [Vermeiren, Joan; Bosscher, Douwina] Cargill R&D Ctr Europe, Vilvoorde, Belgium","Flint, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Rowett Inst Nutr & Hlth, Microbiol Grp, Greenburn Rd, Aberdeen AB21 9SB, Scotland.",h.flint@abdn.ac.uk,"Louis, Petra/Y-3779-2019; Parkhill, Julian/G-4703-2011; Walker, Alan W./AAE-8102-2019","Louis, Petra/0000-0003-2115-2399; Parkhill, Julian/0000-0002-7069-5958; Walker, Alan W./0000-0001-5099-8495; Chung, Wing Sun Faith/0000-0002-5635-0056; Duncan, Sylvia/0000-0002-4903-0978","Scottish Government Rural and Environmental Sciences and Analytical Services (RESAS); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC-CASE)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Cargill, Inc.; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [098051]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [1227957] Funding Source: researchfish","We would like to thank Donna Henderson for carrying out GC analysis, and Paul Scott, Iraad Bronner and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's core sequencing team for carrying out the Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes.

The nest, which originally contained a single Crowned Lapwing egg, eventually contained an additional three Wattled Lapwing eggs, before it was predated. Although parents of both species were observed in the vicinity of the nest, video monitoring showed that the Wattled Lapwings incubated all four eggs. Detection of embryonic heart rate suggested that all the eggs were probably viable up until the nest was destroyed. Nest usurpation in shorebirds is rare, and given the easily accommodated nest requirements and minimal costs of nest construction in these species, is difficult to explain. I speculate that the occurrence described here may represent a case of mistaken identity by the female Wattled Lapwing when choosing a nest scrape, since there seems to have been little benefit to the usurping species of taking over an already occupied nest.","[Horrocks, Nicholas P.

Three different populations of this species were sampled during the reproductive (July 2014) and non-reproductive (October 2014) periods to assess shell use patterns in the field by different demographic groups in absence of interspecific competition for shell-resource use. Irrespective of sampling sites and periods considered, sex ratios were female-biased (2.3 on average), and mean sizes of males were greater than those for females. At least shells from 31 different gastropods were used by C. erythropus in the Gulf of Cadiz. Shell selection was largely determined by the sizes of the hermit crab and shells. As result, a generalist pattern of shell use was displayed by this species. Most hermit crabs with shield length > 4.5 mm were males and the less abundant larger shells were occupied by these large males. Statistically significant sex-related (males vs. females) and size -related (small males vs. large males) differences in shell use were observed at two sampling sites with higher shell diversity, suggesting partial intraspecific partitioning of shell resource. There was a negative effect of carrying relatively heavy/large shells on the stage condition (males and females) and on clutch size of ovigerous females, suggesting that protection from predators was prioritised.","[Perez-Miguel, Marta; Cuesta, Jose A.; Manzano, Raquel; Drake, Pilar] ICMAN CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia, Ave Republ Saharaui 2, Cadiz 11519, Spain","Cuesta, JA (corresponding author), ICMAN CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia, Ave Republ Saharaui 2, Cadiz 11519, Spain.",jose.cuesta@icman.csic.es,"Cuesta, Jose A./A-1132-2008; Cuesta, Jose A./P-7142-2019; MANZANO, RAQUEL/AAB-1709-2020","Cuesta, Jose A./0000-0001-9482-2336; Cuesta, Jose A./0000-0001-9482-2336; MANZANO, RAQUEL/0000-0002-7477-8742",,,,40,3,4,0,25,CRUSTACEAN SOC,SAN ANTONIO,"840 EAST MULBERRY, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78212 USA",0278-0372,1937-240X,,J CRUSTACEAN BIOL,J.

Knowing where and how adult penguins find adequate resources during this energy-intensive stage is vital to understanding their susceptibility to ecosystem changes. GPS and TDR loggers were used to track movements and record diving behaviour of macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus and eastern rockhopper E. chrysocome filholi penguins from Marion Island (46 degrees S, 37 degrees E) during the pre-moult foraging trip in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Both species consistently travelled in a southerly direction to forage in cooler (similar to 3.5 degrees C) Antarctic Zone waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front where they associated with mesoscale eddies and sub-mesoscale filaments. Dives were predominantly to depths of 30 to 60 m, but macaroni penguins dived deeper more often. Mean trip durations of both species were similar (33 +/- 6 days), but maximum foraging ranges of macaroni penguins (903 +/- 165 km) were greater than eastern rockhopper penguins (696 +/- 152 km). Spatial overlap of core foraging areas between species was high, but a 2- to 3-week difference in departure dates reduced potential interspecific competition at sea. Trip durations were longer in 2014 compared to 2013, when decreased productivity may have reduced prey availability, forcing penguins to remain longer at sea. Continued monitoring is vital to understand how crested penguins at Marion Island adapt to the predicted southward shift of major frontal boundaries.","[Whitehead, T. O.; Ropert-Coudert, Y.; Ryan, P.

However, its populations have significantly declined in recent decades, principally as the result of agricultural intensification on arable land. Its abundance has also undergone a significant decline in forested areas over the last few decades, where wild ungulate management and abundance have increased. In this scenario, we aimed to test the factors that affect red-legged partridge abundance in relation to high wild ungulate (wild boar and red deer) abundance in south-central Spain. The factors included as predictors were carnivore, wild boar and red deer abundances, vegetation features, nest predation rate and invertebrate availability. Red deer abundance showed a negative relationship with partridge abundance in spring (non-significant negative trends were also evident for carnivore and wild boar), whereas variables related to food availability (grass biomass, Hemipteran abundance and total invertebrate mass) had a positive effect in the same season. Moreover, deer and carnivore abundances and spring nest predation rate were negatively associated with partridge abundance in autumn. Plant biomass and Hemipteran abundance were negatively correlated with wild boar abundance, whereas maximum pasture height was negatively related to red deer and wild boar abundance. Overall, our results show that high ungulate densities may negatively affect partridge abundance, which may be mediated by (i) a reduction in food availability (invertebrate and herbaceous plant biomass) and (ii) nest predation by wild boar. This research has shown that current intensive big-game hunting management schemes in south-central Spain are often incompatible with red-legged partridge conservation, and that these effects should be taken into account when defining big-game management and conservation policies.","[Carpio, A.

We investigated habitat use patterns using landscape and microhabitat variables. In addition, we explored a previously postulated competition hypothesis involving the Black-breasted Puffleg and the Gorgeted Sunangel Heliangelus strophianus. Our results suggest that landscape variables may play a role in the habitat selection process; specifically the distance to nearest forest border seems to have a significant effect on our habitat model. We speculate that, as the species is known to perform seasonal movements, the avoidance of forest border might reduce the physiological stress caused by altitudinal migration. At microhabitat level, Black-breasted Puffleg seems not sensitive to forest structure variables. Our findings suggest that ensuring forest tract connectivity, between the altitudinal extremes of the species' range at the north-western flanks of the Pichincha volcano, might be crucial for survival of the species during its annual cycle. However, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) indicates that Black-breasted Puffleg and the Gorgeted Sunangel do not overlap spatially, but this finding is not conclusive considering our field observations.","[Guevara, Esteban A.] Area Invest Monitoreo Avifauna Aves & Conservac B, Quito, Ecuador; [Guevara, Esteban A.; Duivenvoorden, Joost F.] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 HX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bonaccorso, Elisa] Univ Tecnol Indoamer Machala & Sabanilla, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Cambio Climat, Quito, Ecuador","Guevara, EA (corresponding author), Area Invest Monitoreo Avifauna Aves & Conservac B, Pasaje Joaquin Tinajero E3-05 & Jorge Drom Casill, Quito, Ecuador.",eguevara@avesconservacion.org,,"Bonaccorso, Elisa/0000-0002-7262-9356; Guevara, Esteban/0000-0002-2220-1298","EcoFondo (Fondo Ambiental Nacional); BirdLife's Preventing Extinction Programme; Ecuadorian National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation SENESCYT","We deeply thank Aves y Conservacion staff for logistical support.

We examined microhabitat partitioning in six sets of steppe birds associated to agroecosystems in central Spain (female and male Great Bustards Otis tarda, female and male Little Bustards Tetrax tetrax, Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa and Eurasian Stone-curlews Burhinus oedicnemus) to estimate realized niche breadth, overlap and segregation. Principal Components Analysis on data from used and random microhabitat locations produced two axes we retained for analysis related with two key factors: cover-visibility and food availability. Non-parametric kernel density functions were calculated for each of the PCA axes and species (or sexes), and niche overlap estimated as the area shared between species' density functions. Null models were run to evaluate overlap significance. In analyses of microhabitat selection by the six sets of birds, 13 out of 15 pairs had significant resource partitioning and niche segregation, except for the pairs partridge and female Great Bustard and the two sexes of Great Bustard. Eurasian Stone-curlew showed wider trophic niche breadth, although segregated from the other species, probably because of its higher invertebrate requirements. Great and Little Bustards segregated in both niche axes, selecting microhabitat according to their body size. Accessibility to food resources and shelter seems to be similar for partridges and female Great Bustards, overlapping in their selection, which may indicate the existence of segregation in other niche factors (e.g., feeding habits). Great Bustard males showed niche overlap with females. Little Bustard males showed feeding microhabitat selection patterns similar to those of females, although they preferred more open microhabitats to meet their sexual display requirements. The entire assemblage had significantly less overlap than expected by chance, suggesting that differential microhabitat selection and realized niche partitioning may explain coexistence in steppe bird communities. Our results suggest that the maintenance of different microhabitat structure should be a priority in the management of agricultural environments.","[Traba, J.; Morales, M. B.; Carmona, C.

It predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection should therefore lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters. However, females of many species are also highly ornamented(5-7). The view that this is due to a correlated genetic response to selection on males(1,8) was widely accepted as an explanation for female ornamentation for over 100 years(5) and current theoretical(9,10) and empirical(11-13) evidence suggests that genetic constraints can limit sex-specific trait evolution. Alternatively, female ornamentation can be the outcome of direct selection for signalling needs(7,14). Since few studies have explored interspecific patterns of both male and female elaboration, our understanding of the evolution of animal ornamentation remains incomplete, especially over broad taxonomic scales. Here we use a new method to quantify plumage colour of all similar to 6,000 species of passerine birds to determine the main evolutionary drivers of ornamental colouration in both sexes. We found that conspecific male and female colour elaboration are strongly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary changes in one sex are constrained by changes in the other sex. Both sexes are more ornamented in larger species and in species living in tropical environments. Ornamentation in females (but not males) is increased in cooperative breeders-species in which female-female competition for reproductive opportunities and other resources related to breeding may be high(6). Finally, strong sexual selection on males has antagonistic effects, causing an increase in male colouration but a considerably more pronounced reduction in female ornamentation. Our results indicate that although there may be genetic constraints to sexually independent colour evolution, both female and male ornamentation are strongly and often differentially related to morphological, social and life-history variables.","[Dale, James] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand; [Dey, Cody J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Delhey, Kaspar] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany","Dale, J (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand.",j.dale@massey.ac.nz,"Delhey, Kaspar/AAZ-5362-2020; Valcu, Mihai/AAX-8842-2021","Delhey, Kaspar/0000-0001-5190-5406; Valcu, Mihai/0000-0002-6907-7802; Dey, Cody/0000-0003-4947-8972; Kempenaers, Bart/0000-0002-7505-5458",Massey University; Australian and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 10/8]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Graduate ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE120102323]; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX,"We thank the many ornithologists and scientists who have published their data or contributed data to public databases, allowing us to conduct this study.

The invasive caprellid amphipod Caprella scaura has successfully spread along southern Europe in a short time period, coinciding with a decline in the population of an ecologically similar congener, Caprella equilibra. To understand the mechanisms underlying the establishment success of this aggressive species and its potential role in shaping C. equilibra's distribution, we analyze the biotic and abiotic factors involved in the patterns of distribution and co-occurrence of both species along the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa.

However, our understanding of the indirect role of defoliation in seedling recruitment and tree-grass dynamics in tropical savanna is limited. In West African savanna, Fulani pastoralists frequently defoliate several fodder tree species to feed livestock in the dry season. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of recurrent defoliation of African mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) by Fulani people on seedling (<2 cm basal diameter) and sapling dynamics in West Africa using four years of demographic data on seedling and sapling density, growth, and survival, coupled with fruit production and microhabitat data over the same time period. Tree canopy cover facilitated seedlings but had negative effects on sapling growth possibly via intraspecific competition with adult plants. Interspecific competition with grasses strongly reduced seedling survival but had a weak effect on sapling growth. Fire reduced seedling survival and weakly reduced growth of seedlings and saplings, but did not affect sapling survival. These results indicate that the effect of fire on seedlings and saplings is distinct, a mechanism suitable for an episodic recruitment of seedlings into the sapling stage and consistent with predictions from the demographic bottleneck model. Defoliation affected seedling density and sapling growth through changes in canopy cover, but had no effect on seedling growth and sapling survival. In the moist region, sapling density was higher in sites with low-intensity defoliation, indicating that defoliation may strengthen the tree recruitment bottleneck. Our study suggests that large-scale defoliation can alter the facilitative role of nurse trees on seedling dynamics and tree-sapling competition. Given that tree defoliation by local people is a widespread activity throughout savanna-forest systems in West Africa, it has the potential to affect tree-grass coexistence. Incorporating the influence of large tree defoliation into existing models of savanna dynamics can further our understanding of tree-grass coexistence and improve management. A rotating harvest system, which allows seedlings to recruit episodically, or a patchwork harvest, which maintains some nursery trees in the mosaic, could help sustain seedling recruitment and minimize the indirect effects of harvest.","[Bufford, Jennifer L.; Gaoue, Orou G.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gaoue, Orou G.] Univ Parakou, Parakou, Benin","Gaoue, OG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, 3190 Maile Way,St John 101, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",ogaoue@hawaii.edu,"Bufford, Jennifer L/G-6653-2018; Gaoue, Orou G./B-4932-2011","Bufford, Jennifer L/0000-0003-3320-6024; Gaoue, Orou G./0000-0002-0946-2741","College of Natural Sciences, University of Hawaii at Manoa; International Foundation for ScienceInternational Foundation for Science [IFS D-3694]","We are grateful to Yacoubou Boni, Ulysse Korogone, and Hugues Akpona for field assistance, Natalie Kurashima for assistance with GIS, and to Jiang Jiang and two reviewers for comments on this manuscript.

Therefore understanding which characteristics or mechanisms contribute to their invasive success is important. Here the role of symbiotic microsporidia in the hemolymph of H. axyridis was investigated in the context of intraguild predation between wild-caught H. axyridis and the native ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata. The microsporidia were recently discussed to contribute to the unpalatability of Harmonia for other coccinellids during intraguild predation and to function as biological weapons. In the present study, visual detection of microsporidia in hemolymph samples revealed that 73.5% of H. axyridis were infected. Intraguild predation experiments between larvae of the two species showed a significant competitive advantage for H. axyridis, even against larger larvae of C. septempunctata. Adult C. septempunctata always killed and fed on H. axyridis larvae. However only 11.4% (4 of 47) of C. septempunctata that fed on infected H. axyridis died within 4 months. In contrast to previous studies this suggests that microsporidia or harmonine, the chemical defense compound of H. axyridis, do not lead to death of C. septempunctata preying on larvae of H. axyridis. Instead our results support the idea that competitive advantage during intraguild predation greatly facilitates the success of H. axyridis and that this may help this highly invasive species to outcompete native species. The impact of microsporidia on Harmonia itself as well as on interspecific interactions require further studies.","[Gegner, Tobias; Otti, Oliver; Tragust, Simon; Feldhaar, Heike] Univ Bayreuth, Anim Populat Ecol, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Feldhaar, H (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Anim Populat Ecol, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",feldhaar@uni-bayreuth.de,"Otti, Oliver/AAH-2963-2021; Tragust, Simon/D-2927-2018; Feldhaar, Heike/AAB-8678-2020","Otti, Oliver/0000-0002-2361-9661; Tragust, Simon/0000-0002-3675-9583; Feldhaar, Heike/0000-0001-6797-5126",,,,39,5,6,1,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1672-9609,1744-7917,,INSECT SCI,Insect Sci.,JUN,2015,22,3,,,,,353,359,,10.1111/1744-7917.12224,,,7,Entomology,Entomology,CI8EV,WOS:000355003400004,25829258,,,,2021-09-21,

We offer a summary of the possible mechanisms responsible for the abundance and displacement pattern observed and of their significance in terms of disease transmission. Among these mechanisms we may mention the competition for limiting resources, the differences in the ability to withstand starvation, the apparent competition through differential effects of the parasite Ascogregarina taiwanensis, and the inhibition of Ae. aegypti egg development by Ae. albopictus larvae. Habitat segregation has been proposed as a mechanism promoting the coexistence of the two species through avoidance of direct competition. Aedes aegypti predominates in urban areas, Ae. albopictus in rural ones, and both species coexist in the suburbs. There is also evidence that in certain areas, habitat segregation in terms of distance from the coast can influence the distribution of both species. Another possible cause of the rapid disappearance of Ae. aegypti is reproductive interference between the species. According to this hypothesis, asymmetric effects of interspecific mating favor Ae. albopictus. This type of reproductive interference can result in the elimination of sympatric populations of the affected species and can be one of the major causes for the swiftness with which Ae. aegypti disappeared from some places in the Americas following invasions by Ae. albopictus.","[Rey, Jorge R.; Lounibos, Philip] Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, Vero Beach, FL 32962 USA","Rey, JR (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Med Entomol Lab, 200 9th St SE, Vero Beach, FL 32962 USA.",jrey@ufl.edu,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R21AI095780, R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R21 AI095780, R01 AI044793] Funding Source: Medline",,,50,29,46,1,50,INST NACIONAL SALUD,BOGOTA D C,"AVENIDA CALLE 26 NO 51-60, APARTADO AEREO 80334 Y 80080, BOGOTA D C, 00000, COLOMBIA",0120-4157,2590-7379,,BIOMEDICA,Biomedica,JUN,2015,35,2,,,,,177,185,,10.7705/biomedica.v35i2.2514,,,9,Tropical Medicine,Tropical Medicine,CO5CW,WOS:000359178200005,26535539,gold,,,2021-09-21,

There are four major alleles of the gene blpH, which encodes the receptor responsible for activating the blp locus when bound to one of four distinct peptide pheromones (BlpC). The allelic variation of blpH is presumably explained by a need to restrict cross talk between competing strains. The BlpH protein sequences have polymorphisms distributed throughout the sequence, making identification of the peptide binding site difficult to predict. To identify the pheromone binding sites that dictate pheromone specificity, we have characterized the four major variants and two naturally occurring chimeric versions of blpH in which recombination events appear to have joined two distinct blpH alleles together. Using these allelic variants, a series of laboratory-generated chimeric blpH alleles, and site-directed mutants of both the receptor and peptide, we have demonstrated that BlpC binding to some BlpH types involves an electrostatic interaction between the oppositely charged residues of BlpC and the first transmembrane domain of BlpH. An additional recognition site was identified in the second extracellular loop. We identified naturally occurring BlpH types that have the capacity to respond to more than one BlpC type; however, this change in specificity results in a commensurate drop in overall sensitivity. These natural recombination events were presumably selected for to balance the need to sense bacteriocin-secreting neighbors with the need to turn on bacteriocin production at a low density. IMPORTANCE Bacteria use quorum sensing to optimize gene expression to accommodate for local bacterial density and diffusion rates. To prevent interception of quorum-sensing signals by neighboring strains, the genomes of single species often encode strain-specific signal/receptor pairs. The blp locus in Streptococcus pneumoniae that drives bacteriocin secretion is controlled by quorum sensing that involves the interaction of the signal/receptor pair BlpC/BlpH. We show that the pneumococcal population can be divided into several distinct BlpC/BlpH pairs; however, there are examples of naturally occurring chimeric receptors that can bind to more than one BlpC type. The trade-off for this broadened specificity is a loss of overall receptor sensitivity. This suggests that under certain conditions, the advantage of signal interception can trump the requirements for self-induction.","[Pinchas, Marisa D.; LaCross, Nathan C.; Dawid, Suzanne] Univ Michigan, Dept Pediat & Communicable Dis, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pinchas, Marisa D.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dawid, Suzanne] Univ Michigan, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Dawid, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Pediat & Communicable Dis, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sdawid@umich.edu,"Dawid, Suzanne/AAP-6564-2020",,NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI101285]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI101285] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This work was supported by grant number R01AI101285 from the NIAID.,,33,12,13,0,13,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0021-9193,1098-5530,,J BACTERIOL,J.

Mean temperature of coldest quarter (Bio 11) was the bioclimatic variable with the highest influence in this model.

This narrow zone of overlap could be maintained, among other causes, by the role of the Parana River as a natural barrier for dispersion, differences in niche requirements, potential interspecific competition, and hybridization.","[Holzmann, Ingrid; Agostini, Ilaria; Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, CONICET, IBS, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina; [DeMatteo, Karen] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [DeMatteo, Karen] St Louis Zoo, WildCare Inst, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ignacio Areta, Juan] Univ Nacl Salta, Inst Bio & Geociencias Noroeste Argentino IBIGEO, CONICET, RA-4400 Salta, Argentina; [Merino, Mariano L.] Univ Nacl Noroeste Prov Buenos Aires UNNOBA, Ctr BioInvest, Comis Invest Cient Prov Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Di Bitetti, Mario S.] Univ Nacl Misiones, Fac Ciencias Forestales, RA-3380 Eldorado, Misiones, Argentina","Holzmann, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Misiones UNaM, CONICET, IBS, RA-3370 Puerto Iguazu, Misiones, Argentina.",holzmanningrid@yahoo.com.ar,,"Di Bitetti, Mario/0000-0001-9704-8649; Areta, Juan Ignacio/0000-0001-8588-3030",National Research Council of Argentina (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Comite Ejecutivo de Desarrollo e Innovacion Teconologica (CEDIT); Rufford Small Grant,"We thank the Ministry of Ecology of Misiones for the research permit and all the people who contributed to this article with presence localities of both howler species: M.

A fundamental assumption of the model is that the landscape is homogeneous and the species moves between identical patches at random. However, this assumption clearly contrasts with the common observation that different stages prefer or require different habitat types. Here I studied a minimum extension of the Levins model in which the species has stage-specific (juvenile and adult) spatial distributions and dispersal occurs at the timing of reproduction and maturation (i.e., ontogenetic habitat shifts). I examined how the persistence of the stage-structured metapopulations would be affected by rescue effect and interspecific competition. The models predict that rates of ontogenetic habitat shifts are particularly crucial for the persistence or coexistence of stage-structured metapopulations because the species need to complete biphasic life cycles. The present study opens a new avenue for exploring stage-and space-structured population dynamics and will contribute to better landscape management for the conservation of stage-structured animals.","Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Nakazawa, T (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",take.nkzw@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [103-2621-336 B-006-003]",This study was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (103-2621-336 B-006-003).,,50,4,4,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JAN 19,2015,5,,,,,,,,7871,10.1038/srep07871,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AZ1CT,WOS:000347978600010,25598411,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Field experimentation to identify density dependent effects is often cost and time prohibitive. Thus, assimilation of existing knowledge into a balance of probabilities can serve as a surrogate for experimental research. A case study of such a process is found in the mule deer Odocoileus hemionus herds of Colorado. Wildlife managers and hunters expressed concern over a recent decline in western Colorado mule deer herds, yet the underlying cause of this decline is yet to be determined. In response to this management concern, we conducted a review of scientific evidence on Colorado's mule deer population dynamics. This review was done in the context of a conceptual model that portrays population growth as a function of population size, per capita growth rate and population carrying capacity. Similar declines that occurred during the 1960s and early 1990s resulted in similar reviews that identified research and management topics that would benefit mule deer. These topics included: harvest, predation, intraspecific competition, disease, interspecific competition, and habitat loss and degradation. Between the late 1990s and present time, many of these topics were addressed by research. The conventional working hypothesis in Colorado is that mule deer herds are limited by winter range habitat. We identify new gaps in knowledge and suggest potential, future research topics, as well as potential management strategies. We suggest a focus on integrated studies of multiple herbivores with density reduction experiments to address intra- and inter- specific competition. In addition, we suggest focused experiments that address the roles of mountain lion predation, black bear predation, and disease in mule deer population dynamics.","[Bergman, Eric J.; Holland, A.

Specifically, mast production and acorn weevil (Curculio L., 1758) occupancy were estimated annually from 2006 to 2008 for individual host trees in a sample of 74 northern red oaks (Quercus rubra L.), 100 white oaks (Quercus alba L.), and 81 shagbark hickories (Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch) in west-central Indiana, USA. Occupancy and vital rates of nine Curculio species on their primary host-tree species were derived using multispecies, multiseason (MSMS) models within a Bayesian framework, accounting for imperfect detection. Mast production of host trees had a strong positive effect on community-level occupancy and survival of Curculio. Mast production varied considerably between years and generally was spatially autocorrelated only at distances <2 km, which likely reduced interspecific resource competition. Derived estimates of mean weevil species richness per tree and community similarity were highest in 2007 when mast production on all host-tree species was in phase. Generalist species compensated for lower survival rate on secondary hosts with higher colonization rates on these hosts during a year of mast failure in the primary host. We hypothesize that differential suitability of hosts as resources for Curculio created a spatial storage effect that, when coupled with a temporal storage effect induced by prolonged diapause common among Curculio, facilitated species coexistence. Methodologically, increased precision of parameter estimates from MSMS models makes it generally more useful than single-species models in studies of community dynamics.","[Govindan, Byju N.; Swihart, Robert K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Govindan, BN (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, LJ Smith 211,POB 646120, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",byju.ng@wsu.edu,"Swihart, Robert K/D-2787-2016; Govindan, Byju N./J-7665-2015","Govindan, Byju N./0000-0001-8126-1445","James S.

This preliminary study about relation between Nicrophorus species in the forest edge was conducted near the city of Poznan (western Poland). During observation significant differences between burying beetles activity were recorded. Furthermore, analysis of obtained data definitely showed that Nicrophorus vespilloides Herbst, a typical forest species, was frequently observed also in the forest edge. However, activity of N. vespilloides was shaped differently in different habitats. In the other hand typical meadow species, Nicrophorus vespillo L., was reported predominantly in cages placed in preferred habitat. These results could be explained by results of analysis of temperature data.

In high-elevation Scofield Reservoir in Utah the unintentional introduction of Utah Chub Gila atraria and subsequent population expansion prompted a shift from stocking exclusively Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to include tiger trout (female Brown Trout Salmo trutta x male Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis) and Bonneville Cutthroat Trout O. clarkii utah, which composed a novel suite of top predators and potential competitors. We examined the interspecific interactions among Scofield Reservoir piscivores using a multifaceted approach including gut analyses, stable isotopes, and gape limitation. Large Cutthroat Trout consumed 50-100% Utah Chub and tiger trout consumed 45-80%. In contrast, small and large Rainbow Trout consumed primarily invertebrate prey and exhibited significant overlap with small tiger trout, Cutthroat Trout, and Utah Chub. Large Cutthroat Trout and tiger trout occupy a top piscivore trophic niche and are more littoral, while Rainbow Trout occupy an omnivore niche space and are more pelagic. Both Cutthroat and tiger trout varied in niche space with respect to size-class, demonstrating an ontogenetic shift to piscivory at approximately 350 mm TL. Cutthroat Trout and tiger trout are capable of consuming prey up to 50% of their own size, which is larger than predicted based on their theoretical gape limit. Because it appears food resources (Utah Chub) are not limited, and performance metrics are high, competition is unlikely between Cutthroat Trout and tiger trout. In contrast, apparent survival of Rainbow Trout has recently declined significantly, potentially due to shared food resources with Utah Chub or negative behavioral interactions with other members of the community. Collectively, this research aids in understanding biotic interactions within a top-heavy and novel fish community and assists towards developing and implementing suitable management strategies to control nuisance species.","[Winters, Lisa K.; Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Winters, Lisa K.; Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Budy, P (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",phaedra.budy@usu.edu,,,Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (Federal Sport Fish Restoration) [F-134-R]; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; Utah Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Ecology Center at Utah State University; State of Utah [1COLL8712]; IACUC protocol [1544],"Funding and support for this project was provided by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (Federal Sport Fish Restoration, Project F-134-R), U.S. Geological Survey, Utah Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, in-kind, and the Ecology Center at Utah State University.

Numbers of nesting Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were stable at about 700-1,000 breeding pairs at five colonies and about 1,200-1,500 breeding pairs at four colonies, respectively. Numbers of American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) increased at Badger Island, the sole breeding colony for the species on the Columbia Plateau, from about 900 individuals in 2007 to over 2,000 individuals in 2010. Overall numbers of breeding California gulls (Larus californicus) and ring-billed gulls (L. delawarensis) declined during the study, mostly because of the abandonment of a large colony in the mid-Columbia River. Three gull colonies below the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers increased substantially, however. Factors that may limit colony size and productivity for piscivorous waterbirds nesting on the Columbia Plateau included availability of suitable nesting habitat, interspecific competition for nest sites, predation, gull kleptoparasitism, food availability, and human disturbance. Based on observed population trends alone, there is little reason to project increased impacts to juvenile salmonid survival from tern and cormorant populations. Additional monitoring and evaluation may be warranted to assess future impacts of the growing Badger Island American white pelican colony and those gull colonies located near mainstem dams or associated with Caspian tern colonies where kleptoparasitism is common.","[Adkins, Jessica Y.; Lyons, Donald E.; Loschl, Peter J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Roby, Daniel D.] Oregon State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oregon Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Collis, Ken; Evans, Allen F.; Hostetter, Nathan J.] Real Time Res Inc, Bend, OR 97702 USA","Collis, K (corresponding author), Real Time Res Inc, 52 SW Roosevelt Ave, Bend, OR 97702 USA.",ken@realtimeresearch.com,,,U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Walla Walla District; U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR),"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Walla Walla District and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) provided funding for this research; we thank C.

However, several key challenges remain. First, while many studies have explored connections between functional traits and abiotic gradients, far fewer have directly tested the common assumption that functional trait differences influence interspecific interactions. Second, empirical studies often ignore intraspecific trait variation within communities, even though intraspecific variation has been known to have substantial impacts on community dynamics. Here we present an experiment designed to assess the role of functional trait differences in predicting the outcome of interspecific species interactions among a suite of California vernal pool annual plants. Eight species were grown in pairwise combinations in two levels of inundation in a greenhouse and functional traits were measured on all individuals. Nested models predicting focal plant performance were fit to the data. For seven of the eight species in the experiment, the best model included a functional trait difference term that was consistent with a competitive hierarchy, indicating that focal species tended to do better when they had larger leaf size, lower specific leaf area, and greater investment in lateral canopy spread than their neighbors. Models that included individually measured trait values generally performed better than models using species trait averages. We tested if the same trait measurements predicted tolerance of inundation (a feature of vernal pool habitats), and species depth distributions from extensive field surveys, though we did not find strong relationships. Our results suggest that functional traits can be used to make inferences about the outcome of interspecific interactions, and that greater predictive power can come from considering intraspecific variation in functional traits, particularly in low diversity communities.","[Kraft, Nathan J.

One potential mechanism is the storage effect hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, species co-exist because they differ in when they are most actively using resource and, therefore, respond differently to environmental perturbation. The hypothesis is based on two main assumptions: (i) two competitors have different responses to climate and (ii) the responses to climate are mediated by changes in the relative importance of intra- and interspecific competition. The hypothesis could provide useful insights into the role of climate in maintaining weed species diversity and potential shifts in dominant species under climate change. This study tested the basic principles of the storage effect hypothesis on weed communities using data from the Broadbalk long-term fertiliser experiment. Relative abundance of weeds in 10 plots with contrasting fertility but no herbicides was assessed for 21years. Multivariate analyses and generalised additive mixed models were used to analyse the data. The following pairs of species were found to be adapted to similar fertiliser levels, but diverged in their response to climate: (i) Papaver rhoeas-Tripleurospermum inodorum, (ii) Medicago lupulina-Vicia sativa and (iii) Scandix pecten-veneris-Ranunculus arvensis.

Understanding these patterns is important for predicting future community composition in the context of climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances. However, we know little about how these environmental stressors might change interspecific interactions. Here we present an analysis on the role of putative foundation species (cushion-type life forms) in determining the phylogenetic community composition of vascular plants at the local scale. We also investigated how community diversity and structure shifts across an environmental severity gradient. Abundance data for vascular plants was collected within and outside of four focal cushion plant species along an elevation gradient in Canadian alpine tundra. We compared differences in species-specific abundance within plots with foundation plants to the same measure in adjacent open plots. Using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny, we quantified community structure metrics, including the net relatedness index (NRI), a novel net relatedness to focal index (NRFI), and an index of species co-occurrence across the gradient. We examined the trends in these indices with cushion plant presence/absence and environmental severity using both linear regression and mixed effect models. We found that the loss of species richness at higher elevations was counterbalanced by a decrease in interspecific relatedness, maintaining phylogenetic diversity across the gradient. We found no evidence for community diversity or structure modifications by cushion plants, nor any evidence that species were preferentially associating with these hypothesized foundation species. On the contrary, many species had significantly negative co-occurrence with the cushion plants. Overall, our results suggest that the cushion plant life forms may exhibit interspecific dynamics that are at least as competitive as they are facilitative. The decrease in phylogenetic clustering with elevation suggests that traits that allow persistence in these conditions are convergent at the local scale.","[Harris, Liam W.; Elliott, Tammy L.; Davies, T.

A long-standing hypothesis in ecology and evolutionary biology is that closely related species are more ecologically similar to each other and therefore compete more strongly than distant relatives do. A recent hypothesis posits that evolutionary relatedness may also explain the prevalence of mutualisms, with facilitative interactions being more common among distantly related species. Despite the importance of these hypotheses for understanding the structure and function of ecological communities, experimental tests to determine how evolutionary relatedness influences competition and facilitation are still somewhat rare. 2. Here, we report results of a laboratory experiment in which we assessed how competitive and facilitative interactions among eight species of freshwater green algae are influenced by their relatedness. We measured the prevalence of competition and facilitation among 28 pairs of freshwater green algal species that were chosen to span a large gradient of phylogenetic distances. For each species, we first measured its invasion success when introduced into a steady-state population of another resident species. Then, we compared its growth rate when grown alone in monoculture to its growth rate when introduced as an invader. The change in the species' population growth rate as an invader (sensitivity) is used as a measure of the strength of its interaction with the resident species. A reduced growth rate in the presence of another species indicates competition, whereas an increased growth rate indicates facilitation. 3. Although competition between species was more frequent (75% of interactions), facilitation was common (the other 25% of interactions). We found no significant relationship between the phylogenetic distance separating two interacting species and the success of invasion, nor the prevalence or strength of either competition or facilitation. Interspecific interactions depended more on the identity of the species, with certain taxa consistently acting as good or bad competitors/facilitators. These species were not predictable a priori from their positions on a phylogeny. 4. Synthesis. The phylogenetic relatedness of the green algae species used here did not predict the prevalence of competitive and facilitative interactions, rejecting the hypothesis that close relatives compete strongly and contesting recent evidence that facilitation is likely to occur between distant relatives.","[Venail, Patrick A.; Narwani, Anita; Fritschie, Keith; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Venail, Patrick A.] Univ Geneva, Inst FA Forel, Sect Earth & Environm Sci, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland; [Alexandrou, Markos A.; Oakley, Todd H.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Venail, PA (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst FA Forel, 10 Route Suisse,CP 416, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland.",Patrick.Venail@unige.ch,"Venail, Patrick/D-2968-2018","Venail, Patrick/0000-0003-1126-280X; Oakley, Todd/0000-0002-4478-915X; Narwani, Anita/0000-0003-4561-0163",U.S. National Science Foundation's DIMENSIONS of Biodiversity programme [DEB-1046121]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1046121] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank S.

In spite of their sympatry within Georgia, they are never syntopic. Furthermore, in contrast with H. buchii, H. lucorum is mainly found in areas subject to human disturbance. Another large helicoid species, Caucasotachea calligera, is widespread in Georgia and usually co-occurs with either Helix. The distribution patterns of these species suggest that interspecific competition might play an important role in shaping the distribution of the two Helix species. In order to see whether their ecological niches were different enough to provide such a distribution pattern, I used predictive ecological niche models (ENM) based on the Maximum Entropy algorithm. ENMs showed that the niches of these species in Georgia were significantly different but not fully separated (similar to 15-36% overlap). The distributional pattern of H. lucorum should not be considered truly natural in Georgia and may be anthropogenic. The fact that the two Helix species never co-occur may result from factors other than ecological niche differentiation at any macro scale. Since competition remains the most useful and informative assumption to explain the distributional pattern of these congeneric species, microhabitat requirements also need to be tested as a potential driver.","[Mumladze, Levan] Ilia State Univ, Inst Ecol, GE-0162 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Mumladze, Levan] IRC, GE-0119 Tbilisi, Georgia","Mumladze, L (corresponding author), Ilia State Univ, Inst Ecol, Kakutsa Cholokashvili St 3-4, GE-0162 Tbilisi, Georgia.",lmumladze@gmail.com,"mumladze, levan/J-4347-2012","mumladze, levan/0000-0002-2172-6973",Shota Rustaveli National Scientific Foundation of Georgia; Presidential Grants for Young Scientists [2-2/04]; Unitas Malacologica Travel grant,"I would like to thank Robert Cameron, Maka Murvanidze, Alexandre Gavashelishvili and two anonymous reviewers for their suggestions during the preparation of the manuscript.

However, the extent to which this niche construction can propagate across food webs and shape trait variation in competing species is unknown. Here, we tested whether niche construction by different life-history variants of the planktivorous fish alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) can drive phenotypic divergence and resource use in the competing species bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Using a combination of common garden experiments and a comparative field study, we found that bluegill from landlocked alewife lakes grew relatively better when fed small than large zooplankton, had gill rakers better adapted for feeding on small-bodied prey and selected smaller zooplankton compared with bluegill from lakes with anadromous or no alewife. Observed shifts in bluegill foraging traits in lakes with landlocked alewife parallel those in alewife, suggesting interspecific competition leading to parallel phenotypic changes rather than to divergence (which is commonly predicted). Our findings suggest that species may be locally adapted to prey communities structured by different life-history variants of a competing dominant species.","[Huss, Magnus; Howeth, Jennifer G.; Osterman, Julia I.; Post, David M.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Huss, M (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",magnus.huss@slu.se,"Post, David M/A-6987-2009","Post, David M/0000-0003-1434-7729","Yale University; USA National Science Foundation (DEB ) [0717265]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1343920, 1343916] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This research was supported by Yale University, the USA National Science Foundation (DEB no. 0717265) and a postdoctoral fellowship from the Swedish Research Council to M.H.",,34,11,11,0,52,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In many species, sperm from one male compete with those from others to find and fertilize oocytes. Since this competition occurs inside the female reproductive tract, she often influences the outcome through physical or chemical factors, leading to cryptic female choice. Finally, traits that help males compete with each other are sometimes harmful to females, and female countermeasures may thwart the interests of males, which can lead to an arms race between the sexes known as sexually antagonistic coevolution. New studies from Caenorhabditis nematodes suggest that males compete with each other by producing sperm that migrate aggressively and that these sperm may be more likely to win access to oocytes. However, one byproduct of this competition appears to be an increased probability that these sperm will go astray, invading the ovary, prematurely activating oocytes, and sometimes crossing basement membranes and leaving the gonad altogether. These harmful effects are sometimes observed in crosses between animals of the same species but are most easily detected in interspecies crosses, leading to dramatically lowered fitness, presumably because the competitiveness of the sperm and the associated female countermeasures are not precisely matched. This mismatch is most obvious in crosses involving individuals from androdioecious species (which have both hermaphrodites and males), as predicted by the lower levels of sperm competition these species experience. These results suggest a striking example of sexually antagonistic coevolution and dramatically expand the value of nematodes as a laboratory system for studying postcopulatory interactions.","[Ellis, Ronald E.] Rowan Univ SOM, Dept Mol Biol, Stratford, NJ 08084 USA; [Schaerer, Lukas] Univ Basel, Inst Zool, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland","Ellis, RE (corresponding author), Rowan Univ SOM, Dept Mol Biol, Stratford, NJ 08084 USA.",ellisre@rowan.edu,"Scharer, Lukas/B-4396-2008","Scharer, Lukas/0000-0002-0209-9871",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1021128]; Swiss NSF grant [31003A-143732],"REE was supported by NSF grant 1021128, and LS was supported by Swiss NSF grant 31003A-143732.

We traced the development of temperate-zone plant communities during the first 7 years of primary succession on catchment soils to explore patterns of initial species assembly. We found pronounced small-scale differences in the phylogenetic composition of neighbouring plant assemblages and a large-scale trend towards phylogenetic evenness. This small-scale variability appears to be mediated by soil properties, particularly carbonate content. Therefore, abiotic environmental conditions might counteract or even supersede the effects of interspecific competition among closely related species, which are usually predicted to exhibit patterns of phylogenetic evenness.

Lions (Panthera leo) are the dominant large carnivore in African savannah ecosystems and wild dogs avoid them both spatially and temporally. Wild dog young are particularly vulnerable and suffer high rates of mortality from lions. Since lions do not utilize all parts of the landscape with an equal intensity, spatial variation in lion densities can be exploited by wild dogs both during their general ranging behaviour, but more specifically when they are confined to a den with vulnerable young. Since patches of rugged terrain are associated with lower lion densities, we hypothesized that these comparatively safe habitats should be selected by wild dogs for denning. We investigated the relationship between the distribution of 100 wild dog den sites and the occurrence of rugged terrain in four wild dog populations located in Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa. A terrain ruggedness index was derived from a 90 m digital elevation model and used to map terrain ruggedness at each site. We compared characteristics of actual and potential (random) den sites to determine how wild dogs select den sites. The distributions of wild dog dens were strongly associated with rugged terrain and wild dogs actively selected terrain that was more rugged than that available on average. The likelihood of encountering lions is reduced in these habitats, minimizing the risk to both adults and pups. Our findings have important implications for the conservation management of the species, especially when assessing habitat suitability for potential reintroductions. The simple technique used to assess terrain ruggedness may be useful to investigate habitat suitability, and even predict highly suitable denning areas, across large landscapes.","[Jackson, Craig R.; Roskaft, Eivin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Power, R.

Therefore, understanding, predicting and controlling plant invasions became issues of great practical importance. In the present paper, a model for plant invasion based on allelopathic suppression is proposed and studied through analytical methods and numerical integration. Employing linear stability analysis the conditions for plant coexistence as well as one species extinction were determined for the spatially homogeneous system. These conditions demonstrate the advantage conferred to the alien plant by its phytotoxin. It was shown that the system exhibits bistability between two distinct fixed points, either associated to species coexistence or to the extinction of one species. Numerical simulation is also included to support such results. Further, the invasion spreading starting from a single, spatially localized initial focus was investigated by numerical integration of the model's equations. As obtained for the spatially homogeneous system, at strong interspecific competition the outcome is the extinction of one plant species. In contrast, at low interspecific competition, the rule is the coexistence between the invader and native plants.

According to predictions of niche partitioning, segregation is expected to occur at habitat boundaries among congeners and within habitats among conspecifics, while negative relationships in the density of species or populations will occur in areas of overlap. We tested these predictions by modelling the winter distributions of two crested penguin species from three colonies in the south-western Atlantic. Location Penguins were tracked from two large colonies on the Falkland Islands and one in South Georgia, from where they dispersed through the South Atlantic, Southern Ocean and south-eastern Pacific. Methods Forty macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) from South Georgia and 82 southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) from two colonies in the Falkland Islands were equipped with global location sensors which log time and light, allowing positions to be estimated twice-daily, from April to August in 2011. Positions were gridded and converted into maps of penguin density. Metrics of overlap were calculated and density was related to remote-sensed oceanographic variables and competitor density using generalized additive models. Results Macaroni penguins from western South Georgia and southern rockhopper penguins from Steeple Jason Island, Falkland Islands, were spatially segregated by differences in their habitat preferences thus supporting our first prediction regarding interspecific segregation. However, southern rockhopper penguins from Beauchene Island showed a marked spatial overlap with macaroni penguins as the two had similar habitat preferences and strong mutual associations when controlling for habitat. Contrary to our predictions relating to intraspecific segregation, southern rockhopper penguins from Beauchene Island and Steeple Jason Island were segregated by differences in habitat selection. Main conclusions Morphological differentiation probably allows macaroni penguins from South Georgia and southern rockhopper penguins from Beauchene Island to coexist in areas of spatial overlap, whereas segregation of the two Falkland rockhopper penguin populations may have arisen from two distinct lineages retaining cultural fidelity to ancestral wintering areas.","[Ratcliffe, Norman; Brown, Ruth; Adlard, Stacey; Horswill, Catharine; Venables, Hugh; Trathan, Philip N.; Staniland, Iain J.] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Crofts, Sarah; Baylis, Alastair M.

Implementing biotic interactions in spatial models of community assembly is therefore essential for accurately modelling assemblage properties. However, this remains a challenge due to the difficulty of detecting the role of species interactions and because accurate paired community and environment data sets are required to disentangle biotic influences from abiotic effects. Here, we incorporate data from three dominant species into community-level models as a proxy for the frequency and intensity of their interactions with other species and predict emergent assemblage properties for the co-occurring subdominant species. By analysing plant community and field-quantified environmental data from specially designed and spatially replicated monitoring grids, we provide a robust in vivo test of community models. Considering this well-defined and easily quantified surrogate for biotic interactions consistently improved realism in all aspects of community models (community composition, species richness and functional structure), irrespective of modelling methodology. Dominant species reduced community richness locally and favoured species with similar leaf dry matter content. This effect was most pronounced under conditions of high plant biomass and cover, where stronger competitive impacts are expected. Analysis of leaf dry matter content suggests that this effect may occur through efficient resource sequestration. Synthesis. We demonstrate the strong role of dominant species in shaping multiple plant community attributes, and thus the need to explicitly include interspecific interactions to achieve robust predictions of assemblage properties. Incorporating information on biotic interactions strengthens our capacity not only to predict the richness and composition of communities, but also how their structure and function will be modified in the face of global change.","[le Roux, Peter C.; Luoto, Miska] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [le Roux, Peter C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Plant Sci, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pellissier, Loic; Wisz, Mary S.] Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Wisz, Mary S.] Greenland Inst Nat Resources, Greenland Climate Res Ctr, Nuuk, Greenland; [Wisz, Mary S.] DHI Water & Environm, Dept Ecol & Environm, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark","le Roux, PC (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",peter.leroux@up.ac.za,"le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011; Pellissier, Loic/J-2563-2015; Pellissier, Loic/AAG-1013-2020","le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Wisz, Mary S./0000-0002-5357-6367; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143",Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [12-126430]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [1140873],"We thank two anonymous referees and our editor for constructive comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

The non-native mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus have been resident in the southeastern United States for over a century. They coexist at some urban sites with the more recent invasive Aedes albopictus, which is usually superior in interspecific competition. We tested predictions of temporal and spatial habitat segregation that foster coexistence of these resident species with the superior invasive competitor. We measured spatial and temporal patterns of site occupancy and abundance for all three species among standard oviposition traps in metropolitan Tampa, Florida. Consistent with the condition-specific competition hypothesis, A. albopictus and A. aegypti abundances were greater and C. quinquefasciatus abundance was lower late (September) versus early (June) in the rainy season, and the proportional increase of A. albopictus abundance was greater than that of A. aegypti. These results are postulated to result from greater dry-season egg mortality and associated greater rainy-season competitive superiority of larvae of A. albopictus, followed by A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. Spatial partitioning among landscape variables was also evident among species, with A. albopictus more likely to oviposit across a range of open grass landscapes whereas A. aegypti were mostly restricted to cemeteries. Culex quinquefasciatus showed a shift in abundance from cemeteries early in the rainy season to developed areas characterized by built environments with large proportions of impervious surfaces late in the rainy season, where A. albopictus was not in its highest abundance. These results suggest that both temporal and spatial variation, and their interaction, may contribute to local coexistence between Aedes and Culex mosquito species in urban areas.","[Leisnham, Paul T.] Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [LaDeau, Shannon L.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY USA; [Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61761 USA","Leisnham, PT (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",leisnham@umd.edu,,"Leisnham, Paul T./0000-0003-3527-8435; LaDeau, Shannon/0000-0003-4825-5435; Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01-AI-44793]; Illinois State University; University of Maryland; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Field work was funded by NIAID grant R01-AI-44793 (Illinois State University subaward) and by a grant to SAJ from Illinois State University.

To understand these constraints, we characterized distributions of 15 herbivore species from water, locations of peak density and degree of clustering around the peaks using zero-inflated count data models and mapping census data collected in the Mara reserve and the adjoining pastoral ranches in Kenya during a wet and dry year. Herbivores followed a humped pattern (n = 46), suggesting constrained foraging in which they balance the benefits of proximity to water with the costs of foraging where food is depleted near water and travelling to more abundant food distant from water; an exponentially decreasing pattern (n = 11), indicating strong attraction to water or vegetation near water; or a uniform (n = 3) pattern. The details rather than the types of these patterns varied between years. Herbivores concentrated farther from water and more tightly around locations of their peak densities in the ranches than the reserve. Herbivores were more abundant and widely distributed from water in the wet than the dry year, and segregated along the distance-to-water gradient, presumably to minimize interspecific competition for food. Pastoralism compressed herbivore distributions and partially excluded some species (warthog, hartebeest, topi, wildebeest, zebra, eland, buffalo and elephant) from, while attracting others (Grant's and Thomson's gazelles, impala, giraffe) to the ranches, relative to the reserve. Regulating cultivation, fencing, settlements and livestock stocking levels in the ranches would allow continued wildlife access to water, reduce competition with, displacement or harassment of wildlife by people, livestock and dogs near water.","[Ogutu, Joseph O.; Reid, Robin S.; Kruska, Russell L.; Worden, Jeffrey S.; Nyabenge, Meshack] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Ogutu, Joseph O.; Piepho, Hans-Peter] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Reid, Robin S.; Hobbs, Nicholas T.; Worden, Jeffrey S.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Rainy, Michael E.] Explore Mara Ltd, Nairobi 00200, Kenya","Ogutu, JO (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Fruwirthstr 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",jogutu2007@gmail.com; Robin.Reid@colostate.edu; piepho@uni-hohenheim.de; Tom.hobbs@colostate.edu; mikerainy@gmail.com; r.kruska@cgiar.org; jeffrey.worden@gmail.com; m.nyabenge@cgiar.org,"Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016","Piepho, Hans-Peter/0000-0001-7813-2992; Ogutu, Joseph O/0000-0002-7379-0387","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0342820]; Belgian Government [DGIC BEL011]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Fellowship at the Institute of Crop Science, Bioinformatics Unit, University of Hohenheim, GermanyAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","The data were collected by 22 vehicle- and 3 aircraft-counting teams, 20 organisations and 84 individuals in 1999 and 2002 (see http://www.masaimaracount.org for details).

We surveyed the relationship between a shrub species (Artemisia tridentata) and pine seedlings (Pinus monophylla) across the Great Basin and the Mojave Desert, USA, encompassing the entire range of P. monophylla. Using 69 sites we evaluated the spatial association between P. monophylla seedlings and A. tridentata shrubs, quantified with an electivity index, and implemented multiple regression analysis on the effects of macro- and micro-environmental factors: precipitation, temperature, monsoonality index, topography, substrate and litter cover. We identified annual precipitation as a main factor, which was negatively related to shrub-seedling association. Additionally, shrub-seedling association was stronger in the hot- than in the cold-desert, and was negatively related to litter cover. Effects of monsoonality, summer temperature, and bedrock type were not significant. We also considered nonlinear functional forms of a precipitation electivity relationship, but the negative linear model proved most predictive. Our observations match SGH predictions. Studying the role of interspecific interactions in shaping species range shifts may lead to improved predictions of distribution ranges and changes in dryland vegetation under global change scenarios.

However, an alternative view is that lineages typically interact when relatively old(6), by which time selection for divergence is weak(7,8) and potentially exceeded by convergent selection acting on traits mediating interspecific competition(9). Few studies have tested these contrasting predictions across large radiations, or by controlling for evolutionary time. Thus the role of species interactions in driving broad-scale patterns of trait divergence is unclear(10). Here we use phylogenetic estimates of divergence times to show that increased trait differences among coexisting lineages of ovenbirds (Furnariidae) are explained by their greater evolutionary age in relation to non-interacting lineages, and that-when these temporal biases are accounted for-the only significant effect of coexistence is convergence in a social signal (song). Our results conflict with the conventional view that coexistence promotes trait divergence among co-occurring organisms at macroevolutionary scales, and instead provide evidence that species interactions can drive phenotypic convergence across entire radiations, a pattern generally concealed by biases in age.","[Tobias, Joseph A.; Cornwallis, Charlie K.; Seddon, Nathalie] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Cornwallis, Charlie K.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Derryberry, Elizabeth P.; Claramunt, Santiago; Brumfield, Robb T.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Derryberry, Elizabeth P.] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Claramunt, Santiago; Brumfield, Robb T.] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Claramunt, Santiago] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Ornithol, New York, NY 10024 USA","Tobias, JA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",joseph.tobias@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Brumfield, Robb T/K-6108-2015; Claramunt, Santiago/H-5483-2019","Brumfield, Robb T/0000-0003-2307-0688; Derryberry, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8248-9748; Claramunt, Santiago/0000-0002-8926-5974; Tobias, Joseph/0000-0003-2429-6179; Seddon, Nathalie/0000-0002-1880-6104","John Fell Fund; Browne Fellowship, Queen's College, Oxford; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission","We thank G.

One potential source of this spatial aggregation is seed dispersal but it is unclear to what extent aggregated seed distributions affect plant diversity in real communities. Using a field experiment, I tested whether uniform or aggregated seed arrival alters community structure and whether these effects vary with sowing density. Methods The experiment consisted of two spatial seeding treatments (uniform and aggregated) that were fully crossed with three seed density treatments. Sixty, 3 x 4-m plots were arrayed in a low-diversity grassland located in Kansas, USA. Each plot was divided into forty-eight, 0.5 x 0.5-m patches. For aggregated seeding treatments, each of the 15 species was sown into three randomly selected patches within the plot (3 x 15 = 45). To create a uniform species arrival but control for the seed addition method, all 15 species were sown into 45 individual patches (with three patches remaining unsown) within each plot. Seed mass for each species was held constant at the plot scale between uniform or aggregated treatments within a given level of the sowing density treatment. After two growing seasons, plant density was quantified for all sown species in 15 randomly selected patches from each plot. Important Findings I found evidence for shifts in community structure in response to the different spatial seeding patterns. The evenness of added species was higher under aggregated than uniform sowing patterns. There was no detectable effect of aggregated seed sowing on species richness at 3.75 m(2) scale. However, when species richness was extrapolated to larger scales (11.25 m(2)), aggregated sowing was predicted to have greater richness than uniform sowing. Effects of seed aggregation on community structure were apparent only at moderate to high sowing rates, yet the latter are within the range of measured seed dispersal in similar grasslands. Additionally, as sowing density increased, seed mass became an increasingly effective predictor of relative abundances for added species, but only under uniform sowing patterns supporting the idea that aggregated dispersal may buffer weaker (smaller seeded) species from competition during colonization. This is the first experiment to show that aggregated seed dispersal patterns can increase at least some components of plant diversity in undisturbed grasslands and suggests that previous seed dispersal experiments, which utilize uniform seed sowing, may underestimate the potential effect of dispersal on plant community structure.","Wichita State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Wichita, KS 67260 USA","Houseman, GR (corresponding author), Wichita State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",greg.houseman@wichita.edu,,"Houseman, Gregory/0000-0001-6554-770X",Wichita State University; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS 0903806],Wichita State University; National Science Foundation (EPS 0903806).,,49,12,12,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.) are historically considered generalist predators such that food is not a limiting resource. However, in this study we show that the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) and the aquatic garter snake (Thamnophis atratus) show a strong preference for amphibians as their primary food source at the Santa Lucia Preserve (SLP), Monterey County, California. This food preference forces these snake species at SLP to exploit aquatic habitats. Our principle goal was to investigate the aggressive behavior of T. sirtalis and the potential that this aggression displaces T. atratus from its preferred habitat. We found that when individuals from either species are alone, a 100% preference for aquatic or near aquatic habitat is observed. In contrast, when these species are together, T. sirtalis occupy the aquatic habitat and T. atratus occupy an area far removed from water. Thamnophis sirtalis often physically force T. atratus from the aquatic habitat through repeated biting and other displays of aggression.","[Edgehouse, Michael] Lewis Clark State Coll, Dept Nat Sci & Math, Lewiston, ID 83501 USA; [Latta, Leigh C.] Reed Coll, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Brodie, Edmund D., III] Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Brodie, Edmund D., III] Univ Virginia, Mt Lake Biol Stn, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Brodie, Edmund D., Jr.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Edgehouse, M (corresponding author), Lewis Clark State Coll, Dept Nat Sci & Math, Lewiston, ID 83501 USA.",mjedgehouse@lcsc.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0315172, DEB-0922251]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0922216] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by National Science Foundation grants to EDB Jr and EDB III (DEB-0315172, DEB-0922251).

Within these communities, microbial cells excrete a wide range of metabolites, setting the stage for interspecific metabolic interactions. The links, however, between metabolic and ecological interactions (functional relationships), and species spatial organization (structural relationships) are still poorly understood. Here, we use an individual-based modelling framework to simulate the growth of a two-species surface-attached community where food (resource) is traded for detoxification (service) and investigate how metabolic constraints of individual species shape the emergent structural and functional relationships of the community. We show that strong metabolic interdependence drives the emergence of mutualism, robust interspecific mixing, and increased community productivity. Specifically, we observed a striking and highly stable emergent lineage branching pattern, generating a persistent lineage mixing that was absent when the metabolic exchange was removed. These emergent community properties are driven by demographic feedbacks, such that aid from neighbouring cells directly enhances focal cell growth, which in turn feeds back to neighbour fecundity. In contrast, weak metabolic interdependence drives conflict (exploitation or competition), and in turn greater interspecific segregation. Together, these results support the idea that species structural and functional relationships represent the net balance of metabolic interdependencies.","[Estrela, Sylvie; Brown, Sam P.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Estrela, Sylvie; Brown, Sam P.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Estrela, S (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",s.estrela@sms.ed.ac.uk,"Brown, Sam/B-5234-2009","Brown, Sam/0000-0003-1892-9275; Estrela, Sylvie/0000-0003-1946-3657",PDBC-IGC; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BD/33856/2009]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [082273/Z/07/Z],"SE was supported by PDBC-IGC and funded by FCT (SFRH/BD/33856/2009).

Consideration of species interactions when estimating functions of population distribution is unusual, and may be crucial to understand and predict how species use space and resources. In this study, we combine resource selection probability functions (RSPFs) with a model selection approach based on information theory to evaluate how biotic (interspecific interactions) and abiotic (environmental) factors affect resource selection of guanacos Lama guanicoe and livestock (goats, sheep, cattle and horses) in two seasonal periods. We first test different a priori hypotheses of the environmental effects on guanacos and livestock occurrence (i.e. foraging, predation/topography and human effect hypotheses), then we assess model performance with independent data, and finally we use validated models of each species as predictors of the interaction between them. In all seasons, L.guanicoe occurrence was influenced by both environment and livestock interactions, especially small livestock (goats and sheep). Guanacos selected for habitats characterized by high temporal variability in plant productivity and away from potential human contact. In all seasons, L.guanicoe was negatively related to the RSPF of small livestock, but the reverse was not the case, suggesting that L.guanicoe avoids sites used by goats and sheep. In contrast, livestock was mainly affected by environmental variables related to human presence and was not affected by the interactions with herbivores. Contrary to our predictions, goats and sheep were also associated with less productive sites, probably indicating strong degradation of the sites to which they are restricted. Our results suggest a spatial segregation between L.guanicoe and domestic herbivores throughout the year, which is explained by competitive interactions of L.guanicoe with small livestock but also in response to vegetation productivity and human pressure. This study shows the importance of including species interaction effects in habitat modeling.","[Schroeder, N.

While it is recognized that evolution will play a role in determining how environmental changes directly affect species, the interactions among species force us to consider the coevolutionary responses of species to environmental changes. Methodology/Principle Findings: We use simple models of competition, predation, and mutualism to organize and synthesize the ways coevolution modifies species interactions when climatic changes favor one species over another. In cases where species have conflicting interests (i.e., selection for increased interspecific interaction strength on one species is detrimental to the other), we show that coevolution reduces the effects of climate change, leading to smaller changes in abundances and reduced chances of extinction. Conversely, when species have nonconflicting interests (i.e., selection for increased interspecific interaction strength on one species benefits the other), coevolution increases the effects of climate change. Conclusions/Significance: Coevolution sets up feedback loops that either dampen or amplify the effect of environmental change on species abundances depending on whether coevolution has conflicting or nonconflicting effects on species interactions. Thus, gaining a better understanding of the coevolutionary processes between interacting species is critical for understanding how communities respond to a changing climate. We suggest experimental methods to determine which types of coevolution (conflicting or nonconflicting) drive species interactions, which should lead to better understanding of the effects of coevolution on species adaptation. Conducting these experiments across environmental gradients will test our predictions of the effects of environmental change and coevolution on ecological communities.","[Northfield, Tobin D.; Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Northfield, TD (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Ctr Trop Biodivers & Climate Change, Cairns, Qld, Australia.",tobin.northfield@jcu.edu.au,"Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X",USDA Postdoctoral fellowship [WISW-2010-05109],"TDN was supported by a USDA Postdoctoral fellowship (#WISW-2010-05109).

Such interspecies interactions are often mediated by secreted soluble factors and/or direct cell-cell contact. As ubiquitous soil bacteria, Myxococcus species are able to produce a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites to inhibit the growth of other competing bacterial species. Meanwhile, Myxococcus spp. also exhibit sophisticated predatory behavior, an extreme form of competition that is often stimulated by close contact with prey cells and largely depends on the availability of solid surfaces. Myxococcus spp. can also be isolated from aquatic environments. However, studies focusing on the interaction between Myxococcus and other bacteria in such environments are still limited. In this study, using the well-studied Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 and Escherichia coli as model interspecies interaction pair, we demonstrated that in an aqueous environment, M. xanthus was able to kill E. coli in a cell contact-dependent manner and that the observed contact-dependent killing required the formation of co-aggregates between M. xanthus and E. coli cells. Further analysis revealed that exopolysaccharide (EPS), type IV pilus, and lipopolysaccharide mutants of M. xanthus displayed various degrees of attenuation in E. coli killing, and it correlated well with the mutants' reduction in EPS production. In addition, M. xanthus showed differential binding ability to different bacteria, and bacterial strains unable to co-aggregate with M. xanthus can escape the killing, suggesting the specific nature of co-aggregation and the targeted killing of interacting bacteria. In conclusion, our results demonstrated EPS-mediated, contact-dependent killing of E. coli by M. xanthus, a strategy that might facilitate the survival of this ubiquitous bacterium in aquatic environments.","[Pan, Hongwei; He, Xuesong; Lux, Renate; Shi, Wenyuan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Dent, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Luan, Jia; Shi, Wenyuan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Shi, WY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Dent, 10833 Le Conte Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",wenyuan@ucla.edu,,,NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM54666]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM054666] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank Aida Kaplan, Tingxi Wu, Emil Simanian, and Shuai Le for their help in preparing the bacterial strains and the National BioResource Project (NIG, Japan) for providing E. coli mutant libraries.

Current theories of forest dynamics range between the so-called neutral theories which assume functional equivalence among coexisting species to forest simulators that explain species assemblages as the result of tradeoffs in species individual strategies at several ontogenetic stages. Progress in these questions has been hindered by the inherent difficulties of developing analytical size-structured models of stand dynamics. This precludes examination of the relative importance of each mechanism on tree coexistence. In previous simulation and analytical studies emphasis has been given to interspecific differences at the sapling stage, and less so to interspecific variation in seedling recruitment. In this study we develop a partial differential equation model of stand dynamics in which competition takes place at the recruitment stage. Species differ in their size-dependent growth rates and constant mortality rates. Recruitment is described as proportional to the basal area of conspecifics, to account for fecundity and seed supply per unit of basal area, and is corrected with a decreasing function of species specific basal area to account for competition. We first analyze conditions for population persistence in monospecific stands and second we investigate conditions of coexistence for two species. In the monospecific case we found a stationary stand structure based on an inequality between mortality rate and seed supply. In turn, intra-specific competition does not play any role on the asymptotic extinction or population persistence. In the two-species case we found that coexistence can be attained when the reciprocal negative effect on recruitment follows a given relation with respect to intraspecific competition. Specifically a tradeoff between recruitment potential (i.e. shade tolerance or predation avoidance) and fecundity or growth rate. This is to our knowledge the first study that describes coexistence mechanisms in an analytical size-structured model in terms of competitive differences at the regeneration state.

Simulation models of pollination networks suggest that plant communities will be resilient to losing many or even most of the pollinator species in an ecosystem. These predictions, however, have not been tested empirically and implicitly assume that pollination efficacy is unaffected by interactions with interspecific competitors. By contrast, ecological theory and data from a wide range of ecosystems show that interspecific competition can drive variation in ecological specialization over short timescales via behavioral or morphological plasticity, although the potential implications of such changes in specialization for ecosystem functioning remain unexplored. We conducted manipulative field experiments in which we temporarily removed single pollinator species from study plots in subalpine meadows, to test the hypothesis that interactions between pollinator species can shape individual species' functional roles via changes in foraging specialization. We show that loss of a single pollinator species reduces floral fidelity (short-term specialization) in the remaining pollinators, with significant implications for ecosystem functioning in terms of reduced plant reproduction, even when potentially effective pollinators remained in the system. Our results suggest that ongoing pollinator declines may have more serious negative implications for plant communities than is currently assumed. More broadly, we show that the individual functional contributions of species can be dynamic and shaped by the community of interspecific competitors, thereby documenting a distinct mechanism for how biodiversity can drive ecosystem functioning, with potential relevance to a wide range of taxa and systems.","[Brosi, Berry J.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Brosi, Berry J.; Briggs, Heather M.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Briggs, Heather M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Brosi, BJ (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",bbrosi@emory.edu,,"Brosi, Berry/0000-0002-9233-1151","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1120572, DBI-1034780, OIA-0963529, DBI-0753774]; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; Emory University; University of California, Santa CruzUniversity of California System; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1120572] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank N.

However, few studies help predict the impact on the population dynamics. To simulate the performance of introgressed insect-resistant plants of wild Brassica juncea, independently from the interspecific hybridization cost, healthy plants were cultivated in pure and mixed stands with damaged plants through cutting leaves in field experiments over two field seasons. As expected, resistant (healthy) plants held a competitive advantage when in competition with susceptible (damaged) plants. Individual biomass and seed production of both types of plants decreased as the percentage of resistant plants increased, so that the relative advantage of resistant plants increased. The combined effects of defoliation and competition on the individual performance of B. juncea were additive. Replacement series experiments confirmed this trend but did not show different seed output in pure stand of susceptible versus resistant plots. The total vegetative and reproductive production of mixed populations was not significantly different of that of pure populations. These results suggest that if a transgene for insect-resistance were to colonize wild populations, high herbivory of susceptible plant and low resource availability would facilitate the spread of resistant individuals. However, at the population level, the shift from an insect-susceptible to a predominantly resistant population would not result in exacerbated habitat colonization.","[Liu, Yongbo] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yongbo; Darmency, Henri] Inst Natl Rech Agron, INRA, UMR1347, F-21065 Dijon, France; [Wei, Wei; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Darmency, H (corresponding author), Inst Natl Rech Agron, INRA, UMR1347, 17 Rue Sully,BP 86510, F-21065 Dijon, France.",henri.darmency@dijon.inra.fr,", Weiwei/B-2681-2008; Liu, Yongbo/H-3984-2015",", Weiwei/0000-0002-1815-9314; Liu, Yongbo/0000-0003-1618-8813",CNOUS [20072315]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970432],"This work was supported by a PhD joint fellowship between France and China (CNOUS, No. 20072315) and a fund from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC grant No. 30970432).",,35,17,17,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0962-8819,,,TRANSGENIC RES,Transgenic Res.,AUG,2013,22,4,,,,,747,756,,10.1007/s11248-012-9679-y,,,10,Biochemical Research Methods; Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,184UO,WOS:000321919200007,23250587,,,,2021-09-21,

Assessing potential interactions between invasive and native species is thus important to understand community functioning and prioritize conservation efforts. With this purpose, we compared the ecological niche and occurrence of a successful avian invader in SW Europe, the common waxbill (Estrildidae: Estrilda astrild), with those of co-occurring native passerine species. We found that common waxbills occupy a marginal niche relative to the community of native passerines, with a larger average ecological distance to the remaining species in the community compared to the native species amongst themselves, and a nearest-neighbour ecological distance identical to those of native species. Furthermore, ecological similarity did not predict co-occurrence of waxbills with other bird species. This is consistent with the invasion using a vacant niche in unsaturated communities, which is likely related to invading waxbills occupying partly human-modified habitats. Similar explanations may apply to other biological invasions of human-modified environments. Results also suggest that detrimental ecological effects due to interspecific competition with native passerines are unlikely. Notwithstanding, the ecological nearest-neighbour of common waxbills was the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), whose SW European subspecies are endangered, and may justify conservation attention regarding possible interactions between these two species.

Barrier permeability varies among species and can potentially impact the competitive balance within animal communities by differentially affecting co-occurring species. The influence of barriers on the spatial distribution of species within whole communities has nonetheless received little attention. During a 4-year period, we studied the influence of a fence and rivers, two landscape features that potentially act as barriers on space use and ranging behaviour of lions Panthera leo, spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta, African wild dogs Lycaon pictus and cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus in Northern Botswana. We compared the tendencies of these species to cross the barriers using data generated from GPS-radio collars fitted to a total of 35 individuals. Barrier permeability was inferred by calculating the number of times animals crossed a barrier vs. the number of times they did not cross. Finally, based on our results, we produced a map of connectivity for the broader landscape system. Permeability varied significantly between fence and rivers and among species. The fence represented an obstacle for lions (permeability=7 center dot 2%), while it was considerably more permeable for hyenas (35 center dot 6%) and wild dogs and cheetahs (50%). In contrast, the rivers and associated floodplains were relatively permeable to lions (14 center dot 4%) while they represented a nearly impassable obstacle for the other species (<2%). The aversion of lions to cross the fence resulted in a relatively lion-free habitat patch on one side of the fence, which might provide a potential refuge for other species. For instance, the competitively inferior wild dogs used this refuge significantly more intensively than the side of the fence with a high presence of lions. We showed that the influence of a barrier on the distribution of animals could potentially result in a broad-scale modification of community structure and ecology within a guild of co-occurring species. As habitat fragmentation increases, understanding the impact of barriers on species distributions is thus essential for the implementation of landscape-scale management strategies, the development and maintenance of corridors and the enhancement of connectivity.","[Cozzi, Gabriele; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Cozzi, Gabriele; Broekhuis, Femke; McNutt, J.

AimsTo investigate whether food limitation of House Sparrow population size during the winter varied spatially in relation to agricultural landscape intensification and farm management. MethodsWe experimentally increased the winter food supply for populations on farmsteads in replicated landscapes that differed in agricultural intensification (open plains versus mixed farming) and/or farm management (crop farming versus animal husbandry), and estimated possible differences in effects on winter population change. ResultsWe found no effect of supplementary winter feeding on changes in House Sparrow population sizes over the winter, irrespective of agricultural landscape type or presence of animal husbandry at the farm. However, we found a significantly larger winter population decline in mixed farmland and when farms contained animal husbandry. ConclusionsThe results suggest that House Sparrow populations in south Swedish farmland are not primarily limited by winter food availability. Alternatively, supplemental winter feeding may augment interspecific competition or attracts predators, offsetting any positive effect on population change. However, the stronger population decline in landscapes in which more breeding resources may be available (animal husbandry farms, mixed farmland), suggests stronger intraspecific competition during the winter in line with the resource separation hypothesis.","[Von Post, Maria; Stjernman, Martin; Smith, Henrik G.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Sect, Lund, Sweden; [Smith, Henrik G.] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden","Von Post, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Sect, Lund, Sweden.",maria_von.post@biol.lu.se,,,"Stiftelsen Oscar och Lilli Lamms minne; FORMAS (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning)Swedish Research Council Formas; Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet; SYSAV Natur- och Viltvard","We would like to thank all the farmers that were involved in this study and that helped out filling up the stations.

Eleven species of squaliforme shark are commonly caught at depths of 200-1200 m on Chatham Rise, New Zealand, and their diversity suggests they might occupy different niches. The diets of 133 Deania calcea and 295 Squalus acanthias were determined from examination of stomach contents. The diet of D. calcea was characterised by mesopelagic fishes, and S. acanthias by benthic to pelagic fishes, but was more adaptive and included likely scavenging. Multivariate analyses found the most important predictors of diet variability in S. acanthias were year, bottom temperature, longitude, and fish weight. The diet of the nine other commonly caught squaliforme sharks was reviewed, and the spatial and depth distribution of all species on Chatham Rise described from research bottom trawl survey catches. The eleven species had a variety of different diets, and depth and location preferences, consistent with niche separation to reduce interspecific competition. Four trophic groups were identified, characterised by: mesopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroselachus crepidater, D. calcea, and Etmopterus lucifer); mesopelagic and benthopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroscymnus owstoni, Etmopterus baxteri); demersal and benthic fishes (Centrophorus squamosus, Dalatias licha, Proscymnodon plunketi); and a generalist diet of fishes and invertebrates (S. acanthias). The trophic levels of the species in each of the four groups were estimated as 4.18-4.24, 4.20-4.23, 4.24-4.48, and 3.84 respectively. The diet of Oxynotus bruniensis and Squalus griffini are unknown. The different niches occupied by different species are likely to influence their vulnerability to bottom trawl fisheries.

By contrast, how variation in prey biological traits may affect niche width and partitioning is still a poorly explored topic. One of these candidate traits is prey mobility, which can affect the predators' niche because acting on the rate of encounter and, assuming mobility as a proxy for escape capability, on the success of predator attacks. Here we analysed 20 wasp populations and their prey as individual-based food-webs to test if prey mobility may explain niche width (here defined by the Shannon entropy-based index ) and patterns of inter-individual diet variation (here defined by the interaction-exclusiveness index H2 and the interaction evenness index E2). Niche width was very variable among populations and overall network specialization (H2) was always higher than the expected by null models. In case of high-speed flying prey (e.g. flies, bees), wasps showed wider niches () and lower specialization (H2) than in case of non-flying or slow-flying prey (e.g. spiders, beetles).

(1) Do trait responses to land-use intensification alter trait-based species rankings, and (2) does land-use intensification alter relationships among interrelated leaf traits? Location Solling Mountains, Central Germany (Grassland management experiment, GrassMan). Methods Over the course of 2 yr with differing weather conditions, we analysed the specific leaf area (SLA) of eight grassland species and related it to leaf nitrogen per mass (Nmass) or area (Narea) in an old-growth grassland with two fertilization levels (none vs NPK fertilization, 180-30-100 kg center dot ha-1 center dot yr-1) and two cutting frequencies (one vs three cuts per season). Results NPK fertilization led to an expected increase in SLA, Nmass and Narea, while the effect of altered cutting frequency on leaf traits was more species-specific. Species-specific responses to management significantly altered trait-based species rankings. A significant SLANmass relationship occurred in unfertilized plots, whereas the SLANarea relationship was stronger in fertilized plots. This was mostly caused by a decrease in the among-species variation in Nmass upon fertilization. Conclusions Although our results reflect only short-term community responses, they indicate that trait-based species ranking and the relationships between plant functional traits are not always consistent across different management regimes. Hence, trait values used to characterize species and communities should never be discussed without consideration of the set of environmental conditions under which they were measured.","[Rose, Laura] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Rubarth, Marie C.; Hertel, Dietrich; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Rose, L (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",l.rose@em.uni-frankfurt.de; marie.rubarth@gmail.com; dhertel@uni-goettingen.de; cleusch@uni-goettingen.de,,"Rose, Laura/0000-0003-4523-4145",Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony; Niedersachsisches Vorab,"We thank Uta Nusse-Hahne and Ute Schlonsog for help with N analyses and the staff of the experimental farm Relliehausen for help with the site management.

Although multiple mechanisms of competitive displacement have been hypothesized, recent evidence of cross-insemination between these species in nature and the sterilizing effects of male accessory gland products asymmetrically favoring A. albopictus in interspecific matings support a role for satyrization (a form of reproductive interference) to explain the rapid displacements. Because of the drastic reproductive loss of A. aegypti females satyrized by A. albopictus males, we predicted selection for prezygotic isolation in populations of A. aegypti sympatric with A. albopictus. Exposures in cages demonstrated that female A. aegypti from populations in Florida sympatric with A. albopictus for the past 20 y were significantly less likely than nearby allopatric populations to mate with heterospecific males. Cross-inseminations of A. albopictus females by A. aegypti males were significantly less common, supporting the one-way direction of displacements observed in nature. Our results indicate rapid sexual selection leading to reproductive character displacement and the potential for satyr-resistant A. aegypti to recover from competitive displacements. These results have implications for increased risks of dengue transmission where these vector species meet worldwide.","[Bargielowski, Irka E.; Lounibos, L.

Most of our understanding of primate community ecology derives from the assumption that these animals interact predominantly with other primates. In this study, we investigate to what extent multiple community assembly hypotheses consistent with this assumption are supported when tested with communities of primates in isolation versus with communities of primates, birds, bats, and squirrels together. We focus on vertebrate communities on the island of Borneo, where we examine the determinants of presence or absence of species, and how these communities are structured. We test for checkerboard distributions, guild proportionality, and Fox's assembly rule for favored states, and predict that statistical signals reflecting interactions between ecologically similar species will be stronger when nonprimate taxa are included in analyses. We found strong support for checkerboard distributions in several communities, particularly when taxonomic groups were combined, and after controlling for habitat effects. We found evidence of guild proportionality in some communities, but did not find significant support for Fox's assembly rule in any of the communities examined. These results demonstrate the presence of vertebrate community structure that is ecologically determined rather than randomly generated, which is a finding consistent with the interpretation that interactions within and between these taxonomic groups may have shaped species composition in these communities. This research highlights the importance of considering the broader vertebrate communities with which primates co-occur, and so we urge primatologists to explicitly consider nonprimate taxa in the study of primate ecology.

However, niche theory predicts that sharing resources, predators, and other interspecific interactions can limit the environmental conditions under which a species may exist. How does the spatial distribution of one species affect that of another within shared landscapes? We tested whether sympatric marten Martes americana and fishers M. pennanti in a mountain landscape in Alberta, Canada exhibit local-scale spatial segregation, beyond differential habitat selection. We modelled marten and fisher distribution in relation to remotely-sensed habitat data and species co-occurrence, using generalized linear models and information-theoretic model selection. Marten and fishers selected different habitat types and showed different responses to habitat fragmentation. Even after accounting for these differences, the absence of one species significantly explained the occurrence of the other. We conclude that the spatial distribution of marten and fishers influences habitat selection by each other at landscape scales, and hypothesize that this pattern may result from competition in a spatially heterogeneous environment. Species-habitat models that consider only resources may fail to capture key predictors of species' occurrence. Reliable prediction and inference requires that ecologists expand from landscapes to also include species-scapes: a spatial plane of species interactions that combines with resources to drive species' distributions.","[Fisher, Jason T.; Anholt, Brad] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada; [Anholt, Brad] Bamfield Marine Sci Ctr, Bamfield, BC V0R 1B0, Canada; [Bradbury, Steve] Govt Alberta, Fish & Wildlife Div, Edson, AB ABT7E 1T2, Canada; [Wheatley, Matthew] Govt Alberta, Prov Pk Div, Hinton, AB T7V 2E6, Canada; [Volpe, John P.] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada","Fisher, JT (corresponding author), Alberta Innovates Technol Futures, Ecosyst Management Unit, 3-4476 Markham St, Victoria, BC V8Z 7X8, Canada.",jason.fisher@albertainnovates.ca,"Volpe, John P/G-5667-2010","Fisher, Jason/0000-0002-9020-6509","Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures (AITF); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; MITACS; Univ. of Victoria; AITF; Alberta Conservation Association; Alberta Tourism, Parks, and Recreation (ATPR, Parks Division); Alberta Sustainable Resource Development; Foundation for North American Wild Sheep","Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures (AITF), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, MITACS, and Univ. of Victoria provided funding to JTF.

An ethogram of oviposition behavior was constructed based on observations made in an oviposition cage. Ovipositional behavioral acts were catalogued and separated into two behavioral repertoires: searching and egg laying. Gravid females of S. epius oviposited similar numbers of eggs on three mealybug species. Females preferred eggs and adults to nymphs of mealybugs for oviposition. Among three species of mealybugs attended by ants, females laid fewer eggs in the mealybug mass attended by Oecophylla smaragdina than on mealybugs attended by Tapinoma melanocephalum and Camponotus variegatus. Females preferred mealybug masses already containing conspecific eggs to mealybug masses containing conspecific larvae or Cryptolaemus montrouzieri larvae for egg deposition. Gravid females laid larger numbers of eggs under bright sunlight than in diffused sunlight or shade. The results of this study showed that S. epius can effectively attack any species of mealybugs, avoid intra- and interspecific competition, and co-exist with some species of ants attending mealybugs. With the knowledge of these behaviors, this predator can be effectively utilized as a major biological control agent of mealybugs.","[Dinesh, Anegunda Shankar; Venkatesha, Melally Giddegowda] Bangalore Univ, Dept Zool, Insect Sci Lab, Bengaluru 560056, Karnataka, India","Venkatesha, MG (corresponding author), Bangalore Univ, Dept Zool, Insect Sci Lab, Bengaluru 560056, Karnataka, India.",venkatmelally@gmail.com,"Venkatesha, Melally G./B-3804-2010",,"University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi, IndiaUniversity Grants Commission, India [33-344/2007 (SR)]; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New DelhiCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India","The second author acknowledges the financial assistance [F.

Different indices, both chemical and biological, may be used to assess a level and a rate of the eutrophication process. Zooplankton indices can be among them, as zooplankton community structure is determined primarily by the physical and chemical environment and modified by biological interactions, i.e. predation and interspecific competition for food resources. Among biological indices of trophic state of lake, those based on densities and structure of crustacean communities seem to respond weaker. There are, however, patterns of crustacean communities connected with trophic state of lakes. Thus, an increase in trophic state causes: (1) an increase in the total numbers of crustaceans; (2) an increase in the total biomass of Cydopoida; (3) an increase in the contribution of the biomass of Cydopidae to the total crustacean biomass; (4) an increase in the ratio of the biomass of Cydopoida to the biomass of Cladocera; (5) a decrease in the average body weight of Crustacea; (6) an increase in the ratio of Cladocera to Calanoida numbers; (7) an increase in the ratio of Cydopoida to Calanoida numbers; (8) an increase in the dominance of species indicative of high trophy (Mesocyclops leuckartii, Thermocyclops oithonoides, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Chydorus sphaericus, Bosmina (Eubosmina) coregoni thersites) in the numbers of all indicative species. Crustacean zooplankton was sampled at the deepest place in a lake at 1 m intervals from the surface to the bottom of epilimnion layer, and then samples were pooled together for the layer. Samples were taken once a year, during the summer stagnation. The material was collected from a total of 41 dimictic and 33 polymictic lakes within Masurian Lake District, Ilawa Lake District and Lubawa Upland. Among above-mentioned indices, six were the best correlated with trophic state of lakes. Below are formulas which enable to assess trophic state of lakes regardless of their mixis type (TSICR) from parameters of abundance and structure of crustacean communities: (1) TSICR1 = 25.5 N-0.142 (R-2 = 0.32), where TSI = trophic state index; N = numbers (id. I-1); (2) TSICR2 = 57.6 Busi (R-2 = 0.37), where B = biomass (mg w.wt. I-1); (3) TSICR3 = 40.9 CB0.097 (R-2 = 0.35), where CB = percentage of biomass of Cyclopoida in the total biomass of Crustacea (%); (4) TSICR4 = 58.3 (CY/CL)(0.071) (R-2 = 0.30), where CY/CL = ratio of the Cydopoida biomass to the biomass of Cladocera (%); (5) TSICR5, = 5.08 Ln (CY/CA) + 46.6 (R-2 = 0.37), where CY/CA = ratio of Cydopoida numbers to the numbers of Calanoida; (the relationship covering exclusively dimictic lakes); (6) TSICR6 = 43.8 e(0.004 (IHT)) (R-2 = 0.30), where IHT = percentage of species indicative of high trophy in the indicative group's numbers. It was assumed that the lakes with a TSICR under 45 are mesotrophic, those with a TSICR value of 45-55 are meso-eutrophic, those with a TSICR value of 55-65 - eutrophic and those with a TSICR above 65- hypertrophic. Although crustacean indices of trophic state of lakes seem to be less useful than other biological indices, they may be recommended in assessing the quality of lake waters.","[Ejsmont-Karabin, Jolanta] Univ Bialystok, Inst Biol, PL-15950 Bialystok, Poland","Ejsmont-Karabin, J (corresponding author), Univ Bialystok, Inst Biol, Swierkowa 20B, PL-15950 Bialystok, Poland.",jolanta@onet.pl,,,,,,41,44,44,0,31,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

In this study, we examined whether temperature parameters could predict the timing of recruitment, the duration of recruitment and total recruitment in 18 benthic epifaunal species using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and ordinary least squares regression. Additionally, we used a null model to test whether temperature parameters and inter-annual variation in those parameters affect the temporal niche overlap of these benthic species. We specifically examined the recruitment patterns of non-native species to help illustrate how shifts in phenology may help drive changes in the community composition. Results from the PLSR helped determine the most instructive regressors for univariate least-squares models. For many (14 of 18) of the species examined, recruitment patterns could be predicted by seasonal growing degree days. Additionally, communities at cooler sites exhibited greater temporal niche overlap than assemblages found at warmer sites. Finally, we observed a unique pattern among invasive species, with more recent invaders recruiting later in the season, which may be a result of shifts in niche overlap. The findings of this study illustrate potential mechanisms for species coexistence and increased rates of invasion resulting from climate change.","[Reinhardt, James F.] NOAA Restorat Ctr, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Whitlatch, Robert B.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Osman, Richard W.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Reinhardt, JF (corresponding author), NOAA Restorat Ctr, 1315 East West Hwy, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",jamesfreinhardt@hotmail.com,"Reinhardt, james/AAD-8406-2019","Reinhardt, james/0000-0003-4707-4026",U.S. EPA STARUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Long Island Sound Study,"This research was partially supported by U.S. EPA STAR and NSF grants awarded to R.B.W. and R.W.O.

Global climate change is predicted to affect coastal habitats and may, therefore, have important consequences for the terrestrial breeding habitat of seabirds and hence seabird populations. The present study assessed use of breeding habitat in the four most abundant species of seabird breeding in south-eastern Australia using a generalised additive mixed-modelling approach. Habitat characteristics were measured on 13 islands in winter and summer, 2008-11. Burrows of the four species were associated with one or more habitat parameters, potentially explained by predator avoidance, physical requirements and possibly by interspecific competition. Whereas the habitat characteristics used by each species showed broad interspecific overlap, there was strong divergence, and the four species typically occupied different nesting sites within breeding areas. Information on the proportion of available habitat used and the influence of breeding habitat on reproductive success would enhance current understanding of what constitutes optimal breeding habitat as well as the role of interspecific competition in this assemblage of seabirds.","[Schumann, Nicole; Arnould, John P.

Internationally, glyphosate-based herbicides are the most widely used herbicides in both of these sectors. Laboratory and mesocosm studies have demonstrated that some formulations are toxic to amphibian larvae below concentrations that approximate predicted maximal or worst-case exposure scenarios. However, field studies have not found evidence of toxicity at these concentrations. The authors conducted a replicated field experiment involving 10 naturalized wetlands split in half with an impermeable plastic barrier to assess the direct toxicity of a glyphosate formulation commonly used in silviculture (VisionMAX (TM)). The herbicide formulation was applied directly to the surface of one side of each wetland at one of two target aqueous exposure rates (high?=?2,880, low?=?550?mu g acid equivalents [a.e.]/L), and the other side was left as an untreated control. The survival and growth of green frog larvae (Lithobates clamitans) were assessed for two years following herbicide treatment. The herbicide did not have a negative impact on survival or growth of L. clamitans larvae at either treatment level. In fact, mean larval abundance was typically greater in the treated sides than in control sides within the year of herbicide application. These results indicate that typical silviculture use of VisionMAX poses negligible risk to larval amphibians, likely because the combined effects of sorption and degradation in natural wetlands limit the exposure magnitude and duration.

In such cases, direct competition can influence invasion success of both species, and provide insights into competition without co-evolution in species equally novel to the environment. We used two widespread crayfish invaders of freshwater ecosystems of Europe, signal crayfish (pacifastacus leniusculus) and spiny cheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus), to investigate how behavioural decisions in agonistic encounters contribute to competitive advantages in the absence of adaptation to either opponents or an environment. In direct competition against novel but comparable opponents, the key factor for establishing clear dominance of P. leniusculus in interspecific bouts was its greater tendency towards continued engagement in high-intensity fights. With O. limosus individuals consistently retreating from staged bouts as fights became more intense, P. leniusculus individuals did not need to adapt their strategy to be successful, suggesting that their agonistic behaviour intrinsically predisposed them to win. While both species are detrimental to invaded ecosystems, our results indicate that aggressive behaviour of P. leniusculus against unfamiliar opponents could allow it to more easily outcompete other comparable species and consequently present a potentially greater threat for native ecosystems.

Cross-sectional patterns of ecosystem properties with respect to climatic gradients are often used to predict ecosystem responses to global change. Across sites in the tropics, primary productivity increases with temperature, suggesting that forest ecosystems will become more productive as temperature rises. However, this trend is confounded with a shift in species composition and so may not reflect the response of in situ forests to warming. In this study, we simultaneously studied tree diameter growth across the altitudinal ranges of species within a single genus across a geographically compact temperature gradient, to separate the direct effect of temperature on tree growth from that of species compositional turnover. Using a Bayesian state space modeling framework we combined data from repeated diameter censuses and dendrometer measurements from across a 1700-m altitudinal gradient collected over six years on over 2400 trees in Weinmannia, a dominant and widespread genus of cloud forest trees in the Andes. Within species, growth showed no consistent trend with altitude, but higher-elevation species had lower growth rates than lower-elevation species, suggesting that species turnover is largely responsible for the positive correlation between productivity and temperature in tropical forests. Our results may indicate a significant difference in how low-and high-latitude forests will respond to climate change, since temperate and boreal tree species are consistently observed to have a positive relationship between growth and temperature. If our results hold for other tropical species, a positive response in ecosystem productivity to increasing temperatures in the Andes will depend on the altitudinal migration of tree species. The rapid pace of climate change, and slow observed rates of migration, suggest a slow, or even initially negative response of ecosystem productivity to warming. Finally, this study shows how the observed scale of biological organization can affect conclusions drawn from studies of ecological phenomena across environmental gradients, and calls into question the common practice in tropical ecology of lumping species at higher taxonomic levels.","[Rapp, Joshua M.; Silman, Miles R.] Harvard Univ, Petersham, MA 01366 USA; [Clark, James S.] Duke Univ, Sch Environm, Dept Biol & Nicholas, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Girardin, Cecile A.

The objective of this study was to quantify regional-scale variation in vital rates of giant ragweed and common sunflower. To accomplish this objective, a common field experiment was conducted across seven sites between 2006 and 2008 throughout the north central U.S. maize belt. Demographic parameters of both weed species were measured in intra- and interspecific competitive environments, and environmental data were collected within site-years. Site was the strongest predictor of belowground vital rates (summer and winter seed survival and seedling recruitment), indicating sensitivity to local abiotic conditions. However, biotic factors influenced aboveground vital rates (seedling survival and fecundity). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) indicated that demography of both species was most strongly influenced by thermal time and precipitation. The first PLSR components, both characterized by thermal time, explained 63.2% and 77.0% of variation in the demography of giant ragweed and common sunflower, respectively; the second PLSR components, both characterized by precipitation, explained 18.3% and 8.5% of variation, respectively. The influence of temperature and precipitation is important in understanding the population dynamics and potential distribution of these species in response to climate change.","[Wortman, Sam E.; Lindquist, John L.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Davis, Adam S.; Schutte, Brian J.] ARS, USDA, Global Change & Photosynth Res Unit, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Cardina, John; Felix, Joel] Ohio State Univ, OARDC Wooster, Wooster, OH 44691 USA; [Sprague, Christy L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dille, J.

Between the guild of ants that are attracted to these seeds, only a few of them will act as effective dispersers, that is, transporting the seeds to suitable sites (the nests) for germination and plant establishment. Ant communities are known to be highly hierarchical, and subordinate ants quickly deliver resources to their nest rather than consuming it on-site, thereby avoiding encounters with more dominant species. As a result of a series of studies that were carried out during summer in semi-arid Northwest Argentina, we have found that the most important seed disperser of the myrmecochorous plant Jatropha excisa Griseb. (Euphorbiaceae), the ant Pogonomyrmex cunicularius pencosensis Forel, was the most subordinate species during interspecific interactions. The daily timing of release of the J. excisa seeds through ballistic dispersal increased their probability of being removed by the highly thermophilic P. cunicularius pencosensis. Foraging during the warmest hours of the day allowed P. cunicularius pencosensis ants to avoid the risk of interference competition with dominant species, which also behaved as elaiosome predators. As a conclusion, subordinance behaviour appears to be integral to successful myrmecochory, and also the timing of seed release plays a key role in shaping the dynamics of myrmecochorous interactions. Therefore, ant-dispersed plants should not only favour their discovery by subordinate ants, but also should present their seeds at those times of the day when the behaviourally dominant ants are less active.","[Aranda-Rickert, Adriana; Fracchia, Sebastian] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina","Aranda-Rickert, A (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina.",ardrickert@yahoo.com.ar,,,Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas,"This study is part of the Ph.D. dissertation of A.A.R. at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, which was financially supported by a Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas Grant.

Often there are no environmental barriers in the contact zones, hence competitive interaction is usually advocated as the factor that modulates species distribution ranges. Even though the effects of climate change on species distribution have been widely studied, few studies have explored these effects on the biogeographical relationships between closely related, parapatric, species. We modelled environmental favourability for three parapatric hare species in Europe Lepus granatensis, L. europaeus and L. timidus using ecogeographical variables and projected the models into the future according to the IPCC A2 emissions scenario. Favourabilities for present and future scenarios were combined using fuzzy logic with the following aims: (i) to determine the biogeographical relationships between hare species in parapatry, that is L. granatensis/L. europaeus and L. europaeus/L. timidus and (ii) to assess the effects of climate change on each species as well as on their interspecific interactions. In their contact area L. granatensis achieved higher favourability values than L. europaeus, suggesting that if both species have a similar population status, the former species may have some advantages over the latter if competitive relationships are established. Climate change had the most striking effect on the distribution of L. timidus, especially when interspecific interactions with L. europaeus were taken into account, which may compromise the co-existence of L. timidus. The results of this study are relevant not only for understanding the distribution patterns of the hares studied and the effects of climate change on these patterns, but also for improving the general application of species distribution models to the prediction of the effects of climate change on biodiversity.","[Acevedo, Pelayo; Jimenez-Valverde, Alberto; Real, Raimundo] Univ Malaga, Biogeog Div & Conservat Res Team, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Acevedo, Pelayo; Melo-Ferreira, Jose; Alves, Paulo Celio] Univ Porto, CIBIO, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Acevedo, Pelayo] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Alves, Paulo Celio] Univ Porto, Dpto Biol, Fac Ciencias, P-4169007 Oporto, Portugal; [Alves, Paulo Celio] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Acevedo, P (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Biogeog Div & Conservat Res Team, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",pacevedo@uma.es,"Jimenez-Valverde, Alberto/L-2755-2014; Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010; Alves, Paulo C/B-5448-2009; Acevedo, Pelayo/L-6737-2013; Melo-Ferreira, Jose/E-9784-2010","Jimenez-Valverde, Alberto/0000-0001-9962-2106; Real, Raimundo/0000-0002-6642-1284; Alves, Paulo C/0000-0003-4797-0939; Acevedo, Pelayo/0000-0002-3509-7696; Melo-Ferreira, Jose/0000-0003-4473-1908","Juan de la CiervaInstituto de Salud Carlos III; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion-Fondo Social EuropeoEuropean Social Fund (ESF)Spanish Government; Spanish GovernmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2009-11316/BOS]; FEDEREuropean Commission; Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PTDC/BIA-EVF/111931/2009, PTDC/BIA-EVF/115069/2009]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF) [SFRH/BPD/43264/2008]","We thank the Societas Europaea Mammalogica and Tony Mitchell-Jones for providing the distribution data used to prepare the Atlas of European mammals.

Here, we contrast these two measures in two species of sunflower, Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris. We quantified the total reproductive barrier strength between these species by compounding the contributions of the following prezygotic and postzygotic barriers: ecogeographic isolation, reproductive asynchrony, niche differentiation, pollen competition, hybrid seed formation, hybrid seed germination, hybrid fertility, and extrinsic postzygotic isolation. From this estimate, we calculated the probability that a reproductively successful hybrid is produced: estimates of Phyb range from 10-4 to 10-6 depending on the direction of the cross and the degree of independence among reproductive barriers. We then compared this probability with population genetic estimates of the per generation migration rate (m). We showed that the relatively high levels of gene flow estimated between these sunflower species (Nem= 0.340.76) are mainly due to their large effective population sizes (Ne > 106). The interspecific migration rate (m) is very small (<10-7) and an order of magnitude lower than that expected based on our reproductive barrier strength estimates. Thus, even high levels of reproductive isolation (>0.999) may produce genomic mosaics.","[Sambatti, Julianno B.

We identify 7 long-term studies of population changes in Myodes in North America. Using autoregressive and spectral analysis, we found that only 2 of the 7 show 3- to 5-year cycles like those found in some Eurasian populations. There was no relationship between latitude and cycling. The general lack of cyclicity is associated with two key aspects of their demography that act in tandem: first, poor overwinter survival in most years; second, chronically low densities, with irregular outbreak years. Eight factors might explain why some Myodes populations fluctuate in cycles and others fluctuate irregularly, and we review the evidence for each factor: food supplies, nutrients, predation, interspecific competition, disease, weather, spacing behavior and interactive effects. Of these eight, only food supplies appear to be sufficient to explain the differences between cyclic and non-cyclic populations. Irregular fluctuations are the result of pulsed food supplies in the form of berry crops (M. rutilus) or tree seeds (M. gapperi) linked to weather patterns. We argue that, to understand the cause for the patterns in the respective hemispheres, we must know the mechanism(s) driving population change and this must be linked to rigorous field tests. We suggest that a large-scale, year-round feeding experiment should improve overwintering survival, increase standing densities, and flip non-cyclic Myodes populations into cyclic dynamics that would mimic the patterns seen in the cyclic populations found in parts of Eurasia.","[Boonstra, Rudy] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Krebs, Charles J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Boonstra, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",boonstra@utsc.utoronto.ca; krebs@zoology.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We dedicate this paper to the memory of William (Bill) A.

Here we aimed at determining which tree-and stand-level attributes were more closely associated with the effect of a severe drought on the radial growth of Scots pine, both in terms of immediate impact and recovery after the drought event. Our dataset included tree-ring series from 393 plots located close to the dry limit of the species range. Time series analysis and mixed-effects models were used to study the growth of each tree and its detailed response to a severe drought event that occurred in 1986. Our results showed that the radial growth responses of Scots pine were determined primarily by tree-level characteristics, such as age and previous growth rate, and secondarily by stand basal area and species richness, whereas local climate had a relatively minor effect. Fast-growing trees were more severely affected by the drought and retained proportionally lower growth rates up to three years after the episode. In absolute terms, however, fast-growing trees performed better both during and after the event. Older trees were found to be less resilient to drought. The effect of stand basal area and species richness indicated that competition for resources worsened the effects of drought, and suggested that the effect of interspecific competition may be particularly detrimental during the drought year.","[Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Lopez, Bernat C.; Loepfe, Lasse; Lloret, Francisco] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF Unitat Ecol, Fac Ciencies, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland","Martinez-Vilalta, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF Unitat Ecol, Fac Ciencies, Edifici C, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",Jordi.Martinez.Vilalta@uab.es,"Camarero, J.

While facilitation in plant communities has been intensely studied, the role of facilitation in shaping animal communities is less well understood. In the Chihuahuan Desert, both kangaroo rats and harvester ants depend on the abundant seeds of annual plants. Kangaroo rats, however, are hypothesized to facilitate harvester ants through soil disturbance and selective seed predation rather than competing with them. I used a spatially explicit approach to examine whether a positive or negative interaction exists between banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) mounds and rough harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex rugosus) colonies. The presence of a scale-dependent interaction between mounds and colonies was tested by comparing fitted spatial point process models with and without interspecific effects. Also, the effect of proximity to a mound on colony mortality and spatial patterns of surviving colonies was examined. The spatial pattern of kangaroo rat mounds and harvester ant colonies was consistent with a positive interspecific interaction at small scales (<10 m). Mortality risk of vulnerable, recently founded harvester ant colonies was lower when located close to a kangaroo rat mound and proximity to a mound partly predicted the spatial pattern of surviving colonies. My findings support localized facilitation of harvester ants by kangaroo rats, likely mediated through ecosystem engineering and foraging effects on plant cover and composition. The scale-dependent effect of kangaroo rats on abiotic and biotic factors appears to result in greater founding and survivorship of young colonies near mounds. These results suggest that soil disturbance and foraging by rodents can have subtle impacts on the distribution and demography of other species.","[Edelman, Andrew J.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Edelman, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",aedelman@uwyo.edu,"Edelman, Andrew J/C-2810-2012",,"Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research Site Graduate Student Summer Grant; American Society of Mammalogists Shadle; Southwestern Association of Naturalists; T E, Inc.","This research was funded by the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research Site Graduate Student Summer Grant, American Society of Mammalogists Shadle Fellowship and Grant-in-Aid, Southwestern Association of Naturalists Howard McCarley Student Research Award, T & E, Inc.

Here, we combined wetland surveys of host community structure with mechanistic experiments involving a multi-host parasite to evaluate competing explanations for the dilution effect. Sampling of 320 wetlands in California indicated that snail host communities were strongly nested, with competent hosts for the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae predominating in low-richness assemblages and unsuitable hosts increasingly present in more diverse communities. Moreover, competent host density was negatively associated with increases in snail species richness. These patterns in host community assembly support a key prerequisite underlying the dilution effect. Results of multigenerational mesocosm experiments designed to mimic field-observed community assemblages allowed us to evaluate the relative importance of host density and diversity in influencing parasite infection success. Increases in snail species richness (from one to four species) had sharply negative effects on the density of infected hosts (similar to 90% reduction). However, this effect was indirect; competition associated with non-host species led to a 95% reduction in host density (susceptible host regulation), owing primarily to a reduction in host reproduction. Among susceptible hosts, there were no differences in infection prevalence as a function of community structure, indicating a lack of support for a direct effect of diversity on infection (encounter reduction). In monospecific conditions, higher initial host densities increased infection among adult hosts; however, compensatory reproduction in the low-density treatments equalized the final number of infected hosts by the next generation, underscoring the relevance of multigenerational studies in understanding the dilution effect. These findings highlight the role of interspecific competition in mediating the relationship between species richness and parasite infection and emphasize the importance of field-informed experimental research in understanding mechanisms underlying the diversity-disease relationship.","[Johnson, Pieter T.

We investigated nesting site use for both species in the main Alejandro Selkirk colony. We defined six habitat types and observed four density patterns in the colony: high and low density for each species. Burrow density of Stejneger's Petrels (smaller species) was high only in herbaceous perennial grassland habitat, with low densities in other habitat types possibly due to the presence of breeding Juan Fernandez Petrels and/or unfavorable soil conditions for burrow establishment. In the high density habitat of Stejneger's Petrels, individuals tended to be more closely associated with conspecific burrows than with Juan Fernandez Petrel burrows. This may be attributed to interspecific interference competition for breeding sites, with Juan Fernandez Petrels pushing the smaller species toward a specific habitat type. Our findings of restricted distribution of high density breeding habitat for Stejneger's Petrels may have important implications for conservation of this threatened species, especially given the impacts of introduced mammals, predation (rats, feral cats), and habitat alteration (feral goats) on Alejandro Selkirk Island.

In this study, we examined potential interactions between smallmouth bass (introduced) and walleye Sander vitreus (a native predator) in two Missouri River reservoirs and four natural lakes in South Dakota, USA, using historical standardized sampling data, which indexed four fitness-related factors (relative abundance, size structure, condition, and growth) of both species. Of the 24 total relationships tested among all water bodies, three (13%) were determined to be significant (size structure in Pickerel Lake: P = 0.06; condition in Lake Kampeska: P = 0.06, and growth at Brant Lake: P = 0.02). Of these three, two relationships were negative as would be expected if negative interactions exist between these two species (size structure in Pickerel Lake: r = -0.61; condition in Lake Kampeska: r = -0.61); the remaining relationship was positive (growth at Brant Lake: r = 0.75). Further, no water body consistently demonstrated significant negative interactions in all relationships tested. The results of our study did not support the concept that introduced smallmouth bass interfere with walleye populations in South Dakota waters. Rather, it is more likely that other environmental factors influence the observed variability in walleye demographics and dynamics observed in this study. At this time, we believe that both fisheries will continue to co-exist. However, continuous monitoring of both species is warranted as changing environmental conditions in the future could allow these interspecific relationships to shift toward the dominance of smallmouth bass over walleye.","[Wuellner, M.

Although the two species of woodpeckers studied have similar anatomy, physiology and ethology, they trophically coexisted in ANPPA segregated during their feeding process minimizing, in this way, interspecific competition.","[Ugalde-Lezama, Saul; Tarango-Arambula, Luis A.] Colegio Postgrad, Programa Ganaderia, Montecillo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Valdez-Hernandez, Juan I.] Colegio Postgrad, Programa Forestal, Montecillo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Ramirez-Valverde, Gustavo] Colegio Postgrad, Programa Estadist, Montecillo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Equihua-Martinez, Armando] Colegio Postgrad, Programa Entomol & Acarol, Montecillo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico","Tarango-Arambula, LA (corresponding author), Colegio Postgrad, Programa Ganaderia, Km 36-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco,Campus San Luis, Montecillo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",ltarango@colpos.mx,"Arambula, Luis Antonio Tarango/M-7323-2013; ramirez-valverde, gustavo/F-6130-2013; LEZAMA, SAUL UGALDE/ABH-4932-2020","Arambula, Luis Antonio Tarango/0000-0002-7662-1319; ramirez-valverde, gustavo/0000-0003-3466-991X; ",,,,116,1,1,0,9,UNIV AUTONOMA CHAPINGO,"CHAPINGO, EDO DE MEXICO","CUBICULO 113, CHAPINGO, EDO DE MEXICO, 56230, MEXICO",2007-3828,2007-4018,,REV CHAPINGO SER CIE,Rev.

Lotka-Volterra equations (LVEs) are known to be the most popular model, and they are mainly applied to the systems of predation and competition. However, LVEs often fail to catch the population dynamics of mutualism; the population sizes of species increase infinitely under certain condition (divergence problem). Furthermore, LVEs never predicts the Allee effect in the systems of obligate mutualism. Instead of LVEs, several models have been presented for mutualism; unfortunately, they are rather complicated. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce a simpler theory for mutualism. In the present paper, we apply the lattice gas model which corresponds to the mean-field theory of the usual lattice model. The derived equations are cubic and contain only essential features for mutualism. In the case of obligate mutualism, the dynamics exhibits the Allee effect, and it is almost the same as in the male-female systems. In our model, the population sizes never increase infinitely, because our model contains not only intra- but also interspecific competitions. If the density of one species increases disproportionately in respect of its mutual partners, then this might imply downward pressure on the population abundance of the mutual partner species and such feedback would eventually act as a controlling influence on the population abundance of either species. We discuss several assumptions in our model; in particular, if both species can occupy in each cell simultaneously, then the interspecific competition disappears. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we quantify temporal overlap between the Sumatran tiger and five of its presumed prey species from four study areas comprising disturbed lowland to primary submontane forest. Data from 126 camera traps over 8984 camera days were used to estimate species activity patterns and, in turn, their overlap through the coefficient D (ranging from 0 to 1, i.e. no overlap to complete overlap). A newly developed statistical technique was applied to determine confidence intervals associated with respective overlap, which is important, as such measures of precision are usually not estimated in these types of study. Strong temporal overlap was found between tiger and muntjac Muntiacus muntjac (Delta = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.71-0.84) and tiger and sambar Cervus unicolor (Delta = 0.81, 0.55-0.85), with the latter illustrating the importance of measuring precision. According to the foraging theory, Sumatran tigers should focus on expending lower levels of energy searching for and then capturing larger bodied prey that present the least risk. Hence, surprisingly, there was little overlap between the crepuscular tiger and the largest-bodied prey species available, the nocturnal tapir Tapirus indicus (0.52, 0.44-0.60), suggesting that it is not a principal prey species. This study provides the first insights into Sumatran tiger-prey temporal interactions. The ability to estimate overlap statistics with measures of precision has obvious and wide benefits for other predator-prey and interspecific competition studies.","[Linkie, M.] Fauna & Flora Int, Cambridge CB1 2JD, England; [Linkie, M.] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Ridout, M.

The two species' habitats differed in several environmental attributes, primarily precipitation, temperature, and vegetation indices, at both extents. Local-scale surveys between -97 degrees and -101 degrees longitude revealed a steep gradation in ratios of occurrences Say's to the Eastern Phoebe, increasing from east to west. Local-scale occurrences coincided with results of ecological niche models at the extent of both the continent and contact zone, except for Eastern Phoebe occurrences and vegetation indices at both extents. Say's Phoebes nested in open country with sparse or no surrounding woodland, whereas Eastern Phoebe nests were primarily along woodland streams but also at seven sites in more open country where Say's Phoebes had nested previously. At the contact-zone extent, the niche space of the Eastern Phoebe was embedded more into that of Say's Phoebe than the converse. Although niche models at the contact-zone extent indicated some potential for contact, competition between these two species for nest sites is probably less important in limiting distributions than are autoecological characteristics.","[Lira-Noriega, Andres; Peterson, A.

If true, deterministic patterns of species co-existence, transient or otherwise, should not occur. We tested this critical prediction using a spatially explicit, reiterative algorithm (SERA) that incorporates demographic stochasticity to examine how artificial plant species compete for light and space. An additional level of ecological realism was added by simulating species competition in heterogeneous and disturbed environments. Across 108 simulations, small niche differences influenced interspecific competition and persistence, particularly in spatiotemporally heterogeneous environments. One species re-emerged as the dominant, and the identities of subdominant and rare species remained constant. Although stochastic processes played an important role, the results of these simulations are inconsistent with NBT, i.e., very small niche differences dictated patterns even when all species obey the same simple physical rules.","[Hammond, Sean T.; Niklas, Karl J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Niklas, KJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 412 Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",sth24@cornell.edu; kjn2@cornell.edu,"Niklas, Karl/AAV-4760-2021",,"Imaginary Bridges Group; College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell University","The authors thank Drs.

We hypothesized that in response to artificial illumination A. cahirinus will decrease its activity and A. russatus will increase its activity, and thus temporal overlap and interspecific competition could increase. Our study took place in 4 field enclosures: the 1st and 3rd months were controls with natural light, and in the 2nd month artificial illumination, simulating low levels of light pollution, was set for the first 3 h of the night. We implanted temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters to monitor mouse activity, and individual identification tags with automonitored foraging patches were used to track foraging behavior. A. cahirinus decreased activity and foraging with artificial lighting, restricting movement particularly in less-sheltered microhabitats, probably because of increased predation risk. Because illumination restricted both activity time and space, intraspecific encounters of A. cahirinus over foraging patches increased during and following the illuminated hours. However, diurnal A. russatus did not expand its activity into the illuminated hours, possibly due to the presence of competing A. cahirinus, or to nonfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, overt interspecific competition was not affected by experimental light pollution. Light pollution had a negative influence by reducing overall activity and producing a relatively underexploited temporal niche, which may promote invasion of alien species that are less light sensitive; and by increasing intraspecific overlap in foraging A. cahirinus.","[Rotics, Shay; Dayan, Tamar; Kronfeld-Schor, Noga] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Rotics, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",shayroti@post.tau.ac.il,"Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/AAU-3792-2020","Kronfeld-Schor, Noga/0000-0002-5224-3341",,,,59,57,58,1,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

However, an important question is whether it is adaptive. Most models for plasticity in life-history timing predict that animals, once they have reached the minimal nutritional threshold under poor conditions, will accelerate development or time to reproduction. Adaptive delays in reproduction are not common, especially in short-lived species. Examples of adaptive reproductive delays exist in mammalian populations experiencing strong interspecific (e.g., predation) and intraspecific (e.g., infanticide) competition. But are there other environmental factors that may trigger an adaptive delay in reproductive timing? We show that the short-lived flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis will delay reproduction under nutrient-poor conditions, even though it has already met the minimal nutritional threshold for reproduction. We test whether this delay strategy is an adaptive response allowing the scavenger time to locate more resources by experimentally providing supplemental protein pulses (early, mid and late) throughout the reproductive delay period. Flies receiving additional protein produced more and larger eggs, demonstrating a benefit of the delay. In addition, by tracking the allocation of carbon from the pulses using stable isotopes, we show that flies receiving earlier pulses incorporated more carbon into eggs and somatic tissue than those given a later pulse. These results indicate that the reproductive delay in S. crassipalpis is consistent with adaptive post-threshold plasticity, a nutritionally linked reproductive strategy that has not been reported previously in an invertebrate species.","[Wessels, Frank J.; Kristal, Ross; Netter, Fleta; Hahn, Daniel A.] Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hatle, John D.] Univ N Florida, Dept Biol, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA","Wessels, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, POB 110621, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",fwessels@ufl.edu,"Hahn, Daniel A/B-6971-2012",,Florida State Agricultural Experiment Station;  [NSF-IOS-641505]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R15AG028512] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,We thank Jason Curtis for his insight and assistance in processing our stable isotope samples.

Such partitioning can occur through divergent or shared niches. We investigated overlap in habitat use and spatial co-occurrence by sympatric Asiatic black bears and sun bears in three habitats in Thailand, and thereby assessed which niche model best accounts for their coexistence. Methods/Principal Findings: We used density of species-specific signs to assess habitat use. Signs of both bear species occurred in all three habitats, and on >60% of sampling transects. Both species fed mostly on fruit; insect feeding signs were uncommon, and were mostly from sun bears. Significant differences in habitat use occurred only in montane forest, the habitat in which fruit was most abundant; incidence of black bear sign there was six times higher than that of sun bears. Habitat use was similar between the two species in the other habitats, which comprised 85% of the area. Of 10 habitat attributes examined, fruiting tree density was the best predictor of occurrence for both species. Models that included interspecific competition (fresh foraging activity of the other species) were less supported than the top models without competition. Conclusions/Significance: Bear species co-occurrence at both coarse and fine spatial scales and use of the same resources (fruit trees) indicated common niche preferences. However, their habitat use differed in ways expected from their physical differences: larger black bears dominated in the most fruit-rich habitat, and smaller sun bears used less-preferred insects. These results indicate broadly overlapping fundamental niches combined with asymmetric competition-features consistent with the concept of shared preference niches. This model of the niche has received little attention in ecology, but appears to be relatively common in nature.","[Steinmetz, Robert; Seuaturien, Naret] World Wide Fund Nat Thailand, Conservat Biol Unit, Bangkok, Thailand; [Garshelis, David L.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Grand Rapids, MI USA; [Chutipong, Wanlop] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Conservat Ecol Program, Bangkok, Thailand","Steinmetz, R (corresponding author), World Wide Fund Nat Thailand, Conservat Biol Unit, Bangkok, Thailand.",robtyn@hotmail.com,,,World Wildlife Fund United Kingdom; World Wildlife Fund Netherlands; University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System,"This study was funded through grants from World Wildlife Fund United Kingdom (http://www.panda.org/united_kingdom/) and World Wildlife Fund Netherlands (http://www.panda.org/netherlands/).

Because different ecological processes dominate on different spatial and temporal scales, response diversity is likely to be scale dependent. Using three extensive data sets on seabirds, pelagic fish, and zooplankton, we investigate the strength and diversity in the response of seabirds to prey in the North Sea over three scales of ecological organization. Two-stage analyses were used to partition the variance in the abundance of predators and prey among the different scales of investigation: variation from year to year, variation among habitats, and variation on the local patch scale. On the year-to-year scale, we found a strong and synchronous response of seabirds to the abundance of prey, resulting in low response diversity. Conversely, as different seabird species were found in habitats dominated by different prey species, we found a high diversity in the response of seabirds to prey on the habitat scale. Finally, on the local patch scale, seabirds were organized in multispecies patches. These patches were weakly associated with patches of prey, resulting in a weak response strength and a low response diversity. We suggest that ecological similarities among seabird species resulted in low response diversity on the year-to-year scale. On the habitat scale, we suggest that high response diversity was due to interspecific competition and niche segregation among seabird species. On the local patch scale, we suggest that facilitation with respect to the detection and accessibility of prey patches resulted in overlapping distribution of seabirds but weak associations with prey. The observed scale dependencies in response strength and diversity have implications for how the seabird community will respond to different environmental disturbances.","[Fauchald, Per; Tveraa, Torkild] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Arctic Ecol Dept, Polar Environm Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Skov, Henrik] DHI, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark; [Skern-Mauritzen, Mette] Inst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Hausner, Vera Helene] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Johns, David] Sir Alister Hardy Fdn Ocean Sci, The Laboratory, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England","Fauchald, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Arctic Ecol Dept, Polar Environm Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.",per.fauchald@nina.no,"Fauchald, Per/AAV-4242-2021; Skern-Mauritzen, Mette/ABA-8173-2020","Tveraa, Torkild/0000-0002-7501-3696; Johns, David/0000-0003-3270-6764",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway,We thank Maria Zarecki for kindly providing the data from the ICES database.

The aim of this study is to extend the analysis of this topic to the case of Vipera aspis and V. berus in an alpine area of northern Italy, by comparing suitability models to verify which ecological factors affect their occurrence and to assess a possible niche separation. Potential distribution was modelled using the maximum entropy method, using six non-correlated ecogeographical variables as predictors. The models fitted well for both species (mean AUC = 0.926; 87.4% of testing data correctly classified). The most informative variables were: habitat, altitude and solar radiation for the asp viper; altitude and habitat for the adder. Deciduous woods, meadows and urban areas had a positive effect on V. aspis distribution as wetlands, meadows and rocks vegetation did on V. berus. However, the variable best separating the species was the elevation, the adder occurring more frequently at higher altitude than the asp viper. Our data showed that the two vipers were mutually exclusive, as already observed by Saint Girons in 1975. Vipera aspis is more thermophilic and lives at low altitude, while Vipera berus lives under cool and humid areas typical of alpine pastures. A similar pattern were found in the contact areas between European vipers belonging to the V. aspis and Pelias group respectively.","[Scali, Stefano] Museo Civ Storia Nat Milano, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Sacchi, Roberto; Gentilli, Augusto] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Biol Anim, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Scali, S (corresponding author), Museo Civ Storia Nat Milano, Corso Venezia 55, I-20121 Milan, Italy.",stefano.scali@comune.milano.it,"MANGIACOTTI, MARCO/AAH-1282-2020; Sacchi, Roberto/E-2141-2011","MANGIACOTTI, MARCO/0000-0001-7144-3851; Sacchi, Roberto/0000-0002-6199-0074",Parco Regionale delle Orobie Valtellinesi,We are grateful to Sylvain Ursenbacher and to two anonymous referees for helpful comments on the submitted draft.

Both species appear to have similar habitat requirements. We studied habitat selection by hares and cottontails during feeding activity from September 2006 to August 2007 in two areas where they occur alone (allopatry) and in one area where they occur together (sympatry). The three areas were basically similar, so that shifts in habitat use observed in sympatry should reflect the response to interspecific competition. Habitat selection was examined at micro- and macro-habitat levels throughout seasons. Habitat breadth of both species followed the change of resource availability through seasons in allopatry as well as in sympatry. No shifts in habitat use were evident at macro-habitat level, even during autumn which was the limiting season. Exploitation of shared habitats by the two species seems to be promoted by differential micro-habitat use within macro-habitat types. Cottontails used woods with dense understory in greater proportion than hares, and their present sites were concentrated within the maximum distance of 20 m of the nearest shelter site. Hares were more likely than cottontails to exploit crops, and their sites were distributed even greater than 80 m away from permanent cover patches. The habitat heterogeneity of agricultural ecosystems within the sympatry range could buffer the negative effects of external factors (climate, human disturbance and predation) on hares, and enhance the chances of exploitation of shared habitats by both species.","[Vidus-Rosin, Anna; Meriggi, Alberto; Cardarelli, Elisa; Mariani, Maria-Chiara; Corradelli, Chiara; Barba, Annalisa] Univ Pavia, Dept Anim Biol, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Serrano-Perez, Sara] Univ Extremadura, Fac Vet, Dept Anat Biol Celular & Zool, Caceres 10071, Spain","Vidus-Rosin, A (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Anim Biol, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",anna.vidus@unipv.it,,,,,,61,17,18,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0001-7051,2190-3743,,ACTA THERIOL,Acta Theriol.,JAN,2011,56,1,,,,,53,61,,10.1007/s13364-010-0005-x,,,9,Zoology,Zoology,765FR,WOS:000290689500006,,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

In the present study, four forest fragments of 60-120 ha were surveyed on a rural property in southern Sergipe, where two endangered primate species, Callicebus coimbrai Kobayashi & Langguth, 1999 and Cebus xanthostemos Wied-Neuwied, 1826, are found. Two transects were established in each fragment, and the predominant habitat in 50 m sectors was assigned to one of three categories (mature forest, secondary forest and anthropogenic forest). Standard line transect surveys of the resident primate populations which included a third species, Callitrhix jacchus Linnaeus, 1758 were conducted, with a total of 476 km walked transect, resulting in 164 primate sightings. At each sighting of a primate, the habitat class was recorded and the height of the individual above the ground was estimated. The analysis indicated a significant (p < 0.05) preference for mature forest in C. xanthostemos which was also observed more frequently in the larger and better preserved fragments. No clear habitat preference was verified in the other two species, although both were relatively more abundant in the smaller fragments. However, a tendency to avoid anthropogenic forest was observed in C. coimbrai. Callitrhix jacchus used significantly lower (p < 0.05) forest strata than the other species, although other differences were unclear, presumably because of the reduced stature of the forest in the fragments. Overall, the results of the study indicate that C. xanthostemos is tolerant of the effects of habitat fragmentation, and that differential habitat use may play an important role in niche partitioning.","[Deda Chagas, Renata Rocha] Univ Fed Sergipe, Programa Posgrad Desenvolvimento & Meio Ambiente, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil; [Ferrari, Stephen F.] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Biol, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil","Chagas, RRD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sergipe, Programa Posgrad Desenvolvimento & Meio Ambiente, Ave Marechal Rondon, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil.",renata_deda118@hotmail.com,,"Ferrari, Stephen/0000-0003-0566-0000","Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302747/2008-7, 476064/2008-2]","We are especially grateful to Ary Ferreira, owner of Fazenda Trapsa, Jose Elias and Joao Pedro Souza-Alves for their assistance during fieldwork.

However, recent reviews have shown that competitors, unlike predators and parasites, have rarely been documented to cause extinctions. There is a need for better understanding of competitive interactions between nonindigenous species and native competitors across systems where NIS reach high densities. In this paper we examine competitive interactions between the exotic, invasive New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and native estuarine invertebrates. P. antipodarum is often described as a freshwater snail but can occur in brackish water as well; it has been established in the Columbia River Estuary for over ten years. We addressed competition in this estuarine system using three approaches: field surveys of the benthic invertebrate community, stable isotope analysis of overlap in resource use by common invertebrates, and a laboratory competition experiment that tested the strength of competition between P. antipodarum and the isopod, Gnorimosphaeroma insulare, which overlap in resource use. We found no evidence of negative competitive impacts of P. antipodarum on native benthic invertebrates in this estuarine system. Densities of P. antipodarum and common native epibenthic invertebrates are positively correlated in the intertidal, likely due to shared habitat preferences. The competition experiment showed that the effect of interspecific competition from P. antipodarum on the foraging and survival of G. insulare was significantly less than the effect of intraspecific competition between isopods. The presence of the isopod G. insulare reduced foraging in P. antipodarum, but this change did not result in reduced survival and growth of snails. Hence, interspecific competition is weak despite high densities achieved by the invading species. Finally, we discuss several possible explanations for the observation that P. antipodarum does not have an obvious negative competitive impact on native benthic invertebrates.","[Brenneis, Valance E.

Specifically, we addressed the following questions: 1) do species show niche conservatism in space (France vs Morocco) and time (breeding vs winter period)? 2) Does habitat use change at different interspecific densities? 3) Which factors drive the narrow range limit between G. cristata and G. macrorhyncha? We found that G. theklae was strongly associated with sloping and rocky (rugged) habitats in comparison with crested larks, but habitat use was not entirely consistent in space and time. Evidences for ecological displacement were mitigated. In the only habitat shared by G. cristata and G. theklae in France (vineyards surrounded by low shrubland), we observed a one-third increase of G. theklae from nearby garrigues in winter, which coincided with a significant decrease of G. cristata after we controlled for density changes in non-shared habitats. However, in Morocco, the use of rugged habitats by G. theklae was not affected by the prevalence of G. cristata or G. macrorhyncha in surrounding areas, at least at the spatial scales investigated. Our results suggest that interspecific competition plays a role in the parapatric distribution of G. cristata and G. macrorhyncha, because: 1) the alternative of a recent contact receives little support; 2) transition between species coincides with aridity gradients but not with topographic barriers or a sharp ecotone; 3) G. cristata also occurs in arid areas wherein G. macrorhyncha is rare or absent. Overall, our results add support to the view that a better integration of biotic interactions and spatio-temporal variations in ecological niches might increase the predictive power of ecological niche models.","[Guillaumet, Alban; Gonin, Julien] CNRS, EPHE, CEFE, UMR 5175, FR-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Prodon, Roger] CNRS, EPHE, CEFE, UMR 5175, FR-34295 Montpellier 5, France; [Gonin, Julien] Ligue Francaise Protect Oiseaux, FR-17305 Rochefort, France","Guillaumet, A (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, Mail Stop 9690, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",aguillaumet@cfr.msstate.edu,,,GDRI BIOM,"The authors are pleased to thank people who helped us in the field, and particularly Guillaume Bruneau, Olivier Chaline, Guillaume Leotard, Vincent Mouret and Hicham Nouiri.

Androdioecy (where populations contain a mix of males and hermaphrodites) is rare among animals, but has been described in more than 30 species of barnacles and appears to have evolved independently at least four times in this clade. Several models have been suggested to explain the evolution and stability of different mating systems in barnacles, including the relatively high frequency of androdioecy. We review this body of theory and compare predictions to existing empirical data on interspecific patterns of sex allocation. Allocation to male and female reproduction may also vary within barnacle species, and these patterns may provide additional insight into the evolutionary forces that select for different mating systems. Theory predicts that for simultaneous hermaphrodites, the optimal allocation to male function should increase with the size of mating groups, due to sperm competition. This prediction is supported by the only previously published study to address this issue. We present new data from another intertidal barnacle (Tetraclita rubescens) that do not support the predicted association between investment in male reproduction and local density of conspecifics. We suggest that this departure from the expected relationship may arise from a reduced importance of sperm competition in this species. Despite over 150 years of interest in barnacle mating systems, many questions remain unanswered. We argue that barnacles provide a superb opportunity to test predictions of sex allocation theory and we offer suggestions for promising areas of future research. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, distance-dependent tree models are difficult to use because they require a map of the stand, which is not only very costly but also impracticable in a routine management context. This paper reports the development of a model bridging distance-dependent and distance-independent tree models, and that is designed to simulate the growth of a mixed forest. The model used distributions of the number of neighbours to reconstruct tree neighbourhoods and compute the competition indices needed as inputs to the growth model. Data were collected from a mixed forest of sessile oak and Scots pine in central France. The study showed that local competition indices explained a significant proportion of growth variability and that intraspecific competition was greater than interspecific competition. The model based on neighbourhood distributions gave consistent predictions compared to a distance-dependent model.

Here, we assess the extent and impact of edge effects on a protected leopard Panthera pardus population in the Phinda-Mkhuze Complex (PMC), South Africa. We compared the spatial and demographic characteristics of leopards in two areas of the PMC, one closer to the border than the other. Leopard density declined from the core of the reserve (11.11 +/- 1.31 leopards 100 km-2) to the border (7.17 +/- 1.12 leopards 100 km-2), and was the lowest in non-protected areas adjoining the PMC (2.49 +/- 0.87 leopards 100 km-2), but was not related to prey abundance or interspecific competition. Radiotelemetry showed that leopards near the border spent a greater proportion of their time outside the reserve and suffered higher annual mortality rates (0.358 +/- 0.075) than those closer to the core (0.122 +/- 0.065). A Cox proportional hazards model further demonstrated the negative effect of time spent outside the reserve on the survival probability of leopards. Despite an increased risk of mortality, leopards did not avoid non-protected areas, which may have functioned as an ecological trap for predators. Although the overall conservation outcome of the reserve was positive, edge effects clearly weakened the potential of the PMC to protect leopards. Our findings show that high mortality rates of carnivores in areas bordering reserves can extend to protected populations. Management approaches that control human activities on both sides of administrative borders are therefore essential if reserves are to conserve large carnivores effectively.","[Balme, G.

Here, we develop general theory for the density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism based on the C-R mechanism of interspecific interaction. To test the influence of C-R interactions on the dynamics and stability of bi- and uni-directional C-R mutualisms, we developed simple models that link consumer functional response of one mutualistic species with the resources supplied by another. Phase-plane analyses show that the ecological dynamics of C-R mutualisms are stable in general. Most transient behavior leads to an equilibrium of mutualistic coexistence, at which both species densities are greater than in the absence of interactions. However, due to the basic nature of C-R interactions, certain density-dependent conditions can lead to C-R dynamics characteristic of predator-prey interactions, in which one species overexploits and causes the other to go extinct. Consistent with empirical phenomena, these results suggest that the C-R interaction can provide a broad mechanism for understanding density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism. By unifying predation, competition, and mutualism under the common ecological framework of consumer-resource theory, we may also gain a better understanding of the universal features of interspecific interactions in general.","[Holland, J.

Analyses of organic matter delta N-15 from sediment cores show that nutrient enrichment started in the 1910s and intensified from the 1930s. Subsequent changes in sediment organic carbon content and accumulation rates, carotenoid pigment concentrations, organic matter delta C-13, and cladoceran subfossil remains show that excess nutrient inputs triggered bottom-up-driven increases in lake primary production, as well as in Daphnia abundance. Daphnia size, however, started to decrease in the late 1930s, indicating an increasing size-selective predation from zooplanktivorous whitefish populations (Coregonus lavaretus) that had been fostered by stocking and increased food availability. Whitefish predation is likely to have indirectly facilitated the establishment of Bosmina longirostris. With decreasing nutrient concentrations, Daphnia abundance decreased, but their size declined, presumably due to an ongoing size-selective predation. At this same time, Bosmina abundance doubled as a likely result of released interspecific competition from smaller Daphnia. delta N-15 analyses on subfossil cladoceran remains revealed that these changes in cladoceran community structure were accompanied by major changes in the food web. In spite of successful measures to reduce nutrient inputs from the late 1960s and reduced primary production, anoxia still occurs every summer at the lake bottom. These patterns are the consequence of a still relatively high export of phytoplankton-derived organic matter to the sediment as a result of strong top-down effects on the planktonic food chain.","[Perga, Marie-Elodie] Alpine Ctr Res Lake Ecosyst & Food Webs CARRTEL, INRA, Thonon Les Bains, France; [Desmet, Marc] Natl Sch State Publ Works, Vaulx En Velin, France; [Desmet, Marc] Univ Tours, Inst Earth Sci, Orleans, France; [Enters, Dirk] Univ Bremen, Arbeitsgrp Geomorphol & Polarforsch, D-2800 Bremen 33, Germany; [Enters, Dirk] Univ Savoie, Savoie, France; [Reyss, Jean-Louis] Lab Climate Sci & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France","Perga, ME (corresponding author), Alpine Ctr Res Lake Ecosyst & Food Webs CARRTEL, INRA, Thonon Les Bains, France.",perga@thonon.inra.fr,"Enters, Dirk/AAF-1669-2021","Enters, Dirk/0000-0002-0484-541X; Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769",French National Institute for Agronomical Research,Funding for this study was provided by the Innovative Projects'' program 2007 of the French National Institute for Agronomical Research.,,60,51,52,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

In this study, we used observational and experimental approaches to investigate the role of temperature and interspecific competition in controlling the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in forests of the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon. To assess the potential role of competition, we first Used null model analyses to ask whether species partition temporal and/or spatial environments. TO understand how thermal tolerances influence the structure Of Communities, we conducted a laboratory experiment to estimate the maximum thermal tolerance of workers and a field experiment in which we added shaded microhabitats and monitored the response of foragers. Finally, to evaluate the roles of temperature and interspecific competition in the field, we simultaneously manipulated shading and the presence of a dominant competitor (Formica moki). The foraging activity of species broadly overlapped during the diurnal range of temperatures. Species co-occurrence patterns varied across the diurnal temperature range: species were spatially segregated at bait stations at low temperatures, but co-occurred randomly at high temperatures. The decreased abundance of the co-occurring themophilic Temnothorax nevadensis in shaded plots was a direct effect of shading and not an indirect effect of competitive interactions. Thermal tolerance predicted the response of ant species to the shading experiment: species with the lowest tolerances to high temperatures showed the greatest increase ill abundance in the shaded plots. Moreover, species with more similar thermal tolerance values segregated more frequently oil baits than did species that differed in their thermal tolerances. Collectively, our results suggest that thermal tolerances of ants may mediate competitive effects in habitats that experience strong diurnal temperature fluctuations.","[Wittman, Sarah E.; Gotelli, Nicholas J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Ellison, Aaron M.] Harvard Univ, Petersham, MA 01366 USA; [Jules, Erik S.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Ratchford, Jaime S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Range Ecol & Management, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Wittman, SE (corresponding author), Mpala Res Ctr, POB 555, Nanyuki, Kenya.",sarah.wittman@uvm.edu,"Sanders, Nathan/ABE-4335-2020; Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009","Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731; Ellison, Aaron/0000-0003-4151-6081","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [03-01932, 03-01361, 03-01381]","We thank Nick Kaczmar, Rachel Lacy, Shannon McBride, Raynelle Rine, and Patricia Wittman for help in the field, and the US Forest Service for access to sites.

Predictions based on theory should be applicable when, e.g., effects of competing species on the ecological tolerances are assessed or species' diversity along a resource gradient is evaluated. We studied the ecological response curves of competing plant species along a resource gradient in boreal forests. The study was based on nation-wide soil and vegetation data collected from 455 sample plots on boreal forests in Finland. Species response curves along a soil fertility gradient (in terms of C/N ratio) were estimated using generalized additive models. Distribution of species optima and the relationship of niche width and skewness to the location of the optimum were analyzed with new bootstrap tests. The developed tests can account for the effects of truncation observed in the response curves of several species and for the uneven distribution of observations on the gradient. The estimated response curves of the major field layer species of boreal forests were not evenly distributed along soil C/N gradient. The density of optima peaked with relatively high nitrogen availability. Species with optima at low nitrogen availability had relatively broad realized niches. Niche width was negatively correlated with the density of optima. Species optima were packed and niches were narrow at high resource levels. This result suggests that a greater number of more specialized species can occur and interspecific competition decreases niche widths at high resource levels. Species were packed in the gradient where the C/N ratio was lower than 25, i.e., in conditions where nitrification can take place. This indicates that the majority of the vascular plants of boreal forests are favoured by the availability of N03-. Those few species thriving at high C/N ratios have broader realized niches.

We studied seasonal patterns of habitat use by Akodon azarae and Calomys laucha at two spatial scales: between maize fields and their weedy edges (macrohabitats), and associations of rodents captures with vegetation variables at the trap site level (microhabitats). We evaluated if the different habitat uses were related to disturbances generated by practices associated to maize cycle. A. azarae used mainly field edges, but it showed an increased use of maize fields when the crop reached maturity in summer. Contrarily, C. laucha used maize fields in a higher proportion than edges in all seasons. C. laucha was more influenced by microhabitat characteristics than A. azarae. C. laucha was present in sites with abundant dicot weeds when maize was growing up, while it was associated to sites with weeds with scarce cover in stubble maize fields. Before harvesting, both species were segregated at the microscale within maize fields. A. azarae was related to sites with high availability of green plant cover and C. laucha occupied low-quality sites, probably attributed to differences in their diets. We conclude that the pattern of habitat use by both species is best predicted at the macrohabitat scale, and when they are impoverished and present internal heterogeneity, there is selection at microhabitat scale of those better sites. While A. azarae responds to changes in vegetation cover and habitat structure associated to agricultural practices, C. laucha uses cropfields in an opportunistic way, affected by interspecific competition.","[Hodara, Karina] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Metodos Cuantitat & Sistemas Informac, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Busch, Maria] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Hodara, K (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Metodos Cuantitat & Sistemas Informac, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",hodara@agro.uba.ar; mbusch@ege.fcen.uba.ar,,,CONICET (Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires,"We thank the farm owners who allowed us to conduct the fieldwork on their farms.

In this study, we suggest an approach that integrates the phenology and ontogeny of species interactions with a fitness landscape to provide a common mechanistic framework for investigating phenological shifts. We suggest that this ontogeny-phenology landscape provides a flexible method to document changes in the relative phenologies of interacting species, examine the causes of these phenological shifts, and estimate their consequences for interacting species.

Here, we consider how parasitoid wasps vary their reproductive decisions when their offspring face intra- and interspecific competition for resources and mates. We use host acceptance and sex ratio behaviour to test whether female Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia longicornis discriminate between conspecifics and heterospecifics when ovipositing. We tested pairs of conspecific or heterospecific females ovipositing either simultaneously or sequentially on a single host, using strains varying in their recent history of sympatry. Both N. vitripennis and N. longicornis rejected parasitized hosts more often than unparasitized hosts, although females were more likely to superparasitize their own species in the sequential treatment. However, sex ratio behaviour did not vary, suggesting similar responses towards conspecifics and heterospecifics. This contrasts with theory predicting that heterospecifics should not influence sex ratios as their offspring do not influence local mate competition, where conspecifics would. These non-adaptive sex ratios reinforce the lack of adaptive kin discrimination in N. vitripennis and suggest a behavioural constraint. Discrimination between closely related species is therefore context dependent in Nasonia. We suggest that isolating mechanisms associated with the speciation process have influenced behaviour to a greater extent than selection on sex ratios.","[Ivens, A. B.

In eusocial aphids, there is no single explanation for what predisposes some lineages of aphids to sociality, and not others. Because the assumption has been that most aphid species occur in essentially clonal groups, the roles of intra- and interspecific competition and population structure in aphid sociality have been given little consideration. Here, I used microsatellites to evaluate the patterns of variation in the clonal group structure of both social and nonsocial aphid species. Multiclonal groups are consistent features across sites and host plants, and all species-social or not-can be found in groups composed of large fractions of multiple clones, and even multiple species. Between-group dispersal in gall-forming aphids is ubiquitous, implying that factors acting ultimately to increase between-clone interactions and decrease within-group relatedness were present in aphids prior to the origins of sociality. By demonstrating that between-group dispersal is common in aphids, and thus interactions between clones are also common, these results suggest that understanding the ecological dynamics of dispersal and competition may offer unique insights into the evolutionary puzzle of sociality in aphids.","Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Abbot, P (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",patrick.abbot@vanderbilt.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOB-0417006],"The author gratefully acknowledges V.

Recent studies have shown that the indirect effects of climate change may amplify or counteract the direct effects. However, little is known about the the relative strength of direct and indirect effects or their potential to impact population persistence. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the effects of altered precipitation and interspecific interactions on the low-density tiller growth rates and biomass production of three perennial grass species in a Kansas, USA mixed prairie. We transplanted plugs of each species into local neighborhoods of heterospecific competitors and then exposed the plugs to a factorial manipulation of growing season precipitation and neighbor removal. Precipitation treatments had significant direct effects on two of the three species. Interspecific competition also had strong effects, reducing low-density tiller growth rates and aboveground biomass production for all three species. In fact, in the presence of competitors, ( log) tiller growth rates were close to or below zero for all three species. However, we found no convincing evidence that per capita competitive effects changed with precipitation, as shown by a lack of significant precipitation x competition interactions. Conclusions/Significance: We found little evidence that altered precipitation will influence per capita competitive effects. However, based on species' very low growth rates in the presence of competitors in some precipitation treatments, interspecific interactions appear strong enough to affect the balance between population persistence and local extinction. Therefore, ecological forecasting models should include the effect of interspecific interactions on population growth, even if such interaction coefficients are treated as constants.",,"Adler, PB (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.adler@usu.edu,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014; Adler, Peter B./D-3781-2009","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",,,,23,45,49,0,51,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,SEP 3,2009,4,9,,,,,,,e6887,10.1371/journal.pone.0006887,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,490RX,WOS:000269522900016,19727390,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Surveys of the invaded area indicate that the geographic distribution of O. vitiosa encompasses 71% of the Melaleuca infestation. Although released 5 yr later, the distribution of B. melaleuca is slightly greater than its predecessor, with a range including 78% of the sampled Melaleuca stands. Melaleuca stands outside both biological control agents' distributions occurred primarily in the northern extremes of the tree's range. Strong positive association between herbivore species was observed, with the same density of both species occurring in 162 stands and no evidence of interspecific competition. Soil type also influenced the incidence of biological control agents and the distribution of their impacts. The odds of encountering O. vitiosa or B. melaleucae in cells dominated by sandy soils were 2.2 and 2.9 times more likely than those predominated by organically rich soils. As a result, a greater level of damage from both herbivores was observed for stands growing on sandy versus organic-rich soils.","[Balentine, K. M.; Pratt, P. D.; Dray, F. A., Jr.; Rayamajhi, M.

Most empirical tests of the SGH have evaluated the interactions between a single or a few pairs of species, have not considered the effects of multiple stress factors, and have not explored these interactions at nested spatial scales. We sampled 63 0.25-m(2) plots, each subdivided into 100 5x5 cm and 25 10x10 cm sampling squares, in a semi-arid Mediterranean environment to evaluate how co-occurrence patterns among biological soil crusts (BSC)-forming lichens changed along natural stress gradients driven by water and nutrient (N, P, K) availability. According to the SGH, we tested the hypothesis that the fine-scale spatial arrangement of BSC-forming lichens should shift from prevailing interspecific segregation to aggregation as abiotic stress increases. Co-occurrence patterns ranged from significant species segregation to aggregation at the two spatial scales studied. When using the 5x5 cm grid, more plots showed significant species segregation than aggregation. At this sampling scale, co-occurrence increased as water and nutrient availability decreased and increased, respectively. Small increases in soil pH promoted species co-occurrence. Interspecific segregation was promoted as the cover of highly competitive species, such as Diploschistes diacapsis, increased. No significant relationships between co-occurrence and the surrogates of abiotic stress were observed when data was arranged in a 10x10 cm grid. Our co-occurrence analyses partially supported predictions from the SGH, albeit the results obtained were dependent on the type of abiotic stress and the spatial scale considered. They show the difficulties of predicting how co-occurrence patterns change along complex stress gradients, and highlight the need of incorporating the effects of abiotic stress promoted by different resources, such as water and nutrients, into the conceptual framework of the SGH.","[Maestre, Fernando T.; Martinez, Isabel; Escolar, Cristina; Escudero, Adrian] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, ES-28933 Mostoles, Spain","Maestre, FT (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, ES-28933 Mostoles, Spain.",fernando.maestre@urjc.es,"Escudero, Adrian/H-5046-2015; Maestre, Fernando T./A-6825-2008; Martinez, Isabel/K-8800-2014","Escudero, Adrian/0000-0002-1427-5465; Maestre, Fernando T./0000-0002-7434-4856; Martinez, Isabel/0000-0002-5924-1648","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MCINN)Spanish Government; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); British Ecological Society [231/1975, ECPG 231/607]; Comunidad de Madrid projectsComunidad de Madrid [GR/AMB/0932/2004]; REMEDINAL [S-0505/AMB/0335]; MCINN project [CGL2006-09431]; Fundacion BBVA project INTERCAMBIOBBVA Foundation [BIOCON06/105]","We thank the owners of La Encomienda Mayor de Castilla estate for allowing us to work on their property, Nicholas J.

Therefore, selection should favour mechanisms that allow sensing neighbours prior to emergence. We tested whether or not germination is affected by density and identity of neighbouring seeds or seedlings of desert perennial plants. Based on theory, we predicted that germination fractions are independent of neighbouring seeds, that germination is accelerated in dense interspecific neighbourhoods, and neighbour effects are caused by seedlings, not by seeds. We examined germination fraction and timing of four naturally coexisting sandy desert perennial species in low versus high seed densities in both intra- and interspecific neighbourhoods, and with and without removal of newly emerged seedlings. Neighbours accelerated germination independent of density and this pattern was apparently caused by the presence of early emerging seedlings. Germination fractions were lower in high seed densities even when neighbours did not germinate, indicating that seeds were able to sense each other prior to emergence. Early germination may be adaptive because fast emerging seedlings may gain a competitive edge over slow emerging ones. However, since seeds that did not germinate died, delayed germination may only be advantageous for mother plants when sib competition is intense. Another key finding was a competitive hierarchy with late successional species germinating faster and inhibiting germination of pioneer species. This indicates that successional processes may be directed as early as during germination.","[Tielboerger, Katja] Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, Dept Plant Ecol, DE-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Prasse, Ruediger] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Environm Planning Dept, DE-30419 Hannover, Germany","Tielborger, K (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, Dept Plant Ecol, Morgenstelle 3, DE-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",katja.tielboerger@uni-tuebingen.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [FK 0339498B]; Lady Davis Foundation,"We acknowledge funding by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF; FK 0339498B) and by the Lady Davis Foundation.

The most important consequences of light quality cues, often mediated by decreasing in red far-red ratios with respect to the spectral composition of incident sunlight radiation, affecting weed-crop interaction are the increased plant height and shoot to root ratio in anticipation of competition by light quantity, water or nutrients. Although the concepts related to light quality have been extensively studied and several basic process of this phenomenon are well known, little applications of photomorphogenic signaling currently are related to agricultural problems or weed management. The objectives of this review are to describe how light quality change can be a triggering factor of interspecific interference responses, to analyze how this phenomenon can be used to predict weed interference, to reevaluate the critical periods of interference concept, and to discuss its potential contribution towards developing more weed competitive crop varieties. Knowledge on light quality responses involved in plant sensing of interspecific competition could be used to identify red/far-red threshold values, indicating when weed control should be started. Light quality alterations by weeds can affect grain crop development mainly in high yielding fields. Unlike the traditional concept or the critical period of competition, light quality mediated interference implies that the critical period for weed control could start before the effects of direct resource (water, nutrients and available light) limitation actually occur. The variability in light quality responses among crop genotypes and the identification of mutants insensitive to light quality effects indicate that this characteristic can be selected or modified to develop cultivars with enhanced interspecific interference ability. Knowledge on light quality-elicited responses represents a new possibility to understand the underlying biology of interspecific interference, and could be used in the development of new weed management technologies.","[Merotto Jr, A.; Vidal, R.

Here we present the first detailed assessment of its distribution, ecology and conservation. We first used a maximum entropy model (Maxent model) to create a predicted distribution for this species based on very limited species occurrence data. We used this model to guide field surveys for the species between April and October 2006. We found a positive relationship between model values and species presence, indicating that the model was a useful tool to predict species occurrence and guide exploration. In the sites where the metaltail was found we gathered data on its habitat requirements, food resources and behaviour. Our results indicate that Violet-throated Metaltail is restricted to the Western Cordillera of the Andes Mountains in Azuay and Canar provinces of Ecuador, with an area of extent of less than 2,000 km(2). Deep river canyons to the north and south, lack of suitable habitat, and potential interspecific competition in the east may limit the bird's distribution. The species occurred in three distinct habitats, including Polylepis woodland, the upper edge of the montane forest, and in shrubby paramo, but we found no difference in relative abundance among these habitats. The metaltail seems to tolerate moderate human intervention in its habitats as long as some native brushy cover is maintained, We found that Brachyotum sp., Berberis sp., and Barnadesia sp. were important nectar resources. The 'Endangered' status of this species is supported due to its restricted distribution in fragmented habitats which are under increasing human pressures.","[Tinoco, Boris A.; Astudillo, Pedro X.] Univ Azuay, Escuela Biol Medio Ambiente, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Latta, Steven C.] Natl Aviary, Allegheny Commons W, Pittsburgh, PA 15212 USA; [Graham, Catherine H.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Tinoco, BA (corresponding author), Univ Azuay, Escuela Biol Medio Ambiente, Cuenca, Ecuador.",boristmr@yahoo.com,"Graham, Catherine/A-9560-2011; Webster, Pedro Xavier Astudillo/AAW-7879-2021; Graham, Catherine/AAN-1237-2020","Graham, Catherine/0000-0001-9267-7948; Webster, Pedro Xavier Astudillo/0000-0002-9945-9414; Graham, Catherine/0000-0001-9267-7948",Stony Brook University; NASA New InvestigatorNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Aviary (USA); PRBO Conservation Science; Fundacion EcoCiencia; Programa de Becas de Investigacion para la Conservacion (PBIC),"We acknowledge the field assistance of Danilo Mejia.

Syrphids are highly mobile, enabling them to lay eggs over large areas, and to locate aphid colonies earlier in the season than other aphidophaga. The result is that most syrphid eggs tend to be laid close to aphid colonies. The choice of oviposition sites may be crucial for offspring performance because the neonate larvae have limited dispersal ability. Selection of aphid patches should therefore reflect nutritional value, risk of predation and competition pressure. Several factors are known to affect the choice of oviposition site: habitat, host plant, aphid species, aphid availability, semiochemicals, the presence of intra-or interspecific competitors and female age. We review here the available information on these factors in order to understand the mechanisms of decision-making by syrphid females during their egg-laying behavior, a crucial aspect of their effective use in strategies of the biological control of aphids.","[Almohamad, Raki; Verheggen, Francois J.; Haubruge, Eric] Univ Liege Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Entomol, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium","Almohamad, R (corresponding author), Univ Liege Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Entomol, Passage Deportes, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",almohamad.r@fsagx.ac.be,,"Verheggen, Francois/0000-0002-5849-1661; Haubruge, Eric/0000-0002-8138-0476",,,,132,62,65,4,79,FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX,GEMBLOUX,"BIBLIOTHEQUE, PASSAGE DES DEPORTES 2, GEMBLOUX, 00000, BELGIUM",1370-6233,1780-4507,,BIOTECHNOL AGRON SOC,Biotechnol.

In the common buzzard Buteo buteo, the 3 color morphs vary in lifetime reproductive success (LRS), but the proximate mechanisms leading to these differences are unknown. We first confirmed the stability of the fitness differences found previously, using a greatly extended LRS data set. To find potential causes for these differences, we experimentally studied variation in aggressive behavior of the morphs, both against an interspecific predator and intraspecific competitors. The morphs showed substantial variation in aggressive behavior. Light-colored males were most aggressive toward an interspecific predator, followed by intermediate and dark males. In females, this pattern was reversed, resulting in sex-related differences of aggression in 2 morphs. When defending their territory against intraspecific competitors, no absolute difference in aggression was found, but the morphs reacted strongest toward intruders of a morph similar to their own. This suggests that aggression differs both between and within morphs, leading to a complex pattern on the population level. Coupled with the strong fitness differences, our results suggest that the genetic basis of the polymorphism has far-reaching behavioral consequences.","[Boerner, M.; Krueger, O.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England","Boerner, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",mb549@cam.ac.uk,,,European Trust scholarship; Royal Society Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London,European Trust scholarship to M.

Studies have shown that seabird and prey distribution seldom conforms with this prediction. In this study, I review recent theoretical advances in spatial predator-prey interactions and relate these with studies of seabirds and pelagic schooling fish and crustaceans. Studies on seabirds and prey have generally assumed that prey are nonresponsive. Predator-prey interactions should, however, be viewed as a 2-way spatial game where seabirds track concentrations of prey while prey move away from areas with high risk of predation. The outcome of the game depends on how seabirds and prey are spatially constrained. Constraints include the spatial distribution of resources, interspecific competition, the location of spawning and breeding areas, and limitations on diving depth. Although game theoretic models can explain some general aspects of the spatial interaction, the spatial distribution of seabirds and prey is generally much more aggregated and elusive than can be expected from the game theoretic equilibrium. This is because spatial pattern is formed through self-organizing behavior that includes schooling, local enhancement and area-restricted search (ARS). Schooling and local enhancement are processes with strong positive density dependence that destabilize the predator-prey interaction locally. However, the unstable local dynamics might be stabilized by spatial constraints and the effects of ARS processes at large scales.","Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Polar Environm Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway","Fauchald, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Polar Environm Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.",per.fauchald@nina.no,"Fauchald, Per/AAV-4242-2021",,Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,"I thank J.

We used interfertile species of haplodiploid Nasonia wasps to compare re-mating frequency, longevity, oviposition rate and sperm use of conspecifically and heterospecifically mated females. Females that first mated with a heterospecific male re-mated more often a second time, indicating that conspecific mates reduce female receptivity more. Mating did not affect female lifespan. Lifetime production of sons and daughters was significantly reduced in heterospecifically mated females. Dissection of females confirmed that heterospecific sperm survives equally well as conspecific sperm during storage in the spermatheca. Differences in daily fecundity and age at which females become sperm depleted could in part be explained by species differences in ovariole numbers. We conclude that sexual conflict may play a role in the evolution of female mating rate, fecundity and sex allocation in Nasonia.

The larger Snow Geese maintain families longer than Ross's Geese, which probably contributes to their dominance over Ross's Geese during winter. Predator vigilance probably is an important benefit of mixed flocking for both Species. We Suggest the long-standing association with Snow Geese (along with associated subordinate social status) has selected against family maintenance in Ross's Geese.","[Jonsson, Jon Einar] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Afton, Alan D.] Louisiana State Univ, Louisiana Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, USGS, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Jonsson, JE (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Snaefellsnes Res Ctr, Hafatnargata 3, IS-340 Stykkisholmur, Iceland.",joneinar@hi.is,"Jonsson, Jon Einar/K-7482-2015","Jonsson, Jon Einar/0000-0003-1198-786X","Canadian Wildlife Set-vice, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF); Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge (NWR); U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; U.S. Geological Survey-Louisiana Cooperative FishUnited States Geological Survey","Our study was funded by the Canadian Wildlife Set-vice, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), Delta Waterfowl Foundation, Rockefeller Scholarship program, a Research Partnership Proposal (RPP) Grant from Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) and the U,S.

To infer species-specific preferences, we used logistic regression and AIC model selection to compare nest habitat of White-tailed (n = 43) and Rock Ptarmigan (n = 58). Only descriptive statistics were used for Willow Ptarmigan (n = 8 nests) because of smaller sample sizes. Modeling results indicate elevation, slope, and the ground cover of graminoids and lichens were the main variables separating White-tailed and Rock Ptarmigan breeding habitat. Average estimates for elevation and slope around nest sites of each species followed a pattern of White-tailed Ptarmigan (1,827 m, 30 degrees) > Rock Ptarmigan (1,728 m, 18 degrees) > Willow Ptarmigan (1,512 m, 6 degrees). White-tailed Ptarmigan tended to select drier habitats dominated by lichens, rock and dwarf shrubs, while Rock Ptarmigan were more common in meadows with graminoids and scattered woody shrubs. Willow Ptarmigan nested in areas with dense, woody shrubs. The three species display inter- and intraspecific territoriality, and while species-specific habitat preferences allow co-existence, the niche width of each is likely narrowed by the presence of congeners, particularly for White-tailed and Rock Ptarmigan. Within territories, all three species selected nest sites with more lateral cover than expected at random (24-50%). White-tailed and Rock Ptarmigan did not select specific cover types (vegetation or rock) for nest sites within territories, while most Willow Ptarmigan nests were located in patches of scrub birch (Betula glandulosa).","[Wilson, Scott; Martin, Kathy] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Martin, Kathy] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, Canada","Wilson, S (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",wilsonwa@interchange.ubc.ca,"Wilson, Scott/AAC-7144-2021; Brainerd, Scott M./A-1172-2010",,Calgary Bird Banding Society; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Northern Scientific Training Program; Upland Birds Society; Isaac Walton Killam,"We thank C.

This study investigated the interaction between egos of the lizard Mabuya longicaudata Hallowell and two species of ant: a lizard egg commensalist (Paratrechina longicornis Latreille), and an egg predator (Pheidole taivanensis Forel). The ecological interaction between P. longicornis and lizard eggs was tested, and it was predicted that when the interaction was removed, lizard eggs would be attacked by P. taivanensis. 2. Field observations showed that both ant species actively searched for lizard eggs, and that P taivanensis typically found new lizard nests earlier than P. longicornis did. Left undisturbed, P taivanensis predation dramatically reduced lizard egg survival. While P. longicornis usually found nests later, they were able to displace P taivanensis. As a result, proportional egg survival was higher in nests with P. longicornis (0.95 +/- 0.04 eggs) compared to nests without either ant species (0.65 +/- 0.09 eggs), or nests occupied by P. taivanensis (0.07 +/- 0.02 eggs). 3. When P. longicornis ants were experimentally excluded from lizard nests, the proportion of eggs surviving significantly decreased because of increased P. taivallensis predation. Paratrechina longicornis benefits from water that condenses on the eggs. When this resource disappears P. longicornis abandons the nest, leading to predation of the eggs by P. taivanensis.","[Huang, Wen-San] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, 1 Kuan Chien Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan; [Huang, Wen-San] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Huang, WS (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Zool, 1 Kuan Chien Rd, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",wshuang@mail.nmns.edu.tw,,"Huang, Wen-San/0000-0003-0073-3557",,,,15,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

In the former case, the developing single-species stands have limited future management options because they do not provide structures that favor quality wildlife habitat or quality sawtimber production. In the latter case, species mixtures are being planted with little knowledge of subsequent stand development, leading to an inability to predict future stand composition for management purposes. In this article, we present a system to determine bottomland tree planting mixtures that will create single-cohort, mixed-species stands with a component of high-quality bottomland oak. Using individual species ecological life-history characteristics, such as early height growth pattern, relative twig diameter and durability, and developmental patterns in natural stands, bottomland species are rated for their ability to provide beneficial training effects that will lead to the development of quality oak boles. Incorporating such a system to determine species value in mixtures should provide an increased number of future options to meet explicit management objectives and promote improved restoration of bottomland hardwood ecosystems.","[Lockhart, Brian Roy; Gardiner, Emile; Leininger, Theodor] US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Stoneville, MS 38776 USA; [Stanturf, John] US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Lockhart, BR (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, POB 227, Stoneville, MS 38776 USA.",blockhart@fs.fed.us; egardiner@fs.fed.us; tleininger@fs.fed.us; jstanturf@fs.fed.us,"Stanturf, John A./M-4171-2019; Stanturf, John/B-2889-2010","Stanturf, John A./0000-0002-6828-9459; Stanturf, John/0000-0002-6828-9459",,,,110,13,14,1,12,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0148-4419,,,SOUTH J APPL FOR,South.

We studied the reproductive interactions between non-native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and native brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a Pyrenees Mountain stream (SW France). We found evidence of significant interspecific interactions owing to consistent spatial and temporal overlap in redd localizations and spawning periods. We observed mixed spawning groups composed of the two species, interspecific subordinate males, and presence of natural hybrids (tiger trout). These reproductive interactions could be detrimental to the reproduction success of both species.

In this paper I re-analyze by null models several studies on resource partitioning by freshwater turtles published in the peer-reviewed literature. These studies originated from all continents and from a variety of climatic and habitat conditions. I used data given in the original papers to recalculate dietary overlap between species. Then, the true datasets were compared to randomly generated datasets produced by 3 x 10(4) Monte Carlo permutations, by using two different randomization algorithms (RA2 and RA3 of Lawlor, 1980). Datasets were inspected to find non-random structure of the various communities along four resource dimensions: macro-habitat, micro-habitat, food, and time. Based on my meta-analysis, I concluded that the micro-habitat resource is the most important dimension (it was the resource partitioned in nearly 80% of the study cases), followed by the food resource dimension (nearly 70%), whereas macro-habitat and time were clearly less important. In relation to micro-habitat dimension, the selection of basking site typology is perhaps the main aspect of the microhabitat niche to be partitioned. Logistic regression models indicated that the presence of a resource partitioning structure in the dataset was influenced only by matrix size, and not by number of species, continent, presence of substantial body size differences among coexisting species, or tropical versus non-tropical origin. A combination of causes may explain the observed patterns: interspecific competition is likely important in shaping several turtle communities, but intrinsic and extrinsic constraints and predation are also relevant.

Stable coexistence is predicted to occur in communities where competing species have niche-partitioning mechanisms that reduce interspecific competition. Neutral communities are predicted to be structured by stochastic processes that are not influenced by species identity, but that may be influenced by priority effects and dispersal limitation. Recent developments have suggested that neutral interactions may be more common at local scales, while niche structuring may be more common at larger scales. We tested for mechanisms that could promote either stable coexistence or neutral drift in a bromeliad-dwelling mosquito community by evaluating A) if a hypothesized within-bromeliad niche partitioning mechanism occurs in the community, B) if this mechanism correlates with local species co-occurrence patterns, and C) if patterns of coexistence at the larger (metacommunity) scale were consistent with those at the local scale. We found that mosquitoes in this community do partition space within containers, and that species with the strongest potential for competition co-occurred least. Species with overlapping spatial niches minimized co-occurrence by specialising in bromeliads of differing sizes, effectively changing the scale at which they coexist. In contrast, we found no evidence to support neutral dynamics in mosquito communities at either scale. In this community, a niche-based mechanism that is predicted to stabilize species coexistence explains co-occurrence patterns within and among bromeliads.","[Gilbert, Benjamin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Srivastava, Diane S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Kirby, Kathryn R.] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Gilbert, B (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",bgilbert@zoology.ubc.ca,"Kirby, Kathryn/D-1151-2011; Gilbert, Benjamin/E-6616-2010","Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0002-4947-6822",,,,40,49,51,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2008,117,6,,,,,944,950,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16300.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,314WG,WOS:000256839300016,,,,,2021-09-21,

In the High Course of Ebro River, northern Spain, there is a contact zone between Vipera aspis, V. latastei, and V. seoanei. Sympatry was detected between aspis and latastei and also specimens with intermediate morphological traits. Presence-data at a local scale (1 x 1 km) and ecological niche-based models manipulated in a GIS were used to (1) identify how environmental factors correlate with the distribution of the three vipers and with the location of the sympatry area, and (2) identify potential areas for viper occurrence and sympatry. Ensemble for casting with 10 Maximum Entropy models identified a mixture of topographical (altitude, slope), climatic (precipitation, evapotranspiration, and minimum and maximum temperature), and habitat factors (land cover) as predictors for viper occurrence. Similar predicted probabilities according to the variation of some environmental factors (indicating probable sympatry) were observed only for aspis-latastei and aspis-seoanei. In fact, areas of probable occurrence of vipers were generally allopatric but probable sympatry between vipers was identified for aspis-latastei in 76 UTM 1 x 1 km squares, for aspis-seoanei in 23 squares, and latastei-seoanei in two squares. Environmental factors correlate with the location of this contact zone by shaping the species range: some enhance spatial exclusion and constrain distribution to spatially non-overlapping ranges, while others allow contact between species. The distribution in the contact zone apparently results from the balance between the pressures exerted by the different environmental factors and in the sympatry area probably by interspecific competition. Further ecological and genetical data are needed to evaluate the dynamics of the probable hybrid zone. GIS and niche-modelling tools proved to be powerful tools to identify environmental factors sustaining the location of contact zones.","[Martinez-Freiria, F.; Lizana, M.] Univ Salamanca, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim Parasitol Ecol Edafol & Quim Agric, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Sillero, N.; Brito, J.

Their ecology has been extensively studied in New England (United States), but knowledge gaps exist for northern shores, which are subjected to stronger environmental stress. Therefore, we studied the above organisms on Canadian shores. We quantified the summer abundance of these seaweeds and filter feeders across full vertical (intertidal elevation) and horizontal (wave exposure and winter ice scour) environmental gradients on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and open Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia. At the regional scale along the open Atlantic coast, seaweeds showed similar abundances in Nova Scotia than values reported for New England. However, both filter feeders were considerably less abundant in Nova Scotia. At the local scale in Nova Scotia, intense winter ice scour (which only occurs on the Gulf of St. Lawrence coast) was associated with a very low abundance of all species except barnacles. Spatial trends in Nova Scotia were similar to patterns known for certain species elsewhere, such as A. nodosum being almost restricted to sheltered habitats, regardless of elevation, and C. crispus being almost restricted to low elevations, regardless of exposure. Other trends were, however, characteristic of Nova Scotia, such as C. crispus being frequent at low elevations in exposed habitats, unlike in New England, where mussels often predominate there because of competitive advantages. In Nova Scotia, mussels were always restricted to cracks and crevices, unlike in New England, where they form extensive intertidal beds on exposed shores. The direct effects of increased environmental stress and indirect effects through altered interspecific interactions might explain the regional differences in local species distribution, which will require experimental validation.","[Scrosati, Ricardo; Heaven, Christine] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, R (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",rscrosat@stfx.ca,"Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X",,,,70,12,12,0,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAY,2008,603,,,,,,1,14,,10.1007/s10750-007-9160-8,,,14,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,275RI,WOS:000254088900001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Its distribution has not changed noticeably since a survey in 1975/1976. Many experimental studies have shown that canopy-forming algae can have profound effects on the community structure. Although such experiments involving F. serratus are few it was decided to test predictions from these experiments on a geographical scale by comparing community compositions within the area where F. serratus is a dominant algae (since at least 1975/1976) with an adjacent area of similar size where F. serratus is absent (with a single exception without consequences). The work is based on measurements on some 372 stations in the F. serratus area, termed region A, and 227 stations from the F. serratus-free area, termed region B. Percentage cover of algae and sessile invertebrates was estimated on 2 m(2) on each station and animals collected from 800 cm(2) from each station. The vertical distribution of F. serratus was most similar to that of Fucus distichus and the two species often grew intermingled on the lower part of the shore. F. serratus appeared to have reduced the cover of F. distichus in the lowermost part of the shore, while having little or no effect on other canopy-forming species. The low abundance of Semibalanus balanoides in the F. serratus area (region A) is in line with experiments showing detrimental effect on this barnacle by whiplash of F. serratus. In general algal grazers were more abundant in region A, consistent with the greater attractiveness of F. serratus than other canopy-forming species to grazers, although this may be partly explained by the abundance of understorey algae in region A.

Comparative studies of closely related species have evaluated the socio-ecological model and confirmed its validity. For example, female patas monkeys in Laikipia, Kenya, form a nonlinear and unstable dominance hierarchy (i.e., egalitarian), whereas females of sympatric, closely related savannah monkeys form a linear and stable dominance hierarchy (i.e., despotic), in accordance with the model's predictions of the characteristics of food resources. I compared agonistic interactions involving food between patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) and sympatric savannah monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) in Kala Maloue, Cameroon. I found linear dominance hierarchies not only in savannah monkeys, but also in patas monkeys in Kala Maloue. The rates of agonistic interactions during feeding between patas monkeys were equivalent to those between savannah monkeys in Kala Maloue; further, these rates were significantly higher than those of both Laikipia patas and savannah monkeys. The results imply that patas monkeys in Kala Maloue are not egalitarian, but are despotic, similar to savannah monkeys. Disparity in the dominance hierarchies of patas monkeys between Kala Maloue and Laikipia were attributable to the differences in the characteristics of food resources. Although patas monkeys in Laikipia subsist on small and dispersed food resources within a high-density area, those in Kala Maloue subsisted on food resources that were clumped in intermediate-sized patches within a low-density area. This study shows that the socio-ecological model is applicable not only for interspecific comparisons but also for intraspecific comparisons.","Kyoto Univ, Sch Sci, Human Evolut Studies Lab, Dept Zool,Div Biol Sci,Grad Sch Sci, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Nakagawa, N (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Sch Sci, Human Evolut Studies Lab, Dept Zool,Div Biol Sci,Grad Sch Sci, Kita Shirakawa Oiwakecho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",nakagawa@jinrui.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,46,10,10,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0275-2565,1098-2345,,AM J PRIMATOL,Am.

Researchers attribute limitations in predictive ability of a habitat model to data deficiencies, missing parameters, error introduced by specifications of the statistical model, and natural Variation. Few wildlife biologists, however, have incorporated intra- and interspecific interactions (e.g., conspecific attraction, competition, predator-prey relationships) to increase predictive accuracy of habitat models. Based on our literature review and preliminary data analysis, conspecific attraction can be a primary factor influencing habitat selection in wildlife. Conspecific attraction can lead to clustered distributions of wildlife within available habitat, reducing the predictive ability of habitat models based on vegetative and geographic parameters alone. We suggest wildlife biologists consider incorporating a parameter in habitat models for the clustered distribution of individuals within available habitat and investigate the mechanisms leading to clustered distributions of species, especially conspecific attraction.","[Campomizzi, Andrew J.; Butcher, Jerrod A.; Farrell, Shannon L.; Collier, Bret A.; Morrison, Michael L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Snelgrove, Amy G.; Wilkins, R.

The responses of Moina micrura (Cladocera) to slight salinity increases (up to 6.0) were evaluated through laboratory manipulative experiments and field observations at Cabiunas lagoon (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). From the field data, a positive relationship between M. micrura density and salinity was observed, whereas the opposite was found for other co-occurring microcrustaceans. Life-table observations from laboratory experiments showed better performance of individuals exposed to control conditions (no salt addition) and 1.0 and 2.0 of salinity. The difference between field and laboratory results may be explained considering possible direct and indirect effects of salinity on M. micrura populations. Salinity may have direct negative physiological effects in individuals. However, under natural conditions, M. micrura might benefit from reduced invertebrate predation and interspecific competition. This balance between negative and positive effects of salinity is probably more positive under natural conditions, explaining the success of M. micrura in Cabiunas lagoon under mild salinity conditions. Although salinity negatively affects many species living in freshwater systems, slight increases may be beneficial for some species under natural conditions.","[Santangelo, Jayme M.; Bozelli, Reinaldo L.; Rocha, Adriana de M.; Esteves, Francisco de A.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Esteves, Francisco de A.] Nucleo Pesquisas Ecol & Desenvolvimento Socioambi, BR-28970 Macae, RJ, Brazil","Bozelli, RL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373,POB 68020, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",bozelli@biologia.ufrj.br,"Santangelo, Jayme M/B-5922-2011; Bozelli, Reinaldo/S-6414-2019; Bozelli, Reinaldo L/G-1805-2012","Bozelli, Reinaldo L/0000-0001-9916-1629",CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CNPq-PeldConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); PetrobrasFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Amapa (FAPEAP)Petrobras; Pronex; FaperjFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ),"The authors thank the staff of the Laboratorio de Limnologia da UFRJ and NUPEM/UFRJ, especially Joao Marcelo Souza for field assistance.

In order to test whether the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) holds in less exposed shores comprised exclusively of smaller rocks (cobbles) we measured 1) the size frequency distribution of cobbles (mass and basal surface area), 2) the incidence of barnacle encrustation as an indirect measure of cobble disturbance, 3) the abundances of the dominant macroinvertebrates occurring beneath cobbles (the crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus, the chiton Sypharochiton pelliserpentis and the snail Diloma zealandica), and 4) macroinvertebrate fidelity beneath a range of cobble sizes. Only large cobbles were found to be encrusted with barnacles, indicative of their greater resistance to physical disturbance by waves and currents. Mark and relocate experiments indicated fidelity to a given cobble over two tidal cycles was 11-14% for crabs and did not vary with cobble size. In contrast, fidelity to medium and large cobbles was higher for chitons (26-45%) and snails (17-31%) and generally increased with increasing cobble size. In contrast to the predictions of the IDH, there was a positive correlation between increasing cobble size and increasing species diversity of organisms found under the cobbles. This pattern is not simply attributable to greater space available beneath large cobbles as there was a significantly greater density of macroinvertebrates beneath medium and large, compared to the small cobbles. Increasing species diversity with increasing cobble size appears to be independent of patterns of species recolonization associated with small cobbles being subject to high disturbance or interspecific competitive hierarchies associated with low disturbance beneath large cobbles. Instead, factors such as aggregative behaviors, and reducing vulnerability to predators and desiccation stress are likely to explain the relationship between cobbles and their associated macroinvertebrate communities.

Therefore, interspecific competition may occur as each species becomes naturalized throughout the other's native range. As a first step towards investigating competitive interactions, we tested hypotheses regarding prey selection in allopatric and sympatric populations of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in a natural stream. Diet samples from 184 fish and contemporary drift samples were collected during a 24-hour period in mid-summer. Diet overlap was low between salmon and trout in allopatry, but high in sympatry. Salmon consumed more prey and a greater proportion of baetid mayflies than did trout, which fed more frequently on chironomid larvae and aerial-terrestrial invertebrates. Both species consumed larger prey when allopatric than when sympatric. Salmon in allopatry fed as generalists and trout in allopatry fed as specialists, but diets converged when in sympatry. Feeding habits of both salmonines seemed to be affected by the other's presence, although more notably for trout. Results were more consistent with predictions based on optimal foraging theory than on niche-partitioning theory.","SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Fac Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Coghlan, SM (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",stephen.coghlan@umit.maine.edu,,,,,,64,8,8,1,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0270-5060,2156-6941,,J FRESHWATER ECOL,J.

Interspecific diversity in the morphology of animal sperm suggests adaptive evolutionary changes in size and structure. Little attention has been directed at patterns of intraspecific phenotypic variation in sperm morphology, although such variation is a prerequisite for the extreme diversity seen among male gametes. Despite well-developed sperm competition theory providing a basis for exploring how variation in sperm morphology may affect male fitness, the patterns of variation in sperm morphology remain unclear for most species. 2. We report systematic size variation in sperm length among different males and between successive ejaculates within the same male in the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea. Both flagellum length and mid-piece length decreased between the first and second ejaculate. However, within the same ejaculate the sperm head (acrosome and nucleus), midpiece (centriole adjunct region) and tail length exhibited less variation than that present between males for both first and second ejaculates. 3. Our findings, combined with previous studies, suggest a focus on episodes of selection and lifetime selection on ejaculates may be instructive in understanding the selective forces influencing sperm evolution in a predictive framework.","Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England","Harris, WE (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Michael Smith Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",ed.harris@manchester.ac.uk,"Moore, Allen/ABG-1442-2020",,,,,39,12,12,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

A data series for the period 1974-2003 was used to examine shifts in brown bear Ursus arctos food habits in its south-westernmost European population. This focused on the hyperphagic season, when bears gain the fat that is essential for winter dormancy and reproduction. General climatic indicators were predictors of diet trends. Other variables potentially able to modify brown bear food habits at the local scale were accounted for by considering two areas where local conditions changed in different ways during the study period. General climatic indicators such as temperature and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index were good predictors of some diet trends, although local factors seemed to modulate the potential response of food habits to recent climate change. Boreal and temperate food items decreasingly contributed to brown bear diet, replaced by increasing contributions of southern foods, which suggested that warmer temperatures might determine the occurrence of some food items in the diet of Cantabrian brown bears through effects on plant distribution and phenology. At the local scale, high cattle density in one of the study areas limited food sources available for brown bears. Important food sources for brown bears, such as heath-like Vaccinium formations and old-growth oak forest in the Cantabrian Mountains, require increased levels of protection.","Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organismos & Sistemas, Unidad Ecol, Oviedo, Spain; CSIC, Dept Appl Biol, Estac Biol Donana, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Rodriguez, C (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",carlos.rodriguez@uni-jena.de,"Delibes, Miguel/K-2744-2014","Delibes, Miguel/0000-0002-3569-567X; Obeso-Suarez, Jose Ramon/0000-0001-7157-6478",,,,58,37,37,0,57,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,,,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

Model predictions for an idealized two-species annual plant community with asymmetric linear frequency dependence are explored using (i) analytic mean field equilibrium predictions, (ii) deterministic, discrete-time, finite-population, mean field predictions, and (iii) stochastic, discrete-time, cellular automata predictions for a variety of sizes of the spatial interaction and dispersal neighborhoods. We define species interaction factors, ranging from 0 to 1, which incorporate both frequency independent and frequency dependent terms. The maximum competitive ability of a species is reduced unless species frequency is optimal based on species-specific frequency dependence coefficients, ranging from -1 to +1. Assuming that maximum competitive ability is identical for two species, they can coexist indefinitely when they have equal absolute magnitude or both have sufficiently negative frequency dependence. Although smaller scales of spatial interactions reduce the region of the parameter space in which stable coexistence is predicted, the time to extinction of one species can be significantly increased or decreased by the locality of interactions, depending on whether the losing species has positive or negative frequency dependence, respectively. The sensitivity to initial conditions in the community at large is dramatically reduced as the spatial scale of interactions is decreased. As a consequence, smaller spatial interaction neighborhoods increase the ability of introduced species to invade established communities in regions of the parameter space not predicted by mean field approximations. In the loser positive, winner positive regions, smaller scales of interaction dramatically increased invasiveness. In the loser positive, winner negative regions of the parameter space, invasion success decreases, but time to extinction of the resident species during successful invasions increases, with an increase in the spatial scale of interactions. The loser negative, winner positive regions were relatively insensitive to initial conditions, so invasion success was relatively high at a variety of spatial scales. Surprisingly, invasions in parts of this region are most often successful with intermediate neighborhood sizes, although the maximum time that the losing species could persist before being driven to extinction increases with an increase in the spatial scale of interactions. These results are explained by understanding cluster formation and density and the relative local interspecific dynamics in cluster interiors, exteriors, and boundaries. In summary, frequency dependent interactions, and the spatial scale on which these interactions occur, can have a big impact on spatio-temporal community dynamics, with implications regarding species coexistence and invasiveness. The model proposed herein provides a theoretical framework for studying frequency dependent interactions that may shed light on spatio-temporal dynamics in real ecological communities.

Post-copulatory sexual selection on males ( that is, sperm competition and cryptic female choice) can lead to decreased sperm numbers by favouring the production of larger sperm(1). However, a decline in sperm numbers is predicted to weaken selection on males and increase selection on females(2,3). As isogamy is approached ( that is, as investment per gamete by males approaches that by females), sperm become less abundant, ova become relatively less rare, and competition between males for fertilization success is predicted to weaken. Sexual selection for longer sperm, therefore, is expected to be self limiting. Here we examine this paradox in Drosophila along the anisogamy-isogamy continuum using intraspecific experimental evolution techniques and interspecific comparative techniques. Our results confirm the big-sperm paradox by showing that the sex difference in sexual selection gradients(4) decreases as sperm size increases. However, a resolution to the paradox is provided when this finding is interpreted in concert with the 'opportunity for selection' and the 'opportunity for sexual selection'(5,6). Furthermore, we show that most of the variation in measures of selection intensity is explained by sperm length and relative investment in sperm production.","Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Bjork, A (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",acbjork@syr.edu,,"Bjork, Adam/0000-0001-7544-2987",,,,29,75,76,1,80,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,JUN 8,2006,441,7094,,,,,742,745,,10.1038/nature04683,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,050NL,WOS:000238095100052,16760976,Green Published,,,2021-09-21,

This work aims primarily on effects of intraspecific interactions. Agonistic and unequally strong interactions among conspecifics should make the within-population distribution of individuals to be characterised by spatial avoidance of potentially risky conspecifics, according to the individual risks perceived. This process should affect individual performance and involve individual tradeoffs, as failing to adequately avoid risky conspecifics could incur unnecessary costs, while, at the same time, successful conspecific avoidance may reduce access to patches favourable for e.g. foraging or sheltering. Intraspecific agonistic behaviours, such as cannibalism and competition, are likely to have prominent effects in size-structured populations. It is therefore reasonable to assume spatial avoidance of intraspecific risks according to individuals' size relationships in such populations. With this field investigation I show that individuals of northern pike spatially avoid larger conspecifics. This avoidance creates a size-influenced and spatially clumped distribution pattern among pike individuals. At low pike densities, however, distances between individuals increase, allowing for an even distribution pattern to appear. The spatial distribution patterns among piscivore individuals should affect both the individual performance of predators and the potential for spatial antipredatory responses of their prey, and hence be a factor in consumer-resource interactions.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Nilsson, PA (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.nilssson@limnol.lu.se,"Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014","Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835",,,,38,44,44,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2006,113,2,,,,,251,258,,,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,044EO,WOS:000237655400006,,,,,2021-09-21,

We used this unusual interspecific variation to test functional hypotheses of SSD using phylogenetic comparative methods. We found a strong allometric relation between SSD and body size that is consistent with Rensch's rule. We then tested whether the intensity of mating competition and the agility of male displays relate to SSD. First, the intensity of mating competition hypothesis predicts that males should be larger than females in species in which the males compete intensely for mates. As predicted, evolutionary changes towards more polygynous mating systems in bustards were associated with relatively larger males. Second, our results are also consistent with the aerial agility hypothesis, since in agile bustards the males tend to be smaller than females, whereas in nonagile bustards the males are usually larger. We also found that these two types of sexual selection have independent and statistically significant influences on SSD. We conclude that SSD in bustards is most consistent with sexual selection, and is influenced by both the intensity of sexual selection and the agility of male displays. Other hypotheses, however, such as fertility selection acting on females and differential use of niches by males and females remain untested.

Although less well documented, nest raiding by invasive ants may also contribute to the extirpation of native ants. In coastal southern California, for example, invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) commonly raid colonies of the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex subnitidus. On a seasonal basis the frequency and intensity of raids vary, but raids occur only when abiotic conditions are suitable for both species. In the short term these organized attacks cause harvester ants to cease foraging and to plug their nest entrances. In unstaged, one-on-one interactions between P. subnitidus and L. humile workers, Argentine ants behaved aggressively in over two thirds of all pair-wise interactions, despite the much larger size of P. subnitidus. The short-term introduction of experimental Argentine ant colonies outside of P. subnitidus nest entrances stimulated behaviors similar to those observed in raids: P. subnitidus decreased its foraging activity and increased the number of nest entrance workers (many of which labored to plug their nest entrances). Raids are not likely to be the result of competition for food. As expected, P. subnitidus foraged primarily on plant material (85% of food items obtained from returning foragers), but also collected some dead insects (7% of food items). In buffet-style choice tests in which we offered Argentine ants food items obtained from P. subnitidus, L. humile only showed interest in dead insects. In other feeding trials L. humile consistently moved harvester ant brood into their nests (where they were presumably consumed) but showed little interest in freshly dead workers. The raiding behavior described here obscures the distinction between interspecific competition and predation, and may well play an important role in the displacement of native ants, especially those that are ecologically dissimilar to L. humile with respect to diet.","Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Art & Design, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Holway, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dholway@ucsd.edu,,,,,,29,27,28,0,19,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0020-1812,1420-9098,,INSECT SOC,Insect.

Treatments included a non-weeded control, a manually weeded treatment, a chemically weeded treatment, a 1.2m row and 1.2m inter-row weeding, a 0.5m radius ring weeding, a complete weeding except for a 0.5m radius ring around the tree, and the use of two legume cover-crops, Mucuna puriens (L.) DC. and Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. Growth responses to treatments and economic profit were assessed when the trial was felled at seven years of age. Initial growth benefits (first detected from 60 days after planting) were maintained until the trial was felled. The manually weeded treatment produced 62% more merchantable timber, at an increased profit of 30%, than the non-weeded control, thereby demonstrating the potential gains that can be obtained through vegetation control. The non-weeded control, inter-row weeding and the cover-crops experienced interspecific competition during tree establishment and yielded trees of similar height but smaller taper when compared with other treatments. This work shows that volume estimates, derived by using only top height as a predictor variable, may be problematic for non-weeded stands due to the adverse effect of tree suppression on taper and hence timber volume.","Inst Commercial Forestry Res, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa; Univ KwaZulu Natal Pietermaritzburg, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, Res Ctr Plant Growth & Dev, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa","Little, KM (corresponding author), Inst Commercial Forestry Res, POB 100281, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",keith@icfr.unp.ac.za,,,,,,33,5,5,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0254-6299,1727-9321,,S AFR J BOT,S.

Here, we describe a system of nectarivorous bird assemblages exploiting pockets of eucalypt woodlands that differ dramatically in flowering and provision of nectar. The behavioral dominant, the Red Wattlebird (Anthochaera curunculata), aggressively reduces the occurrence and activities of other honeyeaters of the genera Lichenostomus and Melithreptus on sites of intense flowering. The latter genera predominate in moderately flowering areas, but few honeyeaters occupy poorly flowering sites. To understand such systems, in which temporal variation in habitat quality can be great, one needs to consider not only the disparity in habitat quality among locations but also the spatial extent of habitats of different quality. Isoleg analysis is a theoretical tool developed to understand how dominant and subordinate species partition habitats as a function of their respective densities. Our results suggest that isoleg analysis needs to be developed with spatial explicitness to capture variation in extent of habitats of different qualities and consequent effects on the usefulness of aggression for domination of resources.","Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Biodivers Anal Policy & Management, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Mac Nally, R (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Biodivers Anal Policy & Management, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",ralph.macnally@sci.monash.edu.au,"Mac Nally, Ralph/A-5262-2008",,,,,68,45,47,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,OCT,2005,122,4,,,,,1097,1111,,10.1642/0004-8038(2005)122[1097:RACBCT]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Ornithology,Zoology,987HO,WOS:000233509200007,,,,,2021-09-21,

We explore a number of models of interspecific interactions that lead to (sometimes abrupt) distribution limits in the presence and absence of environmental gradients. We find that gradients in competitive ability can lead to spatial segregation of competitors into distinct ranges, but that spatial movement tends to broaden the region of sympatry between the two species, and that Allee effects tend to sharpen these boundaries. We generalize these simple models to include metapopulation dynamics and other types of interactions including predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. We derive conditions for range limits in each case. We also consider models that include coevolution and gene flow and find that character displacement along environmental gradients can lead to stable parapatric distributions. We conclude that it is essential to consider coevolved species interactions as a potential mechanism limiting species distributions, particularly when barriers to dispersal are weak and environmental gradients are gradual.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Univ Texas, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Case, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",case@biomail.ucsd.edu,"Keitt, Timothy H./AAF-9787-2021","Keitt, Timothy H./0000-0002-4587-1083",,,,110,264,267,1,153,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2005,108,1,,,,,28,46,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13148.x,,,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,877OA,WOS:000225578700004,,,,,2021-09-21,

We report how annual variation in precipitation from 1999 to 2002 in the Prairie Pothole Region of Iowa, USA, affected both density and reproduction of two interspecific competitors: yellow-headed blackbirds, Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus (Bonaparte, 1826), and red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus (L., 1766). During dry years, yellow-headed blackbirds, an obligate wetland-breeding species, showed a marked reduction in density and a complete reproductive failure in which none of the nests we monitored fledged young. The reproductive failure was attributed primarily to nest predation, which was negatively correlated with water levels in wetlands. Conversely, red-winged blackbirds, a facultative wetland-breeding species, showed little variation in density and nest success. Both species exhibited similar patterns of reduced clutch size and later nest initiation dates in dry years, measures often tied to bottom-up effects of food availability and (or) age of individuals. Yet top-down effects of nest predation had a stronger influence, because lower clutch size did not result in fewer young fledged per successful nest. Incorporating how rainfall variation can affect wetland songbird demography will be critical for understanding population and community dynamics in changing environments.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Reosurce Ecol & Management, Iowa Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Fletcher, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Avian Sci Ctr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",robertjfletcherjr@yahoo.com,,"Fletcher, Robert/0000-0003-1717-5707",,,,63,28,29,1,16,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Based on precious few genetic and field observational studies, current speculation is that polyandrous mating strategies and multiple paternity may be common in sharks as they are in most other vertebrates. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining the genetic mating system of the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, using microsatellite DNA profiling of 22 litters (22 mothers, 188 embryos genotyped at four polymorphic loci) obtained from multiple locations along the west coast of Florida. Contrary to expectations based on the ability of female S. tiburo to store sperm, the social nature of this species and the 100% multiple paternity observed in two other coastal shark species, over 81% of sampled bonnethead females produced litters sired by a single male (i.e. genetic monogamy). When multiple paternity occurred in S. tiburo, there was an indication of increased incidence in larger mothers with bigger litters. Our data suggest that sharks may exhibit complex genetic mating systems with a high degree of interspecific variability, and as a result some species may be more susceptible to loss of genetic variation in the face of escalating fishing pressure. Based on these findings, we suggest that knowledge of elasmobranch mating systems should be an important component of conservation and management programmes for these heavily exploited species.","Nova SE Univ, Oceanog Ctr, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Dania, FL 33004 USA; Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, MBC, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; Mote Marine Lab, Ctr Shark Res, Elasmobranch Physiol & Environm Biol Program, Sarasota, FL 34263 USA","Shivji, MS (corresponding author), Nova SE Univ, Oceanog Ctr, Guy Harvey Res Inst, 8000 N Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA.",mahmood@nova.edu,,"Prodohl, Paulo/0000-0001-8570-9964",,,,57,64,68,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

In southern Australia, the native Polistes humilis was the predominant social wasp prior to the arrival of the exotic Vespula germanica (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). Both species forage for similar resources (water, pulp, carbohydrate and protein prey), and concerns have arisen about potential competition between them. The aim of this study was to identify the protein foods that these wasps feed on. As many prey items are masticated by these wasps to the degree that they cannot be identified using conventional means, morphological identification was complemented by sequencing fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. GenBank searches using BLAST and phylogenetic analyses were used to identify prey items to at least order level. The results were used to construct complete prey inventories for the two species. These indicate that while P. humilis is restricted to feeding on lepidopteran larvae, V. germanica collects a variety of prey of invertebrate and vertebrate origin. Calculated values of prey overlap between the two species are used to discuss the implications of V. germanica impacting on P. humilis. Results obtained are compared to those gained by solely 'conventional' methods, and the advantages of using DNA-based taxonomy in ecological studies are emphasized.","Univ Adelaide, Ctr Evolutionary Biol & Biodivers, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; Queensland Dept Primary Ind, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia; S Australian Museum, Evolutionary Biol Unit, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia","Austin, AD (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Ctr Evolutionary Biol & Biodivers, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",andy.austin@adelaide.edu.au,"Reeson, Andrew/A-1207-2011; Cooper, Steven JB/I-6291-2012","Reeson, Andrew/0000-0002-1603-2731; ",,,,69,58,61,0,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Traditionally, spatial segregation is predicted to occur when species differ in the habitat in which they are either superior at competing for resources or less susceptible to predation. However, predictions from a behavioural model demonstrate that spatial segregation and coexistence can also occur in the absence of such interspecific trade-offs in competitive ability and vulnerability to predation. Unlike other models of competitor coexistence this model predicts that when species rank both habitat productivity and 'riskinesses' similarly, but differ slightly in their habitat-specific vulnerabilities to predators, they will tend to segregate across habitats, with the species experiencing the higher ratio of mortality risk across the habitats occurring primarily in the safer habitat. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that intraspecific trade-offs between resource availability and mortality risk can lead to spatial segregation of competing species by (1) documenting the spatial (i.e. intertidal) distribution of two marine snails, Littorina sitkana and L. subrotundata and (2) performing field experiments to quantify growth and mortality rates of each species at 'low' and 'high' intertidal heights. Our results indicate that both species agree on the rankings of habitat riskiness and productivity, experiencing higher predation and higher growth in low- than in high-intertidal habitats. However, L. sitkana and L. subrotundata experienced differences in their habitat-specific mortality risks and growth rates. Despite both species being similarly at risk of predation in high-intertidal habitats (where mortality was lower), L. subrotundata was subject to significantly higher mortality than L. sitkana at the low-intertidal height. In contrast, growth rate differences between habitats were greater for L. sitkana than for L. subrotundata. Whereas both species grew at the same rate at the high-intertidal level (where growth was lower), L. sitkana individuals grew more rapidly than L. subrotundata snails at the low-intertidal level. As predicted by the behavioural model, the species that experienced the higher ratio of mortality across habitats (i.e. L. subrotundata) occurred exclusively in the safer, high-intertidal habitat. Taken together, these results provide support for the hypothesis that spatial segregation, and potentially competitor coexistence, can occur in the absence of interspecific trade-offs in resource acquisition ability or vulnerability to predation.","Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Rochette, R (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, POB 5050, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada.",rochette@unbsj.ca,,"Rochette, Remy/0000-0003-3390-8413",,,,35,5,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2004,105,3,,,,,512,524,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12367.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,821CT,WOS:000221438100007,,,,,2021-09-21,

This study examined whether mangrove recruitment differs among species with respect to the effect of forest gap size, ground disturbance, position along an intertidal gradient and canopy membership. 3 The canopy of a tropical mangrove forest in northern Australia was experimentally manipulated to create two gap sizes (50 m(2) and 225 m(2)) in low and high intertidal forests with or without sediment disturbance. Propagules of six species, from three mangrove families, were sown into treatments and their predation, establishment, growth and survival measured for 5 years. 4 All species established, and five survived, in canopy gaps in both high and low intertidal positions. Interspecific difference in establishment, growth and survival of seedlings in two intertidal positions were not closely matched to canopy membership and hence this does not explain zonation. 5 No seedlings survived under the canopy and there was little evidence for shade-tolerant species. The interactions between canopy treatments and sediment disturbance that would have indicated gap partitioning were not detected. Seedling growth and survival was enhanced in large canopy gaps but there were no growth differences among species that matched canopy membership of plots. 6 Most species appear to be able to recruit in canopy gaps if there is no dispersal limitation. Rather, the range of species available to fill gaps is limited because predation of propagules advantages species that are from the adjacent canopy. Lack of partitioning of resources within gaps by species may result in the exclusion of competitors that are not canopy members, further reducing coexistence.","Univ New England, Sch Environm Sci & Nat Resources Management, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia","Clarke, PJ (corresponding author), Univ New England, Sch Environm Sci & Nat Resources Management, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",pclarke1@metz.une.edu.au,"Clarke, Peter/D-6403-2012",,,,,33,42,44,0,23,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

The species pool is composed of the species present in the seed bank and species able to disperse into the wetland, and many abiotic and biotic factors interact to influence a species performance and abundance in the plant community. Anthropogenic activities produce specific stressors on wetland systems that alter these abiotic and biotic interactions, potentially altering species composition. We simulated three common wetland hydrogeomorphic (HGM) subclasses in a greenhouse to examine the effects of two stressors-sedimentation and nitrogen (N) enrichment-on the performance of 8 species grown in artificial communities. Species establishment, height, biomass, and foliar N and P concentrations were measured to explore species responses to stressors and competition, as well as the potential impacts of changes in species composition on ecosystem processes. Species were affected differently by sedimentation and N enrichment, and there were differences in overall community sensitivity to stressors between wetland subclasses. Sedimentation generally reduced seedling establishment, while N enrichment produced variable effects on height and biomass. Interspecific competition had little effect on establishment but significantly reduced most species biomass. Sedimentation generally lowered community biomass, diversity, and richness, while enrichment increased community biomass. Establishment, biomass, and foliar nutrient concentrations significantly differed between many species, suggesting that shifts in species composition may impact ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Phalaris arundinacea, an aggressive clonal graminoid, universally dominated all wetland subclasses. This dominance across a range of environmental conditions (sedimentation, fertility, and hydrology) has important implications for both restoration and predicting the impacts of human activities on species composition. Our results suggest that, in regions where R arundinacea is common, restoration projects that establish communities from seeds and human activities that cause vegetation removal are likely to become dominated by P. arundinacea.","Penn State Univ, Penn State Cooperat Wetlands Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Mahaney, WM (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Penn State Cooperat Wetlands Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mahaneyw@kbs.msu.edu,,,,,,67,32,34,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,,2004,175,2,,,,,227,243,,,,,17,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,889LI,WOS:000226444100007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Guilds are often comprised of members of the same family or genus, but they can span larger taxonomic categories. Predacious arthropods, such as carabid beetles, centipedes and spiders, and small carnivorous vertebrates, such as woodland salamanders, overlap extensively in microhabitat and prey types. These taxa, though unrelated, may form important guilds of forest floor predators. We examined the behavioral interactions between a carabid ground beetle (Platynus tenuicollis) and a small woodland salamander (the red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus) in laboratory encounters. These species occur syntopically and feed on similar prey. Individuals of R cinereus are territorial and,defend cover objects against conspecific and congeneric intruders. Because both species require moist conditions, it seems probable that they would compete for resources, such as cover objects and prey, as the forest floor and leaf litter dries. We posed two general hypotheses: (1) salamanders will display territorial behavior toward intruding salamanders and beetles and (2) beetles will display territorial behavior toward intruding beetles and salamanders. Residents of each species were paired with control, intra- and interspecific intruders. In both species, residency status affected behavior-residents behaving more aggressively than intruders. Resident salamanders behaved similarly toward intruding salamanders and beetles, but no biting was observed. There were no significant differences in aggressive behavior of resident beetles among treatments. When physical attacks by beetles were observed, they were brief and often escalated to biting and chasing. Platynus tenuicollis bit intruders of both species in a significant number of trials; this often resulted in the production of adhesive secretions by P. cinereus that successfully immobilized R tenuicollis. Antipredator behaviors observed in P. cinereus, and biting by P. tenuicollis of R cinereus, suggest that intraguild predation may be as important as interspecific resource competition for these species of forest floor predators.","John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Univ Hts, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",canthony@jcu.edu,,,,,,58,21,23,0,15,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,1938-4238,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

The heterospecific attraction hypothesis predicts that colonizing or migrant individuals use the presence of resident species as a cue for profitable breeding sites. In other words, increasing resident densities will result in increased migrant densities until the costs of interspecific competition override the benefits of heterospecific attraction. The experiment consisted of a reference and a manipulation year. In the reference year, resident titmice were permitted to breed at intermediate densities whilst in the manipulation year, resident densities were manipulated in nine study plots. Three treatments were performed as low, intermediate and high resident densities and migrant density responses were measured in both years. Relative between-year migrant and resident densities were analyzed by regression analysis. Migrant foliage gleaning guild densities responded linearly and positively, as did densities of habitat generalists, in particular Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs),. The ground-foraging guild did not show a response. This study provides support for predictions of the heterospecific attraction hypothesis and suggests that information on habitat quality with reference to both food availability and safe breeding sites are important in using heterospecifics as cues. Based on Chaffinch response data, artificially increased resident densities were not high enough for competitive effects between residents and migrants to decrease heterospecific attraction. It seems unlikely that in northern environments natural resident densities will reach high levels where competitive effects would occur, therefore heterospecific attraction will always be beneficial. This study again shows the importance of heterospecific attraction in migrant habitat selection and as a process promoting species diversity in northern breeding bird assemblages.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, Oulu 90014, Finland","Thomson, RL (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, Oulu 90014, Finland.",,"Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012; Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011; Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,57,88,91,2,26,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2003,134,3,,,,,431,438,,10.1007/s00442-002-1140-0,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,657BG,WOS:000181645100018,12647152,,,,2021-09-21,

Since parasite transmission is often density-dependent, group living is normally thought to lead to an increased exposure to parasitism. As a consequence, it is predicted that animals living in groups will invest more resources (energy, time, risk, etc.) in parasite defence than those living solitarily. 2. We tested this prediction by measuring basal immune parameters in the larvae of 12 species of Lepidoptera, grouped into six phylogenetically matched species-pairs, each comprising one solitary feeding and one gregariously feeding species. 3. Contrary to expectation, the solitary species in all six species-pairs had higher total haemocyte counts than the gregarious species, and in five out of six species-pairs the solitary species also exhibited higher phenoloxidase activity. Both measurements were positively correlated with each other and with the magnitude of the cellular encapsulation response. 4. The relationship between infection risk and group living was investigated with a dynamic, spatially explicit, host-pathogen model. This shows that when individuals aggregate in groups, the per capita risk of infection can be reduced if the lower between-group transmission more than compensates for the higher within-group transmission. 5. We conclude that the expectation that group living always leads to increased exposure to pathogens and parasites is overly simplistic, and that the specific details of the social system in question will determine if there is increased or decreased exposure to infection.","Univ Stirling, Inst Biol Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland","Wilson, K (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Inst Biol Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",ken.wilson@stirling.ac.uk,"Wilson, Kenneth/B-7452-2008","Wilson, Kenneth/0000-0001-5264-6522",,,,63,102,103,1,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Observed growth rate was only weakly correlated with predicted maximum growth rate based on laboratory models, and there was a significant interaction with site. A generalized linear model showed that growth rate was positively correlated with temperature, but also that growth rate decreased as the summer season progressed. This might indicate either a seasonal decline in food availability or appetite, or a change in energy allocation strategy. Growth rate decreased with increasing fish age, probably as an effect of sexual maturation of older fish, and differential allocation of protein and lipid among different size-groups of brown trout. After adjusting for variation in temperature, season, and fish mass, there was still significant among-site variation in growth rate. A significant part of this variation was due to variation in brown trout density and the presence or absence of Alpine bullhead Cottus poecilopus. Growth rate decreased with increasing brown trout density, and was lower in the presence than in the absence of Alpine bullhead after correcting for variation in brown trout density. This last result may indicate the presence of interspecific competition. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Although small size at stocking appears to be the primary factor restricting fish prey consumption and rapid growth, trophic competition may also be a contributing factor. We examined the food habits of sympatric populations of age-0 striped bass and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides over the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons to assess temporal and length-related patterns and similarities in trophic resource use. With increasing predator length, food habits for both species shifted from zooplankton to insect and then to fish as the principal prey items over both growing seasons. Except for fish smaller than 50 mm during June and July 1994, diet overlap was insufficient (Schoener's index value <0.60) to suggest trophic competition. Striped bass between 50 and 100 mm long primarily ate aquatic insects and cyprinids, whereas largemouth bass in the same length range ate aquatic and terrestrial insects. Cyprinids were the principal fish prey of striped bass less than 100 mm long, with age-0 alewives Alosa pseudoharengus becoming the predominant prey for larger individuals. Darters and age-0 sunfishes constituted the primary fish prey of largemouth bass regardless of body length. Although temporal and length-related segregation by food habitats may be sufficient to minimize trophic overlap, limitations in these resources may cause interspecific competition, especially for smaller individuals. We recommend releasing striped bass at a larger size (>50 mm) and earlier in the growing season to minimize the potential for trophic competition with age-0 largemouth bass immediately after stocking.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Sutton, TM (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 1159 Forestry Bldg, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,"Sutton, Trent/E-9281-2010",,,,,43,9,10,0,5,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0275-5947,,,N AM J FISH MANAGE,North Am.

Selection patterns varied between species, but were largely replicable between sample dates and resembled dietary patterns found in similar studies from neighboring regions. Ambush-foraging medusae (Aglantha digitale, Sarsia tubulosa, and Proboscidactyla flavicirrata) fed primarily on crustacean and ciliated prey but the dietary niches of these hydromedusan species centered on different fractions of the available plankton. Consequently. little dietary overlap occurred between the ambush foraging hydromedusae. In contrast, the dietary niches of cruising predators (Aequoroa victoria, Mitrocoma cellularia, and Phialidium gregarium) overlapped substantially because those species all fed on similar soft-bodied prey such as eggs and appendicularians. These results have two important implications for trophic patterns involving medusae. First, different mechanisms of prey eucounter and capture used by hydromedusae (ambush vs. cruising patterns) result in important interspecific dietary differences and, hence. trophic roles of the medusae. Second, whereas cruising, medusae may consume similar prey and hence form a feeding guild, ambush-foraging medusae may experience substantially less prey overlap and. for the community examined here, do not experience potentially strong feeding competition from other medusan species.","Providence Coll, Dept Biol, Providence, RI 02918 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA","Costello, JH (corresponding author), Providence Coll, Dept Biol, Providence, RI 02918 USA.",,,"Colin, Sean/0000-0003-4463-5588",,,,36,60,64,2,15,AMER SOC LIMNOLOGY OCEANOGRAPHY,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710-4446 USA",0024-3590,,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

A primary goal of such studies often is to elucidate evolutionary stable strategies based on steady-state dynamics of population growth. In contrast, we developed a simulation model to explore short-term movements of interspecific competitors among fine-grained habitats of differing attributes, as might result from field manipulations of habitat quality or population densities. In this model, habitat quality is expressed in terms of mean individual fitness, represented by average per capita growth rate calculated according to the Lotka-Volterra equations describing interspecific competition. This model provides a mechanism for quantifying the effects of habitat quality, patterns of resource use and competition on distributions of individuals. Results demonstrate the heuristic value of this model in corroborating predictions derived from the ideal free distribution and isodar theory, and in generating isolegs to test the predictions of isoleg theory. Results indicate that small changes in model parameters have substantial impacts on patterns of habitat use and co-occurrence between species. The model identifies a variety of conditions under which isolegs for a given type of community organization deviate from predictions of contemporary isoleg theory, potentially expanding the universe of possible interspecific behaviors underlying the development of evolutionary stable strategies.","Univ Texas, Sch Biol Sci, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Toledo, Dept Earth Ecol & Environm Sci, Toledo, OH 43606 USA","Guthrie, CG (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Sch Biol Sci, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",cguthrie@mail.utexas.edu,,,,,,26,16,17,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2002,97,2,,,,,184,194,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970204.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,570VF,WOS:000176678800004,,,,,2021-09-21,

The generation times of 13 isolates of L. innocua and L. monocytogenes were determined in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) and a variety of enrichment media. No significant differences were found in growth characteristics between either species in the various media, suggesting that the growth advantage of L. innocua in enrichment media was not as significant as previously described. Kinetic analysis of mixed cultures of L. monocytogenes and isolates of L. innocua producing a variety of inhibitory activities demonstrated the possibility of an inhibitory interaction between these two species resulting in the overgrowth of the enrichment culture with L. innocua. Modelling the evolution of the ratio between two populations in an enrichment process was used to analyze the impact of a selective growth advantage in L. innocua in an enrichment process for growth of L. monocytogenes. These findings support the widely held view that an overgrowth of L. innocua in the enrichment process can result from both a selective growth advantage as well as the production of inhibitory compounds.

This species is very successful in displacing native ants, but the proximal mechanisms of this success have not been fully investigated. We conducted field experiments to verify if W. auropunctata workers use repellent compounds on soybean oil baits. We compared the recruitment behavior of native ant species at treatment baits (which were exploited by W. auropunctata) and at control baits (non-exploited) after 30 and 60 minutes. The verification of the two categories of baits at the end of the two periods (30' and 60') revealed that the number of baits occupied and the number of native ant foragers present were not significantly different. These results imply that workers of W. auropunctata did not deposit repellent compounds on exploited food sources, thus indicating the predominance of direct interactions in the success of W. auropunctata to displace native ants populations.","Ctr IRD Noumea, Lab Zool Appl, Noumea 98948, New Caledonia; Univ Toulouse 3, UMR CNRS 5552, Lab Ecol Terrestre, F-31062 Toulouse, France","Le Breton, J (corresponding author), Ctr IRD Noumea, Lab Zool Appl, BP A5, Noumea 98948, New Caledonia.",lebreton@noumea.ird.nc; dejean@cict.fr,,"Dejean, Alain/0000-0002-3561-2248",,,,10,5,5,0,2,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIV,CHICO,"DEPT BIOL SCI, CHICO, CA 95929 USA",0361-6525,,,SOCIOBIOLOGY,Sociobiology,,2002,40,2,,,,,437,442,,,,,6,Entomology,Entomology,572WU,WOS:000176798600019,,,,,2021-09-21,

Of the eight helminth species, only four were common enough to be included in the analyses: Pomphorhynchus laevis, Acanthocephalus anguillae, Echinorhynchus truttae and Cyathocephalus truncates. The observed frequencies of co-occurrences of the different species, based on presence/absence data, did not differ from those predicted by a null model derived from prevalence data. However, the intensity of infection (number of individuals per fish) of different helminth species were generally, but not always significantly, negatively correlated in tests of pairwise associations. Variation in fish sizes and its effect on infection levels, and whether or not two helminth species used the same or different intermediate hosts, had no influence on these findings. Of the few significant negative associations found between pairs of helminth species, none was found in more than one fish population. This suggests that interspecific associations may be condition-dependent: even in apparently similar localities, the same combinations of helminth species show different associations. Without evidence of replicability, it is almost impossible to conclude to the consistent role of competition between any pair of helminth species in the field.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Biol, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy","Poulin, R (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",robert.poulin@stonebow.otago.ac.nz,"Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008; Giari, Luisa/F-5909-2015; Sayyaf Dezfuli, Bahram/G-4184-2015","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Giari, Luisa/0000-0003-1058-0910; Sayyaf Dezfuli, Bahram/0000-0002-9778-5937",,,,29,36,39,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0022-149X,,,J HELMINTHOL,J.

We showed that the intensity of parasite infection was positively related to intraspecific aggregation only for the more abundant species. No relationship was found between intensity of parasite infection and niche size when correcting for total parasite intensity. This may suggest that when parasite intensities are low, intraspecific competition may not have a strong effect on parasites. Conversely, when looking at the evolution of niche size and intraspecific aggregation for each species separately, intraspecific aggregation decreased for the most abundant species (D. crucifer) suggesting that this species is more competitive than others when total parasite intensity increases. When considering interspecific aggregation, Dacylogyrus species were found to be positively and negatively aggregated, Following the prediction of morphological and ecological similarity for congeneric species, Dactylogyrus species similar in morphometry of attachment parts tend to be more positively aggregated among their gill microhabitats than Dactylogyrus species with morphometric differences in attachment parts.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool & Ecol, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; Comenius Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Bratislava 84215, Slovakia; Univ Perpignan, CNRS, UMR 5555, Ctr Biol & Ecol Trop & Mediterraneenne, F-66860 Perpignan, France","Simkova, A (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool & Ecol, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic.",simkova@sci.muni.cz,"Simkova, Andrea/F-7636-2019; sasal, pierre/U-2670-2019","Simkova, Andrea/0000-0002-5995-6766; ",,,,48,18,20,2,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,DEC,2001,123,,6,,,,599,607,,10.1017/S0031182001008782,,,9,Parasitology,Parasitology,518NP,WOS:000173675000008,11814047,,,,2021-09-21,

Empirical exploration of a wide range of spatial and temporal plant arrangements is costly and time-consuming. Modelling the growth of mixed crops is a tool which, combined with empirical tests, can greatly reduce the time and investment required for this task. Spatially explicit, individual-based dynamic models seem well suited for this purpose; their exploration and experimental validation for the case of simple, two-species, artificial plant communities, can also provide further insight as to how the spatial and temporal scales of a plant's multispecific neighbourhood affect its growth and performance. The aim of this investigation was to further develop a published spatially explicit individual-based mixed crop growth model [Vandermeer, J. H. (1989). The Ecology of intercopping, Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, p. 237], and to validate it experimentally With this purpose in mind: (1) computer programs to simulate individual plant growth and to perform statistical analysis of both deterministic and stochastic versions of the model were developed; (2) the model was parametrized using a complex experimental diculture with several cohorts and spatial arrangements; (3) the predictive capacity of the model was tested using independent spatio-temporal experimental arrangements; (4) a modified version of the model was written, which abandons the assumption of linearity of the neighbourhood index at the cost of increasing the number of parameters; (5) The performance of stochastic versions of both Vandermeer's and our modified model were compared, employing a non-parametric measure of goodness of fit. We conclude that this approach to modelling plant growth subject to intra and interspecific competition is a remarkably efficient, general, conceptually elegant, heuristic tool whose predictive power can be further improved when nonlinear terms are introduced into the neighbourhood competition index, as done in our modified version of Vandermeer's model.

The prediction that competitive exclusion occurs rarely, if at all, in established communities seems to hold for many types of bryophyte vegetation, but the drastic effects on local diversity of some invading exotic species suggests, that this may be partly due to the ghost of competition past. In a survey of bryophyte communities on earth banks, variation in species number per stand was rather larger than predicted by the species-pool hypothesis. Large differences in accessibility of the stands may have played an important role in this respect. Small-scale repeated chartings and permanent grid studies suggest, that competitive exclusion hardly ever occurs in a range of terrestrial bryophyte communities. Evidence for interspecific competition (as derived from small-scale association between behaviour - increase or decrease in grid cells - of species pairs) was equally rare, but this may have been due to interaction with positively density-dependent facilitation effects. However, a rigorous proof of the hypothesis that facilitation may prevent competitive exclusion is still lacking.","Univ Utrecht, Dept Plant Ecol, FAFC, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","During, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Plant Ecol, FAFC, Went Bldg,POB 80084, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Lloret, Francisco/M-7754-2019; Lloret, Francisco/H-2711-2015","Lloret, Francisco/0000-0002-9836-4069",,,,38,11,12,2,12,ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBLIC INST BOTANY,PRAGUE,"PRUHONICE NEAR PRAHA, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",0015-5551,,,FOLIA GEOBOT,Folia Geobot.,,2001,36,1,,,,,63,70,,10.1007/BF02803139,,,8,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,434QX,WOS:000168828300008,,,,,2021-09-21,

Three out of the nine individual European minks studied were specialists on frogs (mainly common frog Rana temporaria). The majority (77-97%) of their seats contained frog remains, and frogs constituted 62-88% of food biomass consumed. One European mink fed mostly on crayfish (Astacus astacus); 62% of its seats contained crayfish remains, and crayfish constituted about 61% of the food biomass consumed. The other five European minks studied were generalist predators at watersides. Three out of the ten individual American minks studied were micromammalian specialists; 86-92% of their seats contained remains of small mammals (mostly water vole Arvicola terrestris and microtines), and small mammals constituted 83-88% of food biomass consumed. The other seven American minks were generalist predators. No correlation was found between the proportion of small mammals in the diets (expressed in percentage of food biomass consumed) and their abundance in the habitats. Hence, those American minks mostly feeding on small mammals demonstrated an individual feeding specificity. In contrast, the proportions of crayfish and frogs in the diets of individual American minks was positively correlated with the abundance of these alternative prey in the habitats. This suggests an opportunistic feature in consuming of crayfish and frogs by the naturalized mink. For the European mink there was a positive correlation between the proportion of frogs and crayfish in the individual diets and the abundance of these prey in the habitats, but there was no such correlation with abundance of small mammals. The results suggest that the native mink is reluctant to prey small mammals and its opportunistic feature of feeding on crayfish and frogs. Interspecific and intraspecific food niche overlaps in minks at an individual level was estimated. Fairly large variation of the dietary similarity between the individual minks was revealed. Resource competition between the European mink and the naturalized American mink on population and individual levels is discussed.","Natl Acad Sci Byelarus, Inst Zool, Vertebrate Predat Res Unit, Minsk 220072, BELARUS; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Inst Terr Ecol, Banchory AB31 4BY, Kincardine, Scotland","Sidorovich, VE (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Byelarus, Inst Zool, Vertebrate Predat Res Unit, Adakemicheskaya Str 27, Minsk 220072, BELARUS.",vadimsid@mustbel.open.by; david.macdonald@zoo.ox.ac.uk; hkruuk@gellan.u-net.com,,,,,,38,36,39,0,33,INST VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY AS CR,BRNO,"KVETNA 8, BRNO 603 65, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-7893,1573-1189,,FOLIA ZOOL,Folia Zool.,,2001,50,1,,,,,27,42,,,,,16,Zoology,Zoology,422BU,WOS:000168098700003,,,,,2021-09-21,

One consequence of the overwhelming evidence for competition in ant communities is that the role of such top-down processes as predation and parasitism has been ignored. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the composition and dynamics of ant communities are influenced by highly specialized parasitoids that mediate the outcome of competition among ant species. Here I review this evidence and develop a general framework for integrating the roles of competition and parasitism in the assembly of ant communities. I then use invasions by the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis wagneri) and the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) to show how this new Framework can be used to develop testable hypotheses regarding the ecological success (or failure) of invasive ant species.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Feener, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",feener@biologyu.utah.edu,,,,,,86,80,82,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2000,90,1,,,,,79,88,,,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,341ML,WOS:000088594100008,,,,,2021-09-21,

The short time required to hatch and develop from egg to adult, usually in temporary pools, suggests a strategy which allows for exploitation of transient pools, thus evading predation and interspecific competition. Under these conditions intra specific competition could represent a major density-dependent source of larval mortality, but the relative importance of density-dependent regulation of mosquito populations has generated controversy. Therefore we examined the effects of larval density on basic population characteristics of Ae. albifasciatus in the laboratory. Larvae were obtained by synchronous hatching of eggs laid by field-trapped females. Emerging larvae (L1) were used to build cohorts of different initial densities, kept in plastic trays with 400 ml of distilled water, and food supplied daily during the first 10 days (0.1 g per larvae day(-)1). Age-specific development time and specific and relative mortality were estimated, and their relation to initial larval density was assessed through linear and non-linear regressions and correlation analysis. First hatching was registered 3 h after flooding the eggs. Higher levels of pre-adult mortality were detected in groups with higher densities. Specific mortality and average time to enter a stage of L1 to L3 could directly be related to initial larval density, but no significant relations were found for L4 and pupae. Results suggest that crowding could be a factor capable of regulating the density of natural populations of Ae. albifasciatus.","Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, Mendoza & Entre Rios, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina","Gleiser, RM (corresponding author), Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Transferencia Tecnol, Mendoza & Entre Rios, RA-5301 Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina.",,"Gorla, David/AAX-3360-2020","Gorla, David/0000-0002-9323-9365",,,,17,22,25,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

There was little spatial overlap between the terrestrial species, Plethodon cinereus and P. glutinosus, and the largest two semiaquatic species, Desmognathus monticola and D. fuscus. Terrestrial species occupied retreats that were considerably drier than those of semiaquatic species, but they selected larger cover objects. Body size appeared to influence microhabitat use as well. Among both the terrestrial and the semiaquatic salamanders, large species used wider cover objects, deeper retreats, and occupied cooler retreat sites than smaller species. Among the semiaquatic salamanders, larger species were found closer to water than smaller species. Rehydration rates paralleled habitat rise. Species found farther from water on searches of transects rehydrated faster than species inhabiting wetter habitats closer to H-ater. Salamanders were found significantly farther from water on transects where the large aquatic salamander Desmognathus quadramaculatus was present than on transects where it was absent. The findings of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that species distributions along environmental gradients are frequently determined by opposing gradients in the influence of limiting environmental factors and the influence of dominant competitors and predators.","Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Grover, MC (corresponding author), Feather River Coll, 570 Golden Eagle Ave, Quincy, CA 95971 USA.",MGrover@frcc.cc.ca.us,,,,,,59,51,54,0,19,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 1,2000,,1,,,,,156,168,,10.1643/0045-8511(2000)2000[0156:DOSDAM]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Zoology,Zoology,281XN,WOS:000085186900015,,,,,2021-09-21,

In this study, we analyzed some aspects of the early Life history of the stone crab, focusing especially on (1) recruitment patterns among habitats and between years in intertidal zones, (2) habitat preferences, including some intra- and interspecific interactions that may affect habitat use, and (3) intraspecific interactions that may affect survival. We also evaluated the percent cover of suitable habitats for juvenile stone crabs in a MPA and a MEA. Sheltered habitats showed higher densities of juvenile H, plana than exposed areas, and sand with boulders showed the highest crab densities, followed by shell hash with boulders. Differences in mean densities were detected for all benthic stages among sheltered substrates, except for megalopae. Bare substrates (without boulders) showed the lowest density. Throughout the settlement period, abundance of smaller instars (<J2) was 3 times higher in 1995 than in 1996, while densities of >J4 were twice as high in 1996 than in 1995. Neither intra- nor interspecific space competition seems to explain the distribution of juvenile stone crabs in the field. However, cannibalism among juveniles may have an important effect on survival. Cannibalism among juveniles is density-dependent, and may have greater effects as the abundance of larger conspecifics increases since mutual interference does not affect proportional prey mortality per predator. We suggest that losses are high in low quality habitats (probably through emigration, predation or habitat disturbance due to wave impact), and cannibalism is an important source of mortality in high quality habitats (where crab density is high). Although substrate type and post-settlement processes can help explain the distribution of juvenile stone crabs, wave action seems to be the major determinant of juvenile distribution. Neither sheltered habitats nor the most suitable substrate are common in the MPA and MEA studied. These factors are not currently being considered in the assignation of MEAs or planning of MPAs, although they could explain the lack of effect of both protection strategies in increasing the abundance of the stone crabs in Chile in comparison to other exploited benthic species.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile","Fernandez, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Estac Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",mfernand@genes.bio.puc.cl,,,,,,41,20,20,1,20,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

These results support the prediction of differential habitat preferences as a model of community organisation at the low density period, while they are consistent with shared habitat preferences during autumn and winter when both species apparently coexist in the better habitat (border). Akodon azarae showed intraspecific density-dependent habitat selection throughout the year, except in spring, while habitat selection by C. laucha was density-dependent in spring, autumn and winter. The effect of interspecific density on habitat selection was detected in both habitats and changed seasonally. The effect of A. azarae over C. laucha by resources exploitation was detected in borders, while competitive effects of C. laucha over A. azarae was observed within cropfields. Both species were more affected by exploitation competition than interference, which was more common in borders than in maize fields. We conclude that seasonally have a profound effect in habitat selection of these species because it changes the intensity of intra and interspecific competition and affects different habitat preferences and basic suitability of habitats.","Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ciencias Biol, Ciudad Univ,Pab 2,4 Piso,C1428EHA, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biol, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Hodara, K (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ciencias Biol, Ciudad Univ,Pab 2,4 Piso,C1428EHA, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",khodara@bg.fcen.uba.ar,,,,,,61,24,27,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Relationships between taxonomic richness and P-BF and SPECQ(BF) were strongly curvilinear, such that richness was low in both stable and highly unstable streams, and in streams of both low and high SPECQ(BF). Richness was highest in streams with moderate P-BF and SPECQ(BF). Interspecific competition may have reduced species richness at stable sites. In contrast, only a few bryophyte taxa were able to grow at unstable sites. Low richness at sites with a low SPECQ(BF) most likely reflects the intolerance of some species to desiccation. Low richness at sites with high SPECQ(BF) may reflect differences in the resistance of different taxa to high discharges. Community composition (expressed as ordination scores), and presence/absence of individual bryophyte species and life forms also differed among streams of different P-BF and SPECQ(BF). Thalloid or weft liverworts were common in streams with low P-BF and high SPECQ(BF) whereas cushion-forming mosses were common in streams of high P-BF and low SPECQ(BF).

A possible cause is competition with, and predation by, coyotes (Canis latrans). We investigated the level of spatial, temporal, and dietary resource use overlap between swift foxes and coyotes at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in southeastern Colorado. We captured and radio-tracked 73 foxes and 24 coyotes from April 1997 to August 1998. We collected 10 832 and 5350 locations of foxes and coyotes, respectively. Overall, home-range sizes of foxes and coyotes were 7.6 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SE) and 19.8 +/- 1.9 km(2), respectively. A high degree of interspecies spatial overlap was apparent, with fox home ranges being overlapped by coyote home ranges by as much as 100% and coyote sign (tracks and scats) being evident in all swift fox home ranges. There was no evidence of temporal avoidance of coyotes in fox movement patterns. Coyotes traveled significantly farther than foxes during diurnal hours; foxes spent the majority of diurnal hours in or on top of dens. Coyotes and foxes showed a high index of overlap for dietary resources, although some dietary partitioning was apparent. Swift foxes specialized in small prey, such as insects and rodents, while coyotes used greater proportions of large prey, such as lagomorphs and ungulates. Interference competition was evident, with 48% (12/25) of fox mortalities identified as confirmed or probable coyote-caused deaths. In each case, death occurred outside either the fox's home range or the 85% isopleth of that range, indicating that coyotes are more likely to attack a fox successfully when it is a substantial distance from a den. We propose that swift foxes are able to coexist with coyotes, owing to year-round den use and a degree of dietary partitioning.","Utah State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Gese, EM (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",egese@cc.usu.edu,"Gese, Eric M/B-4578-2011",,,,,63,122,125,1,63,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Treehoppers infested plane at the border of the cerrado almost euclusively and preferably fed near the apical meristem. During the reproductive phase of the host plant, however, the vast majority of the treehoppers aggregated on the inflorescences. We found 21 ant species harvesting honeydew at G. xiphias aggregations, the most frequent being Camponotus rufipes, Ectatomma edentatum, C. crassus, and C. renggeri. Such a taxonomic diversity of ants tending G. xiphias aggregations in the cerrado is far greater than that reported for any other ant-homopteran system. Daily turnover of ant species at a given treehopper aggregation was observed on 29 percent (64 out of 222) of the G. xiphias aggregations recorded on D. vinosum shrubs. Species replacements probably reflect distinct humidity and temperature ranges tolerated by the species, and may ultimately reduce interspecific competition at homopteran aggregations. Since predation and parasitism on G. xiphias can be severe, and tending: ants protect the homopterans against predators and parasitoids, the round-the-clock activity by ants at G. xiphias aggregations is regarded as crucial for the survival of these treehoppers in the cerrado.","Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Zool, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; Univ Fed Uberlandia, Dept Biociencias, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil","Oliveira, PS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Zool, CP 6109, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",,"Del-Claro, Kleber/N-3700-2019; Del-Claro, K/C-5570-2013; Oliveira, Paulo S/E-1910-2013","Del-Claro, K/0000-0001-8886-9568; ",,,,59,96,106,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0006-3606,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,MAR,1999,31,1,,,,,135,144,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00124.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,185MK,WOS:000079672600013,,,,,2021-09-21,

We review stream habitat selection studies and relate results to variable and interacting abiotic and biotic factors. The importance of spatial and temporal scales an often overlooked. Different physical variables may influence fish position choice at different spatial scales. Temporally variable water flows and temperatures are pervasive environmental factors in streams that affect behavior and habitat selection. The more frequently measured abiotic variables are water depth, water velocity (or stream gradient), substrate particle size, and cover. Summer daytime, feeding habitats of Atlantic salmon are size structured. Larger parr (greater-than 7 cm) have a wider spatial niche than small parr. Selected snout water velocities are consistently low (3-25 cm.s(-1)). Mean (or surface) water velocities are in the preferred range of 3050 cm.s(-1), and usually in combination with coarse substratum (16-256 mm). However, salmon parr demonstrate flexibility with respect to preferred water velocity, depending on fish size, intra- and interspecific competition, and predation risk. Water depth is less important, except in small streams. In large rivers and lakes a variety of water depths are used by salmon parr. Summer daytime, feeding habitat of brown trout is also characterized by a narrow selection of low snout water velocities. Habitat use is size-structured, which appears to be mainly a result of intraspecific competition. The small trout parr (less-than 7 cm) are abundant in the shallow swift stream areas (less-than 20-30 cm depths, 10-50 cm.s(-1) water velocities) with cobble substrates. The larger trout have increasingly strong preferences for deep-slow stream areas, in particular pools. Water depth is considered the most important habitat variable for brown trout. Spatial niche overlap is considerable where the two species are sympatric, although young Atlantic salmon tend to be distributed more in the faster flowing and shallow habitats compared with trout. Habitat use by salmon is restricted through interspecific competition with the more aggressive brown trout (interactive segregation). However, subtle innate differences in behavior at an early stage also indicate selective segregation. Seasonal changes in habitat use related to water temperatures occur in both species. In winter, they have a stronger preference for cover and shelter, and may seek shelter in the streambed and/or deeper water. At low temperatures (higher latitudes), there are also marked shifts in habitat use during day and night as the fish become nocturnal. Passive sheltering in the substrate or aggregating in deep-slow stream areas is the typical daytime behavior. While active at night, the fish move to more exposed holding positions primarily on but also above the substrate. Diurnal changes in habitat use take place also in summer; brown trout may utilize a wider spatial niche at night with more fish occupying the shallow-slow stream areas. Brown trout and young Atlantic salmon also exhibit a flexible response to variability in streamflows, wherein habitat selection may change considerably. Important topics in need of further research include: influence of spatial measurement scale, effects of temporal and spatial variability in habitat conditions on habitat selection, effects of interactive competition and trophic interactions (predation risk) on habitat selection, influence of extreme natural events on habitat selection use or suitability (floods, ice formation and jams, droughts), and individual variation in habitat use or behavior.","Telemark Coll, Dept Environm Sci, N-3800 Bo I Telemark, Norway; INRA, Ctr Rech, Aquat Ecol Lab, Rennes, France; Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, Fredericton, NB E3B 6E1, Canada; Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, Fredericton, NB E3B 6E1, Canada","Heggenes, J (corresponding author), Telemark Coll, Dept Environm Sci, POB 14, N-3800 Bo I Telemark, Norway.",,,,,,,209,174,177,2,103,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0906-6691,,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

This condition is commonly believed to be associated with the morphology or behavioral ecology of avian predators, and numerous theoretical explanations have been presented to account for its evolution. Most tests of these ideas have been theoretical or based on comparative analyses. We present tests of specific hypotheses of RSD based on field studies of Great Skuas (Catharacta skua) and Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) breeding in Shetland. We also present a comparative analysis of foraging behavior and degree of RSD within the Stercorariinae. We found no support for the popular theories that claim that RSD evolved as a result of specialized roles during breeding. Large females were not more fecund, nor were they the main defenders of the nest. Male body size was not correlated with any breeding parameter. In addition, interspecific comparisons did not support the idea that the degree of RSD is related to foraging behavior during the breeding season (as opposed to morphology). Female dominance within pairs did not affect any breeding parameters. Support was found for theories that RSD is linked to sexual selection. Large females had an advantage when pairing with older males, which could be a result of intrasexual competition for mates. There was assortative mating for size, indicating that small males could also have an advantage in pairing, because large males seem to be rejected by small females. Given the disparate results of several previous studies, we conclude that a large body of empirical evidence will be needed before we can draw firm conclusions about the main selective factors that act to maintain current levels of RSD in natural populations of raptorial birds.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Appl Ornithol Unit, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Phillips, RA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Appl Ornithol Unit, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",r.a.phillips@durham.ac.uk,"Catry, Paulo/I-5408-2013","Catry, Paulo/0000-0003-3000-0522",,,,50,38,39,0,18,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,,,AUK,AUK,JAN,1999,116,1,,,,,158,168,,10.2307/4089462,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,160RJ,WOS:000078244500015,,,,,2021-09-21,

Here I describe the interactions of four species of tropical hummingbird which defended the same territory at different stages in the flowering period and at different times of the day. The pattern of territory defence was greatly influenced by the dominance hierarchy between species and the costs and benefits of territory ownership. I used a simple economic model to calculate the predicted territory size based on four potential strategies, Hummingbirds appeared to be defending territories of the smallest economical size, agreeing with two hypotheses: (1) that hummingbirds minimize the cost of territory ownership and (2) that hummingbirds maximize the time spent sitting, The model predicted accurately the observed pattern of territory acquisition; hummingbirds initiated defence as soon as the territory contained sufficient resources and were either displaced by a larger species or replaced by a smaller one as the value of the territory changed.","Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Cotton, PA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",,,"Cotton, Peter/0000-0002-4830-0868",,,,39,38,38,1,26,BRITISH ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,TRING,"C/O NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, SUB-DEPT ORNITHOLOGY, TRING, HERTS, ENGLAND HP23 6AP",0019-1019,,,IBIS,Ibis,OCT,1998,140,4,,,,,647,653,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.1998.tb04710.x,,,7,Ornithology,Zoology,126RR,WOS:000076307500011,,,,,2021-09-21,

The ecosystem was dominated by a dinoflagellate, Ceratium hirundinella, two filter-feeding cladocerans, Daphnia rosea and Ceriodaphnia reticulata, and an invertebrate predator, the dipteran Chaoborus flavicans. The midsummer zooplankton community showed a large change in species composition (the Daphnia population crashed) when a heavy Ceratium bloom occurred. It is shown that (i) the rapid density decline of D.rosea in mid-May was mainly caused by a shortage of edible phytoplankton, which was facilitated by the rapid increase in C.hirundinella abundance; (ii) the low density of D.rosea in June-July was considered to be mainly caused by the blooming of Ceratium hirundinella (which may inhibit the feeding process of D.rosea), while predation by C.flavicans larvae, the changing temperature, the interspecific competition and the scarcity of edible algae were not judged to be important; (iii) the high summer biomass of the planktonic C.flavicans larvae was maintained by the bloom of C.hirundinella, because >90% of the crop contents of C.flavicans larvae were C.hirundinella during this period. The present study indicates that the large-sized cells or colonies of phytoplankton are not only inedible by most cladocerans, but the selective effect of the blooming of these algae can also influence the composition and dominance of the zooplankton community, especially for the filter-feeding Cladocera, in a similar way as the selective predation by planktivorous fish. The large-sized phytoplankton can also be an important alternative food for ominivorous invertebrate predators such as Chaoborus larvae, and thus may affect the interactions between these predators and their zooplanktonic prey. In this way, such phytoplankton may play a very important role in regulating the dynamics of the aquatic food web, and become a driving force in shaping the community structure of zooplankton.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; Univ Tsukuba, Inst Biol Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan","Xie, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",,"Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020",,,,,39,12,15,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

These systems exhibit considerable regional variability in percentage cover and in the strength of interspecific interactions, which may be due largely to effects of varying larval supply. In Oregon and Washington, experimental studies of space allocation among sessile invertebrates have emphasized the role of benthic processes such as competition and predation. In contrast, studies in central California have emphasized the importance of larval supply. In this article, we identify a gradient in per centage cover in the middle and upper intertidal zone that is consistent with an oceanographically based explanation for these differences: percentage cover of mussels and barnacles is much higher in Oregon, where nearshore circulation promotes high recruitment, than in California, where strong offshore currents inhibit recruitment. A mathematical model incorporating larval transport and interspecific competition for space offers an explanation for the one violation of the hypothesis-higher percentage cover of Chthamalus spp. in California. The findings illustrate that attempts to synthesize regional differences in community structure and dynamics can benefit from considering both the benthic adult and pelagic larval environments.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Connolly, SR (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Connolly, Sean R./E-7773-2011","Connolly, Sean R./0000-0003-1537-0859",,,,59,157,159,0,35,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5801 S ELLIS AVENUE, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

The model takes into account the simultaneous effects of spatial and temporal distribution of females, female group size, male-male competition, female choice, and the operational sex ratio (i.e., the proportion of estrous females). The model predicts that higher numbers of females per group increases the average exploitation time of such groups by males. An increase in female group density, operational sex ratio, and age-specific fighting success of males are predicted to reduce the average exploitation time of female groups, leading to roving of males (i.e., moving between female groups). In contrast, an increase in the female rejection rate of males and in the time spent by males on nonmating activities (i.e., foraging, lying down, ruminating, migrating) are predicted to increase the average exploitation time of female groups and to favor staying behavior of males (i.e., defending a female group over a longer period of time). Consequently, the model predicts that young males will tend to be stayers, whereas middle-aged and old males are expected to be rovers. Model predictions were tested with field data collected on muskoxen Ovibos moschatus in a natural population in west Greenland. Observed correlations between bull exploitation times of cow groups and the six above-mentioned social and environmental parameters were all in the predicted direction and statistically significant in five of the six cases. Overall, 69% of the observed variation in exploitation time of cow groups by males was explained by the model predictions. Stepwise regression suggested that, of the six parameters, variation in sex ratio (R-2 = .56) and time spent on nonmating activities (R-2 = .35) had the largest effects on male exploitation time. Also, the observed age-specific variation in bull exploitation time of cow groups was as predicted.","Univ Aarhus, Dept Ecol & Genet, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Forchhammer, MC (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, POB 1050, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",,"Forchhammer, Mads/I-7474-2013; Boomsma, Jacobus J/M-2785-2014","Boomsma, Jacobus J/0000-0002-3598-1609",,,,58,16,16,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

We chose Oecophylla longinoda, the best known dominant species and two other Formicinae accepted on its territories: Polyrhachis laboriosa, a sub-dominant species: and P. weissi, a non-dominant species. We experimented in nature and on colonies reared on shrubs cultivated in planters. During dyadic encounters, foragers of the three species generally ignored each other. Aggressive interactions were rare and limited to intimidating postures such as opening the mandibles and raising the gaster. However, the need for protein leads arboreal ants sharing territories to prey robbing. The expected dominance hierarchy did not hold true at all levels as both O. longinoda and P. weissi rob prey from P. laboriosa. Also, foragers of P. weissi were able to follow the recruitment trails of P. laboriosa. As a result, predatory behavior is broken down into two tasks in the latter species: workers carving the prey that tolerate the presence of interspecific intruders, and other workers acting as guards. P. laboriosa guards limit the activity of the competitors thanks to allomones released during marking rounds, by drumming the gaster on the substrate, and through dissuasive postures such as opening the mandibles, raising the gaster, bending the gaster and an outstretched posture described here for the first time. We concluded that a code containing chemical and behavioral information working at the interspecific level enables ants sharing territories in the arboreal ant mosaic to defuse potentially volatile situations without the loss of individuals. These behaviors can be compared to true ritualized displays (i.e. intraspecific), and work here at the interspecific level, implying a co-evolutionary process as selective pressure.","Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, Lab Ethol & Pharmacol Comportement, F-37200 Tours, France; Univ Paris 13, CNRS, UPRESA 7025, Lab Ethol Expt & Comparee, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France","Mercier, JL (corresponding author), Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, Lab Ethol & Pharmacol Comportement, Parc Grandmont, F-37200 Tours, France.",,,"Dejean, Alain/0000-0002-3561-2248",,,,26,14,14,0,9,UNIV ESTADUAL FEIRA SANTANA,FEIRA DE SANTANA,"AV TRANSORDESTINA S N NOVO HORIZONTE, FEIRA DE SANTANA, BAHAI CEP44036-900, BRAZIL",0361-6525,,,SOCIOBIOLOGY,Sociobiology,,1998,32,1,,,,,139,150,,,,,12,Entomology,Entomology,ZW865,WOS:000074456100012,,,,,2021-09-21,

The length of the planktonic larval period varies both intra-and interspecifically, and it is unknown how the age and size of larvae may affect their selection of habitat. To investigate the influence of age and size on habitat selection, I collected newly settled Hawaiian domino damselfish, Dascyllus albisella, daily from grids containing three coral species at four locations in Kaneohe Bay Oahu, Hawaii. I recorded the coral species each fish was collected on, and measured and aged (by otoliths) the collected fish. The results indicate that the coral Pocillopora meandrina was selected by settling fish significantly more than the other two coral species. Younger and smaller larvae selected this coral species more frequently than older/larger larvae. In addition, younger/smaller individuals were found more commonly inside the bay than older/larger settling larvae.

Three main strategies were assessed, firstly that competition between species may be reduced by the presence of selective predators, secondly, that coexistence is maintained by periodic disturbance which reduces competition effects, and thirdly that interspecific competition is negated by segregation of either life histories or feeding strategies, and diet or microhabitat preferences. The first strategy was rejected, as gut analyses of common fish and macroinvertebrate predators showed that both species of Aoteapsyche were taken in approximately equal proportions to their benthic densities (i.e. 10:1 A. raruraru to A. colonica), indicating that predation was unlikely to influence coexistence. Similarly the second strategy was not supported by observations of flow conditions during the study which were insufficient to move the substrata extensively colonised by both species of Aoteapsyche. Finally, temporal segregation of life histories was not observed, but analyses of larval guts indicated that diet was affected by shelter location on the substrate. Sampling of substrate microhabitats showed that A. raruraru larvae occurred on the upper surfaces, sides and under surfaces of large cobbles, although significantly higher densities were collected from the upper surfaces and sides. In contrast, A. colonica aggregated on the sides and undersurfaces of cobbles. In other streams A. colonica shows a similar microdistribution but in a silted stream lacking seston, and in the absence of A. colonica, A. raruraru larvae occurred mainly on the under surfaces of stones. Co-existence of these two congeners would seem to be possible by microhabitat segregation where food availability is high, however in the absence of a plentiful food supply and A. colonica the microdistribution of A. raruraru may differ.","UNIV CANTERBURY,DEPT ZOOL,CHRISTCHURCH 1,NEW ZEALAND",,,,,,,,27,13,17,0,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,AUG 15,1997,350,,,,,,25,33,,10.1023/A:1003012512998,,,9,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,YE362,WOS:A1997YE36200003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Therefore, coevolutionary models predict adaptation and counter-adaptation by the sexes in a battle to control the outcome of sexual encounters. A phylogenetic analysis was performed on patterns of sexual dimorphism and mating systems within water striders (Hemiptera, Gerridae). Phylogenetic effects or 'constraints' have significantly shaped patterns of sexual dimorphism in female/ male size ratios, legs and genitalia of males, and the structure of the female abdomen. Males of ancestral gerrids were probably slightly smaller than conspecific females, had powerful fore legs adapted to g-rasp the female's thorax during mating, and had clasping genitalic structures suited to grasp or pinch the female posteriorly. Most gerrids have a female/male size ratio between 1.05 and 1.14, but more pronounced sexual size ratios (above 1.25) have independently evolved several times in the family, usually in association with extended postcopulatory mate guarding. The comparative, phylogenetic analysis suggests coevolution of female anticlasper and male clasping devices for the clade comprising the subfamilies Cylindrostethinae, Ptilomerinae, and Halobatinae while female anticlasper devices have evolved in the absence of male clasping genitalia in the Gerrinae. The ancestral and most common mating system in gerrids is 'scramble competition polygyny' from which has evolved 'resource defence polygyny' at least four times independently of each other. The phylogenetic effects on patterns of mating behaviour are much less obvious, as exemplified by the large amount of interspecific variation in some genera.

The repeated evolution of divergent body shapes in a radiation of stickleback from Cook Inlet, Alaska suggests that diversification has proceeded by extensive parallel selection. To explore this hypothesis, hydromechanical equations of fish propulsion and descriptions of stickleback foraging and anti-predator behaviours were used to develop a series of hypotheses that predicted the evolutionary effects of native predatory fishes (NPF) and relative littoral area (RLA) on body shape. Body shape was measured using Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks transformed by the generalized resistant fit superimposition. In general, the results were consistent with the hypotheses that (1) RLA has a direct effect on selection for foraging behaviour and morphology, (2) RLA has an indirect effect on selection for morphology employed in predator evasion, (3) presence of NPF has a direct effect on selection for evasive morphology, and (4) presence of NPF has an indirect effect on selection for foraging behaviour and morphology. The magnitude of the divergence of body shapes present in the Cook Inlet system suggests that extreme phenotypes have evolved by opportunistic expansion into new habitat relatively free of interspecific competition.

Success in nonequilibrium environments depends in part on the ability to store energy and control its allocation during periods of extreme food limitation or outright starvation. Starvation resistance is one measure of the ability of a species to persist when energy intake is less than energy expenditure. The life-history responses of nine species of planktonic rotifers to food deprivation were compared using cohort life-table experiments. Allometric patterns of energy storage and respiration rate lead to the prediction that larger species should have greater starvation resistance than smaller species. Contrary to this prediction, when rotifers were acclimated to high resource levels and starved as young adults, body mass did not predict starvation time, Rather, there was a trade-off between survival and reproduction during starvation. Some species did not reproduce during starvation and had high starvation times (up to 5.0 d). Other species maintained or increased fecundity relative to fed controls and had low starvation times (as low as 0.4 d). Species with more rapid senescence when fed tended to have shorter starvation times. However, the interspecific trade-off between survival and reproduction remained after removing the effect of control survivorship. Differences in life-history responses to starvation may be critical in determining competitive outcome and community structure in variable environments. When acclimated to low food levels prior to food deprivation, simulating conditions of declining resource abundance in nature, rotifer starvation time decreased. Juveniles had longer starvation times than adults, further supporting the idea that allocating energy to reproduction decreases starvation resistance.",,"Kirk, KL (corresponding author), NEW MEXICO INST MIN & TECHNOL, DEPT BIOL, SOCORRO, NM 87801 USA.",,,,,,,41,111,114,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1997,78,2,,,,,434,441,,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0434:LHRTVE]2.0.CO;2,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WN754,WOS:A1997WN75400009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Such behaviour, when exhibited toward heterospecifics, plays an important role in the competitive interactions between species. We compared levels of aggressive behaviour in intra- and interspecific contexts in two species of sympatric salamanders (Plethodon ouachitae and P. albagula) that have similar ecological requirements but differ in adult size. We also tested the effectiveness of such behaviour in holding cover objects (territorial foci) in the laboratory and on the forest floor. We predicted that if one species were more aggressive than the other, then that species would have greater success in obtaining and holding cover objects. In laboratory trials, residents of P. ouachitae (the smaller species) were extremely aggressive in both intra- and interspecific contexts. Individuals of P. ouachitae delivered bites at a rate 14 times that of previously studied species of Plethodon and were significantly more likely to escalate to biting when tested as territorial residents (in intra- and interspecific trials) and as intruders (in interspecific trials). Plethodon albagula exhibited a lower level of aggression, similar to other species of Plethodon. In laboratory trials, in which salamanders competed for cover objects of differing quality, residents of P. ouachitae were effective in expelling conspecific intruders, and they were marginally effective at expelling intruding P. albagula. Residents of P. albagula were less effective in expelling conspecific intruders and did not expel intruding P. auachitae. We conclude that the extreme aggression exhibited by P. ouachitae enabled it to expel intruders from artificial cover objects and to invade cover objects held by larger heterospecific residents. Field data supported intraspecific defence of cover objects by P. ouachitae, but results for Il albagula were inconclusive. These results are consistent with the geographic distributions of these species (P. ouachitae typically outnumbers P. albagula in the Ouachita Mountains) and provide an example of a behavioural mechanism overcoming a size-related disadvantage.","UNIV SW LOUISIANA, DEPT BIOL, LAFAYETTE, LA 70504 USA",,,,,,,,49,46,48,0,13,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,FEB,1997,134,,1-2,,,,71,88,,10.1163/156853997X00287,,,18,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,WJ216,WOS:A1997WJ21600004,,,,,2021-09-21,

The general stratification of different bacterial groups in the biofilm was simulated using a one-dimensional (1-D) mathematical biofilm accumulation model (BAM) and compared with the experimental results. Biofilms were cultured at three C:N ratios of feed solutions In a partially submerged rotating biological contactor (RBC). It was shown that the biofilms were vertically stratified (from biofilm surface to substratum). At C:N = 0, heterotrophs and nitrifiers coexisted in the outermost biofilm and heterotrophs dominated in the innermost biofilm. At C:N = 1.5, heterotrophs outcompeted nitrifiers for dissolved oxygen and space; thus, heterotrophs dominated in the outermost biofilm and nitrifiers were present only in the deeper biofilm. Nitrifiers and heterotrophs coexisted in the innermost biofilm. An increase in the influent C:N ratio resulted in stronger stratification of microbial species, as well as inhibition of nitrification. In batch experiments, NH4-N utilization rate (R(NH4-N)) was almost the same at each substrate C: N ratio even though NH, oxidizers were predominantly present in the deeper biofilm. The biofilm performance could not be sufficiently explained by the obtained microbial spatial distribution, suggesting that one-dimensional description of microbial distribution was not good enough and three-dimensional measurements of microbial spatial distribution is necessary. Total bacterial densities increased by a factor of 3-17 with biofilm depth. The metabolically active cell fraction decreased from 35 +/- 13% in the outermost biofilm to 15 +/- 4% in the innermost biofilm, presumably due to substrate limitation. The model predicted more pronounced stratification of nitrifiers and heterotrophs than the observed results. This discrepancy could be attributed to the real biofilms that were structurally heterogeneous (e.g., water channels), which could not be described by the one-dimensional model. The results of this study clearly indicate the limitation of 1-D biofilm models to describe the extent of stratification of nitrifiers and heterotrophs and suggest a 3-D model is necessary.

Possible explanations include nonoverlapping food distributions, interspecific competition, and predation. If food limits distributions, species should forage most successfully in their preferred habitats and should experience poorer food intake rates elsewhere. These same predictions hold if species distributions are shaped by exploitative competition. We tested the foraging success hypothesis and exploitative competition hypothesis as explanations of the habitat distributions of Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli), Black-throated Sparrows (A. bilineata), and Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), which spend the winter in different habitats along an elevational gradient in the Sonoran Desert of southern California. Individuals of each species were transplanted between habitats in a portable aviary and observed while foraging on naturally occurring seeds. Predictions of the foraging success hypothesis and exploitative competition hypothesis were not confirmed. Only Dark-eyed Juncos achieved their highest foraging success in their preferred habitat. Black-throated Sparrows experienced nearly identical foraging success in all three habitats, yet are confined to only one of them naturally. Sage Sparrows foraged more successfully in habitats other than that in which they naturally occur. We conclude that immediate foraging gains do not explain habitat distributions of these birds, and that interference competition, predation, or other unknown factors are responsible. We contrast this finding with that seen in Galapagos finches in which bird distributions closely matched food supply.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT ZOOL, ECOL GRP, VANCOUVER, BC V6T 1Z4, CANADA",,,,,,,,28,6,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1996,77,2,,,,,452,460,,10.2307/2265621,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TY198,WOS:A1996TY19800009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Results showed that spatial overlap (Lloyd's index and spatial distribution) was higher among adults of both species at the lower tidal elevation of l'Anse-a-l'Orignal (north-east oriented). Results also suggest weaker interspecific interactions among juveniles of both species because of limited spatial overlap, In Baie-du-Ha!Ha! (south-west oriented), spatial overlap was greater than that observed in 1'Anse-8-l'Orignal and appeal-ed important in adults as well as in juveniles. Levins' directional measure of competition indicated an asymmetric spatial overlap between N. virens and N. caeca in Baie-du-Ha!Ha! and a symmetric overlap in l'Anse-a-l'Orignal. The intraspecific encounter values, estimated from Lloyd's mathematical expression, were significantly higher than values of interspecific interactions only in l'Anse-a-l'Orignal. Moreover, no vertical stratification was found inside the sediment, with no effect of the densities and individual body weights of the polychaetes. Juveniles of both species mainly inhabited the organic-rich upper portion of the sediments (O to 12 cm), while adults colonised greater depths( > 25 cm) where organic matter content was lower. A complementary field experiment was conducted in 1993 to investigate interspecific interactions (predation and competition) existing between N. virens and N. caeca. Results from this experiment depend on which species was first-introduced and showed an important variation in mortality rates between allopatric and sympatric conditions. The influence of competition and predation on the structure of these populations is also discussed in relation to their spatial overlap.","UNIV LAVAL,GIROQ,DEPT BIOL,ST FOY,PQ G1K 7P4,CANADA; MUSEUM NATL HIST NAT,LAB MARITIME,F-35801 DINARD,FRANCE","Caron, A (corresponding author), UNIV QUEBEC,DEPT OCEANOG,CTR OCEANOG RIMOUSKI,310 ALLEE URSULINES,RIMOUSKI,PQ G5L 3A1,CANADA.",,,,,,,83,13,17,1,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Densities of large herbivore prey were estimated by line transects. Density of tigers was estimated from individual track features. Tiger diet was determined by analyses of seats (feces). Selection of prey species was inferred by comparing observed counts of seats to hypothesized seat frequencies generated from prey density estimates. Prey removal by tigers was estimated from the estimated food requirement of the tigers in the study area and the estimated biomass of the different prey species. Three species (axis deer (Axis axis), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and hog deer (Axis porcinus) comprised more than 90 % of the biomass killed. Larger and reportedly more optimum sized prey species like nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and barasingha (Cervus duvauceli) were not preferentially eaten, probably due to their low densities. Contrary to the predictions that tiger predation would be non-selective on medium and smaller sized prey if availability of large prey was limited, the Kamali tigers showed significant selectivity among the medium sized prey species : wild boar was preferred, whereas barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak) was under-represented in the diet. Total removal of available ungulate prey biomass was low (3,1 %) compared to other studies, indicating that the relatively dense tiger population was regulated through social behaviour rather than by food. Predation by tiger did not appear to play a major role in regulating the densities of wild herbivores, except nilgai.

The isodar method is a good tool to assess differences between habitats, shape and general location of fitness-density graphs. Using the isodar method we discovered new details about the two gerbil species. The G. pyramidum fitness-density graphs are two parallel straight lines. The G. allenbyi fitness-density graphs are two converging straight lines. Isodars estimated for mixed populations agree with the prediction that they should not differ from that calculated for each species in isolation. This point implies that isodars can be used to detect habitat preference of single species even though they exist in a community of competitors. The isodar method was also able to detect the shared preference community organization pattern of the two gerbil species. We concluded that the isodar method is a useful tool in detecting density-dependent habitat selection and community organization pattern. But we had to conclude that the isodar method is very limited in estimating interspecific competition. The method was not able to detect interference competition between the two gerbil species although results of manipulation experiments showed that it is the key process in the gerbil system. Also, the isodar method assumes that competition is fixed (density independent). This is a major flaw since all theories of optimal foraging, including density dependent habitat selection, predict that competition coefficients are density dependent. Thus, although the isodar method was able to estimate significant exploitation competition for the two species, we are not sure if it means anything. This is because the estimated isoclines of the two species, using field manipulations, revealed that the isoclines are highly nonlinear and that the magnitude of the interaction, for each density combination, depends on the degree of habitat overlap of the two species. Thus, habitat specific constant interaction coefficients estimated by the isodar method probably mean very little, if anything.",,"OVADIA, O (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV, DEPT LIFE SCI, BEER SHEVA, ISRAEL.",,"Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012; ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012","Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,28,36,36,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1995,73,1,,,,,86,94,,10.2307/3545729,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH161,WOS:A1995RH16100012,,,,,2021-09-21,

In nectarless Dactylorhiza incarnata, the deceptive pollination system has been considered to function best in remote habitats such as marshes, where flowering plants attractive to pollinators are rare (remote habitats hypothesis). In contrast, the magnet-species theory predicts that a nectarless plant benefits from growing in the vicinity of nectar-containing species. We tested these hypotheses by adding attractive, nectar-containing violets (Viola x wittrockiana) to orchid populations. The percentage of fruit set in D. incarnata was adversely affected by the violets, probably because interspecific exploitation competition for pollinators took place in favour of the violas at the expense of the orchids. This result gave no support for the magnet-species theory and supported the remote habitats hypothesis.","UNIV JYVASKYLA,DEPT BIOL & ENVIRONM SCI,SF-40351 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND",,,,,,,,31,55,58,0,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1995,101,4,,,,,500,503,,10.1007/BF00329430,,,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QT597,WOS:A1995QT59700013,28306966,,,,2021-09-21,

Moreover, most of the information on in situ diel feeding and migratory rhythms is based on low sampling frequencies. The kinetics and the degree of coupling of these processes are thus only roughly known. Here, we present a study conducted on a diel cycle in Lake Geneva to establish the temporal and spatial relationships between DVM and grazing activity of the dominant planktonic crustaceans. Our methodological approach is based on reliable and frequent (every 30 minutes) sampling, and on gut fullness analysis. We test the hypothesis of temporal and spatial segregation in DVM and feeding activity of sympatric taxa to counteract resource competition. We also evaluate the variation in DVM and feeding activity between taxa, size and sexes. In Lake Geneva, the Daphnia complex of different species and size (D. hyalina x galeata) and the diaptomid (Eudiaptomus gracilis) have distinct DVM and diel feeding patterns which lead to temporal and spatial segregation. Differences arise from the amplitude and kinetics of DVM and diel feeding rhythms. A strong day/night contrast in depth distribution and feeding activity was observed for the large daphnids while the small daphnids and the diaptomids had lower amplitudes of DVM and weaker diel changes in feeding activity. Large Daphnia exhibited a biomodal feeding pattern coupled with dynamic interchange of individuals between the epi- and hypolimnetic layers at dusk and dawn. In contrast, little coupling between DVM and feeding patterns was found for the diaptomid. These distinct behaviours can be viewed as specific adaptative strategies developed by calanids and daphnids to limit interspecific competition and to compromise between avoidance of starvation in deep waters and avoidance of visual predators in surface layers. Our study supports the hypothesis of exogenous control of Daphnia DVM by the relative change in light intensity at dusk and dawn, but also suggests that small Daphnia (not large ones), are controlled by absolute light variations when this major stimulus is lacking. Our results also support the hypothesis that selective predation by fish is responsible for the observed differences in DVM and diel feeding patterns of sized-daphnids and diaptomids. Other factors explaining the coupling of DVM and feeding patterns are hunger, vertical temperature gradient and for daphnids, size. Thus, ecological plasticity in crustacean DVM and feeding patterns results from the interactive effect of multiple abiotic and biotic driving forces. Finally, our study also shows that large Daphnia have a marked contribution to the acceleration of downward nutrient fluxes in Lake Geneva, via their diurnal rhythm in feeding and vertical migration. Ecological implications of the study for lake management and sampling design of zooplankton grazing studies are also presented.","UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT SCI BIOL, GRP RECH INTERUNIV LIMNOL & ENVIRONM AQUAT, GRIL, MONTREAL, PQ H3C 3J7, CANADA","ANGELI, N (corresponding author), INRA, HYDROBIOL LACUSTRE STN, BP 511, F-74203 THONON LES BAINS, FRANCE.",,"Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/U-9107-2019","Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/0000-0002-1070-2968",,,,94,31,32,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR 24,1995,300,,,,,,163,184,,10.1007/BF00024459,,,22,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,RB625,WOS:A1995RB62500017,,,,,2021-09-21,

Little is known about the ecology of these crabs or the factors that influence their distribution in mangrove forests. Pitfall traps were used to sample grapsid crabs in the Murray River estuary in north Queensland. Sampling was conducted at five sites along a salinity gradient from <1 parts-per-thousand at upstream sites to >35 parts-per-thousand at the river mouth. At each site, trapping was done in both low and high intertidal forests. We characterized the sediments at each site by measuring percent sand, silt, clay and organic matter, Eh, pH, and soil pore-water salinity. Four species of grapsids dominated the crab fauna along the Murray River (Sesarma semperi-longicristatum, S. messa, S. brevicristatum, and S. brevipes). Distinct zonation patterns were found along the salinty gradient and between high and low intertidal forests. S. messa was dominant in high intertidal, downstream forests, high and low intertidal forests in the middle to downstream portion of the river, and in low intertidal forests in the central reach of the river. S. brevipes was dominant in both low and high intertidal zone forests at low salinity upstream sites. S. brevicristatum was most abundant in the central reaches of the river and only in the high intertidal zone. S. semperi-longicristatum was found only in the low intertidal zone, downstream forest. Subsequently, tests of salinity tolerances of these crabs were carried out in the laboratory. These indicated very wide tolerances over salinities from completely fresh to hypersaline (60 parts-per-thousand). The osmoregulatory abilities of the crabs were also found to vary. However, neither their salinity tolerance nor osmoregulatory ability adequately explain the zonation patterns we measured in the field. For example, S. brevicristatum had the most restricted distribution, but it had the second broadest salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory ability. Sediment characteristics explained a significant amount of the variation in abundance for two of the crab species. Pore-water salinity provided no explanatory power for any of the species. Individual species abundances are probably influenced by additional factors such as interspecific competition and predation.","AUSTRALIAN INST MARINE SCI,TOWNSVILLE,QLD 4810,AUSTRALIA",,,"Frusher, Stewart/G-5117-2014","Frusher, Stewart/0000-0003-2493-3676",,,,41,59,66,0,28,ESTUARINE RES FEDERATION,LAWRENCE,"PO BOX 368, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0160-8347,,,ESTUARIES,Estuaries,SEP,1994,17,3,,,,,647,654,,10.2307/1352412,,,8,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,QA359,WOS:A1994QA35900012,,,,,2021-09-21,

The probability that containers held water was positively correlated with the quantity of the preceding rainfall and with the depth and volume of the containers. It was estimated that dehydration occurred more regularly in autumn and winter than in summer. The probability that mosquito larvae were present in each type of container was positively correlated with habitat stability in terms of the probability of the existence of standing water and the coefficient of variation of the water level. Twelve species of mosquito larvae, including two rare predators, were found. Species composition differed between the different types of container. Although 4 to 10 species used each type of container, the median number of species per container was two for treeholes and bamboo stumps, and one for the others. The dominant species was Tripteroides bambusa in treeholes and bamboo stumps, Aedes albopictus in stone vases, and A. japonicus in stone vessels. The larval mosquito community, which lacked major predators, possessed the following features that may facilitate the coexistence of many species: (1) niche segregation amonst species in terms of their selection of container types; (2) and aggregated distribution of the individual species among containers of the same type; (3) high intraspecific mean crowding (and hence probably intense intraspecific competition) in the dominant species in each type of container; (4) independent species associations within the same type of container; and (5) low interspecific mean crowding (and hence probably not intense interspecific competition) between species in the same type of container.","SAGA MED SCH,DEPT MICROBIOL,SAGA 849,JAPAN","SOTA, T (corresponding author), SHINSHU UNIV,FAC SCI,DEPT BIOL,MATSUMOTO,NAGANO 390,JAPAN.",,,,,,,40,59,61,0,15,SOC POPULATION ECOLOGY,KYOTO,"SHIMOTACHIURI OGAWA-HIGASHI KAMIKYO-KU, KYOTO 602, JAPAN",0034-5466,,,RES POPUL ECOL,Res.

We developed a preliminary model to assess the effects of lake acidity and productivity, fish predation and interspecific fish/duck competition in relation to available food (aquatic invertebrates). We then validated the model using a factorial analysis of the relationships between the variables pertaining to the diet of the fish and ducklings, and the environmental characteristics of the lakes (acidity, biological production and fish predation). The first factorial axis can be interpreted in terms of biological productivity, while the second axis illustrates the effect that fish have on the quantity and type of food available to ducklings. Two different trends appear to occur depending on whether the carrying capacity of the lake is reduced by acidification of the water or increase through liming or fertilization. In the first case, fish predation appears to have a marked effect on available food, whereas in the second case, interspecific fish/duck competition is apparently to blame for changes in the diet of ducklings. In both instances, but to a lesser extent, fish compete increasingly (exploitation and/or interference) with the ducklings, forcing them to feed to a greater extent in riparian sites that are less accessible to fish.",,"DESGRANGES, JL (corresponding author), CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV, CP 10100, ST FOY G1V 4H5, PQ, CANADA.",,"Sauve, Sebastien/K-5671-2012",,,,,28,13,13,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,APR 1,1994,279,,,,,,207,221,,10.1007/BF00027855,,,15,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,NK399,WOS:A1994NK39900021,,,,,2021-09-21,

We tested these ideas by comparing the extent to which coexistence of dabbling ducks on breeding and wintering grounds depended on differences in body size which, in turn, reflect differences in prey size. Species of dabbling ducks that differ in body size by less than a factor of 1.2 co-occurred less frequently than expected by chance during the breeding season when duck assemblages are characterized by low dominance (i.e., the fractional abundances of species are roughly similar). In winter, when duck assemblages are characterized by high dominance (i.e., a few abundant species and many rarer ones), the pattern of species co-occurrence in relation to differences in body size could not be discerned from that which might occur by chance. This implies that competition for invertebrate prey, at least, is unlikely during winter. These results contrast with data from assemblages of other sexually reproducing vertebrate species, and with recent theories which predict that species' assortment patterns should be more regular than random in assemblages characterized by high dominance. Our results are consistent with the idea that communities of dabbling ducks are assembled, except during winter, according to some limiting size similarity and are influenced more by interspecific interactions than by chance.",,"NUDDS, TD (corresponding author), UNIV GUELPH, DEPT ZOOL, GUELPH N1G 2W1, ON, CANADA.",,,,,,,35,18,18,0,5,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Dugesia and Glossiphonia numbers decreased substantially, whilst Polycelis tenuis and Helobdella abundances increased. In the second study, the snail component in the diet was greatly reduced resulting in a broader food niche, particularly for Dugesia and Glossiphonia, and greater food overlap between the predators with the exception of Dendrocoelum and Erpobdella which do not eat molluscs. It is postulated that the reduced size of the snail refuge, and consequent increase in severity of interspecific competition with other predators, particularly Polycelis and Helobdella, led to the observed decrease in abundances of Dugesia and Glossiphonia.

Because limb morphology affects foraging behavior, we divided species into bipedal and quadrupedal guilds. The trait for which interspecific size ratios tended most toward equality both within each guild and among combined guilds is the width (cutting edge) of the upper incisor. Sizes of this trait were interspersed regularly between bipedal and quadrupedal guild members. Size ratios for pouch volume tended toward equality among Great Basin heteromyids both within each guild and among combined guilds. For no other traits did size ratios approach equality. Incisors of heteromyids are used for husking, some of which occurs above ground where predation risk is high. Therefore, husking speed may be critical. For each species there may be an optimal size for a seed that is too large to be pouched unhusked but that can be husked efficiently enough to outweigh the predation risk, and this seed size class may be the object of evolutionary specialization. A strong correlation between pouch volume and incisor width supports this hypothesis.

Consequently, these findings suggest that these species utilized carcasses more fully and likely competed more intensely for food than present-day large carnivores.",,"VANVALKENBURGH, B (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT BIOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024, USA.",,,,,,,34,115,121,0,20,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005",0036-8075,,,SCIENCE,Science,JUL 23,1993,261,5120,,,,,456,459,,10.1126/science.261.5120.456,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,LN623,WOS:A1993LN62300031,17770024,,,,2021-09-21,

I investigated the hypothesis that the shortfin molly caused the decline of the Moapa dace through competition or predation on larvae, pressures not experienced by the Moapa White River springfish. Relative interspecific competition was analyzed by contrasting the ranges of spatial and dietary overlap among larval, juvenile, and adult life stages. There appeared to be moderate to low spatial overlap between the various life stages of native and nonnative fishes. Overlap in diet was highest between adult Moapa White River springfish and shortfin mollies. Laboratory experiments suggested that shortfin mollies prey vigorously upon fish larvae. In terms of spatial habitat use, Moapa White River springfish larvae were less available to adult shortfin mollies for consumption than were Moapa dace larvae.

Observations were made for 72 consecutive hours in each of eight ice-free months and include extensive, relatively nonintrusive field observations of pumpkinseed behavior at night. We tallied numbers of passes above the substrate and numbers of substrate strikes (at substrate or at vegetation). Variation among months accounted for 40-50% of the total variation in rates of daytime passing and substrate striking, which peaked in May and September. Among-day variation in daytime foraging activity within months was high, accounting for 50-57% of the total variance, and the variances we measured can be used to plan replication levels necessary to achieve adequate statistical power in future studies involving measurements of daily ration or comparisons of exploitation rates in different habitats. Simultaneous video monitoring at multiple sites allows one to factor out the day-to-day variance and provides a sensitive way to compare foraging variables in different sites or habitats. Although pumpkinseeds are usually considered diurnal feeders, some foraging occurred at night in each month. The median rate of fish passing at night was about half the median diurnal and crepuscular rates. Rates of substrate striking were much lower at night than during the day, but planktonic feeding at night was higher, so that nocturnal striking rates on plankton plus substrate were more than 75% of the diurnal values. Nocturnal feeding by other visually feeding fishes is more important than we currently acknowledge, and needs to be incorporated into our thinking about interspecific competition and predation among littoral fishes.",,"COLLINS, NC (corresponding author), UNIV TORONTO,ERINDALE COLL,DEPT ZOOL,MISSISSAUGA L5L 1C6,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,"Collins, Nicholas C/F-2704-2010","Collins, Nicholas C/0000-0002-6901-6604",,,,32,19,21,1,10,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

We consider three hypotheses to explain interspecific variation in relative cloacal protuberance size. The copulation efficiency hypothesis states that a relatively large cloacal protuberance facilitates sperm transfer and predicts more rapid copulation in species with larger protuberances. There is insufficient data to test this idea rigorously, but we found no evidence for such an effect. The spermatozoa size hypothesis is a non-functional hypothesis which states that cloacal protuberance size is merely a consequence of sperm size, and predicts that species with larger spermatozoa have relatively larger cloacal protuberances. Sperm length was positively correlated with protuberance size, providing support for this hypothesis, although it seems unlikely that variation in sperm size alone is sufficient to account for variation in protuberance size because the numbers of sperm stored in the cloacal protuberance were also positively correlated with its size. The sperm competition hypothesis states that the cloacal protuberance is a sperm store and predicts that when sperm competition is intense, as measured by male copulation frequency and or mating system, males will have relatively large protuberances and testes mass. The sperm competition hypothesis was supported: in a comparative study in which we controlled for phylogenetic effects, relative cloacal protuberance size was significantly and positively correlated with copulation frequency. Across all mating systems protuberance size was also positively correlated with the mass of seminal glomera tissue, the number of sperm stored in the seminal glomera, and with relative testes size. These results suggest that where sperm competition is intense, a large cloacal protuberance is required to maintain a large sperm reserve for a high copulation rate.","DEPT ZOOL,S-75122 UPPSALA,SWEDEN","BIRKHEAD, TR (corresponding author), UNIV SHEFFIELD,DEPT ANIM PLANT SCI,POB 601,SHEFFIELD S10 2UQ,ENGLAND.",,"Moller, Anders/O-6665-2016","Moller, Anders/0000-0003-3739-4675",,,,59,81,83,0,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

The species show habitat segregation with respect to the wave-exposure gradient: H. maroubrae (small species, < 0.6 mm cephalon length) and H. rubra (large species, >0.6 mm cephalon length) occurred in protected environments, whereas H. grandicornis, H. hirtipalma and H. media (large species) and Hyale sp. (a small species) inhabited exposed environments. With the exception of Hyale sp., all the species were also found in areas with intermediate exposure. However, when they coexist, Hyale spp. show differential occurrence according to microhabitat utilization: in protected environments H. rubra was found exclusively on algal patches with high canopies, whereas H. maroubrae was abundant on patches with low canopies. In the exposed sectors, the species were found mainly on algal patches with low canopies; they showed pronounced segregation among patches, with Hyale sp. being restricted to turf-forming filamentous algal patches. The association of amphipod occurrence with canopy height and with occasional and seasonal algal patch occurrence in protected environments suggests that the distribution and coexistence of Hyale spp. are controlled by predation and the proximity to the colonization sectors (subtidal). In contrast, the permanent algal patch occurrence in exposed environments suggests that interspecific competition is the main factor influencing the distribution and coexistence patterns of Hyale spp., with low-canopy algal patches and water movement playing important roles in maintaining the presence of small species with poor competitive ability.",,"LANCELLOTTI, DA (corresponding author), UNIV CATOLICA NORTE, FAC CIENCIAS MAR, CASILLA 117, COQUIMBO, CHILE.",,,,,,,44,20,21,0,13,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

It is especially interesting that members of the dominating herbivores in freshwater systems, such as Daphnia species, show consistently high P:C ratios. Sestonic P:C ratios in epilimnetic waters are usually far below that encountered in the zooplankton, which suggests that grazers may approach a direct phosphorus limitation in many localities. This view was supported by a regional study of 47 lakes, in which most independent variables including phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll were scarcely correlated with zooplankton biomass but particulate P (>0.45 mum) could explain a major part of the variance of zooplankton biomass. Of the various taxa, daphnids gave the best correlation with particulate P, cyclopids and rotifers the worst. These observations suggest that phytoplankton biomass per se may not be the major determinant of zooplankton biomass but that the nutritional status of phytoplankton (P cell quotas) rather than biomass in terms of carbon is most important, or that zooplankton suffer a direct P limitation in many lakes. The latter view is supported by model predictions given in this article. Also, both freshwater and marine copepod grazers could correspondingly be growth limited by an N:C ratio of ingested food that is too low.

The percentage of time spent foraging was higher when a Great Tit was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species rather than with another Great Tit or a member of the dominant species. When a bird was solitary, time spent foraging was less than when it was with an individual belonging to a subordinate species, and greater than when it was with one belonging to the dominant species. The proportion of time spent vigilant did not differ between Great Tits that foraged with an individual from a dominant species or a subordinate species or with a conspecific, but was higher for solitary birds. Vigilance time of solitary Great Tits, Nuthatches, and three other Parus species was not negatively correlated with interspecific dominance status. In these small passerines, vigilance does not seem to be directed towards the detection of a competitor species. Surveillance for predators and detection of competitor species may be synchronous, nonexclusive tasks. Scanning rate (number of scans per minute of feeding) was the same for Great Tits that fed either solitarily or in pairs, but mean scan duration was significantly shorter for individuals in groups than when solitary.

The Alcyonacea are characterized by high frequencies of ichthyotoxicity and feeding deterrence which are not generally correlated with each other, This may be due to the multiple functions these compounds perform, masking correlations which would otherwise be apparent. Correlations between ichthyotoxicity and physical defense exist, but only at higher levels of taxonomic resolution. One resultant selective advantage of variance in ichthyotoxicity and feeding deterrence may be Diffuse Batesian Mimicry, whereby the toxic or feeding-deterrent characteristics of a majority of species help to protect a taxon with a small number of general morphological types and small variance in coloration from generalist predators. Surface-brooded planulae of Indo-Pacific coral species, similar in appearance but not possessing toxic or feeding deterrent attributes, may be similarly protected. The chemical characters of octocorals may serve the same functions which morphological characters in scleractinian corals serve, particularly in predator defense and competition for space. Most octocorals lack a rigid skeleton possessed by scleractinians, which can protect polyps from predation. Octocorals also lack toxic stinging nematocysts common to scleractinians, but possess allelopathic capabilities. In some octocorals, 'non-toxic' nematocysts on sweeper tentacles may still be effective in competition for space; in others, aggressive interactions can be avoided through re-orientation or movement, resulting in directed growth. Octocoral orders are distributed inequitably between the tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. The Gorgonacea dominate the former; the Alcyonacea, the latter. Octocoral species diversity is higher in the western Indo-Pacific, as is the abundance and diversity of secondary metabolites and their functions. This may be a result of differential levels of extinction between the 2 regions during the early Miocene and the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene, with high extinction rates having been experienced in the Caribbean. These extinctions may also have affected radiation in the secondary metabolites produced by those species and the functions which those metabolites serve. Secondary metabolites appear to have contributed to the evolutionary success of the Indo-Pacific Alcyonacea. In accordance with the Time-Stability hypothesis, we believe that this high abundance and diversity evolved in the Indo-Pacific under conditions of reduced climatic change and lower extinction levels, when compared to the Caribbean.","UNIV CENT QUEENSLAND, ROCKHAMPTON, QLD 4702, AUSTRALIA","SAMMARCO, PW (corresponding author), LOUISIANA UNIV MARINE CONSTORTIUM, CHAUVIN, LA 70344 USA.",,,,,,,117,83,85,0,30,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

By early 1986, six of these species had successfully colonized L Lake (i.e., established reproducing populations); all were trophic and habitat generalists. With one exception, these species declined or disappeared during the next 2 yr as species more typical of reservoir ecosystems were introduced into L Lake. Thc introduced species were larger-bodied and exhibited greater trophic specialization than the original colonists. The close correspondence between the decline of the early colonists and the increase of the reservoir species, coupled with an absence of concurrent changes in the abiotic environment likely to result in species losses, indicated that interspecific interactions were responsible for the observed community changes. Both competition and predation appeared to be contributing factors, although the relative importance of these processes could not be determined. Given the rate and order in which species colonized L Lake, there was no evidence of priority effects, in which previously established species prevent colonization by later arriving species. The development of the L Lake fish community during thc 1 st 3 yr appeared to be a largely deterministic process, controlled initially by the habitat requirements and preferences of the species that had access to L Lake from Steel Creek and later by interspecific interactions between the original colonists of L lake and the introduced species.","NORMANDEAU ASSOCIATES,NEW ELLENTON,SC 29808","PALLER, MH (corresponding author), WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO,SAVANNAH RIVER LAB,AIKEN,SC 29808, USA.",,,,,,,51,8,8,0,3,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

Marked interspecific differences were detected in the preferred sites of attachment of females to their common host, the sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa, with Amb. limbatum found predominantly in the ears and on the lower back, while Ap. hydrosauri preferred to attach under the forelimbs and on the mid-back. Data from field surveys suggested that higher proportions of females were mated in the preferred sites for Ap. hydrosauri, and in one of the preferred sites for Amb. limbatum. However, laboratory and field experiments showed that for both species, the mean time before females were mated, mean engorgement time and mean feeding rate were independent of where they were attached to a host. Four hypotheses were considered as explanations of the observed niche segregation; interspecific competition, avoidance of pheromone jamming or adaptations, to maximize mating and feeding, and minimize physical disturbance.

During the whole period the community was composed of 15 species of Rotifera, 9 of Cladocera, 2 of Copepoda and 1 of Chaoboridae. A period of total zooplankton depression occurred in the winter-spring seasons. Temperature may influence zooplankton fluctuations directly as a triggering factor, or indirectly through its influence on the phytoplankton. Through-flow does not seem to induce seasonal variation, as high zooplankton densities were found in the wet season. Predation by Chaoboridae can exert an influence on some populations, such as Daphnia gessneri, Bosmina tubicen, and Keratella cochlearis micracantha, mainly in the wet-warm season, when the larvae are abundant. Daphnia gessneri was a superior competitor over rotifers and other cladocerans, such as Diaphanosoma birgei, Moina micrura and possibly Ceriodaphnia cornuta. Clutch size variation of D. gessneri and B. tubicen indicated food limitation in the dry-cool season. Fluctuations of the populations can be seasonal or non seasonal depending on the factors involved.

These mosses grow on the droppings of large mammals and have their spores dispersed by flies (Diptera). (2) Droppings located in dry habitats were primarily occupied by Tetraplodon spp., whereas droppings in wet habitats were primarily occupied by Splachnum spp. In dry habitats there was a seasonal segregation of dropping colonization by Tetraplodon spp. Dung placed into the field in May, when sporophytes of T. angustatus matured, were exclusively colonized by T. angustatus, whereas dung placed into the field in June, when most T. mnioides sporophytes matured, were primarily colonized by T. mnioides. (3) Each species of moss attracted between ten and seventeen species of spore-carrying flies and the fly faunas attracted to each species were 77-92% different from each other in species composition.

In this final part of the paper, interspecific relationships and comparisons are emphasised. The nine large gadoids considered are primarily benthopelagic and pelagic predators on fish and crustaceans. Because of their abundance and wide distribution, they are key members of the upper part of the food-web in the Norwegian Deep and its slopes. Particularly important trophic relationships exist between the gadoids and the euphausids, caridean decapods and Norway pout. It is likely that the strongest interactions involving the gadoids are of predator-prey type and exist between the most abundant gadoids and their main prey: small saithe and blue whiting as predators and the euphausids as prey, and between saithe and Norway pout. Because it seems unlikely that any of the species, even those showing rather extensive overlaps in their diets and spatial distributions, experience resource shortages, the overall impression is that competition plays a minor role among the gadoids. However, intraspecific resource overlap seemed rather strong among the lifestages found in this area. Therefore, significant influence of competitive interactions are more likely to be found between size groups of the same species than between different species.",,"BERGSTAD, OA (corresponding author), UNIV BERGEN,DEPT FISHERIES & MARINE BIOL,THORMOHLENSGT 55,N-5008 BERGEN,NORWAY.",,,,,,,47,17,18,0,5,UNIV BERGEN,BERGEN,"DEPT FISHERIES/MAR.

We hypothesized that an extensive infestation of aquatic vegetation was a critical factor allowing sympatry, because introduced inland silversides have rapidly displaced endemic brook silversides in other, less-vegetated, reservoir systems. We believe that an abundant invertebrate prey base associated with the aquatic vegetation was responsible for a low level of interspecific competition for food resources between the two silverside species in Lake Conroe. After removal of vegetation in 1981-1983 by grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, the inland silverside population expanded and the brook silverside population declined. By 1986, brook silversides were rare in seine samples taken from, or near, the main basin of the reservoir and appeared to be restricted to tributaries and coves. Data suggest that food habits of the silverside species diverged after vegetation removal, coincident with declines in the limnetic and littoral invertebrate prey bases. The observed shifts in diets, abundances, and distributions of the two silverside populations were consistent with results predicted by studies on silverside feeding mechanics and the competitive exclusion principle.","TEXAS A&M UNIV SYST,DEPT WILDLIFE & FISHERIES SCI,COLLEGE STN,TX 77843; N CAROLINA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL & FORESTRY,RALEIGH,NC 27695",,,,,,,,29,19,22,0,5,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Twenty characters of external morphology of 41 species (representatives of 54 populations) were put into analysis. Results demonstrate a relatively low level of convergence between Mongolian and Mexican species. Rodent species of Mongolian communities occupy a bigger volume of the factorial space than rodent species of Mexican communities, although the number of species in both types of communities is similar. The comparison of Euclidean distances to the nearest neighbour and their coefficients of variation in real groups of coexisting species (at the level of habitat) and in hypothetical groups formed by random combination of species points to the pattern of regularity in species packing. At the same time there are differences in species distribution in morphological space of Mongolian and Mexican communities. The significant positive correlation of Euclidean distances in morphological and in ecological space (distances between centers of spatial niches) was shown in the community of Mongolian rodents. There is no such correlation in the Mexican rodent community.

Plant functional traits determine plant performance and have therefore the potential to shape and predict species distributions along environmental gradients. This study analyses how traits affect tree species distribution along an elevational gradient in the Himalayas, Nepal. We addressed three questions: (a) what plant strategies can be distinguished among tree species? (b) how are plant traits and strategies associated with elevation? and (c) what plant traits are the best predictors of species positions along elevational gradient? 2. We quantified for 31 tree species a set of 39 plant traits related to resource uptake, use and conservation. We analysed how traits cluster into separate functions using a cluster analysis, and how traits and clusters associate into distinct plant strategies using a principal component analysis. 3. The cluster analysis showed five clusters of traits, reflecting (a) efficiency in vertical expansion, (b) efficiency in horizontal expansion, (c) efficiency in metabolism, (d) physical defence and (e) tree functional groups (conifers vs. broadleaf species). The first PCA axis reflects trade-offs in traits and clusters linked to elevation: highland species had trait values that increase safety against freezing induced cavitation, high solar radiation and strong wind, and that increase resource conservation. In contrast, lowland species had trait values that increase efficiency of resource acquisition, metabolism and expansion. Additionally, a bivariate analysis showed that the first PCA axis is more strongly related to elevation than the individual traits, indicating that the combination of traits is more important than the individual traits. An all subsets regression analysis showed that a small set of traits best explain species distribution: highland species had smaller size (low basal area), safer hydraulics (low conduit diameter) and lower leaf and branch display efficiency (low leaf area per xylem area, specific branch length) that increase persistence under harsh conditions. Remarkably, leaf traits were poor predictors of species' elevational positions. 4. Synthesis. Multiple trade-offs in plant size, hydraulics and light competitiveness shape species distribution along the elevational gradient. Along this extreme environmental gradient, stem and branch traits that integrate multiple plant organs and functions are better predictors of species' elevational distributions than leaf traits.","[Maharjan, Surya Kumar; Sterck, Frank J.; Dhakal, Bishnu Prasad; Makri, Marina; Poorter, Lourens] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Maharjan, Surya Kumar] Rupantaran Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Maharjan, Surya Kumar] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Forestry, Dept Silviculture & Forest Biol, Hetauda, Nepal; [Dhakal, Bishnu Prasad] Minist Forests & Environm, Forest Res & Training Ctr, Kathmandu, Nepal","Maharjan, SK (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",surya.maharjan@wur.nl,,,Wageningen University and Research; Stichting het Kronendak; Rufford Foundation; KNAW Fonds Ecologie,"S.

Among the tools used to assess resource use, stable isotope analysis has proliferated in ecological studies, particularly in relation to describing intra- and interspecific variation in trophic interactions. Despite a growing need to disseminate scientific information, the inherent limitations of stable isotope ratios and inappropriate synonymizing of distinct evolutionary and ecological processes may mislead ecological inferences in natural systems. This situation necessitates a re-evaluation of the utility of stable isotope ratios to address certain ecological questions. Here, we assess the efficacy of stable isotope ratios to describe two fundamental ecological processes, niche partitioning and individual specialization. Investigation of these processes has increased substantially in accordance with increased access to stable isotope data. This article discusses the circumstances and approaches that are necessary to evaluate niche partitioning and individual specialization, and outlines key considerations for the associated application of stable isotope ratios.","[Matich, Philip] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Bizzarro, Joseph J.] Calif State Univ, Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Bizzarro, Joseph J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Cooperat Inst Marine Ecosyst & Climate, 110 McAllisterWay, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Shipley, Oliver N.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Matich, P (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",pmati001@fiu.edu,,,,,,77,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Conspecific sperm precedence (CSP), which occurs when females that have mated with both conspecific and heterospecific males preferentially use conspecific sperm for fertilization, might contribute to species coexistence by mitigating the costs of interspecific mating and hybridization. We discussed whether two species exhibiting CSP can coexist in a local environment in the presence of reproductive interference. First, using a behaviorally explicit mathematical model, we demonstrated that two species characterized by negative mating interactions are unlikely to coexist because the costs of reproductive interference, such as loss of mating opportunity with conspecific partners, are inevitably incurred when individuals of both species are present. Second, we experimentally examined differences in mating activity and preference in two Harmonia ladybird species known to exhibit CSP. These behavioral differences may lead to local extinction of H. yedoensis because of reproductive interference by H. axyridis. This prediction is consistent with field observations that H. axyridis uses various food sources and habitats whereas H. yedoensis is confined to a less preferred prey item and a pine tree habitat. Finally, by a comparative approach, we observed that niche partitioning or parapatric distribution, but not sympatric coexistence in the same habitat, is maintained between species with CSP belonging to a wide range of taxa, including vertebrates and invertebrates living in aquatic or terrestrial environments. Taken together, it is possible that reproductive interference may destabilize local coexistence even in closely related species that exhibit CSP.","[Iritani, Ryosuke] RIKEN iTHEMS, Wako, Saitama, Japan; [Noriyuki, Suzuki] Kochi Univ, Fac Agr & Marine Sci, Kochi, Japan","Noriyuki, S (corresponding author), 200 Monobe Otsu, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan.",fvgnoriyuki@gmail.com,"Noriyuki, Suzuki/I-4882-2015","Noriyuki, Suzuki/0000-0002-7483-0758","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,,109,1,1,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Moon phases may also play an important role in shaping wild mammals' activity rhythms with prey showing peaks of activity in darkest nights. Camera trapping has enriched the possibility to conduct systematic studies of activity patterns and temporal niche overlap on mammalian guilds. In this study, we used camera traps to investigate intra-guild interactions and temporal partitioning among three meso-carnivores and their common prey in two Mongolian areas characterized, respectively, by a grassland and a forest-alpine meadow. We detected a moderate-high interspecific overlap in red foxes, pikas and tolai hares. We found a moderate overlap of temporal activity patterns among nocturnal carnivores as well as among nocturnal prey species. Interestingly, we observed a moderate overlap between hares and meso-carnivores. Amongst nocturnal species, the red fox and the stoat had a peak in activity in the brightest nights, the stone marten and the Mongolian silver vole preferred to range in dark nights, whereas activity of the tolai hare was not dependent on moon phases. Our work provides some first insights of temporal pattern interactions within a small- and meso-mammal assemblage in Central Asia.

However, the accuracy of predictions based on interspecific energy-size relationships relative to approaches not based on size distributions is unknown. We compare six approaches to predict energy flux in phytoplankton communities across succession: assuming a constant energy use among species (per cell or unit biomass), using energy-size interspecific scaling relationships and species-specific rates (both with or without accounting for density effects). Except for the per cell approach, all others explained some variation in energy flux but their accuracy varied considerably. Surprisingly, the best approach overall was based on mean biomass-specific rates, followed by the most complex (species-specific rates with density). We show that biomass-specific rates alone predict community energy flux because the allometric scaling of energy use with size measured for species in isolation does not reflect the isometric scaling of these species in communities. We also find energy equivalence throughout succession, even when communities are not at carrying capacity. Finally, we discuss that species assembly can alter energy-size relationships, and that metabolic suppression in response to density might drive the allometry of community energy flux as biomass accumulates.","[Ghedini, Giulia; Malerba, Martino E.; Marshall, Dustin J.] Monash Univ, Ctr Geometr Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Ghedini, G (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Ctr Geometr Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",giulia.ghedini@monash.edu,,"Ghedini, Giulia/0000-0002-5156-2009; Malerba, Martino E./0000-0002-7480-4779",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,G.G. and D.J.M. were supported by the Australian Research Council.,,47,0,0,2,11,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Here, I discuss the term species interaction, which constitutes the core of ecology. The term has the merits of underlying many fundamental ecological ideas (e.g., competitive exclusion, trophic cascade and keystone predation) and making ecological research more interdisciplinary (e.g., biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management). Meanwhile, it has the demerits of causing problems of synonymy and polysemy, masking the fact that interactions occur at the individual level, and reinforcing the counterfactual view that an ecological community is a network of interactions between homogeneous species. This means that the facile use of the term may impede our understanding of community dynamics, which is a great concern considering recent evidence that individual heterogeneity is ubiquitous (e.g., due to ontogeny, sex and genotype) and crucial for community dynamics. To further extend the debate, I present some prospective scenarios in which future research trends may affect the importance of the terminological debate. For example, the term may obtain other definitions due to the establishment of new analytical techniques (e.g., DNA metabarcoding and causation analysis), or the debate may become obsolete if a consensus is reached that interactions occur between individuals (i.e., a paradigm shift). These arguments indicate that how we can use the term depends on how we view interactions between organisms. I suggest that multifaceted approaches that consider not only the terminology but also its associated concept and relevant research methodology are needed to overcome the issues of such ambiguous terminology and guide the future development of ecology.","[Nakazawa, Takefumi] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan","Nakazawa, T (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Life Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",take.nkzw@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","I thank anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

However, these models often ignore species interactions, which are vital for determining community composition and structure. To evaluate both direct and indirect effects of climate change on species distributions, we applied the Menge-Sutherland model, which describes the relative role of predation and environmental stress in regulating community structure. Using a space-for-time approach, we tested the predictions that (1) predators are more strongly impacted by increasing environmental stress than prey (as described in the Menge-Sutherland model) and (2) incorporating indirect (predator) effects increases our ability to predict impacts of increased temperature on prey distributions. We surveyed vertical distributions of predators (sea stars) and a foundational prey species (mussels) at 20 intertidal sites spanning a thermal gradient along the West Coast of the United States. Using generalized linear models and structural equation models, we found that as temperature increased, the upper limits of foundational prey species decreased (a direct effect), while prey lower limits also shifted downward, due to an indirect effect of temperature on predator distributions. Under future climate change, mussel ranges may undergo vertical shifts toward subtidal habitats, allowing for localized persistence of mussels and associated species. Our model comparisons indicate that this framework-incorporating both direct and indirect environmental stress effects within a classic community regulation model-can improve prediction of responses to warming. Community regulation models could be expanded to inform management and conservation efforts during unprecedented climate and ecological change.","[Wallingford, Piper D.; Sorte, Cascade J.

We incorporate the possibility of local adaptation and novel competitive interactions to improve the predictive accuracy of our Maxent models. Location San Joaquin Valley, California, USA. Methods We created Maxent models of two isolated populations of D. ingens. Using local surveys and state-wide data, we also modelled California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi), a potential novel competitor. Models included landscape variables (slope and soil composition) and climate variables (temperature, precipitation and climatic water deficit). We used Warren's I to evaluate niche overlap between species as well as between isolated populations of the same species. We then projected each set of models into the future to evaluate D. ingens response to climate change. Results Niche overlap between the D. ingens populations was moderate (I = 0.44), suggesting that they already experience different climatic regimes and providing support for population-level modelling. Projecting individual populations separately into the future, under a high emission climate change scenario (CCSM4, rcp8.5), resulted in less predicted range contraction than modelling the species as a whole. However, forecasted distributions showed areas of increasing niche overlap between the Panoche population of D. ingens and O. beecheyi (I = 0.63 to 0.74), indicating competition could be a novel range limit. Main conclusions Modelling the distributions of isolated populations separately provides a more accurate estimation of the species' contemporary niche, capturing not just overlap between the populations, but individually suitable areas as well. Projecting the individual contemporary and historical models into the future allows us to estimate future habitat suitability. Predicting the distribution of a novel competitor characterizes areas of potential competition. Subsequently, management can target suitable areas for preservation and avoid areas of potential novel competition.","[Widick, Ivy, V; Bean, William T.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","Widick, IV (corresponding author), Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.",Ivy.Widick@humboldt.edu,,"Widick, Ivy/0000-0002-9958-9577",U.S. Bureau of Land Management [L14AC00081]; Nature Conservancy [R15PG00093],"U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Grant/Award Number: L14AC00081; The Nature Conservancy, Grant/Award Number: R15PG00093; The Nature Conservancy",,75,3,3,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

This Review gives a brief overview of a number of skills that the fish need to secure prey with their shooting technique. Archerfish are opportunistic hunters and, even in the wild, shoot at artificial objects to determine whether these are rewarding. They can detect non-moving targets and use efficient search strategies with characteristics of human visual search. Their learning of how to engage targets can be remarkably efficient and can show impressive degrees of generalization, including learning from observation. In other cases, however, the fish seem unable to learn and it requires some understanding of the ecological and biophysical constraints to appreciate why. The act of shooting has turned out not to be of a simple all-or-none character. Rather, the fish adjust the volume of water fired according to target size and use fine adjustments in the timing of their mouth opening and closing manoeuvre to adjust the hydrodynamic stability of their jets to target distance. As soon as prey is dislodged and starts falling, the fish make rapid and yet sophisticated multi-dimensional decisions to secure their prey against many intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Although it is not known why and how archerfish evolved an ability to shoot in the first place, I suggest that the evolution of shooting has strongly pushed the co-evolution of diverse other skills that are needed to secure a catch.","[Schuster, Stefan] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Physiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Schuster, S (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Physiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",stefan.schuster@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Schuster, Stefan/0000-0002-0873-8996","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Schu1470/1, Schu1470/3, Schu1470/6-11]","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Schu1470/1, 3, 6-11).",,91,2,2,0,11,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

Information on activity patterns of the wild bactrian camel (Camelus ferus), kiang (Equus kiang), goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), argali (Ovis ammon), blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and wolf (Canis lupus) was obtained. We found that the wild camel, kiang, goitered gazelle, argali, and blue sheep were predominantly diurnal at watering sites, whereas red fox and wolf were nocturnal. Five herbivores partitioned the use of watering sites in a temporal manner to minimize the risk of predation by carnivores. The wild camel was the dominant herbivorous species at the watering sites. The kiang, goitered gazelle, argali, and blue sheep displayed adaptive water use by altering spatial or temporal patterns based on the presence or absence of wild camel, to minimize the risk of interspecific strife. These results are suggestive of the differences in activity patterns that might modulate water partitioning by different species, and provide insights for the development of conservation strategies for integrated species and decisions regarding water development in the Altun Mountains.","[Xue Yadong; Li Jia; Zhang Yu; Dai Yunchuan; Li Diqiang] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Sagen Guli] Adm Bur Xinjiang Lop Nur Wild Camel Natl Nat Rese, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China","Li, DQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",lidiqiang_caf@163.com,,,National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2011003]; Administrative Bureau of Xinjiang Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve; Administrative Bureau of Gansu Annanba Wild Camel National Nature Reserve,This study was funded by National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAFYBB2011003).

Alternatively, colonization may be similar in all sites, but removal may differ among them. Both mechanisms might generate a nested pattern. Moreover, the host size can alter the quality of the site for symbiotic occupation; for instance, by increasing the area and anchorage structures or reducing removal. We predicted that the spatial distribution of the ectosymbiotic chironomid Ichthyocladius lilianae Mendes, Andersen and Sather, 2004 on their host, the armored catfish Pareiorhaphis hypselurus (Pereira and Reis, 2002), would present a nested pattern with regards to body-part preference and variation according to host size. We found that (i) suboptimal sites on the host body were usually only occupied by a symbiont when the optimal sites were already occupied and (ii) sites occupied by larvae on small host body surface were a subset of the sites occupied on large hosts. Our results indicate a nested distribution, yet the mechanisms generating this pattern are unclear. One possibility is that symbionts have preferential sites for attachment on the host body surface and compete for these sites. As an alternative, symbionts may present no preference and colonize equally all sites, but they remain attached to sites that offer better resources or protection from removal.","[Dala-Corte, Renato B.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Melo, Adriano S.] Univ Fed Goias, ICB, Dept Ecol, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil","Dala-Corte, RB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",renatocorte@gmail.com,"Dala-Corte, Renato B/I-4262-2018; Melo, Adriano Sanches/D-6859-2013","Dala-Corte, Renato B/0000-0001-7492-3447; Melo, Adriano Sanches/0000-0002-4695-2854","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [307479/2011-0, 309412/2014-5]","We thank L.C. de Pinho for helping with the identification of the chironomid Ichthyocladius.

The diet of P. pileus was also investigated in relation to seasonal variations. Overall, the diet of P. pileus was dominated by prey groups from phytoplankton followed by zooplankton. Also, seasonal diet of P. pileus is exclusively dominated by phytoplankton only during autumn and winter periods. Dendrogram, multidi-mensional scaling plots, ANOSIM and SIMPER analysis indicated an extremely identical diet of P. pileus between spring and summer. Autumn and winter have distinct prey assemblages and revealed low diet similarities with the two other seasons. Such trend was not found between different regions indicating a similar diet. The study suggested that P. pileus is miscellaneous feeder and its diet composition may evince the availability of different prey groups in the ambient environment. The results obtained from this study would assess not only to describe the diversity of prey species to a certain extent but may also determine interspecific competition for food in the Southeastern Black Sea.","[Mazlum, Rahsan Evren; Aytan, Ulgen; Agirbas, Ertugrul] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-53100 Rize, Turkey","Mazlum, RE (corresponding author), Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-53100 Rize, Turkey.",evren.mazlum@erdogan.edu.tr,"Agirbas, Ertugrul/ABD-4664-2020","Agirbas, Ertugrul/0000-0001-7987-9668",Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Scientific Research Projects UnitRecep Tayyip Erdogan University [2013.103.03.2],This study was founded by Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Scientific Research Projects Unit (Project Number: 2013.103.03.2).,,26,0,0,1,8,PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P),FREISING,"ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY",1018-4619,1610-2304,,FRESEN ENVIRON BULL,Fresenius Environ.

Spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta frequently cooperate to mob lions Panthera leo, approaching the lions as a tightknit group while vocalizing loudly in an attempt to overwhelm them and drive them away. Whereas cooperative mobbing behavior has been well documented in birds and some mammals, to our knowledge it has never been described during interactions between 2 apex predators. Using a 27-year dataset, we characterize lion-hyena encounters, assess rates of mobbing behavior observed during these interactions, and inquire whether mobbing results in successful acquisition of food. Lions and hyenas interacted most often at fresh kills, especially as prey size and the number of hyenas present increased. Possession of food at the beginning of an interaction positively affected retention of that food by each predator species. The presence of male lions increased the probability of an interspecific interaction but decreased the likelihood of hyenas obtaining or retaining possession of the food. Hyena mobbing rates were highest at fresh kills, but lower when adult male lions were present. The occurrence of mobbing was predicted by an increase in the number of hyenas present. Whether or not mobbing resulted in acquisition of food from lions was predicted by an increase in the number of mobs formed by the hyenas present, suggesting that cooperation among hyenas enhances their fitness.","[Lehmann, Kenna D.

For many animals, optimal habitats differ across age or size classes, and individuals shift habitat use through ontogeny. Although many studies document ontogenetic habitat shifts for various taxa, most are observational and do not identify the causal factor of size-specific habitat variation. Field observations of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) show that juveniles perch on shorter and thinner vegetation than adults. We hypothesized that this variation is due to adult males forcing smaller juveniles to less preferred habitat. To test this assertion, we manipulated adult male densities in mesh enclosures with artificial trees to examine the response of juvenile microhabitat choice. We found that adult male density had strong effects on juvenile perch height, perch width, and substrate use, suggesting that age-class competition contributes to the observed ontogenetic differences in habitat choice. We also found that time of day significantly affected juvenile perch height and substrate use. In many cases, our results suggest that juveniles distance themselves from adults using different microhabitats from those used in our control no-adult' treatment. However, these findings were often body size dependent and varied depending upon time of day. This study highlights the complexity of juvenile perching behavior and demonstrates the role of intraspecific interactions in shaping habitat use by juvenile animals.","[Delaney, David M.; Warner, Daniel A.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Delaney, David M.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Warner, Daniel A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Delaney, DM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dmdelane@iastate.edu,"Delaney, David/J-4135-2019","Delaney, David/0000-0002-7010-840X; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",,,,79,12,12,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,2017,123,2,,,,,157,167,,10.1111/eth.12586,,,11,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,EJ4JL,WOS:000393182800007,,,,,2021-09-21,

It has been postulated that recent introduction of the brown marmorated stinkbug (Halyomorpha halys (Stal)) represents an evolutionary trap for native parasitoids, as they accept H. halys egg masses as a host but produce no viable progeny. Interspecific interactions between European egg parasitoid, Trissolcus cultratus (Mayr), and an Asian parasitoid, Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead), were assessed by providing egg masses to T. cultratus at various time intervals following the initial parasitization by T. japonicus. The suitability of the host for the parasitoid development was re-assessed by providing T. cultratus with fresh and frozen egg masses of various ages. The likelihood of T. cultratus being able to attack previously parasitized egg masses was determined by assessing the duration of egg mass guarding behavior by T. japonicus following parasitization. The results of experiments examining the interspecific interactions between a native European egg parasitoid, T. cultratus, and an Asian parasitoid, T. japonicus (a candidate for the biological control of H. halys), showed that the native species can act as facultative hyperparasitoid of the exotic one. Although this is only possible during certain stages of T. japonicus development, the presence of the introduced parasitoid may reduce the impact of the evolutionary trap for indigenous parasitoid species. There is a possibility that the occurrence of facultative hyperparasitism between scelionid parasitoids associated with stinkbugs is common. This resulting intraguild predation could promote conservation and stabilization of natural communities by impacting the diversity and population dynamics of native stinkbugs and their parasitoids (e.g., by allowing native parasitoids to avoid wasting reproductive effort on unsuitable hosts), or reduce success of biological control programs (e.g., by reducing the population size of the exotic parasitoids).","[Konopka, Joanna K.; McNeil, Jeremy N.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Konopka, Joanna K.; Gariepy, Tara] Agr & Agri Food Canada, London Res & Dev Ctr, London, ON, Canada; [Konopka, Joanna K.; Haye, Tim] CABI Europe Switzerland, Delemont, Switzerland; [Mason, Peter] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa Res & Dev Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Gillespie, David] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Agassiz Res & Dev Ctr, Agassiz, BC, Canada","Konopka, JK (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada.",jkonopk@uwo.ca,"Konopka, Joanna/AAL-8589-2020","Konopka, Joanna/0000-0002-0350-2757",NSERC PGS ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ESC Research Travel Scholarship,NSERC PGS Scholarship; ESC Research Travel Scholarship.,,34,22,22,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Most of them were female and 3years old (a partial freshwater year and 2 marine years), which is intermediate between the ages of maturity of the parental species. The hybrids exceed both parental species in the rate of growth, are large in size and robust and might successfully compete for mating in the wild or be chosen for artificial reproduction. The ratio of the scale length over width, R, is oblate (R<1), whereas scales of the parental species are prolate (R>1). From scale analyses, the c.v. in body size of hybrid females at the second marine year is twice that of O. keta, which suggests developmental instability in the hybrid. A dynamic model predicted that continuing hybridization at a low rate does not produce a substantial hybrid load due to selection against advanced-generation hybrids and backcrosses. A high hybridization rate, however, may be an additional risk for genetic management and should be taken into account in programmes of artificial reproduction of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., although such hybrids might have commercial use in confined production systems.

Yet, in apparent defiance of the competitive exclusion principle, large numbers of species form natural communities while sharing a small number of limiting resources. Consumers not only coexist, but also show positive facilitative interactions among themselves. Since body size and functional responses may play important roles in these interactions, we investigate their joint effects on two consumers over a single resource. We find that two consumers with unimodal Type IV functional response can facilitate each other by increasing each other's intake rates. But, this facilitation does not necessarily impact their co-existence. When the consumers differ in their body sizes, the larger consumer receives greater absolute benefits, and the smaller consumer gains more relative benefits. These results are consistent with empirical observations, and do not require any additional assumptions over the parameters governing dynamics of resources to explain net positive interactions between consumers.

The problem of hybridization has had different effects in different areas. In non-Mediterranean regions pure forms of wildcats became almost extinct, while in Mediterranean regions genetic introgression is a rare phenomenon. The study of the potential factors that prevent the gene flow in areas of lower hybridization may be key to wildcat conservation. We studied the population size and spatial segregation of wildcats and domestic cats in a typical Mediterranean area of ancient sympatry, where no evidence of hybridization had been detected by genetic studies. Camera trapping of wild-living cats and walking surveys of stray cats in villages were used for capture-recapture estimations of abundance and spatial segregation. Results showed (i) a low density of wildcats and no apparent presence of putative hybrids; (ii) a very low abundance of feral cats in spite of the widespread and large population sources of domestic cats inhabiting villages; (iii) strong spatial segregation between wildcats and domestic/feral cats; and (iv) no relationship between the size of the potential population sources and the abundance of feral cats. Hence, domestic cats were limited in their ability to become integrated into the local habitat of wildcats. Ecological barriers (habitat preferences, food limitations, intra-specific and intra-guild competition, predation) may explain the severe divergences of hybridization impact observed at a biogeographic level. This has a direct effect on key conservation strategies for wildcats (i.e., control of domestic cats). (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.","[Gil-Sanchez, J.

Killing by the T6SS results from repetitive delivery of toxic effectors. Despite their importance in dictating bacterial fitness, systematic prediction of T6SS effectors remains challenging due to high effector diversity and the absence of a conserved signature sequence. Here, we report a class of T6SS effector chaperone (TEC) proteins that are required for effector delivery through binding to VgrG and effector proteins. The TEC proteins share a highly conserved domain (DUF4123) and are genetically encoded upstream of their cognate effector genes. Using the conserved TEC domain sequence, we identified a large family of TEC genes coupled to putative T6SS effectors in Gram-negative bacteria. We validated this approach by verifying a predicted effector TseC in Aeromonas hydrophila. We show that TseC is a T6SS-secreted antibacterial effector and that the downstream gene tsiC encodes the cognate immunity protein. Further, we demonstrate that TseC secretion requires its cognate TEC protein and an associated VgrG protein. Distinct from previous effector-dependent bioinformatic analyses, our approach using the conserved TEC domain will facilitate the discovery and functional characterization of new T6SS effectors in Gram-negative bacteria.","[Liang, Xiaoye; Moore, Richard; Wilton, Mike; Wong, Megan J.

Previous studies have shown a high proportion of reef fish species using branching fire-coral colonies as shelter, breeding, and feeding sites. However, the effects of Millepora spp. colony size and how the agonistic behaviour of a competitive damselfish affect the associated reef fish community are still unknown. The present study examined how fire-coral colony volume and the presence of a highly territorial and aggressive damselfish (Brazilian endemic Stegastes fuscus) affects the reef fish community associated with the fire-coral Millepora alcicornis. M. alcicornis colonies were surveyed from September 2012 to April 2013 at Tamandare Reefs off Northeast Brazil. Our results show that the abundance and richness of coral associated fish was positively correlated with M. alcicornis coral colony volume. Additionally, behaviour of S. fuscus, the most abundant reef fish species found associated with fire-coral colonies (almost 57% of the fish community), was also influenced by fire-coral colony volume. There was a clear trend of increased agonistic behaviour and feeding on coral polyps as colony volume increased. This trend was reversed for the non-occupational swimming category, which decreased as M. alcicornis colony volume increased. Behavioural ontogenetic changes were also detected for S. fuscus individuals. Juveniles mainly showed two distinct behaviours: sheltered on coral branches and feeding on coral polyps. In contrast, adults presented greater equitability among the behavioural categories, mostly non-occupational swimming around coral colonies and agonistic behaviour. Lastly, S. fuscus individuals actively defended fire-coral colonies from intruders. A large number of agonistic interactions occurred against potential food competitors, which were mainly roving herbivores, omnivores, and sessile invertebrate feeders. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first evidence that through habitat competition, the presence of S. fuscus may affect reef fish communities associated with M. alcicornis coral colonies. Our findings also indicate that S. fuscus uses M. alcicornis coral colonies as part of their territory for shelter and foraging. In conclusion, M. alcicornis fire-coral colonies are extremely important habitats for reef fishes and the size and presence of a territorial damselfish are relevant variables for associated reef fish community.

We examined how four life-history traits in Daphnia ambigua have evolved during community assembly in a recently created lake. Microfossils, preserved in sediments, suggest that D. ambigua was one of the original zooplankton colonizers, followed by Daphnia dentifera and Daphnia pulicaria. We used water column collections and dormant eggs from sediment cores to isolate 45 isofemale lines into laboratory culture, representing four time periods of lake colonization. We measured size at birth, size and time to maturity, clutch size, and juvenile growth rate and found significant differences among time periods in two of the traits, size at maturity and first clutch size. Although isofemale lines from the founding and recent population are known to differ in their competitive ability, we found no evidence that these temporal populations differ in measured life-history traits, sensitivity to resources or population growth rate.

Introduced exotic species gain a competitive advantage in their new environment because of a lack of natural predators, competitors or diseases.

The aims of this work were to evaluate the level of adaptation, and monitor the forms of interaction and the impact caused by S. sciureus on the behavior of the native species Callithrix jacchus in the Saltinho Biological Reserve, Tamandare, Pernambuco, Brazil. The behavior was assessed by use of scan sampling method, every 5 min. A total of 382 h (191 h or 2,292 scans per group) of time sampling was performed. Sixteen interactions were recorded. The interaction index was low and represented 2.4% of the total observation time. Interactions were significantly higher during the dry season (58.5%) relative to the rainy season (41.5%). Callithrix jacchus was intolerant to the presence of S. sciureus and the last one was more tolerant during the interactions. In the presence of S. sciureus, C. jacchus eating, foraging, resting, socializing, and self-grooming behaviors were reduced while alertness was increased. Territorial behavior showed no significant difference. In the presence of S. sciureus, on average, the group of marmosets assembled at a higher layer of the forest stratum. The results might indicate a negative effect of S. sciureus on the native species, C. jacchus.","[Miranda Camarotti, Fatima Luciana; da Silva, Valdir Luna] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Fisiol & Farmacol, BR-50730000 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Borstelmann de Oliveira, Maria Adelia] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Morfol & Fisiol, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil","Camarotti, FLM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Fisiol & Farmacol, Av Prof Moraes Rego 1235,Cidade Univ, BR-50730000 Recife, PE, Brazil.",lucianacamarotti@yahoo.com.br,,,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Cicero Jose da Silva (Sabere),"We acknowledge the Director of the Saltinho Biological Reserve, Luiz Facanha for providing logistical support and Cicero Jose da Silva (Sabere) for supporting the fieldwork.

For example, some mammalian carnivores have the ability to spray noxious anal secretions in defense, whereas other species lack such weaponry but may instead rely on collective vigilance characteristic of cohesive social groups. Using extensive natural history data on 181 species in the order Carnivora, we created a new estimate of potential predation risk from mammals and birds of prey and used comparative phylogenetic methods to assess how different sources of predation risk and other ecological variables influence the evolution of either noxious weaponry or sociality in this taxon. We demonstrate that the evolution of enhanced spraying ability is favored by increased predation risk from other mammals and by nocturnality, but the evolution of sociality is favored by increased predation risk from birds of prey and by diurnality, which may allow for enhanced early visual detection. These results suggest that noxious defenses and sociality are alternative antipredator strategies targeting different predator guilds under different lighting conditions.","[Stankowich, Theodore] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Haverkamp, Paul J.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Spatial Technol & Remote Sensing, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Caro, Tim] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Stankowich, T (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",theodore.stankowich@csulb.edu,,"Stankowich, Theodore/0000-0002-6579-7765",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-0923791]; National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NSF) [EF-0905606]; National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [CA-D-WFB-6721-H],"We thank the Center for Spatial Technologies and Remote Sensing (CSTARS) at UC Davis for their computing resources for this analysis, J.

Red fox dominates in physical interactions with the smaller arctic fox, but little is known about competition between them on the tundra. On Hershel Island, north Yukon, where these foxes are sympatric, we focused on natal den choice, a critical aspect of habitat selection. We tested the hypothesis that red fox displaces arctic fox from dens in prey-rich habitats. We applied an approach based on model comparisons to analyse a 10-year data set and identify factors important to den selection. Red fox selected dens in habitats that were more prey-rich in spring. When red foxes reproduced, arctic fox selected dens with good springtime access, notably many burrows unblocked by ice and snow. These provided the best refuge early in the reproductive season. In the absence of red foxes, arctic foxes selected dens offering good shelter (i.e. large isolated dens). Proximity to prey-rich habitats was consistently less important than the physical aspects of dens for arctic fox. Our study shows for the first time that red foxes in the tundra select dens associated primarily with prey-rich areas, while sympatric arctic foxes do not. These results fit a model of red fox competitively interfering with arctic fox, the first detailed study of such competition in a true arctic setting.","[Gallant, Daniel; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Biodiversite Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gallant, Daniel; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Reid, Donald G.] Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5T2, Canada","Gallant, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Biodiversite Nord, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",beru9664@hotmail.com; dominique_berteaux@uqar.ca,"Gallant, Daniel/B-9118-2015; Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","Gallant, Daniel/0000-0002-3170-0523; Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; International Polar Year program of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada; Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada; ArcticNet; Wildlife Conservation Society Canada; Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP)Natural Resources Canada; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Aurora Research Institute; Canadian Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation; Centre d'Etudes Nordiques (CEN); Northern Scientific Training Program (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada); Universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"We thank G.

The relative roles of resource availability and interspecific interactions between resident and invading species in determining the outcomes of such expansions has not been adequately evaluated. Ecological interactions between a cool-water adapted fish, the perch (Perca fluviatilis), and the cold-water adapted European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus), were studied in both shallow and deep lakes with fish communities dominated by (1) monomorphic whitefish, (2) monomorphic whitefish and perch, and (3) polymorphic whitefish and perch. A combination of stomach content, stable-isotope, and invertebrate prey availability data were used to identify resource use and niche overlap among perch, the trophic generalist large sparsely rakered (LSR) whitefish morph, and the pelagic specialist densely rakered (DR) whitefish morph in 10 subarctic lakes at the contemporary distribution limit of perch in northern Scandinavia. Perch utilized its putative preferred littoral niche in all lakes. LSR whitefish utilized both littoral and pelagic resources in monomorphic whitefish-dominated lakes. When found in sympatry with perch, LSR whitefish exclusively utilized pelagic prey in deep lakes, but displayed niche overlap with perch in shallow littoral lakes. DR whitefish was a specialist zooplanktivore, relegating LSR whitefish from pelagic habitats, leading to an increase in niche overlap between LSR whitefish and perch in deep lakes. Our results highlight how resource availability (lake depth and fish community) governs ecological interactions between native and invading species, leading to different outcomes even at the same latitudes. These findings suggest that lake morphometry and fish community structure data should be included in bioclimate envelope-based models of species distribution shifts following predicted climate change.","[Hayden, Brian; Kahilainen, Kimmo K.] Univ Helsinki, Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, FI-99490 Kilpisjarvi, Finland; [Hayden, Brian; Kahilainen, Kimmo K.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Harrod, Chris] Max Planck Inst Limnol, Dept Ecol Genet, D-24302 Plon, Germany; [Harrod, Chris] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Harrod, Chris] Univ Antofagasta, Inst Invest Oceanolog, Antofagasta, Chile","Hayden, B (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kasivarrentie 14622, FI-99490 Kilpisjarvi, Finland.",Brian.Hayden@Helsinki.fi,"Harrod, Chris/A-8830-2008","Harrod, Chris/0000-0002-5353-1556; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X",Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Municipality of Inari; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [1140903]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission [A30205]; Emil Aaltonen Foundation,"We acknowledge the numerous people who assisted in field and laboratory work.

Separating these processes is especially important to understand the influences of introduced exotic species on the composition of native communities. For this aim, we investigated coexistence patterns in New Zealand exotic and native birds along multiple-scale habitat gradients. We built a Bayesian hierarchical model, contrasting the abundance variations of 10 native and 11 exotic species in 501 point counts spread along landscape and local-scale gradients of forest structure and composition. Although native and exotic species both occurred in a wide range of habitats, they were separated by landscape-level variables. Exotic species were most abundant in exotic conifer plantations embedded in farmland matrices, while native birds predominated in areas dominated by continuous native forest. In exotic plantation forests, and to a lesser extent in native forests, locally co-occurring exotic and native species were segregated along a gradient of vegetation height. These results support the prediction that exotic and native bird species are segregated along gradients related to anthropogenic disturbance and habitat availability. In addition, native and exotic species overlapped little in a multivariate functional space based on 10 life history traits associated with habitat selection. Hence, habitat segregation patterns were probably mediated more by environmental filtering processes than by competition at landscape and local scales.","[Barnagaud, Jean-Yves; Barbaro, Luc] INRA, BIOGECO, UMR1202, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Barnagaud, Jean-Yves; Barbaro, Luc] Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO, UMR1202, F-33405 Talence, France; [Barnagaud, Jean-Yves] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ctr Informat Res Complex Ecol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Papaix, Julien] INRA, UR BIOGER, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Papaix, Julien] INRA, UR MIAJ, F-78352 Jouy En Josas, France; [Deconchat, Marc] INRA, UMR DYNAFOR 1201, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Brockerhoff, Eckehard G.] Scion New Zealand Forest Res Inst, Christchurch 8540, New Zealand","Barnagaud, JY (corresponding author), INRA, BIOGECO, UMR1202, 69 Route Arcachon, F-33612 Cestas, France.",jeanyves.barnagaud@gmail.com,"Brockerhoff, Eckehard Gustav/C-1528-2009; Papaix, Julien/S-3431-2016; Deconchat, Marc/N-7383-2013","Brockerhoff, Eckehard Gustav/0000-0002-5962-3208; Deconchat, Marc/0000-0002-4638-3858","INRA; EGIDE; New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology; New Zealand Government; CIRCE under the AU Ideas program of Aarhus University Research Foundation","We sincerely thank Olivier Gimenez, Marc Kery, Jens-Christian Svenning, and three anonymous referees for comments on earlier versions of the manuscript; Barbara Hock and Thomas Paul for GIS analyses; and David Henley, Sabrina Luecht, and James Muir for assistance in the field.

Population densities of small rodents fluctuate greatly, providing a good study model to evaluate effects of competition on trophic niche. We studied resource use in five arctic small rodent populations of four species combining DNA metabarcoding of stomach contents and stable isotope analysis (SIA). Our results suggest that for small rodents, the most pronounced effect of competition on trophic niche is due to increased use of secondary habitats and to habitat-specific diets, rather than an expansion of trophic niche in primary habitat. DNA metabarcoding and SIA provided complementary information about the composition and temporal variation of herbivore diets.

To assess conflict potential, in winter 2006 we used direct observations aided by radio-tracking to focally monitor continuously one female cheetah with cub (Acinonyx jubatus), a female leopard (Panthera pardus), and a lion pride (Panthera leo) at Shamwari Private Game Reserve, South Africa. Home ranges of all individuals/social groups overlapped, whereas core areas had little overlap. The cheetah core area had no overlap with the lion core area, with lion avoidance also recorded for a radio-tracked single female cheetah and a male leopard. The female cheetah with cub selected thicket habitat which was avoided by lions, the latter preferring naturally revegetated areas that were also selected by the female leopard. Lions also selected low elevations, which were avoided by the smaller felids. Habitat preference differences occurred at study area and home range levels, suggesting a broad-scale feline avoidance strategy to minimize intra-guild conflict. In addition, the focally monitored cheetah and leopard were often stationary when the lions were active, especially during nocturnal lion hunts. These intra-guild mechanisms of reintroduced carnivore coexistence should be tested with longer-term studies across enclosed systems of different sizes, and hosting varying carnivore guilds.","[Cristescu, Bogdan; Krause, Jens] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Cristescu, Bogdan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Bernard, Ric T.

There is accumulating evidence that such promiscuous behavior is driven by indirect, genetic benefits to females. Sexual selection theory distinguishes between two types of genetic benefits, additive and nonadditive effects, mediated by preferences for good and compatible genes, respectively. Good genes preferences should imply directional selection and mating skew among males, and thus reduced genetic diversity in the population. In contrast, compatible genes preferences should give balancing selection that retains genetic diversity. Here, we test how well these predictions fit with patterns of variation in genetic diversity and promiscuity levels among passerine birds. We found that more promiscuous species had higher nucleotide diversity at autosomal introns, but not at Z-chromosome introns. We also found that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIB alleles had higher sequence diversity, and therefore should recognize a broader spectrum of pathogens, in more promiscuous species. Our results suggest that female promiscuity targets a multitude of autosomal genes for their nonadditive, compatibility benefits. Also, as immunity genes seem to be of particular importance, we hypothesize that interspecific variation in female promiscuity among passerine birds has arisen in response to the strength of pathogen-mediated selection.","[Gohli, Jostein; Anmarkrud, Jarl A.; Johnsen, Arild; Kleven, Oddmund; Lifjeld, Jan T.] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Natl Ctr Biosystemat, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Anmarkrud, Jarl A.] Oslo Univ Hosp, Div Canc Med Surg & Transplantat, Norwegian PSC Res Ctr, N-0424 Oslo, Norway; [Borge, Thomas] Merck Serono, N-0277 Oslo, Norway","Gohli, J (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Natl Ctr Biosystemat, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",j.t.lifjeld@nhm.uio.no,"Kleven, Oddmund/A-6116-2009; Anmarkrud, Jarl/C-4970-2009; Anmarkrud, Jarl Andreas/G-2651-2015; Lifjeld, Jan T/B-1978-2008; Anmarkrud, Jarl Andreas/R-1822-2019","Kleven, Oddmund/0000-0003-0267-6795; Anmarkrud, Jarl/0000-0002-7496-4430; Anmarkrud, Jarl Andreas/0000-0002-7496-4430; Lifjeld, Jan T/0000-0002-9172-9985; Anmarkrud, Jarl Andreas/0000-0002-7496-4430; Johnsen, Arild/0000-0003-4864-6284","Natural History Museum, University of Oslo; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway","We thank Silje Hogner, Lars E.

F. Gmel (Santalales: Olacaceae). The study was carried out in three experimental sites during 3 yr. Under conditions of abundant fruit, A. spatulata was the dominant exploiter at the population level, as shown by its ability to infest the largest number of fruits of the three herbivores and substantially displace its moth competitors. In a separate experiment, when resource-partitioning species were excluded, A. spatulata infested twice as many fruits as the two moth species (44.3%). Field observations examined the ability of A. spatulata to locate suitable fruits. We found that, the variation in fruit characters influenced fruit suitability in relation to its size (4.1261 +/- 0.0272 mm [mean +/- SE]) and weight (0.0618 +/- 0.0005 mg [mean +/- SE]).

The questions of how optimal habitat is found and is shared with a competitor species remain problematic for rodents. Study of the habitat preferences and selection of 2 murinae from the south of France, the short-tailed mouse Mus spretus and the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, found a large overlap in habitat and only small differences in preferences. Although both species live in almost every garrigue habitat and are more abundant in transitory human-disturbed areas, A. sylvaticus was higher in abundance in holm oak coppices, while M. spretus was more abundant in low scrubland with shrub oaks or thorny broom thickets. The high level of habitat overlap resulted in many co-occurrences, with A. sylvaticus always more abundant than the short-tailed mouse. When wood mice were experimentally introduced as an attractor in a low-suitability habitat, they surprisingly attracted many short-tailed mice, but fewer wood mice than were attracted by bait-only traps. Encounters arranged in situ between the attractor and the attracted mice showed predominantly amicable or neutral behaviours and very few instances of agonistic behaviour. We hypothesize that the demographic dominance of wood mice and the abundance of resources during a large part of the year resulted in a non-competitive cohabitation, which may be beneficial to short-tailed mice using wood mice cues as public information indicating resource abundance.","[Cassaing, Jacques; Le Proux de la Riviere, Bettina; De Donno, Fabrice; Martinez-Garcia, Esteban; Thomas, Camille] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut Montpellier, UMR CNRS 5554, Cc 064, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France","Cassaing, J (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut Montpellier, UMR CNRS 5554, Cc 064, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France.",jacques.cassaing@univ-montp2.fr,,,,,,56,3,3,0,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2013,20,2,,,,,137,147,,10.2980/20-2-3560,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,230HW,WOS:000325329400005,,,,,2021-09-21,

The extent to which the increase in the number of meta-analyses in ecology, relative to other types of papers, has influenced how questions are asked and the current state of knowledge has not been assessed before. Here, we gauge the impact of meta-analyses in ecology quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative assessment, we conducted an analysis of 240 published meta-analyses to examine trends in ecological meta-analyses. Our examination shows that publication rates of meta-analyses in ecology have increased through time, and that more recent meta-analyses have been more comprehensive, including more studies and a greater temporal range of studies. Meta-analyses in ecology are the result of larger collaborations with meta-analyses being authored by larger teams than other studies, and those funded by collaborative centers have even larger collaborations. These larger collaborations result in a larger scope and scale of the analyses-by using more papers, datasets, species and years of data. Qualitatively, we discuss three examples: the strength of competition, the nature of how biodiversity affects ecosystem function, and the response of species to global climate change, where meta-analyses supplied the critical evaluation of accepted ecological explanations. As scientific criticism and controversy mount, the true power of meta-analyses is to serve as the capstone evidence supporting the validity of an explanation and to possibly herald the shift to other potential explanations.","[Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mehrkens, Lea R.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Menge, Duncan N.

This study examined a species that switches its strategy between pit-trapping and ambushing and asked the mechanism behind the switching behaviour. A dynamic optimization model incorporating tradeoffs between the two strategies was built. The tradeoffs were prey capture success and predation risk (both are higher when pit-trapping). The model predicted that antlions should use the trap-building strategy when their energy status is low and should use the ambush strategy when their energy status is high. These predictions as well as an assumption (i.e., predation risk associated with pit-trapping is higher than that associated with ambushing) of the model were empirically confirmed. The results suggest that antlions flexibly switch between pit-trapping and ambushing to maximize their fitness by balancing the costs and benefits of the two strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

On intertidal mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, mechanisms underlying the negative correlation between the densities of two dominant macro-invertebrates, the mud snail Ilyanassa obsolete and the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator, are unclear. We investigated the effect of mud snail density on survival, growth and fecundity of C volutator in 2-wk experiments in the laboratory and field, and observed behavioral interactions between the two species. Snails negatively affected juvenile and adult survival of amphipods, juvenile growth, and proportion of females. that were ovigerous. Behavioral observations revealed that snails are active predators of C. volutator, both juveniles and adults. We documented several attack methods by snails. As well, we observed that C volutator could become entangled in laid mucus trails of snails, leaving them vulnerable to attack from snail trail-followers or other predators. Snail predation, in combination with increased C. volutator migration in the presence of snails, appears to be a primary short-term mechanism for the observed negative correlation between these invertebrate species. Competition (likely through interference), resulting in lowered growth and fecundity, may be a longer-term mechanism for this negative correlation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It assumes that all individuals, regardless of species identity, are demographically equivalent. However, Hubbell suggested that neutral theory may describe even niche communities because tradeoffs equalize fitness across species which differ in their traits. In fact, tradeoffs can involve stabilization as well as fitness equalization, and stabilization involves different dynamics and can lead to different community patterns than neutral theory. Yet the important question remains if neutral theory provides a robust picture of all fitness-equalized communities, of which communities with demographic equivalence are one special case. Here, I examine Hubbell's suggestion for a purely fitness-equalizing interspecific birth-death tradeoff, expanding neutral theory to a theory describing this broader class of fitness-equalized communities. In particular, I use a flexible framework allowing examination of the influence of speciation dynamics. I find that the scaling of speciation rates with birth and death rates, which is poorly known, has large impacts on community structure. In most cases, the departure from the predictions of current neutral models is substantial. This work suggests that demographic and speciation complexities present a challenge to the future development and use of neutral theory in ecology as null model. The framework presented here will provide a starting point for meeting that challenge, and may also be useful in the development of stochastic niche models with speciation dynamics.","Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Ostling, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, 830 N Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",aostling@umich.edu,,,Class of 1935 Endowed Chair at UC Berkeley; EPA Science to Achieve Results (STAR)United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan System,"I thank R.

We described differences in the activity of individuals occurring alone or in sympatry with larger cats. Oncilla presented low densities (7-13 ind./100 km(2)) and high flexibility in its activity. The oncillas were primarily nocturnal in the absence of other larger cat species - margay, ocelot and puma - but became more diurnal, with a cathemeral activity pattern, when the other cats were present. Oncilla is likely to be in a subordinate position in interactions with larger cats and changes its activity to decrease the chances for interspecific encounters. In this study, however, the presence of other cat species covaries with habitat changes (from coastal forest patches to dense evergreen forests). We also verified the highest oncilla relative abundance in an area with no sympatric larger cats, with abundance decreasing when it was in sympatry with margay, ocelot and puma.

At the same time, as a current range retraction of the original inhabitant of the circumpolar tundra zone the arctic fox is going on, the red fox is expanding their range from the south into arctic habitats. Thus, within large parts of the northern tundra areas the two species are sympatric which gives opportunities for direct interactions including interference competition. However, direct first-hand observations of such interactions are rare, especially in the Russian Arctic. In the present study, we observed one red fox taking over an arctic fox breeding den which resulted in den abandonment by the arctic fox. On July 19, eight arctic fox pups were observed on the den before the red fox was observed on the same den July 22. The pups were never seen at the den or elsewhere after the red fox was observed on the den for as long as we stayed in the area (until August 10). Our observation supports the view that direct interference with red fox on breeding dens may contribute to the range retraction of arctic foxes from the southern limits of the Arctic tundra in Russia.","[Rodnikova, Anna] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Fac Biol, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Rodnikova, Anna; Ims, Rolf A.; Skogstad, Gunhild] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Sokolov, Alexander; Shtro, Victor] Russian Acad Sci, Ecol Res Stn, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, Ural Div, Labytnangi 629400, Russia; [Sokolov, Vasily] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, Ural Div, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Fuglei, Eva] FRAM Ctr, Norwegian Polar Inst, N-9296 Tromso, Norway","Rodnikova, A (corresponding author), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Fac Biol, Leninskije Gory 1, Moscow 119991, Russia.",anna.rodnikova@gmail.com,"Sokolov, Aleksandr/P-3421-2017; Sokolov, Vasiliy/B-3657-2013","Sokolov, Aleksandr/0000-0002-1521-3856; Sokolov, Vasiliy/0000-0002-0115-3151",Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,"We want to thank Victor Sidorov, Polina, Takuchi, and Daniil Laptander for valuable help during fieldwork, Takuchi Laptander for information about the current occurrence of red fox at Erkatayakha River and Peter Castell who was leading the expedition Breeding birds of the Western Palearctic from June 23 to July 1 and provided us with the first breeding information from the focal den reporting from in the present study.

Mixed effects models indicated that species partitioned use of water features spatially and temporally. Linear models indicated factors influencing relative activity at water features varied by species. For coyotes and bobcats, the water availability model, containing days since last rainfall and nearest-neighbor distance to water was best supported by the data, with relative activity increasing with time between rainfall and distance between waters. For gray foxes, the best approximating model indicated that relative activity was inversely correlated to coyote and bobcat activity indices, and positively correlated to topographical complexity. Encounters between carnivore species were low, with most occurring between coyotes and gray foxes, followed by coyotes and bobcats, and bobcats and gray foxes.

Native to the Americas, cane toads Bufo marinus are an invasive species causing substantial ecological impacts in Australia. We need ways to control invasive species such as cane toads without collateral damage to native fauna. 2. We explored the feasibility of suppressing survival and growth of cane toad tadpoles via competition with the tadpoles of native frogs. Compared to the invasive toads, many native frogs breed earlier in the season and their tadpoles grow larger and have longer larval periods. Hence, adding spawn or tadpoles of native frogs to toad-breeding sites might increase tadpole competition, and thereby reduce toad recruitment. 3. Our laboratory trials using tadpoles of eight native frog species gave significant results: the presence of six of these species (Cyclorana australis, C. longipes, Litoria caerulea, L. dahlii, L. rothii and L. splendida) reduced toad tadpole survival and/or size at metamorphosis. Litoria caerulea also increased the duration of the larval period of cane toad tadpoles. Tadpoles of the other two frog species (Litoria rubella and Litoria tornieri) did not affect survival or growth of larval cane toads any more than did an equivalent number of additional toad tadpoles. Native frog species with larger tadpoles exerted greater negative effects on toad tadpoles than did native species with smaller tadpoles. 4. Synthesis and applications. Encouraging the general public to construct and restore waterbodies in peri-urban areas to build up populations of native frogs - especially the much-loved green tree frog Litoria caerulea- could help to reduce recruitment rates of invasive cane toads in Australia.","[Cabrera-Guzman, Elisa; Crossland, Michael; Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Shine, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rick.shine@sydney.edu.au,"Crossland, Michael R/G-1091-2012","Crossland, Michael R/0000-0001-9967-7158",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; National Council on Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); Australian GovernmentAustralian GovernmentCGIAR; University of SydneyUniversity of Sydney,"We thank Greg Brown, Matt Greenlees and Ligia Pizzatto for assistance, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful criticisms of an earlier draft of this manuscript.

Location Great Britain. Methods We modelled the environmental favourability for the deer species using variables related with spatial location, climate, topography, human disturbances and habitat structure. Favourability values of each pair of native (naturalized)-introduced species were used to estimate the fuzzy overlap index (FOvI) as a measure of overall similarity between the environmental requirements for the species in Great Britain. The absolute local overlap values (FOvI-L) were also used to measure the degree to which a given location was favourable simultaneously for each pair of species. We assessed the trends of species favourability across a range defined by the absolute local overlap values and studied the shape of the obtained curves since they informs us about the favourability balance between the studied species. Results Muntjac and Chinese water deer attained higher favourability values than native species in localities with intermediate values of FOvI-L (a reduced number in the study area), suggesting that if competitive relationships were established in these localities the introduced deer species may have some advantages over natives. Sika deer only achieved higher values than fallow deer in those localities clearly unfavourable for the naturalized species. Our analyses predicted that fallow deer will be less affected by the introduced deer species than native species. Main conclusions We developed an approach based on the favourability function to describe biogeographical relationships between species, natives and introduced and to assess from a biogeographical perspective if introduced species could pose a competitive risk to natives. Although the results of present analyses do not conclusively demonstrate competitive exclusion, they provide directional hypotheses that can be tested in experimental field and laboratory studies.","[Acevedo, Pelayo; Real, Raimundo] Univ Malaga, Biogeog Divers & Conservat Res Team, Dept Anim Biol, Fac Sci, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Acevedo, Pelayo; Ward, Alastair I.; Smith, Graham C.] Food & Environm Res Agcy, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England; [Acevedo, Pelayo] CSIC UCLM JCCM, IREC, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain","Acevedo, P (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Biogeog Divers & Conservat Res Team, Dept Anim Biol, Fac Sci, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",pacevedo@irec.csic.es,"Ward, Alastair/J-5616-2014; Smith, Graham C/J-2593-2013; Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010; Acevedo, Pelayo/L-6737-2013","Smith, Graham C/0000-0002-9897-6794; Real, Raimundo/0000-0002-6642-1284; Acevedo, Pelayo/0000-0002-3509-7696; Ward, Alastair/0000-0002-3305-3323",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion - Fondo Social EuropeoEuropean Social Fund (ESF)Spanish Government;  [CGL2006-09567/BOS];  [P05-RNM-00935];  [CGL2009-11316],"Our gratitude to P.

These species periodically reach outbreak densities, but it is unknown if they impact the population dynamics of later developing egg-overwintering grasshopper species. Two experiments were conducted in a northern mixed-grass prairie to examine the effects of herbivory by nymph-overwintering grasshoppers on survival of an egg-overwintering grasshopper, Ageneotettix deorum. When very high densities of nymph-overwintering grasshoppers reduced grass biomass by 80%, survival of A. deorum nymphs was significantly reduced. There was no effect of early season herbivory at a lower density of 16/m(2) on survival of A. deorum nymphs. The effects of early season herbivory appear consistent with exploitative competition. Although a strong reduction in peak grass biomass caused by early season herbivory negatively affected late season grass-feeding grasshopper densities, additional research is needed to examine the potential importance of early summer herbivory on population dynamics of later developing grasshoppers.","ARS, USDA, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Branson, DH (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, No Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",dave.branson@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,28,4,5,0,10,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,ANNAPOLIS,"3 PARK PLACE, STE 307, ANNAPOLIS, MD 21401-3722 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

This situation provided an opportunity to evaluate in situ environmental and interspecific heterogeneity in shell and tissue growth. Shell dry weight, carbon content, and shell strength of D. polymorpha from the four spatially discrete water masses differed significantly. For instance, D. polymorpha total and tissue mass increased over the summer in the shallow fluvial Lac Saint-Pierre but decreased in the upstream and downstream water masses. Standardized shell mass and strength of a polymorpha was lowest where the mussels experienced salinity or low calcium. Although the response pattern of mass and glycogen content for D. polymorpha was spatially complex, mussels from the stressful oligohaline estuary population had the weakest shells and lowest glycogen content, even though their standardized tissue mass was the heaviest. This disparity in shell and tissue response suggests that some aspect of shell physiology alone may be limiting these mussels in estuarine environments. Tissue characteristics of D. polymorpha and D. bugensis were similar at the site where both were present, but the shell strength of D. bugensis was only equivalent to the weakest of D. polymorpha. We also conclude that lighter shells might make D. bugensis more susceptible to predation or mechanical damage but may also offer a bioenergetic advantage that is contributing to its rapid displacement of D. polymorpha where the two species co-occur.

In Moorea, French Polynesia, surveys were used to quantify habitat association for juvenile Thalassoma hardwicke and 7 sympatric labroid species. Having identified the 3 species most similar to focal T. hardwicke in habitat association, a field assay was used to determine if the presence of larger individuals of these species adversely affected the survival of focal individuals. Finally, a field experiment was used to test how competition with larger residents and structural refuge interact to influence survival of transplanted T. hardwicke. Surveys demonstrated that Gomphosus varius, Pseudocheilinus hexataenia, and T. quinquevittatum were most similar to T. hardwicke in habitat association. In the field assay, the presence of T. quinquevittatum had the greatest negative effect on survival of T. hardwicke. The field experiment revealed that competition with T. quinquevittatum and structural refuge both altered T. hardwicke survival, although their effects were not interactive. Survival of T. hardwicke was 2.3 times greater in treatments without T. quinquevittatum relative to those with T. quinquevittatum, and 2.8 times greater in treatments with structural refuge relative to those without structural refuge. The additive effect may have occurred via the establishment of social dominance hierarchies between transplanted T. hardwicke and resident T. quinquevittatum independently of structural refuge, suggesting that it is important to account for interactions occurring independently of resources when examining resource competition.","Victoria Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Sch Biol Sci, POB 6140, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",shane.geange@vuw.ac.nz,,"Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0242312]; VUW; Fulbright-Ministry of Research, Science and Technology","C.

Understanding the population dynamics of important species within these forests in response to past climatic variability provides valuable insight into current and future species composition. Here, we use a population-level approach to analyse palaeo-ecological records over the last 5300 years to understand how populations of Symphonia cf. verrucosa became locally extinct in some rainforest fragments along the southeast coast of Madagascar in response to rapid climate change, yet persisted in others. Our results indicate that regional ( climate) variability contributed to synchronous decline of S. cf. verrucosa populations in these forests. Superimposed on regional fluctuations were local processes that could have contributed or mitigated extinction. Specifically, in the forest with low soil nutrients, population model predictions indicated that there was coexistence between S. cf. verrucosa and Erica spp., but in the nutrient-rich forest, interspecific effects between Symphonia and Erica spp. may have pushed Symphonia to extinction at the peak of climatic change.

Nonetheless, changes in behavior (e.g., activity patterns) may provide equally important insights into responses to disturbance that have conservation or management implications. Because many neotropical bats provide critical ecosystem services, their responses may be of particular conservation concern. We evaluated the effects of season and habitat conversion on temporal activity patterns of 8 abundant species of frugivorous bats in lowland tropical rain forest of Iquitos, Peru. Season had little effect on activity patterns of any species of bat. Five species exhibited different activity patterns in primary or secondary forest compared to agricultural habitats. No interspecific differences in activity patterns occurred in primary forest. In agricultural areas, the patterns of activity of Carollia benkeithi and Rhinophylla pumilio were distinct from those of other species. In secondary forest, activity patterns of Artibeus lituratus and R. pumilio were distinct from those of other species. Temporal activity patterns of common frugivores overlapped more than expected by chance, regardless of season or habitat. Neotropical frugivores avoid open areas during twilight to reduce risk of predation. Nonetheless, to meet their considerable minimum daily caloric intake requirements, frugivores forage throughout most of the night. Increased habitat fragmentation may effectively reduce foraging times and subject bats to increased risk from predators during twilight and periods of great lunar illumination, when bats avoid open areas.","[Presley, Steven J.; Willig, Michael R.; Castro-Arellano, Ivan] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Presley, Steven J.; Willig, Michael R.; Castro-Arellano, Ivan] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Galveston, Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Weaver, Scott C.] Univ Texas Galveston, Med Branch, Ctr Trop Dis, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Presley, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",steven.presley@uconn.edu,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014; Presley, Steven/AAE-9189-2020; Weaver, Scott C/D-6490-2011","Presley, Steven/0000-0002-5987-0735; Weaver, Scott C/0000-0001-8016-8556; Castro-Arellano, Ivan/0000-0002-0696-8982",,,,65,49,58,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

To shed further tight on the topic, the present work investigated the capacity of soil. microarthropods to colonise defaunated soil in the presence and absence of earthworms. Microcosms composed of plastic boxes were prepared with a central cage containing two endogeic earthworms (Hormogaster elisae). In one experiment, the cage contained defaunated natural, soil white that outside was non-defaunated. In a second experiment, the soil outside the cage was defaunated white that inside the cage was non-defaunated. All microcosms were kept at 13 degrees C with 20% soil-water content for 21 days before extracting microarthropods for enumeration by standard methods. In the first experiment, the majority of microarthropod groups were not able to colonise the defaunated soil containing earthworms, but did colonise it when earthworms were absent. In the second experiment, nearly all the microarthropod groups left the central cages containing earthworms, white in the controls without earthworms the majority stayed inside. The results indicate that different microarthropod taxa are affected unequally by the presence of the earthworms. Due to their greater mobility Tarsonemidae and sometimes Gamasida were able to colonise the defaunated soil even when earthworms were present. In contrast, Oribatida, members of which disperse slowly and are very sensitive to soil perturbations, were generally unable to colonise the soil whether earthworms were present or not. However, the presence of H. elisae had a negative effect on the numbers of most groups of microarthropods and on their ability to colonise new environments. Physico-chemical perturbations produced by endogeic earthworms acting as ecosystem engineers, competition for organic matter and passive predation are discussed as possible causes of this negative effect.

Several cases emphasize the fact that chemical signals or defence may modulate interspecific interactions. Notably, it has been shown that diatoms, unicellular algae and key primary producers in aquatic ecosystems produce a wide range of bioactive metabolites. Among these compounds, polyunsaturated short-chain aldehydes in vitro strongly impair the reproduction of various potential grazers. In the field, the relationship between aldehyde production and reproductive failure in copepods remains unclear. Recent studies have suggested that these putative defence compounds may also be involved in intercellular communication and in interactions with competitors. Potential effects of the aldehyde precursors on various organisms have also been described. This review presents an overview of various results obtained in the last decade that could help us to understand the role of polyunsaturated aldehydes and their precursors in the ecology of diatoms. It is focused on the dichotomy between freshwater and marine environments. Indeed, most of the results on anti-proliferative aldehydes concern marine planktonic diatoms, whereas they are also known to be produced by benthic and freshwater species.","[Leflaive, Josephine; Ten-Hage, Loic] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMR 5245, Lab Ecol Fonct EcoLab,INPT, F-31062 Toulouse 09, France","Leflaive, J (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMR 5245, Lab Ecol Fonct EcoLab,INPT, Bat 4R3,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 09, France.",leflaive@cict.fr,"Ten-Hage, Loic/T-2789-2019; Leflaive, Josephine/F-2075-2018","Leflaive, Josephine/0000-0003-3605-349X",,,,103,56,58,2,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,,2009,184,4,,,,,794,805,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03033.x,,,12,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,517UP,WOS:000271644500007,19754636,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

In addition, policy and restoration measures mandated to conform to ecosystem-based management principals can benefit from information on temporal and spatial variability in community-level interactions. Here, we analyzed guild structure of the demersal fish assemblage in Puget Sound, WA, a temperate estuarine system on the US west coast. Using diet information from 2,401 stomachs collected across three seasons (fall, winter, and summer), we identified guild membership for 21 fish species, examined seasonal guild switching, and tested for seasonal shifts in predation and for differences in the degree of diet overlap at the assemblage level. We accounted for ontogenetic variation in diet by dividing species into large (L) and small (S) size classes when appropriate. Using cluster analysis and a permutation approach, we identified seven significant guilds that were typified by predation on benthic invertebrates, pelagic invertebrates, and piscivory. Of the 18 species with more than one season of diet information, six switched guilds (Pacific sanddab L, sturgeon poacher, Pacific tomcod S, speckled sanddab, rex sole, and rock sole S). At the assemblage level, we tested for seasonal differences in prey use between seasons by performing an analysis of similarities based on Bray-Curtis diet similarities and found no significant difference. However, diet overlap was significantly higher in the summer than the fall and winter (with summer > fall > winter) indicating that diets within the assemblage converged in the summer. These results indicate that analyses of guild structure and diet overlap can reveal seasonal variation in community trophic structure and highlight intra-annual food web variation in the Puget Sound demersal fish community.","[Reum, Jonathan C.

However, there is growing evidence that negative interactions among distantly related taxa also occur and may be far more important than previously thought. In this study, we took advantage of an 11-year-old replicated vertebrate-exclosure experiment in a coastal dune community in northern California, USA, to examine the effects of the two most common vertebrate herbivores (jackrabbits and black-tailed deer) on the abundance of the three most visible invertebrate herbivores (two snail, a moth, and a grasshopper species). Our results indicate that four of the six possible pairwise interactions were significantly negative for the invertebrates. Jackrabbits reduced the abundances of snails by 44-75%, tiger moth caterpillars by 36%, and grasshoppers by 62%. Deer reduced the abundances of snails by 32%, increased the abundances of caterpillars by 31%, and had no measurable effect on grasshopper abundance. Our data also revealed that jackrabbits significantly decreased the volume of forbs and common shrubs and the flowering by grasses in our study plots. We were unable to detect an effect of deer on these measures of vegetation. These results suggest that by changing vegetation, jackrabbits may reduce invertebrate populations that are limited by food, protective structures, or microclimate provided by plants. Of these three mechanisms, only shade was strongly supported as limiting snail numbers in smaller-scale manipulations. In most systems, as in this one, the number of pairs of distantly related herbivores far exceeds the number of pairs of congeners. Since interactions among distantly related herbivores may be common in many cases, these interactions are likely to be important and should receive far more attention from ecologists.","[Huntzinger, Mikaela] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Cushman, Hall] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA","Huntzinger, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,40,35,37,0,51,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2008,89,7,,,,,1972,1980,,10.1890/07-0834.1,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,331JC,WOS:000258007500019,18705383,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

However, their species identity frequently remains unknown. Here we present long-term data (1975-2005) from a central European woodland on the predatory effect of three dormice species (Rodentia, Gliridae) on cavity-nesting birds. Dormice are mostly frugivorous during the active late-summer season, but shortly after they terminate hibernation, they frequently depredate cavity-nesting-bird nests. The seven bird species studied, lost on average between 2.9 to 18.4% of their broods. Migratory Ficedula flycatchers suffered the highest brood losses, while the resident Parus titmice and the nuthatch Sitta europaea had much lower brood losses. The three dormice species differed significantly in their predatory effect during different avian breeding stages. The edible dormouse Glis glis (Linnaeus, 1766) depredated both eggs and nestlings equally, while the common dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius (Linnaeus, 1758) and the forest dormouse Dryomys nitedula (Pallas, 1778) destroyed more nests during egg laying and the incubation period. Among adult birds, females were taken more frequently by dormice than males. Among avian species, adult Ficedula flycatchers were more often depredated than the titmice and nuthatch. Our study provided further evidence, that among the traditional studies on the costs of reproduction, parental mortality at the nests needs to be considered and that incubating or brooding females might be under higher predation risk than the males.","[Adamik, Peter] Museum Nat Hist, Nam Republ 5, Olomouc 77173, Czech Republic; [Adamik, Peter] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Ornithol Lab, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic","Adamik, P (corresponding author), Museum Nat Hist, Nam Republ 5, Olomouc 77173, Czech Republic.",peter.adamik@upol.cz,"Adamik, Peter/I-2057-2013","Adamik, Peter/0000-0003-1566-1234",,,,45,29,31,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0001-7051,2190-3743,,ACTA THERIOL,Acta Theriol.,APR,2008,53,2,,,,,185,192,,10.1007/BF03194251,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,293PP,WOS:000255347500009,,,,,2021-09-21,

However, most animal taxa contain kleptoparasitic members. In many ways, adult birds are aberrant because most are acrobatic, capable of three-dimensional movement, and steal from hosts that are capable of similar feats. The mobility of kleptoparasites and their hosts falls along a continuum, with the acrobatic birds at one end and sessile hosts and kleptoparasites at the other. Considering sedentary systems requires amendments to the criteria previously outlined as necessary for kleptoparasitism. Kleptoparasitic interactions between agile participants are ephemeral, involve numerous hosts over the lifetime of the kleptoparasite, and usually rely on vision. Large concentrations of hosts and large, high-quality food items are important in mobile systems. By contrast, the long-term, intimate associations of sedentary interactions demand that the host not consume the kleptoparasite's offspring and that the host must either have a longer life cycle than the kleptoparasite or be located in aggregations that have staggered life cycles (so the kleptoparasite can move to a new host when the original host dies). Expanding studies of kleptoparasitism to other taxa will differentiate between the selective pressures and evolutionary responses that are universal among kleptoparasitic symbioses and those that are restricted to certain groups.

However, a problem arises for understanding coexistence of multiple species if they share critical resources too generally. Here, we employ an experimental framework grounded in nutritional physiology to show that closely related, cooccurring and generalist-feeding herbivores (seven grasshopper species in the genus Melanoplus; Orthoptera: Acrididae) eat protein and carbohydrate in different absolute amounts and ratios even if they eat the same plant taxa. The existence of species-specific nutritional niches provides a cryptic mechanism that helps explain how generalist herbivores with broadly overlapping diets might coexist. We also show that performance by grasshoppers allowed to mix their diets and thus regulate their protein-carbohydrate intake matched optimal performance peaks generated from nochoice treatments. These results indicate the active nature of diet selection to achieve balanced diets and provide buffering capacity in the face of variable food quality. Our empirical findings and experimental approach can be extended to generate and test predictions concerning the intensity of biotic interactions between species, the relative abundance of species, yearly fluctuations in population size, and the nature of interactions with natural enemies in tritrophic niche space.","[Behmer, Spencer T.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Joern, Anthony] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Behmer, ST (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, Heep Bldg,Room 509, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",s-behmer@tamu.edu,,"Behmer, Spencer/0000-0002-5038-1046",,,,52,161,169,1,104,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Bark beetles Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. frontalis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are known to have common pheromone components, except for exo-brevicomin, which is produced by D. brevicomis. We predicted that D. frontalis would not respond to exo-brevicomin outside of the zone of sympatry with D. brevicomis. We conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of exo-brevicomin on attraction of D. frontalis and associated species in Mississippi. We determined whether D. frontalis pheromone production differed inside and outside the sympatric zone and compared the pheromone profiles with D. brevicomis within the sympatric zone. Trapping studies revealed that D. frontalis can perceive and respond positively to exo-brevicomin, an aggregation pheromone of a sympatric congener (D. brevicomis), at locations hundreds of kilometers outside the sympatric zone. Qualitative pheromone profiles showed that both species emit similar pheromone components: frontalin, endo-brevicomin, exo-brevicomin, trans-verbenol, verbenone, and myrtenol. Although not previously reported, D. frontalis males from Arizona produced exo-brevicomin. The predator Thanasimus dubius did not discriminate traps baited with exo-brevicomin and was most attracted to traps with frontalin. Hylastes beetles were significantly attracted to traps baited with exo-brevicomin in combination with other compounds. Our results raise new practical and evolutionary questions on the role of exo-brevicomin in the behavioral ecology of D.frontalis.

Density is largely limited by food, and to a lesser extent, suitable natal dens, but also is influenced by potential competitors and predators. Local abundance of G. sabrinus frequently is correlated with density of large trees and snags, shrub and canopy cover, prevalence of old-forest features (e.g., coarse woody debris), and abundance of hypogeous mycorrhizal fungi (truffles). Diet varies seasonally and among habitats, but truffles (spring and autumn) and lichens (winter) are most often reported. In some parts of its geographic range, G. sabrinus has a more diverse diet and lower reliance on truffles in forests with a depauperate arboreal small mammal community. G. sabrinus is a keystone species in the Pacific Northwest, because its diet facilitates an obligate mutualistic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and some trees and shrubs and because it is essential prey for mesocarnivores and avian predators. G. sabrinus achieves its highest densities in old growth, but also occurs in secondary forests. Disturbance that reduces structural complexity, canopy cover, or the availability of large, decadent trees typically results in smaller populations through effects on food, den sites, or risk of predation. The fundamental niche of G. sabrinus may be broader than suggested by early research in the Pacific Northwest. Sustaining viable and well-distributed populations in heavily modified landscapes will depend on the capability of remaining forest habitat to sustain breeding populations without immigration, or functional connectivity among fragmented populations such that viable metapopulations will persist. Future research should focus on identifying habitat conditions that sustain breeding populations in modified habitats and determining whether G. sabrinus can migrate freely through a matrix of unsuitable habitat.","US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Juneau, AK 99801 USA","Smith, WP (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, 2770 Sherwood Lane,Suite 2A, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.",winstonsmith@fs.fed.us,,,,,,141,49,50,2,65,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 of five sympatric cyclopoid copepod species and of bulk POM from a eutrophic lake over a one-year period, to determine if stable isotope derived-data from the field supported the hypotheses from feeding studies. Cyclops abyssorum and C. vicinus differed significantly in delta N-15 but not in delta C-13, inferring assimilation from similar carbon sources but differentiation in their trophic position. Cyclops abyssorum delta N-15 typically was 1-2% higher than C. vicinus, suggesting a more predatory feeding mode compared to its congener. The summer species Mesocyclops leuckarti, Thermocyclops oithonoides and Diacyclops bicuspidatus exhibited considerable differences in delta C-13. The lower delta C-13 of the hypolimnetic D. bicuspidatus compared to the two epilimnetic species indicates a food niche differentiation by vertical separation. All copepod delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures showed seasonal fluctuations, with low values in winter and high values in summer. The delta C-13 of seston was generally higher than copepod delta C-13. We regard selective feeding from the bulk POM, spatial separation of feeding and assimilation of C-13 depleted food sources responsible for this phenomenon.","Max Planck Inst Limnol, D-24302 Plon, Germany; Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England","Santer, B (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Limnol, Post Box 165, D-24302 Plon, Germany.",Santer@mpil-ploen.mpg.de; n.sommerwerk@the-blue.net; j.grey@qmul.ac.uk,"Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012","Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271",,,,59,19,20,0,9,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

To investigate the efficacy of different behavioral tactics adopted for their acquisition (locomotion, attendance at shell-supplying sites, interactions with conspecifics in aggregation) we conducted observations and experiments at a salt marsh in New England (USA). Locomotion, fast and meandering, significantly increased the chances of encountering empty shells and conspecifics. However, shell exchanges were rare. Simulated gastropod predation sites quickly attracted a larger number of hermit crabs than the other shell-supplying sites tested (live and dead conspecifics, live snails) and induced the rapid occupancy of all the empty shells offered, usually by the first crabs arriving at the site. Aggregations seemed not to function as shell exchange markets, as previously suggested for several other species. In the short run, exploitation seems to be more efficient for the acquisition of new shells by Pagurus longicarpus. In the long run, it is the density of nondestructive gastropod predators that regulates the availability of new shells of good quality in the pool available to this hermit crab species.","Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet Leo Pardi, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Gherardi, F (corresponding author), Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet Leo Pardi, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",francesca.gherardi@unifi.it,,,,,,66,29,29,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

For both sexes, the defence intensity increased from the pre-laying to the chick-rearing period. The intensity of nest defence was significantly higher in males during the pre-laying period but no sex differences were found during the incubation and chick-rearing periods. Competition for nest sites, food and the potential risk of predation may affect the bearded vulture's nest defence behaviour towards other species. Most agonistic interactions took place against Eurasian griffon Vultures (the most abundant species and the most important competing for nest sites) and common ravens (the most likely potential predator and. a kleptoparasitic species). Nest defence against conspecifics mainly took place during the pre-laying. period and may be linked to sperm competition and food resource competition.","Grp Estudio & Protect Quebrantahuesos, E-25520 El Pont De Suert, Lleida, Spain","Margalida, A (corresponding author), Grp Estudio & Protect Quebrantahuesos, Apdo 43, E-25520 El Pont De Suert, Lleida, Spain.",margalid@gauss.entorno.es,"Margalida, Antoni/AAG-5337-2020; Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011; Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011","Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-0576-3993; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-3904-6212; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-7383-671X",,,,66,21,23,1,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

Although their habitat preferences are clearly different, habitat overlap can occur. Their habitat preferences can largely be explained by the overall territory-specific vegetation structure (all components included in the discriminant analysis). The transition from woodland to scrubs and from scrubland to short grasslands explains 92% of the total variance within the species' habitat characteristics. Species of the different genera (Sylvia, Phylloscopus, Acrocephalus, Locustella) show a large amount of habitat overlap. Within the Phylloscopus and Sylvia-genus, only the Lesser Whitethroat S. curruca and the Whitethroat S. communis use the same breeding habitat. Although the other congeneric species show distinct habitat characteristics, a priori classification cannot predict territory occupancy without errors: only 78.3% of the two Phylloscopus-territories and 58.3% of the Sylvia-territories were correctly classified. This indicates a certain amount of territory settlement in non-typical habitats, where competition can occur between sister species. All possible interactions between congenerics were studied by comparing the expected (based on the total of wrong classifications in the typical habitat of the other) and the observed coexistence. The number of wrong classifications could only be explained by real coexistence in the species pair S. borin-S. curruca. Interactions between all other congeneric species pairs were asymmetrical, resulting in distinct territory occupancy with one dominant species. S. borin was always the dominant species, whereas S. communis was never dominant within the possible interactions. In general, species typical for higher vegetation were dominant (with the exception of the species pair S. atricapilla-S. borin). Direct and song aggressiveness are probably the driving forces for the observed territory segregation. Our results confirm and supplement the findings of CODY (1978), who studied similar habitat and territory segregation in Sylviine Warblers in England, Southern Sweden and Sardinia.","[Bonte, Dries] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Lab Anim Ecol Zoogeog & Nat Conservat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Provoost, Sam; Hoffmann, Maurice] Inst Nat Conservat, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium","Bonte, D (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Lab Anim Ecol Zoogeog & Nat Conservat, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",dries.bonte@rug.ac.be,"Provoost, Sam/H-7278-2013","Provoost, Sam/0000-0003-2751-5269","LIFE, Integral Coastal Conservation Initiative (monitoring of fauna, flora and vegetation in the Flemish coastal dunes)","We would like to thank referee E.

To understand such diversity, Newstrom et al. provided a systematic framework for the classification of tropical flowering phenology. They adopted frequency and regularity as criteria with priority, and classified plants in La Selva, Costa Rica, where most plants reproduced more than once a year irregularly. Many other studies have demonstrated annual cycles corresponding to rainfall patterns at the community level in Neotropical forests, including La Selva. On the other hand, supraannual flowering synchronized among various plant species, called general flowering, is known from aseasonal lowland dipterocarp forests in Southeast Asia. Within both forests, a wide spectrum of flowering patterns is found. This range of patterns suggests the great potential of tropical phenological studies to explore the selective pressures on phenology. Various abiotic and biotic factors can be selective agents. The shared pollinators hypothesis suggests that plant species sharing pollinators segregate flowering temporarily to minimize interspecific overlap in flowering times and thus minimize ineffective pollination or competition for pollinators, indicating strong phylogenetic constraints in timing and variation of flowering. Comparison of phenology within and among forests may help our understanding of phenological diversity. Attempts are now being made to develop a common language to communicate concepts and render interpretations of data more compatible among investigators and to create a network to promote comparative studies.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ancon, Panama","Sakai, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",,,"Sakai, Shoko/0000-0002-4267-8405",,,,117,99,110,2,77,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",1438-3896,,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

Even if the debate between the validity of these two hypotheses remains open, one prediction is that living in flocks can favor increased survival rates. We gathered published and unpublished data from various tropical forests where bird species forage (1) exclusively alone or in pairs (2) in heterospecific flocks some of the time (facultative flock members), or (3) exclusively in heterospecific year-long associations (obligate flock members). We controlled statistically for effects of body size, nest type, clutch size, and phylogeny, and tested whether survival rates differed among these three groups. The survival rates of the obligate flock members (mean survival rate 68.7%, range 48.0-87.0%) were significantly higher than estimates for the species feeding alone or in pairs (mean survival rate 58.3%, range 33.0-79.0%). However, survival rates of the facultative hock members (mean survival rate 60.4%, range 40.0-79.0%) did not differ from those of the nonflocking species. Nevertheless, causes of such differences in survival can be explained by an alternative hypothesis. Life history theory predicts that higher survival for the obligate flocking species may be a response to low fecundity and productivity. Yet, the pattern high survivorship, strikingly low fecundity documented in obligate flocking species has never been observed among their solitary or facultative flocking counterparts. This result suggests that permanent obligate flocking can be an alternative ecological factor that may drive the evolution of life histories in tropical birds.","Ecole Normale Super, Ecol Lab, CNRS, URA 258, F-75230 Paris 05, France; Inst Ecol, CNRS, URA 258, F-75252 Paris, France","Jullien, M (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Avian Studies Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,,,,,,113,93,97,0,42,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2000,81,12,,,,,3416,3430,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[3416:TSVOFI]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,387QZ,WOS:000166134400014,,,,,2021-09-21,

Derived indices were then compared with published data from eels. Composition of helminth communities differed considerably between the two hosts as a group of 4 species occurred commonly in trout and so gave greater predictability to the community composition. These 4 species were trout specialists and in 97 % of the localities a trout specialist dominated the community rather than a generalist acanthocephalan as is typical for eels. By contrast all measures of community structure and indices of richness and diversity indicated that helminth communities in trout were isolationist in character, species poor and exhibited low diversity at both component and infracommunity levels. All values of indices for trout helminth communities were strikingly similar to those obtained from eels. Evidence of interspecific interactions within the trout helminth communities and a limit of 4 to infracommunity species richness further enhanced the similarities and suggested a common determinant of community structure. The hypothesis was thus supported in respect of species composition but refuted in respect of community structure.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biol Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Nina Niku, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway","Kennedy, CR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Biol Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",C.R.Kennedy@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,40,40,40,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,JUL,2000,121,,1,,,,55,64,,10.1017/S0031182099006046,,,10,Parasitology,Parasitology,345YQ,WOS:000088843200007,11085225,,,,2021-09-21,

It has spread by purposeful introduction of rooted plants and dispersal of seeds on the tides. Previous work suggested that S. alterniflora was competitively superior to the native California cordgrass, S. foliosa, and that the two species hybridized. The present study determined the spread of S. alterniflora and S. foliosa x alterniflora hybrids in California and examined the degree of hybridization. We used nuclear DNA markers diagnostic for each species to detect the parental species and nine categories of hybrids. The California coast outside San Francisco Bay contained only the native species. All hybrid categories exist in the Bay, implying that several generations of crossing have occurred and that hybridization is bidirectional. Hybrids were found principally near sites of deliberate introduction of the exotic species. Where S. alterniflora was deliberately planted, we found approximately equal numbers of S. alterniflora and hybrid individuals; S. foliosa was virtually absent. Marshes colonized by water-dispersed seed contained the full gamut of phenotypes with intermediate-type hybrids predominating. The proliferation of hybrids could result in local extinction of S. foliosa. What is more, S. alterniflora has the ability to greatly modify the estuary ecosystem to the detriment of other native species and human uses of the Bay. To the extent that they share these engineering abilities, the proliferation of cordgrass hybrids could grossly alter the character of the San Francisco Bay.","Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA","Ayres, DR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Box 247, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",,,,,,,25,106,114,0,40,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We manipulated the densities of resident tit species (Par us spp.). In four study plots residents were removed before the arrival of the migrants in the first study year, and in four other plots their densities were increased by releasing caught individuals. In the second year the treatments of the areas were reversed, allowing paired comparisons within each plot. We also investigated the relative abundance of arthropods in the study plots by the sweep-net method. This allowed us to estimate the effect of food resources on the abundance of birds. The heterospecific attraction hypothesis predicts that densities of migrant species (especially habitat generalists) would be higher during increased resident density. Results supported this prediction. Densities and number of the most abundant migrant species were significantly higher when resident density was increased than when they were removed. On the species level the redwing (Turdus iliacus) showed the strongest positive response to the increased abundance of tits. Migrant bird abundances seemed not to vary in parallel with relative arthropod abundance, with the exception of the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) which showed a strongly positive correlation with many arthropod groups. The results of the experiment indicate that migrants can use resident tit species as a cue to a profitable breeding patch. The relationship between the abundance of the birds and arthropods suggests that annual changes in food resources during the breeding season probably do not have a very important effect on bird populations in these areas. The results stress the importance of positive interspecific interactions in structuring northern breeding bird communities.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90571 Oulu, Finland; Finnish Game & Res Inst, Meltaus Game Res Stn, FIN-97340 Meltaus, Finland","Forsman, JT (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 333, FIN-90571 Oulu, Finland.",,"Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011; Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,62,61,62,0,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,278,286,,10.1007/s004420050517,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700034,28308463,,,,2021-09-21,

Multiple parasite infections occur frequently in populations of wild animals as well as in humans from developing countries. In some species and regions, hosts with multiple infections are more common than hosts with either no infection or a single infection. Studies, predominantly on animals, show that a wide variety of environmental and host-dependent factors can influence the structure and dynamics of the communities of parasites that make up these multiple infections. In addition, synergistic and competitive interactions can occur between parasite species, which can influence the likelihood of their successful transmission to other hosts and increase or decrease their overall pathogenic impact. This review summarises aspects of our current knowledge on the frequency of multiparasite infections, the factors which influence them, and their pathogenic significance.

Ontogenetic differentiation of jaws and snout teeth allow larger Roeboides to remove scales, however, the less specialized tooth/jaw structure in Roeboides dayi, indicates that it may be a facultative scale feeder. Population dynamics and diets of R. dayi in a Venezuelan lowland swamp/creek and a piedmont stream were compared over an annual cycle. Juvenile R. dayi consumed aquatic insect larvae and microcrustacea, and although spawning was year-round at both sites, most reproduction occurred during the wet season when the availability of these resources was greatest for juveniles. At both sites, larger R. dayi fed on a combination of invertebrate prey and fish scales, the former being more important at the piedmont site, and the latter being especially important during initial low water conditions at both sites. In the lowland stream, the reduction of aquatic habitat during the early dry season created higher fish densities and a more profitable environment for scale-feeders. Insectivory probably was less profitable during this early low water period due to interspecific competition for reduced aquatic insect stocks.",,"Peterson, CC (corresponding author), TEXAS A&M UNIV,DEPT WILDLIFE & FISHERIES SCI,COLLEGE STN,TX 77843, USA.",,,"Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129",,,,25,27,31,1,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

The effects of defoliation frequencies (4 and 7 cuts in 1993; 4 and 8 cuts in 1994/95) and nitrogen fertilization (10 and 42 g m(-2) y(-1) N in 1993; 14 and 56 g m(-2) y(-1) in 1994/95) on the growth response to pCO(2) were investigated. There were significant interspecific differences in the CO2 responses during the first two years, while in the third growing season, these interspecific differences disappeared. Yield of T. repens in monocultures increased in the first two years by 20% when grown at elevated pCO(2). This CO2 response was independent of defoliation frequency and nitrogen fertilization. In the third year, the CO2 response of T. repens declined to 11%. In contrast, yield of L. perenne monocultures increased by only 7% on average over three years at elevated pCO(2). The yield response of L. perenne to CO2 changed according to defoliation frequency and nitrogen fertilization, mainly in the second and third year. The ratio of root/yield of L. perenne increased under elevated pCO(2), low N fertilizer rate, and frequent defoliation, but it remained unchanged in T. repens. We suggest that the more abundant root growth of L. perenne was related to increased N limitation under elevated pCO(2). The consequence of these interspecific differences in the CO2 response was a higher proportion of T. repens in the mixed swards at elevated pCO(2). This was evident in all combinations of defoliation and nitrogen treatments. However, the proportion of the species was more strongly affected by N fertilization and defoliation frequency than by elevated pCO(2). Based on these results, we conclude that the species proportion in managed grassland may change as the CO2 concentration increases. However, an adapted management could, at least partially, counteract such CO2 induced changes in the proportion of the species. Since the availability of mineral N in the soil may be important for the species' responses to elevated pCO(2), more long-term studies, particularly of processes in the soil, are required to predict the entire ecosystem response.","ETH ZURICH,INST PLANT SCI,CH-8092 ZURICH,SWITZERLAND; BROOKHAVEN NATL LAB,DEPT APPL SCI,LONG ISL CITY,NY 11973",,,"Luscher, Andreas/E-2944-2018","Andreas, Luescher/0000-0001-8158-1721",,,,44,202,218,3,64,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Experiments were carried out in 260-1 mesocosms set up outdoors in a forest. These pond simulations were designed to mimic conditions that occur in palustrine temporary wetlands in cen central Pennsylvania. No animals reached metamorphosis in the short hydroperiod (56 days). However a greater proportion (66%) of tadpoles of R. sylvatica survived to the end of the 56-day treatment than the 84- or 158-day treatments (29 and 14%, respectively), from which all survivors metamorphosed. In contrast, neither of the salamanders metamorphosed by 84 days; survival to metamorphosis at 158 days was 15% for A. jeffersonianum and 10% for A. maculatum. Average instantaneous growth rates for A. jeffersonianum decreased with each increase in hydroperiod. Growth of R. sylvatica was greater in the 56-day hydroperiod than in hydroperiods of 84 or 158 days. Initial amphibian density had no effect on growth or survival of any species. It appears that salamander larvae were predatory on tadpoles, since survival of R. sylvatica was negatively correlated with survival of A. jeffersonianum in 84-day treatments and with growth of A. maculatum in 158-day treatments.","PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802",,,"Rowe, Christopher/D-5271-2012","Rowe, Christopher/0000-0001-9502-9225",,,,42,94,97,5,41,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1995,102,4,,,,,397,403,,10.1007/BF00341351,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RG164,WOS:A1995RG16400001,28306882,,,,2021-09-21,

We surveyed the presence of three species of shrews, Sorex araneus, S. caecutiens, and S. minutus, on 108 islands in three lakes in Finland. A significant compensatory effect between island area and isolation was detected in one species, but most islands were so little isolated (< 1 km) that isolation played no great role in this study. The position and the slope of the incidence function varied greatly among the species. Fitting the model J = 1/(1 + y/A(x)) to the observed incidence functions, and assuming that the annual extinction probability is 1 on islands of A = 0.5 ha, yielded quantitative predictions of the rates of colonization and extinction in the three species. Observed rates agreed remarkably well with the predicted ones (median difference 200/o). Overwater dispersal rate and/or ability was lowest in the smallest species (S. minutus), probably because of its short starvation time and slow swimming rate. Unexpectedly, this species had the highest colonization ability (rate of successful colonization conditional on arriving at an island). There were no significant differences between the species in colonization rate, but interspecific differences in extinction rate were highly significant and negatively correlated with body size. We suggest that these differences are due to increasing importance of environmental stochasticity with decreasing body size in shrews.

The results of this study are compared with those recorded previously for two other locally endemic species (Galaxias occidentalis and Bostockia porosa) to ascertain the extent to which these three species utilise the same resources, and whether they are similarly adapted to the highly seasonal flow regime. A total of 3396 Edelia vittata was collected with a 3 mm mesh seine net from the Collie River in south-western Australia at 3-6 week intervals over a period of 26 months. During the winter, fish moved from the river into either adjacent flood waters or tributary creeks. The trends shown by gonadosomatic indices, oocyte growth and prevalence of post-ovulatory follicles, demonstrate that spawning takes place between late winter and late spring (July-November). Sexual maturity was attained by both sexes at the end of the first year of life. Although 99% of the fish belonged to the 0+, 1+ and 2+ age classes, representatives of the 3+, 4+ and 5+ age classes were also caught. The respective von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters for L infinity, K and t(o) were 54.9, 1.178 and -0.210 for males and 57.9, 1.124 and -0.198 for females. At the end of the first and second years of life, the lengths predicted from the von Bertalanffy growth equations were 42 mm (= 0.8g) and 51 mm (= 1.4g) for males and 43 mm (= 0.9g) and 53 mm (= 1.6g) for females. The diet consisted of a wide range of small benthic invertebrates, especially dipteran larvae, ostracods and cyclopoid copepods. The peak time, duration and predominant locality of spawning, the time of day when maximum activity occurs and the diet of Edelia vittata differs from those previously recorded for Galaxias occidentalis and Bostockia porosa.

The present study evaluates the relative importance of each type of process during protistan primary succession in initially barren aquatic isolates (200-1 plastic pools) over a 170-d period. Species availability to these systems was manipulated by erecting exclosures around individual mesocosms to successively eliminate access to different dispersal vectors responsible for passive protistan dispersal. Increased exclosure significantly reduced access of autotrophs to the pools, but had little effect on heterotroph species availability. The species replacement process was directional through time and occurred at similar rates in all treatments. Both lower and upper temporal boundaries of heterotrophic and autotrophic species were contagious through time, as predicted by the Clementsian hypothesis, although the independence of these two boundary types suggested an individualistic model. Dominant and subdominant species were correlated into four temporal groups: pioneer, early successional, mid-successional. The dominance of several mid- and late successional species was reduced with increased exclosure. The loss of these species from successional pathways in more exclosed pools had no significant effect on the distribution of other species within the same temporal group. However, the establishment of these other mid- and late successional species may be dependent on initial colonization by pioneer and early successional species. Increased abundances of mid- and late successional species in less exclosed pools coincided with significant attenuations in the distribution of many early successional species in less exclosed pools coincided with significant attenuations in the distribution of many early successional species. Interactions between successional groups may be related to the supply of inorganic resources as well as allelopathic effects. Patterns of protist succession are the result of both population and community processes; while species-specific characteristics (i.e., dispersal ability) may dominate the process in more isolated systems, increased species availability increases the relative importance of interspecific interactions.","VIRGINIA POLYTECH INST & STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BLACKSBURG, VA 24061 USA; VIRGINIA POLYTECH INST & STATE UNIV, DEPT STAT, BLACKSBURG, VA 24061 USA","MCCORMICK, PV (corresponding author), VIRGINIA POLYTECH INST & STATE UNIV, CTR ENVIRONM & HAZARDOUS MAT STUDIES, BLACKSBURG, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,44,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAY 3,1991,213,2,,,,,83,98,,10.1007/BF00014995,,,16,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,FP810,WOS:A1991FP81000002,,,,,2021-09-21,

I use a multi-host epidemiological model with environmental transmission to explore how the characteristics of the host species (e.g., competence and competitive ability), host density, and the pathogen transmission mechanism affect the proportion of infected individuals (i.e., infection prevalence) in a focal host. My sensitivity-based approach identifies the indirect pathways through which specific ecological and epidemiological processes affect focal host infection prevalence. This in turn yields predictions about the context-dependent rules governing whether increased host species richness increases (amplifies) or decreases (dilutes) infection prevalence in a focal host. For example, in many cases, amplification and dilution are predicted to occur when added host species are sources or sinks of infectious propagules, respectively. However, if the added host species have strong and asymmetric competitive effects on resident host species, then amplification and dilution are predicted to occur when the added host species have stronger competitive effects on resident host species that are sources or sinks of infectious propagules, respectively. My results also predict that greater dilution and less amplification is more likely to occur under frequency-dependent direct transmission than density-dependent direct transmission when (i) the added hosts have lower competence than resident host species and (ii) interspecific competition between the added host species and resident host species is lower; the opposite conditions promote greater amplification and less dilution under frequency-dependent direct transmission. This work helps identify and explain the mechanisms shaping the context-dependent relationships between host species richness and disease in multi-host communities. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Theoretically, this might lead to a competitive elimination of either one but there are multispecies temporal larval communities persisting over the years. We hypothesized that larvae of two common European anuran species segregate their trophic niches despite their omnivorous habits and possible similarity of trophic levels. We assessed interspecific differences in food assimilation at larval and postmetamorphic stages of two anurans in an ecosystem of forest lake and an adjacent terrestrial ecosystem using a stable isotope approach. Trophic level of tadpoles of both species corresponded to those of some benthic invertebrate predators. Trophic positions of postmetamorphic juveniles corresponded to those of terrestrial invertebrate predators. The unpredictable decrease of delta N-15 values in anuran tissues during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats corresponded to the differences between aquatic and terrestrial isotopic baselines whereas dynamics of normalized delta N-15 confirmed an increase in their trophic level. Finally, we detected a strong segregation of trophic niches of the two species at both larval and postmetamorphic stages. The described niche separation provides an important prerequisite for decreasing possible intraspecific competition and promoting long-term co-existence of these syntopic anurans.","[Reshetnikov, Andrey N.; Korobushkin, Daniil, I; Gongalsky, Konstantin B.; Korotkevich, Anastasia Yu; Selskaya, Anastasia N.; Kotov, Alexey A.; Tiunov, Alexei, V] Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Ecol & Evolut Inst, Leninsky Pr 33, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Korotkevich, Anastasia Yu] Moscow State Pedag Univ, Kibalchicha Str 6, Moscow 129164, Russia","Reshetnikov, AN (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Ecol & Evolut Inst, Leninsky Pr 33, Moscow 119071, Russia.",anreshetnikov@yandex.ru,"Tiunov, Alexei V./F-7771-2013; Kotov, Alexey/B-1549-2010; Gongalsky, Konstantin/A-8583-2008","Tiunov, Alexei V./0000-0003-2400-3559; Kotov, Alexey/0000-0002-8863-6438; Gongalsky, Konstantin/0000-0003-1600-8448",Russian Scientific FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [19-74-10104],"We are greatly thankful to the Editor L.

Larger individuals typically have lower mass-specific metabolic rates compared to small ones (hypometric scaling). This trend is most evident across species where body size differences can be extreme. Yet, within-species studies are critical to decipher the morphological and physiological mechanisms responsible. However, in most species, the relatively small range in body and appendage size of the same life stage often precludes such intraspecific comparisons. 2. Sexually selected weapons are among the most exaggerated traits in nature; these traits can account for a large portion of body mass and contribute to whole-body energetic maintenance costs. Often larger individuals possess disproportionally larger weapons relative to their body size, yet little is known about how large individuals meet the predicted increased energetic demands of maintaining disproportionately large weapons. 3. New Zealand giraffe weevils, Lasiorhynchus barbicornis (Coleoptera: Brentidae) exhibit an extreme 30-fold range in male body mass as well as hypermetric scaling of sexually selected rostra used as weapons in male-male competition. We compare intra- and interspecific resting metabolic rates by compiling measurements across 26 arthropod species whose size ranges overlap with L. barbicornis. The scaling of metabolic rate across this pooled interspecific sample was not significantly different from the intraspecific scaling of metabolic rate we found in L. barbicornis (slope of log-log relationship with body mass = 0.67). 4. Male and female L. barbicornis had a similar scaling of metabolic rate with body size, despite differing substantially in the scaling of rostra, legs and antennae. However, large structures that scaled with positive allometry in males (rostra and legs) were increasingly composed of cuticle in larger individuals. The largest males invest similar to 60% less metabolically active tissue into rostra (weapons) compared to the smallest males. 5. Our findings reveal hypometric scaling relationships of inter- and intraspecific metabolic rates across a shared size range in a diverse group of arthropods. Our intraspecific study uncovers a tremendous difference in weapon architecture as individuals scale up in size; we find that large males bear disproportionally larger weapons at a lower relative metabolic cost. This cost-saving mechanism may play a key role in shaping the hypermetric scaling of sexually selected traits.

Such a scenario results in a transient pattern with clumps and gaps of species abundance along the niche axis (e.g. represented by body size). From this perspective, clumps are groups of coexisting species with negligible fitness differences and stochastic abundance fluctuations. Plankton is an excellent model system for developing and testing ecological theories, especially those related to size structure and species coexistence. We tested EN predictions using the phytoplankton community along the course of a tropical river considering 1) body size structure, 2) functional clustering of species in terms of morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and 3) the functional similarity among species concerning their functional traits. Two main clumps in the body size axis (clump I and II) were conspicuous through time and were detected in different stretches of the river. Clump I comprised medium-sized species from the MBFGs IV, V and VI while clump II included large-bodied species from the MBFGs V and VI. Pairwise differences in species biovolume correlated with species functional similarity when the whole species pool was considered, but not among species within the same clump. Although clumps comprised multiple MBFGs, the dominant species within the clump belonged always to the same MBFG. Also, within-clump species biovolume increased with functional distinctiveness considering both seasons and stretches, except the lower course. These results suggest that species within clumps behave in a quasi-neutral state, but even minor shifts in trait composition may affect species biovolume. Our findings point that EN belongs to the plausible mechanisms explaining community assembly in river ecosystems.","[Graco-Roza, Caio; Domingos, Patricia; Marinho, Marcelo Manzi] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Lab Phytoplankton Ecol & Physiol, Dept Plant Biol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Segura, Angel M.] Univ Republica, Modelizac Estadist Datos & Inteligencia Artificia, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Kruk, Carla] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Secc Limnol, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Graco-Roza, Caio; Soininen, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland","Graco-Roza, C (corresponding author), Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Lab Phytoplankton Ecol & Physiol, Dept Plant Biol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",caiogracor@gmail.com,,"Rodrigues Leandro Roza, Caio Graco/0000-0002-0353-9154; Soininen, Janne/0000-0002-8583-3137",Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth foundation; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [303572/2017-5],"CGR PhD scholarship was funded by Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), by Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) and by Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth foundation.

This study analyses the recovery of marine level-bottom communities from the end-Permian mass extinction event over a period of 15 Ma, with a main focus on the previously neglected main phase during the Middle Triassic. Our analyses are based on faunas from 37 lithological units representing different environmental settings, ranging from lagoons to inner, midand outer ramps. Our dataset comprises 1562 species, which belong to 13 higher taxa and 12 ecological guilds. The diversification pattern of most taxa and guilds shows an initial Early Triassic lag phase that is followed by a hyperbolic diversity increase during the Bithynian (early middle Anisian) and became damped later in the Middle Triassic. The hyperbolic diversity increase is not predicted by models that suggest environmental causes for the initial lag phase. We therefore advocate a model in which diversification is primarily driven by the intensity of biotic interactions. Accordingly, the Early Triassic lag phase represents the time when the reduced species richness in the wake of the end-Permian mass extinction was insufficient for stimulating major diversifications, whereas the Anisian main diversification event started when self-accelerating processes became effective and stopped when niche-crowding prevented further diversification. Biotic interactions that might drive this pattern include interspecific competition but also habitat construction, ecosystem engineering and new options for trophic relationships. The latter factors are discussed in the context of the resurgence of large carbonate platforms, which occurred simultaneously with the diversification of benthic communities. These did not only provide new hardground habitats for a variety of epifaunal taxa, but also new options for grazing gastropods that supposedly fed from microalgae growing on dasycladaceans and other macroalgae. Whereas we do not claim that changing environmental conditions were generally unimportant for the recovery of marine level-bottom communities, we note that their actual role can only be assessed when tested against predictions of the biotic model.","[Friesenbichler, Evelyn; Hautmann, Michael; Bucher, Hugo] Univ Zurich, Palaontol Inst & Museum, Zurich, Switzerland","Friesenbichler, E (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Palaontol Inst & Museum, Zurich, Switzerland.",evelyn.friesenbichler@pim.uzh.ch,"Hautmann, Michael/E-3656-2012","Hautmann, Michael/0000-0002-7322-8749",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [200021162402/1],"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 200021162402/1 to Michael Hautmann).

Anthropogenic disturbances are changing a variety of ecological factors, but how their relative importance varies across multiple regeneration stages is still unclear even in a single species. In this study, we focused on Metasequoia glyptostroboides, a relict species suffering a severely restricted regeneration in the wild, and performed controlled experiments using 54,600 seeds to investigate seedling emergence and growth in both its natural and adjacent unoccupied habitats to disentangle the roles of seed availability, interspecific competition and herbivore/omnivore attack across early regeneration stages. Our results showed that these factors mainly exerted their predominant effects at initial regeneration stages. Compared with herbivore/ omnivore attack, seed availability and interspecific competition were the crucial factors regulating seedling emergence. The first-year seedling survival rate was only significantly influenced by interspecific competition, and the survival of second-year seedlings was independent of all these factors. Moreover, we detected similar impacts of these factors in the adjacent unoccupied habitats to those in the natural habitats, indicating their roles in limiting population expansion. Our findings provide some suggestions to assist the natural regeneration and range expansion of M. glyptostroboides, and our experiment design can be applied in the assessment of endangerment causes for other endangered plants.","[Li, Yuan-Yuan; Liu, Yu-Pei; Gong, Jun; Shen, Guo-Chun; Zhou, Ying; Fang, Qin; Tang, Qiong; Yang, Yang; Wang, Rong; Chen, Xiao-Yong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Zhejiang Tiantong Forest Ecosyst Natl Observat &, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Fan, Shen-Hou] Res Inst Forestry, Lichuan 445400, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuan-Yuan] Inst Ecochongming IEC, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rong; Chen, Xiao-Yong] Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Wang, R; Chen, XY (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",rwang@des.ecnu.edu.cn; xychen@des.ecnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Xiao-Yong/B-1467-2009","Chen, Xiao-Yong/0000-0002-4795-8940; Wang, Rong/0000-0003-4652-2149","National Key Research & Development Program [2016YFC0503102]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31670540, 31630008, 31170492]; 'ecology plus' project of the East China Normal University","We thank TianHua He of Curtin University, Australia for revisions and constructive suggestions on the draft manuscript, WenWen Chen, SiSi Wang, Yang Zhang, ZhenZhu Xiao, XiaoWei Sun, XueHua Yue, JingWen Wang, XingChun Liao, ShouWan Liu, ChangHong Yang, FoEn Peng, Wu Bao, YuanYuan Ding, XinYun Gu for their help in the field experiments, HongQing Li for identifying plants of herb layer.

Through a mix of local extinctions and invasions, diverse communities of specialists are often replaced by or inundated with generalist species, resulting in uncertain consequences for ecological functions. While concern about biotic homogenization is growing, intraspecific variation and individual diet specialization (IS) have also emerged as key drivers of ecological functions. The niche variation hypothesis predicts that when a population is released from interspecific competition (ie ecological release), intraspecific competition will promote resource niche expansion and IS. It then follows that if biotic homogenization reduces taxonomic diversity and interspecific competition, intraspecific competition within the remaining taxa should expand population resource niches and increase the prevalence of IS. Here, we integrate the rapidly growing fields of biotic homogenization and intraspecific variation and assess the potential for generalist species to compensate for multiple forms of biotic homogenization via adaptive foraging, resource niche expansion, and IS.","[Manlick, Philip J.; Newsome, Seth D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Manlick, PJ (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",pmanlick@unm.edu,,,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-2010712],We thank J Estes and K Maldonado for their thoughtful comments on the manuscript.

The results show that the species richness, plant composition, and PD changed substantially from northern to southern aspects, and the phylogenetic structure of the community changed from clustering to over-dispersion. Weak phylogenetic signals in plant height, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf potassium content were recorded. We conclude that the influencing factor(s) of species coexistence on northern and north-western aspects is limiting similarity (interspecific competition), whereas on southern and south-western aspects, habitat filtering (environmental effect) is predominant. On western aspects, the influencing factors are driven by three processes: limiting similarity, habitat filtration, and random processes.

Faced with this paradox, we show how the invasive monk parakeet, the only parrot species that builds its nests with sticks, can host other species as tenants, increasing nest-site availability for native but also exotic species. This same pattern is observed in the native range of the species, and when parakeets occupy urban or rural habitats, although the richness of tenants was higher in invaded areas and rural habitats. Tenants participated in the cooperative defense against predators, benefiting parakeets with their presence. As tenants can be both native and invasive species, management plans should consider the complex network of interactions developed with the invader. While most of the knowledge on invasive species focuses on their impacts, little is known about their potential positive effects on other species. Invasive ecosystem engineers can disrupt recipient environments; however, they may also facilitate access to novel resources for native species. The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is a worldwide invader and the only parrot that builds its own communal nests, which can be used by other species. However, the ecological effects of these interspecific interactions are barely known. We compared the role of the monk parakeet as a nest-site facilitator in different rural and urban areas, both invaded and native, across three continents and eight breeding seasons. A total of 2690 nests from 42 tenant species, mostly cavity-nesting birds, were recorded in 26% of 2595 monk parakeet nests. Rural and invaded areas showed the highest abundance and richness of tenant species. Multispecies communal nests triggered interspecific aggression between the monk parakeet host and its tenants, but also a cooperative defense against predators. Despite the positive effects for native species, monk parakeets also facilitate nesting opportunities to other non-native species and may also transmit diseases to tenants, highlighting the complexity of biotic interactions in biological invasions.","[Hernandez-Brito, Dailos; Luna, Alvaro; Tella, Jose L.] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Donana Biol Stn, Calle Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Carrete, Martina; Romero-Vidal, Pedro] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Blanco, Guillermo] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Senar, Juan Carlos] Museu Ciencies Nat Barcelona, Castell dels Tres Dragons, Parc Ciutadella, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Mori, Emiliano] CNR, Ist Ric Ecosistemi Terr, Via Madonna Piano 10, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [White, Thomas H.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Program, POB 1600, Rio Grande, PR 00745 USA; [Luna, Alvaro] Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Biomed & Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Sci, Madrid 28670, Spain","Hernandez-Brito, D (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Donana Biol Stn, Calle Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",dailoshb@ebd.csic.es; mcarrete@upo.es; g.blanco@csic.es; pedroromerovidal123@gmail.com; jcsenar@bcn.cat; moriemiliano@tiscali.it; thomas_white@fws.gov; alvaro.luna@universidadeuropea.es; tella@ebd.csic.es,"Romero-Vidal, Pedro/AAX-5422-2021; Hernandez-Brito, Dailos/AAR-3234-2021; Senar, Juan Carlos/V-2371-2018","Hernandez-Brito, Dailos/0000-0002-5203-3512; Senar, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-9955-3892; Luna, Alvaro/0000-0002-8566-6367; Romero-Vidal, Pedro/0000-0002-0647-6953","Severo Ochoa Program [SVP-2014-068732]; Action COST ParrotNet [ES1304]; Loro Parque Fundacion [PP-146-2018-1]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Spanish Research Council [CGL-2016-79568-C3-3-P]","This research was funded by Severo Ochoa Program (SVP-2014-068732), Action COST ParrotNet (ES1304), Loro Parque Fundacion (PP-146-2018-1), and Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Spanish Research Council (CGL-2016-79568-C3-3-P).",,68,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-7737,,BIOLOGY-BASEL,Biology-Basel,JUL,2021,10,7,,,,,,,683,10.3390/biology10070683,,,14,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,TN0AS,WOS:000675908100001,34356538,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

However, EWSs are plagued by false negatives, leading to undetected catastrophes. One reason may be because EWSs do not occur equally for all species in a system, so whether and how strongly EWSs are detected depends on which species is being observed. Here, we illustrate how the strength of EWSs is determined by each species' relationship to properties of the noise, the system's response to that noise, and the occurrence of critical slowing down (the dynamical phenomenon that gives rise to EWSs). Using these relationships, we present general rules for maximizing EWS detection in ecological communities. We find that for two-species competitive and mutualistic systems, one should generally monitor the species experiencing smaller intraspecific effects to maximize EWS performance, while in consumer-resource systems, one should monitor the species imposing the smaller interspecific effects. These guidelines appear to hold for at least some larger communities as well. We close by extending the theoretical basis for our rules to systems with any number of species and more complex forms of noise. Our findings provide important guidance on how to monitor systems for EWSs to maximize detection of tipping points.","[Patterson, Amy Chian; Abbott, Karen C.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Strang, Alexander G.] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Patterson, AC (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",acp105@case.edu,,"Abbott, Karen/0000-0001-5143-0690",,,,40,0,0,10,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Given that experimental verification of virulence factors is time-consuming and laborious, few virulence factors have been characterized. Moreover, most studies have only focused on single virulence factors, resulting in biased interpretation of the pathogenesis of A. veronii. Results In this study, a PPI network at genome-wide scale for A. veronii was first constructed followed by prediction and mapping of virulence factors on the network. When topological characteristics were analyzed, the virulence factors had higher degree and betweenness centrality than other proteins in the network. In particular, the virulence factors tended to interact with each other and were enriched in two network modules. One of the modules mainly consisted of histidine kinases, response regulators, diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases, which play important roles in two-component regulatory systems and the synthesis and degradation of cyclic-diGMP. Construction of the interspecies PPI network between A. veronii and its host Oreochromis niloticus revealed that the virulence factors interacted with homologous proteins in the host. Finally, the structures and interacting sites of the virulence factors during interaction with host proteins were predicted. Conclusions The findings here indicate that the virulence factors probably regulate the virulence of A. veronii by involving in signal transduction pathway and manipulate host biological processes by mimicking and binding competitively to host proteins. Our results give more insight into the pathogenesis of A. veronii and provides important information for designing targeted antibacterial drugs.","[Li, Hong; Ma, Xiang; Tang, Yanqiong; Liu, Zhu] Hainan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dan] Hainan Univ, Coll Trop Crops, Key Lab Sustainable Utilizat Trop Bioresource, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ziding] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Liu, Z (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China.",zhuliu@hainanu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [32060153]; Hainan Natural Science Foundation [319QN161]; Priming Scientific Research Foundation of Hainan University [KYQD (ZR)1929],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32060153), the Hainan Natural Science Foundation (319QN161), and the Priming Scientific Research Foundation of Hainan University (KYQD (ZR)1929).",,70,0,0,3,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2180,,,BMC MICROBIOL,BMC Microbiol.,JUN 24,2021,21,1,,,,,,,188,10.1186/s12866-021-02261-8,,,11,Microbiology,Microbiology,SX1YY,WOS:000665008900001,34162325,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-21,

Whether SBM is typically selected for per se (direct selection hypothesis) or merely represents a side-effect of other sex-related adaptations (indirect selection hypothesis) is, however, still an open question. Substantial interspecific variation in the direction and degree of SBM, both in invertebrates and vertebrates, calls for multi-species studies to understand the relative importance of its evolutionary drivers. Here we use two complementary approaches to evaluate the evolutionary basis of SBM in insects. For this purpose, we assembled an extensive literature-derived data set of sex-specific development times and body sizes for a taxonomically and ecologically wide range of species. We use these data in a meta-analytic framework to evaluate support for the direct and indirect selection hypotheses. Our results confirm that protandry - males emerging as adults before females - is the prevailing form of SBM in insects. Nevertheless, protandry is not as ubiquitous as often presumed: females emerged before males (= protogyny) in about 36% of the 192 species for which we had data. Moreover, in a considerable proportion of species, the sex difference in the timing of adult emergence was negligible. In search for the evolutionary basis of SBM, we found stronger support for the hypothesis that explains SBM by indirect selection. First, across species, the direction and degree of SBM appeared to be positively associated with the direction and degree of sexual size dimorphism (SSD). This is consistent with the view that SBM is a correlative by-product of evolution towards sexually dimorphic body sizes. Second, within protandrous species, the degree of protandry typically increased with plastic increase in development time, with females prolonging their development more than males in unfavourable conditions. This pattern is in conflict with the direct selection hypothesis, which predicts the degree of protandry to be insensitive to the quality of the juvenile environment. These converging lines of evidence support the idea that, in insects, SBM is generally a by-product of SSD rather than a result of selection on the two sexes to mature at different times. It appears plausible that selective pressures on maturation time per se generally cannot compete with viability- and fecundity-mediated selection on insect body sizes. Nevertheless, exceptions certainly exist: there are undeniable cases of SBM where this trait has evolved in response to direct selection. In such cases, either the advantage of sex difference in maturation time must have been particularly large, or fitness effects of body size have been unusually weak.","[Teder, Tiit; Kaasik, Ants; Taits, Kristiina; Tammaru, Toomas] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Zool, Vanemuise 46, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia; [Teder, Tiit] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic","Teder, T (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Zool, Vanemuise 46, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia.; Teder, T (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",tiit.teder@ut.ee; ants.kaasik@ut.ee; kristiina.taits@gmail.com; toomas.tammaru@ut.ee,,,"Estonian Research CouncilEstonian Research Council [PRG741]; Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [42900/1312/3166]","The meta-analytic approach taken in this study made use of a large number of primary empirical studies.

NOV.; INSECTA; IRAN,"Around 27 species of predominantly riverine Gomphidae occur in the vast region encompassing Europe as far as the Urals, the Maghreb, the Mediterranean Basin, and the Middle East up to the west side of the Indus valley, including Arabia, Iran, and Baluchistan. They are the remains of a pre-Pleistocene fauna that we estimate at twice the current number. We analyse the relationships, losses, and their causes at the molecular level and, not surprisingly, confirm the widely held opinion that the ice age is overwhelmingly responsible. Much extinction of European-West Asian and North American species took place in Beringia, presumably in an early phase of the glaciation. Recolonization between glacial stages can be evaluated for the final stage, the Wurm-Wisconsin glaciation. Differences in the orientation of mountain chains allowed more species to survive in North America than in Eurasia. They recolonized Canada, Europe, the Russian Far East, and Japan. From China, 16 additional gomphids are moving west through Siberia. Some reach the Ob valley but in others disjunctions persist. There are, for example, no Stylurus species in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Thailand. Numerous preglacial survivors currently occur in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern refuges. Beside ice, aridity played a role in limiting the fauna. Oriental species advanced into the Middle East and Anatolia, but there was apparently never enough running water in Baluchistan to allow a large-scale movement of gomphids towards Europe. Rather to the contrary, the southeastern-most gomphid is Gomphus amseli, with type locality at the Heri Rud in Afghanistan, which forms a cline towards the west. Pakistan is even more impoverished in gomphids than Europe but is home to one small genus, Anormogomphus, that extends from northern India to eastern Anatolia. Africa also contributed little to the Palaearctic fauna. No Gomphus extends further south than the Maghreb, where several endemic species occur. Paragomphus sinaiticus is a desert species that does not occur south of the Sahara. The richest populations are situated in Oman. Two colonies coincide with the position of the shores of Lake Megachad, in the foothills of the Sahara-Sahel moun-tains of Air, Tibesti and Ennedi. Perhaps biotic factors like interspecies competition explain its range better than environmental factors. Around 8500 BP, the most recent riverine contact with the Nile via the Wadi Howar facilitated contact and crossing of the Red Sea, but Saharan populations could be older. Arabia was presumably invaded via the Sinai Peninsula, terra typica of the species.","[Dumont, Henri J.; Vierstraete, Andy] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Ghent, Belgium; [Schneider, Thomas] Arnold Knoblauch Ring 76, D-14109 Berlin, Germany; [Borisov, Sergey N.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Ecol Anim, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk 630091, Russia","Dumont, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Ghent, Belgium.",Henri.Dumont@UGent.be,,,Russian Federal Fundamental Scientific Research Program [AAAA-A16-116121410123-1],"We are grateful to two reviewers whose remarks forced us to re-think and re-write sections of this paper.

Previous theory suggests that sexual antagonism is a driver of genetic variation by generating balancing selection. However, most of these studies assume that populations are well mixed, neglecting the effects of spatial subdivision. Here, we use mathematical modeling to show that limited dispersal changes evolution at sexually antagonistic autosomal and X-linked loci as a result of inbreeding and sex-specific kin competition. We find that if the sexes disperse at different rates, kin competition within the philopatric sex biases intralocus conflict in favor of the more dispersive sex. Furthermore, kin competition diminishes the strength of balancing selection relative to genetic drift, reducing genetic variation in small subdivided populations. Meanwhile, by decreasing heterozygosity, inbreeding reduces the scope for sexually antagonistic polymorphism due to nonadditive allelic effects, and this occurs to a greater extent on the X chromosome than autosomes. Overall, our results indicate that spatial structure is a relevant factor in predicting where sexually antagonistic alleles might be observed. We suggest that sex-specific dispersal ecology and demography can contribute to interspecific and intragenomic variation in sexual antagonism.","[Flintham, Ewan O.; Savolainen, Vincent] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Mullon, Charles] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Savolainen, V (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",v.savolainen@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,112,0,0,5,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Such competition is reduced by resource-partitioning strategies that may affect physiology. For instance, diet and feeding strategies may affect the antioxidant defences or the production of reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidant defences. If such an imbalance favours the former, this can lead to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress increases. However, to our knowledge, how free-ranging animals adjust their oxidative status in relation to their foraging habitats, diet and dietary antioxidants has not yet been studied. Penguins are an interesting biological model for such a comparison because their diet, based on krill, fish and/or cephalopods, presents strong variation in dietary antioxidant content. We therefore examined trophic level (delta N-15), foraging habitat (delta C-13), dietary antioxidants (retinol, alpha-tocopherol and astaxanthin) and oxidative status (plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage) in pygoscelid penguins (chinstrap Pygoscelis antarcticus, gentoo P. papua and Adelie P. adeliae) breeding in Antarctica. We found interspecific differences in all variables analysed except alpha-tocopherol. Gentoo penguins exploited more cephalopods and fish in coastal and benthic habitats, Adelies showed an intermediate position, whereas chinstraps foraged more on krill and fish in pelagic waters. Dietary antioxidant levels showed specific patterns resulting in relationships with prey items. However, we did not find any clear relationships between dietary antioxidants and species-specific antioxidant capacity, suggesting the importance of endogenously produced antioxidants. Oxidative status appeared to be differently related to foraging strategy and antioxidant capacity in each species.","[Colominas-Ciuro, Roger; Vidal, Virginia; Barbosa, Andres] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat MNCN CSIC, Dept Ecol Evolut, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Bedellotti, Marcelo; D'Amico, Veronica L.] Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR CONICET, U9120ACD Puerto Madryn, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Bedellotti, Marcelo] Univ Chubut, Cat Biol Conservat, U9120OOW Puerto Madryn, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Carabajal, Eliana] Inst Biol Organismos Marinos IBIOMAR CONICET, U9120ACD Puerto Madryn, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Benzal, Jesus] Esn Expt Zonas Aridas EEZA CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Motas, Miguel] Univ Murcia, Fac Vet, Area Toxicol, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Santos, Mercedes; Coria, Nestor] Inst Antartico Argentino, Dept Biol Predadores Tope, B1650CSP San Martin, San Martin, Argentina","Colominas-Ciuro, R (corresponding author), Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat MNCN CSIC, Dept Ecol Evolut, Madrid 28006, Spain.",colominasciuro@gmail.com,,,"Argentinian Antarctic Institute (IAA); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CTM2011-24427, CTM2015-64720]; Multiannual Research Projects-CONICET [PIP 112-20110100680]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness FPI [BES2012-059299]; Argentinian Antarctic Base 'Esperanza'; CONICET doctoral fellowship; Argentinian Antarctic Base 'Marambio'","We thank the Spanish Antarctic Base 'Gabriel de Castilla', the Spanish polar ship 'Hesperides' and the Marine Technology Unit (CSIC) for their hospitality, transportation and logistic support.

We applied the individual-based model inSTREAM to describe the relationship between the dynamic river habitat and emergent population responses in sympatric landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and lake-migrating brown trout (Salmo trutta). This application explicitly describes the environmental conditions in the Gullspang Rapids, a residual flow stretch in the hydropower-regulated Gullspang River, Sweden (Svenskt elfiskeregister - SERS, 2019) etween September 2008 and September 2018. We simulated three static minimum flow scenarios and three variable natural flow regimes, contrasting highly artificial conditions with more natural dynamics. Our main response variable was the number of large (>= 12 cm) out-migrants of salmon and trout, a proxy for successful population recruitment. The baseline model predicted an average production of 455 salmon and 532 trout out-migrants per year during 2008-2018 in this 11,700 m(2) spawning and rearing area. The only alternative scenario producing more out-migrants was when the minimum flow was raised by a factor of three, as this led to a modest increase in trout out-migrants. Interestingly, none of the flow alternatives produced more salmon out-migrants than the baseline model, suggesting a competitive disadvantage originating from spawning later than trout. Density-dependent population regulation, a well-known phenomenon in salmonids, was reproduced by the model. Both intra- and interspecific competition was evident. While the number of out-migrants varied with flow regime, sensitivity analyses showed that other model input, specifically velocity shelter availability and stream temperature, were just as important. Increased availability of velocity shelters (in-stream structures that reduces the swimming speed of drift-feeding fish) was the only environmental factor that increased production of both salmon and trout in silico. We conclude that in this system, flow restoration based on simplistic flow scenarios will have limited effect, unless complemented by an increase of instream structural complexity.","[Bjornas, Kristine L.; Calles, Olle; Piccolo, John J.] Karlstad Univ, Dept Environm & Life Sci, River Ecol & Management Res Grp RivEM, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Railsback, Steven F.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Math, 1 Harpst St, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Railsback, Steven F.] Lang Railsback & Associates, 250 Calif Ave, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Bjornas, Kristine L.] Holemslykkjvegen 48, N-7224 Melhus, Norway","Bjornas, KL (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Environm & Life Sci, River Ecol & Management Res Grp RivEM, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.; Bjornas, KL (corresponding author), Holemslykkjvegen 48, N-7224 Melhus, Norway.",kristine.lubjo@gmail.com; steve@langrailsback.com; olle.calles@kau.se; john.piccolo@kau.se,,,"Department of Environmental and Life Sciences, Karlstad University; KK E-flows project [20170129]; Fortum AB","This study was funded by the Department of Environmental and Life Sciences, Karlstad University, and by the KK E-flows project (Grant number 20170129).

The relationship between them is complex, and the specific sustaining processes are still not well understood. In view of the rapidly evolving landscape, this literature review investigated scientific evidence for specific links between biodiversity and human infectious and non-communicable diseases to characterise identifiable relationships. METHODS: A search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases using keyword algorithms identified relevant manuscripts published between 1 January 2000 and 18 April 2019. Qualitative data were extracted from 155 studies investigating links between or mechanisms linking biodiversity and infectious disease, non-communicable disease, allergic/inflammatory disease and microbiomes. RESULTS: None of the reviewed studies documented causal evidence for a mechanism linking biodiversity and human health. The main mechanisms proposed to link biodiversity and transmission of infectious disease were dilution and amplification. The dilution hypothesis argues that an increase in species diversity leads to a decrease in pathogen prevalence. The amplification effect is the converse, that there is a positive correlation between species diversity and disease risk/infection prevalence. Several driving factors are postulated, including encounter reduction, interspecies competition and predation. In addition, it appears that scale, both spatial and temporal, highly impacts diversity-disease relationships. There is strong evidence that the early environment of a child, including maternally transferred prenatal signals, affects immune maturation, modifying later disease risk. Bi-directional axes communicate between the gut microbiome and the brain, as well as between the skin microbiome and the lung, leading to direct and indirect immune, humoral and neural mechanisms. The main challenges in assessing links between biodiversity and human health are the wide variation in definitions of health and biodiversity, and the heterogeneity in types of studies encountered, as well as the complexity of interactions in dynamic systems. CONCLUSIONS: Contextually adapted integrative approaches, which maintain dialogue across disciplines and amongst all stakeholders, are most likely to generate robust evidence. Because of the relevance of local scale, research engagement must occur across levels to generate legitimate practices and translate into sustainable, equitable policies. Recommendations for future action include: improve the knowledge base on contribution of biodiversity to health, increase awareness of health effects of natural and near-natural environments and biodiversity, and promote synergies by increasing policy coherence.","[Lisa, Crump; Jakob, Zinsstag] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Lisa, Crump; Jakob, Zinsstag] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Daniele, Martinoli] Acad Sci, Swiss Biodivers Forum, Bern, Switzerland","Lisa, C (corresponding author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",lisa.crump@swisstph.ch,,"Crump, Lisa/0000-0002-4406-0238",,,,94,0,0,5,5,E M H SWISS MEDICAL PUBLISHERS LTD,MUTTENZ,"FARNSBURGERSTR 8, CH-4132 MUTTENZ, SWITZERLAND",1424-7860,1424-3997,,SWISS MED WKLY,Swiss Med.

The resilience of obligate seeding plants to fire at any point in time depends on plant maturity and the size of plants in relation to potential fire scorch height. We investigated variation in the resilience of post-fire regenerating Eucalyptus delegatensis subsp. delegatensis (alpine ash) to a short inter-fire interval at its boundaries with E. fastigata (brown barrel) stands. The resilience of post-fire E. delegatensis regeneration was modelled across these stand boundaries as a function of the height of the plants, their reproductive maturity and predicted fire behaviour derived from local fuel characteristics. We measured these attributes 14 years following the Canberra 2003 wildfires and stratified study sites by fire severity. The height and reproductive maturity of post-fire E. delegatensis saplings decreased at stand boundaries with E. fastigata, while fuel was uniformly abundant and capable of supporting canopy scorching fire under mild fire weather conditions. This suggests that E. delegatensis is less resilient to frequent fire in the presence of interspecific competition and other environmental conditions that occur at stand boundaries, which represent the edge of the species' realised niche. With forecasts for increased fire frequency in south eastern Australia, persistence of E. delegatensis may be greatest in pure stands corresponding to the core of the species' realised niche, and in moist and sheltered topographic areas that are less prone to frequent canopy scorching fire. Our findings suggest the importance of considering fine-scale spatial variation in important obligate seeding plant traits when predicting and managing the response of obligate seeding species to frequent fire.","[Gale, Matthew G.; Cary, Geoffrey J.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia","Gale, MG (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",matthew.gale@anu.edu.au,"Cary, Geoffrey J./AAX-1964-2021","Gale, Matthew/0000-0002-6405-4951; Cary, Geoffrey J./0000-0002-6386-1751",National Parks Association of the ACT; Dr Robert Lesslie Memorial Foundation,"This research was funded by project scholarships provided by the National Parks Association of the ACT and the Dr Robert Lesslie Memorial Foundation.

The ability of fragmented forests to support diversity is determined by both landscape-scale metapopulation dynamics and within-patch mechanisms that govern species coexistence. Within-patch dynamics can be affected by proximity to forest edges. Edge effects on abiotic and biotic processes can alter species' performance and species interactions, but it is unclear how edge effects bear upon the long-term ability of fragmented forests to maintain diversity. We apply modern coexistence theory as a framework to predict the impact of edge effects on species coexistence. Using field data for a tropical tree community, we parameterized a spatially explicit simulation model to quantify how habitat and density dependence during seedling establishment affect diversity of later life stages. We matched simulated future communities to observed patterns of diversity and community structure for established seedlings and adults, coupled with sensitivity analysis of simulated effects. We found that early recruitment dynamics contributed to community structure at older life stages, corroborating empirical work on the importance of early life-stage dynamics for diversity. Edge effects reduced the diversity maintained in patches. The progressive loss of diversity was not due to changes in relative competitive ability (fitness differences), but due to weaker stabilization via density-dependent seed mortality. Results were robust to wide changes in the absolute values of model parameters, suggesting that variation in the strength of individual processes did not change their relative importance for diversity. Synthesis. Weakening of stabilizing processes that promote species self-limitation in ecological communities could compromise the ability of habitat fragments to maintain diversity. Quantifying the relative importance of intraspecific versus interspecific interactions-to assess stabilizing mechanisms and fitness differences-can help evaluate when habitat amount versus quality plays a larger role in maintaining diversity of fragments.","[Krishnadas, Meghna] CSIR Ctr Cellular & Mol Biol, Hyderabad, India; [Krishnadas, Meghna; Stump, Simon Maccracken] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Stump, Simon Maccracken] Yale Univ, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT USA","Krishnadas, M (corresponding author), CSIR Ctr Cellular & Mol Biol, Hyderabad, India.; Krishnadas, M (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",meghna@csirccmb.org,,"Stump, Simon/0000-0002-0706-1485; Krishnadas, Meghna/0000-0003-2231-9787",Garden Club of America; Yale Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies; Harvard Arnold Arboretum,Garden Club of America; Yale Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies; Harvard Arnold Arboretum,,85,1,1,23,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We describe the diet and frequency of feeding in the Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnake ( Crotalus pyrrhus). We used data from wild-caught specimens collected from six biogeographic regions (pooled to three regions for analysis) across the species' range in the United States that include Arizona, California, and Nevada, USA. Fecal material from 185 snakes yielded 104 prey items from 72 individuals, and palpation indicated recent meal ingestion in 36 of 174 individuals. The diet consisted predominantly of mammals (80.8%), in particular terrestrial squirrels (39.4%) and members of the heteromyid rodent genus Chaetodipus (26.9%). Male and female snakes exhibited similar diets and feeding frequency, but an ontogenetic shift occurred from primarily ectothermic (lizards) to endothermic prey (rodents and birds) and more frequent feeding. Consumption of ectotherms vs. endotherms appeared to be similar among biogeographic regions, but snakes from the Tinajas Altas Mountains, Arizona, preyed disproportionately on birds compared with other regions, and snakes from the Sonoran Desert-Arizona Upland region more frequently ingested recent meals than those from the California-Nevada region. Regardless of sex, size, and biogeographic region, snakes consumed fewer prey during the spring breeding season than during summer and autumn. We provide data on the diet of C. pyrrhus for testing further hypotheses regarding potential interspecific competition, dietary changes associated with climate change, foraging tactics associated with bird predation, competing behaviors during breeding season, and venom composition variation.","[Cochran, Chip; Travis, Zachary D.; Pompe, Lance R.; Hayes, William K.] Loma Linda Univ, Dept Earth & Biol Sci, Loma Linda, CA 92354 USA","Cochran, C (corresponding author), Loma Linda Univ, Dept Earth & Biol Sci, Loma Linda, CA 92354 USA.",rcochran@llu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1343166]; Chicago Herpetological Society; SciFund crowdfunders; Loma Linda University Department of Earth and Biological Sciences,"We thank J.

Within the last 30 yr, competitive displacement of Ae. aegypti by Ae. albopictus has resulted in partial spatial segregation of the two species, with Ae. aegypti persisting primarily in urban refugia. We modeled fine-scale distributions of both species, with the goal of capturing the outcome of interspecific competition across space by building habitat suitability maps. We empirically parameterized models by sampling 59 sites in south and central Florida over time and incorporated climatic, landscape, and human population data to identify predictors of habitat suitability for both species. Our results show human density, precipitation, and urban land cover drive Ae. aegypti habitat suitability, compared with exclusively climatic variables driving Ae. albopictus habitat suitability. Remotely sensed variables (macrohabitat) were more predictive than locally collected metrics (microhabitat), although recorded minimum daily temperature showed significant, inverse relationships with both species. We detected minor Aedes habitat segregation; some periurban areas that were highly suitable for Ae. albopictus were unsuitable for Ae. aegypti. Fine-scale empirical models like those presented here have the potential for precise risk assessment and the improvement of operational applications to control container-breeding Aedes mosquitoes.","[Hopperstad, Kristen A.; Reiskind, Michael H.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Campus Box 7613, Raleigh, NC 27696 USA; [Sallam, Mohamed F.] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Hopperstad, KA (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Campus Box 7613, Raleigh, NC 27696 USA.",kahopper@ncsu.edu,,"Sallam, Mohamed/0000-0003-2817-6190; Reiskind, Michael/0000-0001-7307-9416",National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1252376]; USDA Multistate Project [NE-1943]; Triangle Center for Evolutionary Medicine,"We would like to thank Dr. L.

Here, interactions between salmon postsmolts and other pelagic fish (mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and herring (Clupea harengus)) in the Northeast Atlantic were investigated. There was a low diet overlap between postsmolts and the two other planktivorous pelagic species. Both mackerel and herring were feeding predominantly on copepods and other small zooplankton, while salmon were feeding mostly on fish larvae. All three species feed on euphausiids and amphipods. Furthermore, postsmolts geographically overlapped with mackerel but had a low geographic overlap with herring.

However, spatio-temporal patterns of indirect interactions as promoters of pathogen transfer between domestic and wild canids are largely unknown. In this study, we used camera traps to describe the activity patterns and habitat use of dogs, chilla (Lycalopex griseus) and culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) foxes and identify the local-scale factors that may affect the frequency of dog-fox interactions through an anthropization gradient of the Coquimbo region, Chile. We assessed local-scale variables that may predict the number of interactions between dogs and foxes, and compared the time interval between dog-culpeo and dog-chilla interactions. Our findings suggested that closeness to urbanized zones predicts the frequency of indirect interactions between dogs and foxes. We found higher number of dog-fox interactions (60 interactions) at a periurban site adjacent to two coastal towns (Tongoy and Guanaqueros), compared to other two more undisturbed sites (12 interactions) increasingly distanced from urbanized areas. We showed that dogs interacted more frequently with chilla foxes (57 interactions) than with culpeo foxes (15 interactions), and the first interaction type occurred almost exclusively at the periurban site, where dogs and chillas were more frequently detected than in the other sites. We detected a marked temporal segregation between dogs and foxes, but dog-chilla interactions resulted in shorter time intervals (2.5 median days) compared to dog-culpeo interactions (7.6 median days), suggesting a higher potential risk of pathogen spillover between the first species pairing. Based on previous studies, we suggest periurban zones may constitute a potential focus of pathogen exposure between dog and fox populations in the study area. Our research contributes to improving the knowledge on the spatio-temporal patterns of interspecific contact between invasive and native carnivores within the context of multi-host pathogen dynamics. Our outcomes will inform theoretical epidemiological models designed to predict and minimize the contact risk between domestic and threatened species, guiding effective control strategies at the wildlife-domestic interface.","[Hernandez, Felipe A.; Manqui, Jonatan; Acosta-Jamett, Gerardo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Med Prevent Vet, Fac Ciencias Vet, Valdivia, Chile; [Mejias, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Programa Magister Ecol Aplicada, Valdivia, Chile; [Mejias, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambient & Evolut, Fac Ciencias, Valdivia, Chile; [Acosta-Jamett, Gerardo] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet, Programa Invest Aplicada Fauna Silvestre, Valdivia, Chile","Hernandez, FA; Acosta-Jamett, G (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Med Prevent Vet, Fac Ciencias Vet, Valdivia, Chile.; Acosta-Jamett, G (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet, Programa Invest Aplicada Fauna Silvestre, Valdivia, Chile.",felipe.hernandez@uach.cl; gerardo.acosta@uach.cl,,,"ANID/CONICYT Fondecyt [3180111, 1180119]; Center of Applied Ecology and Sustainability (CAPES-UC); Instituto de Biologia Integrativa (iBio)",FAH was funded by ANID/CONICYT Fondecyt Postdoctorado No 3180111.

Both species are usually associated with coastal environments, but information on their trophic ecology is scarce. Here we explored the existence of trophic resource partitioning between these 2 sympatric species using delta C-13 and delta N-15. From 2007 to 2013, we analyzed a total of 14 Commerson's dolphin and 34 Peale's dolphin skin samples from a marine protected area in Argentina. Significant differences in delta C-13 values indicated intra- and interspecific spatial partitioning. Three different Peale's dolphin feeding groups (FGs) were identified: FG1 exclusively exploited the pelagic habitat, FG2 occupied more pelagic/inshore habitats (similar to Commerson's dolphins), and FG3 occupied more benthic/inshore habitats. Isotopic niche breadth varied between species and feeding groups, exhibiting less variation in prey selection among Commerson's dolphins. According to Bayesian standard ellipse area analysis, isotopic niche overlap was found between FG2 and FG3 from 2007 to 2012, and between FG2 and Commerson's dolphins. Mixing models suggest that FG3 has a diet mainly based in benthic fish, while FG2 and Commerson's dolphins feed predominantly on pelagic fish. Overall, this study indicates segregation in the use of trophic resources between 2 sympatric dolphin species, showing different foraging strategies that promote coexistence and reduce intra- and interspecific competition. Furthermore, the presence of 3 Peale's dolphin feeding groups segregated at a small geographic scale suggests a previously unknown ecological complexity.","[Alberto Durante, Cristian; Alberto Crespo, Enrique; Loizaga, Rocio] Ctr Nacl Patagon CONICET, Lab Mamiferos Marinos, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR, Brown 2915,U9120ACD, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Alberto Durante, Cristian] Univ Nacl Comahue, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Durante, CA (corresponding author), Ctr Nacl Patagon CONICET, Lab Mamiferos Marinos, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR, Brown 2915,U9120ACD, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.; Durante, CA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",kily@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar,,,"Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICT)ANPCyT [2063]; Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Productiva - National Research Council of Argentina (CONICET) [PIP 2015-2017]; BBVA FoundationBBVA Foundation; PADI Foundation [31802]; Lerner Gray Fund for Marine Research Grants 2017; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","This research was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICT no. 2063), Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Productiva - National Research Council of Argentina (CONICET, PIP 2015-2017), BBVA Foundation: 2005-2008, 2009-2012, PADI Foundation Grant no. 31802, and Lerner Gray Fund for Marine Research Grants 2017.

Brook charr exhibit a resource polymorphism in some Canadian Shield lakes, where a littoral ecotype feeds mainly on zoobenthos and a pelagic ecotype feeds mostly on zooplankton. The objectives of this study were to test that (i) resource polymorphism is common in these brook charr populations, (ii) the presence creek chub and white sucker, two introduced species competing with brook charr for littoral resources, will decrease the phenotypic divergence between the two brook charr ecotypes, and (iii) the ecological release from introduced species will increase population and/or individual niche widths in brook charr. The study was based on 27 lakes and five indicators of resource use (stomach content, liver delta C-13, muscle astaxanthin concentration, pyloric caecum length, and gill raker length). Our results indicate that within-lake differences in resource use by both ecotypes are common and stable through time. When facing interspecific competition, both littoral and pelagic brook charr incorporated more pelagic prey into their diet but maintained the amplitude of their differences in resource use, which contradicts our second prediction. Finally, we did not find any significant effect of introduced species on population and individual niche widths of brook charr. We suggest that the difference in feeding mode among distantly related competitors could prevent the complete exclusion of a species from a given niche and explain the lack of response to the ecological release.","[Rainville, Vincent; Filion, Antoine; Lussier, Isabelle; Pepino, Marc; Magnan, Pierre] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Res Ctr Watershed Aquat Ecosyst Interact, CP 500, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada","Magnan, P (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Res Ctr Watershed Aquat Ecosyst Interact, CP 500, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada.",Pierre.Magnan@uqtr.ca,,"Filion, Antoine/0000-0003-1198-3017",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Fonds de recherche du Quebec -Nature et technologies (FRQNT) du Quebec,This work was supported by Grants from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Canada Research Chair Program to P.

The Common buzzard (Buteo buteo) is a highly aggressive, territorial bird of prey that interacts strongly with its intra- and interspecific competitors. We propose and use random matrix theory to quantify the strength and range of repulsion as a function of the buzzard population density, thus providing a novel approach to model density dependence. As an indicator of territorial behaviour, we perform a large-scale analysis of the distribution of buzzard nests in an area of 300 square kilometres around the Teutoburger Wald, Germany, as gathered over a period of 20 years. The nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distribution between nests is compared to the two-dimensional Poisson distribution, originating from uncorrelated random variables, to the complex eigenvalues of random matrices, which are strongly correlated, and to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas interpolating between these two. A one-parameter fit to a time-moving average reveals a significant increase of repulsion between neighbouring nests, as a function of the observed increase in absolute population density over the monitored period of time, thereby proving an unexpected yet simple model for density-dependent spacing of predator territories. A similar effect is obtained for next-to-nearest neighbours, albeit with weaker repulsion, indicating a short-range interaction. Our results show that random matrix theory might be useful in the context of population ecology. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Fisheries as a top-down force can shorten and destabilize food webs, while effects driven by climate change can alter the bottom-up forces of primary productivity. We assessed the response of a highly-resolved intertidal food web to these two global change drivers, using network analysis and bioenergetic modelling. We quantified the relative importance of artisanal fisheries as another predator species, and evaluated the independent and combined effects of fisheries and changes in plankton productivity on food web dynamics. The food web was robust to the loss of all harvested species but sensitive to the decline in plankton productivity. Interestingly, fisheries dampened the negative impacts of decreasing plankton productivity on non-harvested species by reducing the predation pressure of harvested consumers on non-harvested resources, and reducing the interspecific competition between harvested and non-harvested basal species. In contrast, the decline in plankton productivity increased the sensitivity of harvested species to fishing by reducing the total productivity of the food web. Our results show that strategies for new scenarios caused by climate change are needed to protect marine ecosystems and the wellbeing of local communities dependent on their resources.","[Isidora Avila-Thieme, M.; Corcoran, Derek; Perez-Matus, Alejandro; Wieters, Evie A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.; Marquet, Pablo A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Alameda 340, Santiago 8331150, Chile; [Isidora Avila-Thieme, M.; Corcoran, Derek] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad IEB, Las Palmera 345, Santiago, Chile; [Isidora Avila-Thieme, M.] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Perez-Matus, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Subtidal Ecol Lab,Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile; [Wieters, Evie A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Estn Costera Invest Marinas Las Cruces, Las Cruces, Chile; [Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Ctr Ecol Aplicada & Sustentabilidad CAPES, Alameda 340, Santiago 8331150, Chile; [Marquet, Pablo A.] Ctr Cambio Global UC PUCGlobal, Alameda 340, Santiago 8331150, Chile; [Marquet, Pablo A.] Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Marquet, Pablo A.] Inst Sistemas Complejos Valparaiso ISCV, Artilleria 470, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valdovinos, Fernanda S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Valdovinos, FS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",fvaldovinos@ucdavis.edu,"Avila-Thieme, M.

AMS C-14 dates for Neochoerus sp. (29,072 - 27,713 Cal yr BP), Notiomastodon platensis (25,454 - 24,884 Cal yr BP) and Eremotherium laurillardi (11,320 - 11,131 Cal yr BP) support the Lujanian ages. All fossils have low delta C-13 and delta O-18 isotopic values that suggest C3-dominated environments from closed canopy forests to wooded savannas, agreeing with paleovegetation reconstitution. Most species were browsers (piC(3)=100%; Niche breadth, B-A=0), where the key species with the largest body mass, N. platensis (similar to 6,300 kg) and E. laurillardi (similar to 3,500 kg), possibly had a more generalized browser diet in closed-canopies to woodlands. Their diet distinguished from the C-3/C-4 generalist Trigodonops lopesi (similar to 1,900 kg), which foraged in wooded savannas (p(i)C(3=)70%; B-A=0.72), similarly with its relative Toxodon platensis (similar to 1,800 kg) that had a browse-dominated mixed feeder diet (p(i)C(3) >= 84%, B-A <= 0.38) in Peruvian and Bolivian Amazon localities. Palaeolama major (similar to 280 kg) was possibly a strictly folivorous within forest canopies, whereas Tapirus sp. (similar to 250 kg) and Mazama sp. (similar to 40 kg) were browsers in closed-canopies to woodlands. Holmesina rondoniensis (similar to 120 kg) was a browser but not restricted, where could also feed on herbaceous from understories in woodlands, and Neochoerus sp. (similar to 200 kg) feeding predominantly herbaceous plants in wooded savannas (piC(3)=69%; B-A=75). We estimate that the interspecific competition could have been avoid by different feeding strategies, although more investigations are still needed to better understand their ecological interactions in the habitats of the southwestern Amazon during the late Quaternary.

Yet solving this problem is important for understanding the role of randomness and predictability in the assembly of ecological communities. Here we show that the specific combinations of interacting species that emerge from the ecological dynamics within regional species pools are not all equally likely to be seen; rather, they are among the most likely to persist under changing environments. First, we use niche-based competition matrices and Lotka-Volterra models to demonstrate that realized combinations of interacting species are more likely to persist under random parameter perturbations than the majority of potential combinations with the same number of species that could have been formed from the regional pool. We then corroborate our theoretical results using a 10-year observational study, recording 88 plant-herbivore communities across three different forest successional stages. By inferring and validating plant-mediated communities of competing herbivore species, we find that observed combinations of herbivores have an expected probability of species persistence higher than half of all potential combinations. Our findings open up the opportunity to establish a formal probabilistic and predictive understanding of the composition of ecological communities.","[Medeiros, Lucas P.; Saavedra, Serguei] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Boege, Karina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Ave Univ 3000,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [del-Val, Ek] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Zaldivar-Riveron, Alejandro] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Ave Univ 3000,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Saavedra, S (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sersaa@mit.edu,"Pare, Karina Boege/AAP-9596-2021",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-2024349]; UniversidadNacional Autonoma de Mexico-Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica [IN211916]; Secretaria de Educacion Publica-Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [2015-255544],"Funding was provided by National Science Foundation grant DEB-2024349 (S.S.), UniversidadNacional Autonoma de Mexico-Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica grant IN211916, and Secretaria de Educacion Publica-Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia grant 2015-255544 (E.d.-V. and K.B.).

In this study, the effects of the environmental and human factors were examined on altitudinal patterns of fish habitat selection, faunal changes, species richness and fish abundance from upstream to downstream in the southern part of the central Alborz Protected Area during 2016 and 2017. 366 fish individuals of five species in three families were identified and brown trout was the dominant species. The river was divided into three zones based on habitat structure, species composition and influence of physical and chemical variables. The results indicate that, in some situations, including small changes in habitat structure indices, physical and chemical variables along the altitudinal gradient are more effective in habitat preference, describing the composition, and abundance. Chemical variables can help to have a better understanding of the conventional patterns, shaped by the habitat structure and physical variables. Habitat suitability index model for brown trout in three zones is completely different over the two years and this species could overcome these conditions. However, upstream areas were more appropriate. Dam, with decreases of outlet water temperature, also creates homogeneous and simple habitats leading to changes in expected fish distribution patterns with decreasing altitude. These conditions may have increased habitat suitability index for the brown trout in downstream, while despite favorable ecological conditions in the middle zone, habitat suitability index and alternative habitats available in this zone are likely to decline due to density and interspecific competition. The natural pattern of fish distribution and habitat selection varies along the altitudinal gradient due to various factors and human disturbances. Optimal management of protected areas can control the effects of some of these factors at least temporarily.","[Mostafavi, S.

Feeding Strategy in Three Syntopic Newts in Artificial Habitats,DIVERSITY-BASEL,,,English,Article,,,,,,amphibians; feeding ecology; niche width; artificial habitats; niche overlap; trophic interactions,,"Natural aquatic sites are disappearing worldwide, especially in the Mediterranean region where amphibians are frequently forced to move for reproduction to artificial sites designed for irrigation and cattle watering (i.e., wells, tanks and drinking troughs). In artificial aquatic sites, where resources (space and food) are usually limited, trophic niche information can be particularly useful to infer the suitability of habitats for amphibian conservation especially when more than one species co-occurs. In this paper, we focused on three newt species: The Italian newt (Lissotriton italicus), the Italian smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris meridionalis) and the Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex) inhabiting man-made wells widespread in an area in Central Italy characterized by few available natural aquatic sites. Specifically, we analyzed the trophic spectrum of the species, their interactions and overlap, and discussed the potential role of wells in amphibian conservation. Overall, 550 newt individuals occurring in 16 distinct wells were sampled. The study species consumed similar resources, mainly of aquatic origin, with Diptera larvae and Cladocera representing the most important preys. The high degree of diet overlap observed may be due to site oligotrophy and high availability of small-sized prey, and it does not necessarily lead to competition. Newts had similar narrow niche width values and a generalist feeding pattern with high diversity among individuals. Lissotriton italicus and T. carnifex showed wider niche width in isolation than in syntopy condition, probably as a result of interspecific competition and/or intraguild predation. We showed that artificial aquatic sites are important for newt ecology and conservation since they allow up to three species to cohabit, thus representing a good surrogate of natural habitats. The study wells apparently provided suitable trophic conditions for newts in terms of prey availability and catchability. To date, just a few studies have contributed to a greater understanding of newts' diet in artificial aquatic sites and this gap of knowledge has to be filled to clarify their role in amphibian ecology and conservation.","[Stellati, Luca; Mirabasso, Jennifer; Bologna, Marco A.; Vignoli, Leonardo; Bissattini, Alessandra Maria] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale Marconi 446, I-00146 Rome, Italy; [Luiselli, Luca] Inst Dev Ecol Conservat & Cooperat, IDECC, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Luiselli, Luca] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Anim & Environm Biol, PMB 5080, Port Harcourt, Nigeria; [Luiselli, Luca] Univ Lome, Dept Zool, 01 BP 1515, Lome, Togo","Bissattini, AM (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Viale Marconi 446, I-00146 Rome, Italy.",luca.stellati@uniroma3.it; jennifer.mirabasso@hotmail.it; l.luiselli@ideccngo.org; marcoalberto.bologna@uniroma3.it; leonardo.vignoli@uniroma3.it; alessandramaria.bissattini@uniroma3.it,,"Vignoli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1599-092X; Luiselli, Luca M./0000-0001-6878-2916","Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza) [COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016]","The Grant to Department of Science, Roma Tre University (MIUR-Italy Dipartimenti di Eccellenza, ARTICOLO1, COMMI 314-337 LEGGE 232/2016) is gratefully acknowledged.",,80,0,0,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,JAN,2021,13,1,,,,,,,32,10.3390/d13010032,,,16,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PV6PN,WOS:000610108100001,,gold,,,2021-09-21,

Based on the observed outcomes from such interactions (i.e., patterns of displacements) dominance hierarchies can be established. Knowing which species can outcompete others for essential resources allows researchers to make predictions about the broader ecological impacts of interspecific interactions. We constructed an interspecific dominance hierarchy of twelve avian species which visited an artificial water source in an arid region of coastal Patagonia, Argentina. Displacements were categorized into four types, based on the behaviors involved in the interaction, and we tested if they could predict the difference in dominance between the interacting species (the difference between calculated dominance coefficients for the two focal species). Indirect displacements, involving only the arrival of the dominant species to the water source without direct aggression toward the subordinate bird, occurred more frequently between species with a large difference in dominance. The most dominant bird observed was the kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), which, due to an increasing population and expanding range, in part due to food supplementation from fisheries waste, is likely to outcompete terrestrial and marine avian species for other scarce resources.","[Rabinowicz, Sophie; Lazar, Amanda; Hein, Benjamin] Cornell Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Garcia, Natalia; Campagna, Leonardo] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Fuller Evolutionary Biol Program, Ithaca, NY USA; [Garcia, Natalia] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat, Div Ornitol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Herwood, Tristan] Cornell Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Miller, Eliot] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Macaulay Lib, Ithaca, NY USA; [Campagna, Leonardo] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Rabinowicz, S (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",sr995@cornell.edu,,"Rabinowicz, Sophie/0000-0003-3927-5493; Lazar, Amanda/0000-0001-6595-4591",Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Cornell Lab of Ornithology provided funding to cover the publication costs for this article.

Hybrid zone movement can take place if one of the species possesses a competitive advantage over the other, ultimately resulting in species replacement. Such hybrid zone displacement is predicted to leave a genomic footprint across the landscape in the form of asymmetric gene flow (or introgression) of selectively neutral alleles from the displaced to the advancing species. Hybrid zone movement has been suggested for marbled newts in the Iberian Peninsula, supported by asymmetric gene flow and a distribution relict (i.e., an enclave) of Triturus marmoratus in the range of T. pygmaeus. We developed a panel of nuclear and mitochondrial SNP markers to test for the presence of a T. marmoratus genomic footprint in the Lisbon peninsula, south of the enclave. We found no additional populations of T. marmoratus. Analysis with the software Structure showed no genetic traces of T. marmoratus in T. pygmaeus. A principal component analysis showed some variation within the local T. pygmaeus, but it is unclear if this represents introgression from T. marmoratus. The results may be explained by (a) species replacement without introgressive hybridization and (b) displacement with hybridization followed by the near-complete erosion of the footprint by purifying selection. We predict that testing for a genomic footprint north of the reported enclave would confirm that species replacement in these marbled newts occurred with hybridization.","[Lopez-Delgado, Julia; van Riemsdijk, Isolde; Arntzen, Jan W.] Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Lopez-Delgado, Julia] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Lopez-Delgado, Julia] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [van Riemsdijk, Isolde] Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Tubingen, Germany","Lopez-Delgado, J (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Manton Bldg, Leeds LS2 9NH, W Yorkshire, England.",bsjld@leeds.ac.uk,,"Lopez-Delgado, Julia/0000-0003-0036-4579",Jan Joost ter Pelkwijk fonds,"We thank R.

The location of a seagrass bed within the lagoon can determine the value of a particular bed for shrimp populations. Consequently, differences in the abundance of shrimp can be found in seagrasses depending on their location. As shrimp density increases, density-dependent effects on biological parameters are more likely to occur. However, knowledge about density-dependent processes on shrimp populations in nursery habitats remains limited. The present investigation was undertaken to examine the effects of population density on shrimp condition in two selected seagrass beds, located at different distance from a tidal inlet, one 25 km away (distant) and the other 1 km away (nearby), in a subtropical coastal lagoon. The study was based on monthly samplings during one year in Laguna Madre (Mexico), performing a total of 36 shrimp trawls (100 m 2 each one) within each seagrass bed (n = 3 trawls per bed per month for 12 months). Shrimp density was related to the proximity to the tidal inlet (higher density was consistently observed in the nearby seagrass bed), which in turn adversely affected the condition of both species studied (Penaeus aztecus and P. duorarum). In this regard, the present study provides the first evidence of density-dependent effects on shrimp condition inhabiting a nursery habitat. Both shrimp species exhibited a negative relationship between condition and shrimp density. However, this pattern differed depending on the proximity to the tidal inlet, suggesting that shrimp populations inhabiting the nearby seagrass bed are exposed to density-dependent effects on condition; whereas, such effects were not detected in the distant seagrass bed. Shrimp density within the distant seagrass bed was probably below carrying capacity, which is suggested by the better shrimp condition observed in that area of the lagoon. Infra and interspecific competition for food items is surmised to occur, predominantly within seagrass beds near the tidal inlet. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in future studies.","[Blanco-Martinez, Zeferino; Perez-Castaneda, Roberto; Genaro Sanchez-Martinez, Jesus; Benavides-Gonzalez, Flaviano; Luis Rabago-Castro, Jaime; de la Luz Vazquez-Sauceda, Maria] Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico; [Garrido-Olvera, Lorena] Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas, Inst Ecol Aplicada, Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico","Perez-Castaneda, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico.",roperez@docentes.uat.edu.mx,"Perez-Castaneda, Roberto/AAL-6107-2021",,"PROMEP Mexico [103.5/04/1405, 103.5/05/3156]","This study was funded by PROMEP Mexico through grants 103.5/04/1405 and 103.5/05/3156 awarded to Roberto Perez-Castaneda.

This forest loss has resulted in an increasingly fragmented forest landscape, with fragments isolated from each other by grasslands (i.e., matrix). The grassland matrix is not entirely homogeneous containing matrix elements such as isolated trees and shrubs and linear features such as drainage lines. Because most lemurs are predominantly arboreal, they may preferentially use matrix elements to facilitate dispersal between fragments for access to mates or reduce feeding competition, allowing gene flow between fragments of habitat. Therefore, it is important to understand to what degree they use the matrix. We investigated matrix use in two mouse lemurs, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and the golden-brown mouse lemur (Microcebus ravelobensis) in a fragmented landscape in northwest Madagascar. We tested the predictions that: (1) lemurs use matrix less often than forest fragments, (2) if they use the matrix, then they will preferentially use matrix elements compared to grassland, and (3) M. murinus will disperse into the matrix further than M. ravelobensis. In 2011, we visually surveyed line transects in four areas containing matrix elements and four adjacent forest fragments during nocturnal walks. In 2017, we set up traplines in four areas of the matrix containing matrix elements, three areas that were grassland, and six traplines in adjacent fragments. We compared the relative abundance of mouse lemurs in matrix transects to fragmented forest transects, and the relative abundance of captured lemurs in matrix elements, grassland, and fragment traplines. We found that encounter rates of mouse lemurs did not significantly differ between the matrix and fragmented forest transects or traplines. Our sample size was too low to determine if the mean distance from the forest was greater for either Microcebus spp. Our study highlights that mouse lemurs do use matrix elements and there may be interspecific differences in use. Further research is needed to confirm species-specific matrix use, why mouse lemurs use matrix, and how much matrix elements facilitate movement for each species in fragmented landscapes.","[Steffens, Travis S.] Univ Guelph, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Steffens, Travis S.] Planet Madagascar, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Ramsay, Malcolm S.; Lehman, Shawn M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Anthropol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Andriatsitohaina, Bertrand] Univ Mahajanga, Ecole Doctorale Ecosyst Nat EDEN, Mahajanga, Madagascar; [Radespiel, Ute] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Zool, Hannover, Germany","Steffens, TS (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",tsteffen@uoguelph.ca,,,"Sigma Xi [G2010101554716, G2017031588523587]; American Society of Primatologists (Conservation Small Grant) [2011]; Calgary and Edmonton Valley Zoos; Explorers Club (Exploration Fund) [2011]; University of Toronto School of Graduate Studies Travel Grant [2011]; Primate Conservation Inc.; University of TorontoUniversity of Toronto; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung Germany as part of the BiodivERsA Initiative of the European CommunityFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LC1617A, 2015-138]","T.S.S. received the following funding support: Sigma Xi Grants in Aid of Research [G2010101554716, 2010], American Society of Primatologists (Conservation Small Grant) [2011], Calgary and Edmonton Valley Zoos [2010], The Explorers Club (Exploration Fund) [2011], and the University of Toronto School of Graduate Studies Travel Grant [2011].

Co-occurring species overlap on prey resources, and regular colony movements and long-distance raiding increase interspecific interference. We hypothesised interspecific competition selects for temporal separation of species' raid periods into diurnal versus nocturnal activity. We predicted species would differ significantly in their timing of foraging. We further predicted timing would differ among congeners because close relatives likely overlap in resource needs. Trail walk encounter rates were used to estimate species' diurnal versus nocturnal foraging activity at four Neotropical sites. Army ant species differed significantly in foraging times. There were significantly diurnal and nocturnal specialists; some species foraged at similar rates day and night. Two genera (Eciton and Neivamyrmex) included both diurnal and nocturnal specialists. Relative eye size (a morphological indicator of above-ground activity) was positively associated with diel foraging specialisation (both diurnal and nocturnal). Temporal separation of foraging times may play a role in allowing Neotropical army ant species to occupy the same habitat.

We predicted that the more productive habitat (wetland) would have higher diversity of primary producers and frogs with larger trophic niches and greater interspecific dietary overlap when compared to the less-productive dune habitat. Stomach content analysis (SCA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA) were used to compare frog trophic ecology in the two habitats. We compared trophic niche size (Shannon's index) and overlap (Pianka's index; isotopic ellipse area, SEA(c)). Bayesian isotope mixing models were used to estimate relative contributions of basal production sources to frog biomass in each habitat. Estimates indicated that wetland frogs assimilated material from diverse basal sources (suspended particulate organic matter (POM), C(3)plants, periphyton), whereas frogs inhabiting dunes assimilated material mostly originating from C(3)plants. Both SCA and SIA revealed less trophic overlap among frogs from the sand dunes compared with those from the wetland. Dietary overlap was greater than expected at random for frogs in both the wetland and dunes. Mean overlap among isotopic ellipses (SEAc) of all frogs at each habitat was higher in the wetland (0.14 parts per thousand) than in the dunes (0.04 parts per thousand). These findings corroborate our prediction that trophic structure in the wetland is more complex than in the sand dunes. Also, as expected, we observed greater isotopic niche segregation among frogs in the sand dunes, a potential mechanism that reduces competition for limited food resources.","[Huckembeck, Sonia; Garcia, Alexandre M.] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Oceanog Inst, Campus Carreiros,Ave Italia Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Winemiller, Kirk O.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX USA; [Loebmann, Daniel] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Biol Sci Inst, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil","Huckembeck, SN (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande, Oceanog Inst, Campus Carreiros,Ave Italia Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",sohuckembeck@yahoo.com.br,"Garcia, Alexandre Miranda/H-2549-2012","Garcia, Alexandre Miranda/0000-0002-8479-4199; Loebmann, Daniel/0000-0003-0106-7197",,,,67,0,0,3,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,NOV,2020,45,7,,,,,977,989,,10.1111/aec.12920,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OE3XV,WOS:000580468300012,,,,,2021-09-21,

Currently, it is controlled through calendar-based fungicide treatments starting at petal fall, but an alternative is to develop resistant peach varieties. Previous studies mapped a resistance gene (Vr3) in interspecific populations between almond ('Texas') and peach ('Earlygold'). To obtain molecular markers highly linked to Vr3 and to reduce the number of candidate genes, we fine-mapped Vr3 to a genomic region of 270kb with 27 annotated genes. To find evidence supporting one of these positional candidate genes as being responsible of Vr3, we analyzed the polymorphisms of the resequences of both parents and used near-isogenic lines (NILs) for expression analysis of the positional candidate genes in symptomatic or asymptomatic leaves. Genes differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible individuals were annotated as a Disease Resistance Protein RGA2 (Prupe2G111700) or an Eceriferum 1 protein involved in epicuticular wax biosynthesis (Prupe2G112800). Only Prupe2G111700 contained a variant predicted to have a disruptive effect on the encoded protein, and was overexpressed in both heterozygous and homozygous individuals containing the Vr3 almond allele, compared with susceptible individuals. This information was also useful to identify and validate molecular markers tightly linked and flanking Vr3. In addition, the NILs used in this work will facilitate the introgression of this gene into peach elite materials, alone or pyramided with other known resistance genes such as peach powdery mildew resistance gene Vr2.","[Marimon, Neus; Arus, Pere; Eduardo, Iban] Ctr Res Agr Genom CRAG CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Marimon, Neus; Arus, Pere; Eduardo, Iban] IRTA Inst Recerca & Tecnol Agroalimentaries, Barcelona, Spain; [Marimon, Neus; Luque, Jordi] IRTA Cabrils, Plant Pathol, Carretera Cabrils Km 2, Cabrils 08348, Spain","Eduardo, I (corresponding author), Ctr Res Agr Genom CRAG CSIC IRTA UAB UB, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.; Eduardo, I (corresponding author), IRTA Inst Recerca & Tecnol Agroalimentaries, Barcelona, Spain.",iban.eduardo@irta.cat,"Luque, Jordi/B-1920-2010; Arus, Pere/F-6443-2015; Eduardo, Iban/J-9383-2015","Luque, Jordi/0000-0003-0751-9692; Arus, Pere/0000-0003-0939-8038; Eduardo, Iban/0000-0002-9963-2934","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (INIA) [RTA2015-00050-00-00, RTA2013-00004-C03-01]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SEV-2015-0533, AGL2015-68329-R]; CERCA Programme (Generalitat de Catalunya); project RIS3CAT (COTPA-FRUIT3CAT) - European Regional Development Fund through FEDER frame of Catalonia 2014-2020; INIAInstituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)","We acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (INIA grants RTA2015-00050-00-00 and RTA2013-00004-C03-01), the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in R&D 2016-2019 (SEV-2015-0533), grant AGL2015-68329-R, from the CERCA Programme (Generalitat de Catalunya) and from the project RIS3CAT (COTPA-FRUIT3CAT) financed by the European Regional Development Fund through the FEDER frame of Catalonia 2014-2020.

In this work, we studied the interspecific frequency of interaction (ifreq) and its spatiotemporal pattern between wild and domestic ungulates that coexist in free-ranging farms. For this purpose, 6 red deer, 6 wild boar, 8 Iberian pigs and 3 cattle were monitored using GPS devices during the montanera period (the period in which Iberian pigs are maintained in extensive conditions to feed on acorn). The ifreq was quantified for two spatiotemporal windows: 30 m - 10 min, for inferring potential direct interactions (short window), and 30 m - 12 days for indirect interactions (large window). Secondly, the variation in the ifreq was modelled with regard to 2 temporal (time of the day and week of the year) and 4 environmental factors (distance to water, distance to vegetation cover,Quercusdensity and distance to feeding points). The interactions at the short window were scarce (N = 13); however, they were very frequent at the large one (N = 37,429), with the red deer as the species with the greatest involvement in the interactions. Models showed that the time of the day and distance to water were the variables that best predicted the ifreq and they were conditioned by differences in the activity pattern of the targeted species. Food resource availability also predicted the ifreq, especially at the short window and between wild species. The results presented here highlight the role that wild ungulates may play in the transmission of pathogens to extensive livestock in general and pigs in particular and show the epidemiological risk of certain areas, periods of time and management practices (for wildlife and livestock) as well as providing useful information in the prevention of the transmission of shared pathogens.","[Triguero-Ocana, Roxana; Laguna, Eduardo; Jimenez-Ruiz, Saul; Fernandez-Lopez, Javier; Montoro, Vidal; Vicente, Joaquin; Acevedo, Pelayo] UCLM CSIC JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cinegeticos IREC, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Triguero-Ocana, Roxana; Barasona, Jose Angel] Univ Complutense Madrid, VISAVET Hlth Surveillance Ctr, Madrid, Spain; [Jimenez-Ruiz, Saul; Garcia-Bocanegra, Ignacio] Univ Cordoba, Fac Vet, Dept Sanidad Anim, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario CeiA3, Cordoba, Spain; [Risalde, Maria Angeles] Univ Cordoba, Fac Vet, Dept Anat & Anat Patol Comparadas, Cordoba, Spain; [Montoro, Vidal; Vicente, Joaquin; Acevedo, Pelayo] UCLM, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agronomos, Ciudad Real, Spain","Triguero-Ocana, R (corresponding author), UCLM CSIC JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cinegeticos IREC, Ciudad Real, Spain.",roxanatr@ucm.es,"Jimenez-Ruiz, Saul/AAG-7110-2019; Fernandez-Lopez, Javier/AAU-7282-2020; Barasona, Jose/ABH-7368-2020; Vicente, Joaquin/K-7822-2013","Fernandez-Lopez, Javier/0000-0003-4352-0252; Barasona, Jose/0000-0003-4066-8454; Triguero Ocana, Roxana/0000-0003-4875-4306; Jimenez-Ruiz, Saul/0000-0003-2090-9353; Montoro Angulo, Vidal/0000-0002-7975-669X; Laguna, Eduardo/0000-0003-0250-3157; Vicente, Joaquin/0000-0001-8416-3672","Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha [RYC-2012-11970]; Regional Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure of the Board of Extremadura [TB-PORCEX]; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La ManchaJunta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [AGL2013-49159-C2-2-R, AGL2016-76358-R]; EU projectEuropean Commission [H2020 VACDIVA 862874]; Comunidad de MadridComunidad de Madrid [PEJD-2019-POST/BIO-16805]","Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Grant/Award Number: RYC-2012-11970 and predoctoral contract; Regional Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure of the Board of Extremadura, Grant/Award Number: TB-PORCEX; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, Grant/Award Number: predoctoral contract; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: AGL2013-49159-C2-2-R and AGL2016-76358-R; EU project, Grant/Award Number: H2020 VACDIVA 862874; Comunidad de Madrid, Grant/Award Number: PEJD-2019-POST/BIO-16805",,60,3,3,9,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1865-1674,1865-1682,,TRANSBOUND EMERG DIS,Transbound.

Accurate predictions of the effects of these events on communities and designing scientific recovery and management programs for biodiversity require an understanding of the mechanisms underlying differentially-abundant taxa responses. Here, we assessed an arboreal mangrove mollusk community before and after an extreme cold event (ECE) to determine the effects of the ECE on deterministic and stochastic processes, as well as succession, in abundant and rare taxa. We found that the ECE caused increasingly divergent succession of mollusks, as reflected by changes in species richness and species turnover; these changes more strongly affected the abundant taxa than the rare taxa. The relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes in shaping mollusk communities was also altered after the ECE, although the effects differed between the abundant and rare species assemblages. That is, in response to the ECE, the abundant assemblage maintained a consistent level of mutualism while significantly increasing divergent succession by reducing ecological drift, decreasing niche breadths, weakening interspecific competition, promoting environmental selection, and increasing dispersal limitations. In contrast, the rare assemblage maintained high levels of divergent succession by increasing ecological drift, improving environmental filtering, decreasing niche breadths, weakening both interspecific competition and mutualism, and eroding spatial limits. Thus, species richness, species turnover, abundant species, and rare taxa should be the recommended indicators for the ECE; deterministic and stochastic processes should be mechanistic indexes for community coping with the ECE and also be theoretical indicators for biodiversity conservation and restoration after the ECE. More broadly, our results highlight that mechanistic indexes (deterministic and stochastic processes) and community structure indicators (species richness and species turnover) should be considered in differently-abundant taxa (abundant and rare taxa) in order to more accurately predict the effects of climate change on communities and devise targeted management and conservation strategies for the world's biodiversity.","[Chen, Guogui; Wang, Wenqing; Zhang, Yamian; Liu, Yi; Gu, Xuan; Shi, Xiaofang; Wang, Mao] Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, CN-361102 Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China","Wang, M (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, South Xiangan Rd, CN-361102 Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.",wangmao@xmu.edu.cn,,"Chen, Guogui/0000-0002-3931-079X; Xuan, Gu/0000-0002-1291-3697","Programs of Science and Technology on Basic Resources Survey for the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2017FY100701]; National Natural Science Foundation of China, ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31670490]","This work was supported by the Programs of Science and Technology on Basic Resources Survey for the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2017FY100701), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, China (No. 31670490).",,56,2,3,10,48,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Ambient temperatures may thus mediate competitive interactions among species that share resources. Different species of desert seed-harvesting ants (genusMessor) forage for similar food resources, and colonies can overlap in foraging areas. BecauseMessorspecies differ in body size distributions, and thermal tolerance is often size related in ants, we hypothesized that body size differences within and betweenMessorspecies would predict individual variation in worker thermal tolerances. Body size effects on thermal physiology could have implications for interspecific competition. We measured tolerances of extreme high (maximum critical temperature or CTmax) and low temperatures (CTmin) in twoMessorspecies simultaneously at the same study site, smaller bodiedM. ebeninusand larger bodiedM. arenarius. Although the species did not differ significantly in CTmin or CTmax, tolerance of high temperatures was significantly size dependent forM. ebeninus: worker tolerances of high temperatures decreased with body size in this species. The patterns suggest the foraging activity of the smallest workers of smaller bodied species could be more constrained by high ambient temperatures, which could impact the division of labor within colonies as well as interspecific interactions.","[O'Donnell, S.; Caponera, V.; Oxman, K.] Drexel Univ, Dept Biodivers Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bulova, S.] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Biol, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Giladi, I.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Beersheba, Israel","O'Donnell, S (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Biodivers Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",so356@drexel.edu,,,Drexel University Stein Family Fellowship,Funding was provided by a Drexel University Stein Family Fellowship (to S.

The feedback between plants and their local environment throughout the whole spectrum soil-root-shoot-environment is crucial to accurately describe and evaluate the impact of environmental changes on plant development. This study presents a 3D functional structural plant model, in which shoot and root growth are driven by radiative transfer, photosynthesis. and soil hydrodynamics through different parameterisation schemes relating soil water deficit and carbon assimilation. The new coupled model is used to evaluate the impact of soil moisture availability on plant productivity for two different groups of flowering plants under different spatial configurations. Methods In order to address different aspects of plant development due to limited soil water availability, a 3D FSP model including root. shoot, and soil was constructed by linking three different well-stablished models of airborne plant, root architecture, and reactive transport in the soil. Different parameterisation schemes were used in order to integrate photosynthetic rate with root water uptake within the coupled model. The behaviour of the model was assessed on how the growth of two different types of plants, i.e. monocot and dicot, is impacted by soil water deficit under different competitive conditions: isolated (no competition), intra, and interspecific competition. Key Results The model proved to be capable of simulating carbon assimilation and plant development under different growing settings including isolated monocots and dicots, inn-a, and interspecific competition. The model predicted that (1) soil water availability has a larger impact on photosynthesis than on carbon allocation; (2) soil water deficit has an impact on root and shoot biomass production by up to 90 % for monocots and 50 % for dicots; and (3) the improved dicot biomass production in interspecific competition was highly related to root depth and plant transpiration. Conclusions An integrated model of 3D shoot architecture and biomass development with a 3D root system representation, including light limitation and water uptake considering soil hydraulics, was presented. Plant-plant competition and regulation on stomata' conductance to drought were able to be predicted by the model. In the cases evaluated here, water limitation impacted plant growth almost 10 times more than the light environment.","[Braghiere, Renato K.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Braghiere, Renato K.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Braghiere, Renato K.; Gerard, Frederic] Univ Montpellier, Eco&Sols, CIRAD, INRAE,IRD,SupAgro, Montpellier, France; [Evers, Jochem B.] Wageningen Univ, Ctr Crop Syst Anal CSA, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pradal, Christophe] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France; [Pradal, Christophe] Univ Montpellier, AGAP, CIRAD, INRAE,SupAgro, Montpellier, France; [Pradal, Christophe] Univ Montpellier, INRIA, Montpellier, France; [Pages, Loic] INRAE, UR PSH 1115, Site Agroparc, Avignon, France","Braghiere, RK (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.; Braghiere, RK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Braghiere, RK (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Eco&Sols, CIRAD, INRAE,IRD,SupAgro, Montpellier, France.",renato.braghiere@gmail.com,"Renato, Braghiere/AAR-3506-2021; Renato, Braghiere/AAD-9886-2019","Renato, Braghiere/0000-0002-7722-717X; Renato, Braghiere/0000-0002-7722-717X; Evers, Jochem/0000-0002-3956-0190",European Research Council under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [727217],"This research was supported by the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program Remix (Redesigning European cropping systems based on species mixtures, https://www.remix-intercrops.eu/) [grant number 727217].",,84,0,0,7,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Yet, landscape-scale studies of major coastal rivers from the river mouth to the head of tide, such as this study, remain rare. Here, we develop a new predictive framework for estuarine-tidal river research and management using a river-specific low-water datum and the wetland inundation indicator SEVg, the growing-season sum exceedance value of hourly surface-water depth. The distribution and variability of the wetland species pool (n = 203) on the 234 river kilometer (rkm) lower Columbia River and estuary floodplain are described for the first time. 4,940 quadrats at 50 marshes were surveyed (2005-2016). Throughout the estuarine-tidal river system, SEV(g)was well suited to describe the wetland inundation regime and its variability based on the combination of longitudinal river position and elevation. SEV(g)increased significantly landward. Two primary wetland inundation regimes were identified: the seaward-tidal, usually greatest during the winter months, and landward-fluvial, greatest during the growing season. Nearest the ocean, salinity is the abiotic factor limiting species richness and non-native species. Farther upriver, the daily, seasonal, and interannual variability of the wetting and drying cycle encourage disturbance-tolerant species and non-natives and limit the number of hydrophytes and total vegetative cover. Hence, the average between-year similarity of site-scale areal cover significantly decreased landward. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated five vegetative groups and five ecohydrologic zones between rkm 0 and 234 were discriminated with 76 significant species-zone associations. All zones had unique indicator species. Species with high indicator values wereCarex lyngbyeithroughout the estuarine zones, andEleocharis palustris, Sagittaria latifolia, and the invasive non-nativePhalaris arundinaceain the upper estuarine and lower, middle, and upper tidal river zones (IV > 0.90). Competition fromC. lyngbyeinearest the ocean andP. arundinaceain the tidal river was associated with reduced species richness when total cover was >65%. This framework of filters informs the design and prediction of future wetland plant communities on coastal river floodplains.","[Borde, Amy B.; Diefenderfer, Heida L.; Cullinan, Valerie I.; Zimmerman, Shon A.; Thom, Ronald M.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Coastal Sci Div, Marine Sci Lab, 1529 West Sequim Bay Rd, Sequim, WA 98382 USA","Borde, AB (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Coastal Sci Div, Marine Sci Lab, 1529 West Sequim Bay Rd, Sequim, WA 98382 USA.",Amy.Borde@pnnl.gov,,"Borde, Amy/0000-0002-5603-2832; Diefenderfer, Heida L./0000-0001-6153-4565; Thom, Ronald/0000-0002-8639-6709; Zimmerman, Shon/0000-0003-4743-9566",CEERP: four studies by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA); U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Portland District,"Data collection and analysis were mostly funded through the CEERP: four studies by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and three studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Portland District.

The size of nest box entrance holes affects occupancy, interspecific competition, and nest predation for a number of bird species, but effects on prey delivery success are unstudied. We used digital video cameras to monitor kestrels using two nest box designs, one with a small circular entrance hole (8.75 cm in diameter; n=8) and the other with a large U-shaped entrance hole (7.62 cm wide by 12.07 cm high; n = 6), to compare the rates at which kestrels failed to deliver large prey (vertebrates) into the nest box while provisioning nestlings. Across 111 d of monitoring, we observed a significantly higher prey delivery failure rate at the boxes with small holes (8.9%) compared to boxes with large holes (1.6%). Boxes with small holes fledged 4.33 nestlings and boxes with large holes fledged 4.5. These results suggest that kestrels nesting in boxes with small entrance holes may have higher costs while provisioning nestlings, compared to kestrels using boxes with larger entrance holes. We conclude that the ideal entrance hole size for kestrel nest boxes may be a compromise between being small enough to minimize predation, yet large enough to allow kestrels with large prey to easily enter. Future research should investigate whether boxes with higher prey delivery failure laws have lower reproductive success.","[Clark, Logan B.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Shave, Megan E.; Hannay, Melissa B.; Lindell, Catherine A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Shave, Megan E.; Hannay, Melissa B.] Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lindell, Catherine A.] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Shave, Megan E.] City Brockton, Dept Planning & Econ Dev, Brockton, MA 02301 USA","Clark, LB (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",clarklog95@gmail.com,,,NIFA Specialty Crop Research Initiative program [MICL05052]; NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program [1518366],"We thank the many fruit growers in Michigan who allowed us to install nest boxes on their properties.

Some members of these networks can improve plant health thanks to an important diversity of bioactive secondary metabolites. In this competitive environment, the ability to form biofilms may provide major advantages to microorganisms. With the aim of highlighting the impact of bacterial lifestyle on secondary metabolites production, we performed a metabolomic analysis on four fluorescentPseudomonasstrains cultivated in planktonic and biofilm colony conditions. The untargeted metabolomic analysis led to the detection of hundreds of secondary metabolites in culture extracts. Comparison between biofilm and planktonic conditions showed that bacterial lifestyle is a key factor influencingPseudomonasmetabolome. More than 50% of the detected metabolites were differentially produced according to planktonic or biofilm lifestyles, with the fourPseudomonasstrains overproducing several secondary metabolites in biofilm conditions. In parallel, metabolomic analysis associated with genomic prediction and a molecular networking approach enabled us to evaluate the impact of bacterial lifestyle on chemically identified secondary metabolites, more precisely involved in microbial interactions and plant-growth promotion. Notably, this work highlights the major effect of biofilm lifestyle on acyl-homoserine lactone and phenazine productionin P. chlororaphisstrains.","[Rieusset, Laura; Rey, Marjolaine; Muller, Daniel; Gerin, Florence; Dubost, Audrey; Comte, Gilles; Prigent-Combaret, Claire] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5557, INRAe UMR 1418,Ecol Microbienne VetAgroSup,Univ L, 43 Blvd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Vacheron, Jordan] Univ Lausanne, Dept Fundamental Microbiol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Prigent-Combaret, C (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5557, INRAe UMR 1418,Ecol Microbienne VetAgroSup,Univ L, 43 Blvd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",claire.prigent-combaret@univ-lyon1.fr,"Vacheron, Jordan/C-8123-2019; Muller, Daniel/C-6827-2008; Comte, Gilles/P-5701-2016","Vacheron, Jordan/0000-0003-0031-1338; Muller, Daniel/0000-0002-6619-4691; Comte, Gilles/0000-0003-1191-6455; Rieusset, Laura/0000-0003-0057-9860",,,,87,8,8,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-7915,,,MICROB BIOTECHNOL,Microb.

Extant host-parasite associations are the result of tight reciprocal adaptations that allow parasites to exploit specific biological features of their hosts to ensure their transmission, survival, and maintenance of viable populations. As a result, parasites may affect host physiology, morphology, reproduction or behaviour, and they are increasingly recognized as having significant impacts on host individuals, populations, communities and even ecosystems. Although this is usually acknowledged by parasite ecologists, fish ecologists often ignore parasitism in their studies, often acting as though their systems are free of parasites. However, the effects of parasites on their hosts can alter variables routinely used in fish ecology, ranging from the level of individual fish (e.g. condition factors) to populations (e.g. estimates of mortality and reproductive success) or communities (e.g. measures of interspecific competition or the structure and functioning of food webs). By affecting fish physiology, parasites can also interfere with measurements of trophic levels by means of stable isotope composition, or have antagonistic or synergistic effects with host parameters normally used as indicators of different sources of pollution. Changes in host behaviour induced by parasites can also modify host distribution patterns, habitat selection, diet composition, sexual behaviour, etc., with implications for the ecology of fish and of their predators and prey. In this review, we summarise and illustrate the likely biases and erroneous conclusions that one may expect from studies of fish ecology that ignore parasites, from the individual to the community level. Given the impact of parasites across all levels of biological organisation, we show that their omission from the design and analyses of ecological studies poses real risks of flawed interpretations for those patterns and processes that ecologists seek to uncover.

Besides changes in population-level interspecific interactions, such range shifts may also cause changes in functional structure within the host assemblages, which can result in losses or gains in ecosystem functions. Because consumer-resource dynamics are central to community regulation, functional reorganization driven by introduction of new consumer species can have large consequences on ecosystem functions. Here we experimentally examine the extent to which the recent poleward range expansion of the intertidal grazer limpetScurria viridulaalong the coast of Chile has altered the role of the resident congeneric limpetS. zebrina,and whether the net collective impacts, and functional structure, of the entire herbivore guild have been modified by the introduction of this new member. We examined the functional role ofScurriaspecies in controlling ephemeral algal cover, bare rock availability, and species richness and diversity, and compared the effects in the region of range overlap against their respective native abutted ranges. Experiments showed depression of per capita effects of the range-expanded species within the region of overlap, suggesting environmental conditions negatively affect individual performance. In contrast, effects ofS. zebrinawere commonly invariant at its range edge. When comparing single species versus polycultures, effects on bare rock cover were altered by the presence of the otherScurriaspecies, suggesting competition betweenScurriaspecies. Importantly, although the magnitude ofS. viridulaeffects at the range overlap was reduced, its addition to the herbivore guild seems to complement and intensify the role of the guild in reducing green algal cover, species richness and increasing bare space provision. Our study thus highlights that range expansion of an herbivore can modify the functional guild structure in the recipient community. It also highlights the complexity of predicting how functional structure may change in the face of natural or human-induced range expansions. There is a need for more field-based examination of regional functional compensation, complementarity, or inhibition before we can construct a conceptual framework to anticipate the consequences of species range expansions.","[Aguilera, Moises A.] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Biol Marina, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; [Aguilera, Moises A.] Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas CEAZA, Ossandon 877, Coquimbo, Chile; [Valdivia, Nelson] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia 5110236, Chile; [Valdivia, Nelson] Ctr FONDAP Invest Dinam Ecosistemas Marinos Altas, Santiago, Chile; [Broitman, Bernardo R.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Artes Liberales, Dept Ciencias Biol, Vina De Mar, Chile; [Jenkins, Stuart R.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Anglesey LL59 5AB, Wales; [Navarrete, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile","Aguilera, MA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Biol Marina, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.; Aguilera, MA (corresponding author), Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas CEAZA, Ossandon 877, Coquimbo, Chile.",moises.aguilera@ucn.cl,"Broitman, Bernardo R/D-6007-2013","Broitman, Bernardo R/0000-0001-6582-3188; Aguilera, Moises/0000-0002-3517-6255","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient~ifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11121360, 1160223]; Proyecto de Atraccion e Insercion de Capital Humano Avanzado en la Academia-Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (PAI-CONICYT) [79150002]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1190529, 1181300]; MUSELS Nucleus - Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio; Centro de Investigacion: Dinamica de Ecosistemas Marinos de Altas Latitudes, IDEAL [FONDAP 15150003]","This research was funded through Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient~ifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) 11121360, 1160223, and Proyecto de Atraccion e Insercion de Capital Humano Avanzado en la Academia-Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (PAI-CONICYT) 79150002 to MAA.

The conservation of large wild herbivores presents a challenge posed by the fact that their broad habitat requirements overlap with various human activities. Elucidating the factors that explain their distribution patterns provides us with a better understanding of habitat-species relationships and facilitates the design of effective management policies. Aims. Identify the natural (forage availability, weather) and anthropogenic (hunting, interspecific competition) factors that explain the abundance and productivity distribution of the guanaco. Estimate guanaco abundance and productivity and describe their distribution. Methods. We estimated the abundance and productivity of guanaco by using aerial surveys during the breeding and non-breeding season of two consecutive years, following the strip-transect methodology; we then modelled these as a function of environmental factors by means of density surface models. Key results. The highest abundance and productivity of guanaco occurred mostly where mesic grassland was dominant. Guanaco abundance presented three hotspots on the basis of geographic location, and family groups were more productive at low to intermediate livestock level. Abundance was significantly higher in the breeding season for both years (5614 and 14 092 individuals) than in the non-breeding season (2922 and 6926 individuals), and it was higher in 2015 than in 2014. Productivity was higher in 2015 than in 2014 (0.54 and 0.46 calves per adult respectively). Conclusions. Guanaco responded to forage availability, occupying zones with low to intermediate food availability in the breeding season, and those with the highest availability in the non-breeding season. This could be due to interspecific competition between livestock and guanaco family groups. We propose that the overall guanaco response could also be explained by social structure or by unassessed factors such as predation risk by feral dogs. Implications. The guanaco could compensate for the use of habitats with a lower food availability during the breeding season by using better-quality habitats during the non-breeding season.","[Flores, Celina E.; Adrian, Schiavini] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Austral Invest Cient CADIC, Bernardo Houssay 200,V9410, Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina; [Bellis, Laura M.] UNC, CONICET, CONAE, Inst Altos Estudios Espaciales Mario Gulich, Ruta Prov C45,CPA X5187XAC, Cordoba, Argentina; [Bellis, Laura M.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Catedra Ecol, Av Velez Sarsfield 299,X5000 JJC, Cordoba, Argentina; [Adrian, Schiavini] Univ Nacl Tierra Fuego Antartida & Islas Atlantic, Inst Ciencias Polares Ambiente & Recursos Nat, Fuegia Basket 251, Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina; [Adrian, Schiavini] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Flores, CE (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Austral Invest Cient CADIC, Bernardo Houssay 200,V9410, Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina.",celiflores1@gmail.com,,"Schiavini, Adrian Carlos Miguel/0000-0001-6621-4827",CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Agencia Nacional de Promocion de la Ciencia y la TecnologiaANPCyT [PICT 1329/2011]; Wildlife Conservation Society,"This work was supported by CONICET, by the Agencia Nacional de Promocion de la Ciencia y la Tecnologia (PICT 1329/2011) and by the Wildlife Conservation Society.

The present study, undertaken by the Norfolk Crucian Project, reports on reductions in pond populations of crucian carp in Norfolk, eastern England as well as the success of recent introduction/re-introduction efforts in terms of crucian survival, recruitment and growth over the last 10 years. A 72% decline in crucian carp distribution was observed between the 1950s-1980s and the 2010s. Of 18 crucian carp introductions/re-introductions to restored and suitable existing ponds, 17 were successful in terms of survival, increasing the number of current crucian sites in Norfolk by 37%. Recruitment of young crucian carp was demonstrated for 12 of the 18 stocked ponds, with apparent elevated juvenile growth relative to other English and European populations. Delays in, or a lack of, crucian recruitment in some ponds appeared to result from the presence of other fish species (especially threespine sticklebackGasterosteus aculeatus) with predation and interspecific competition possible contributory factors. This study shows that, through combinations of pond rehabilitation and stocking, it has been possible to achieve a substantial recovery of crucian carp populations in the study region. Although the crucian carp is currently presumed to be non-native within England, given other scientific studies that show a lack of adverse impacts of this species on native biota, and because it is greatly threatened in its native range, the call is sounded for more crucian carp conservation projects in other parts of England as well as in Europe more generally.","[Sayer, Carl D.; Emson, Dave; Patmore, Ian R.; Greaves, Helen M.; West, William P.; Wiseman, Glen; Cooper, Bernard] UCL, Environm Change Res Ctr, Dept Geog, Pond Restorat Res Grp, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Payne, Jonathan; Davies, Gareth D.] Environm Agcy, Fisheries Tech Serv, Brampton, England; [Tarkan, Ali Serhan] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fac Fisheries, Mugla, Turkey; [Tarkan, Ali Serhan; Copp, Gordon H.] Univ Lodz, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Lodz, Poland; [Cooper, George] Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Copp, Gordon H.] Cefas, Salmon & Freshwater Team, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England; [Copp, Gordon H.] Bournemouth Univ, Ctr Ecol Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Poole, Dorset, England","Sayer, CD (corresponding author), UCL, Environm Change Res Ctr, Dept Geog, Pond Restorat Res Grp, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",c.sayer@ucl.ac.uk,"Tarkan, Ali Serhan/AAT-7207-2021","Tarkan, Ali Serhan/0000-0001-8628-0514",UCL MSc in Aquatic Science; Cefas' Science Excellence fund; Norfolk Ponds Project; Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership; Environment Agency; Norfolk Anglers Conservation Association; Environmental Change Research Centre at UCL,"Thanks are due to many anglers, landowners and land managers for valuable information on crucian carp distribution past and present and for site access.

We video recorded a total of 600 actively foraging birds at the intertidal mudflats of the lagoon during the wintering period. We collected data on capturing rates, foraging method and movement characteristics for each observed individual. Results highlighted that studied shorebird species showed marked differences in their feeding strategies and movements when foraging. Plovers used exclusively a visual-run-stop strategy (superficial pecks), unlike Scolopacidae species that showed a wider range of types of feeding behaviour. Generally, this group favoured a tactile-continuous hunting strategy and it can be divided into two important subgroups. The first, including calidrids and shanks, used a mixed hunting strategy (pecking and probing) and had the highest prey capture rate and the fastest feeding rhythm, whereas the second included larger shorebirds that predominantly used tactile foraging technique with a slower rhythm and straighter trajectory. These differences in foraging behaviour and strategies suggest that shorebird species are able to exploit the intertidal flats and trophic resources of Merja Zerga in different ways, a fact that ensures that this site can host large numbers of birds at the same time, because of a lower level of interspecific competition.","[Touhami, Feirouz; Idrissi, Hamid Rguibi; Benhoussa, Abdelaziz] Univ Mohammed 5, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Rabat, Morocco","Touhami, F (corresponding author), Univ Mohammed 5, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Rabat, Morocco.",feirouztouhami1@gmail.com,,,,,,54,0,0,4,7,NATL INQUIRY SERVICES CENTRE PTY LTD,GRAHAMSTOWN,"19 WORCESTER STREET, PO BOX 377, GRAHAMSTOWN 6140, SOUTH AFRICA",0030-6525,1727-947X,,OSTRICH,Ostrich,JUL 2,2020,91,3,,,,,244,251,,10.2989/00306525.2020.1774439,,AUG 2020,8,Ornithology,Zoology,NR1LJ,WOS:000556522900001,,,,,2021-09-21,

The system may exist in the mean-field condensate state, enabling the competition of the Coulomb coupling, contact repulsion, and kinetic energy of the particles, provided that their effective mass is reduced by means of a lattice potential. The respective model combines the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations for the two-component wave function of the cations and anions, coupled to the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential mediating the Coulomb interaction. In addition to its direct introduction, the contact interaction in the GP system can be derived, in the Thomas-Fermi approximation, from a system of three GP equations, which includes the wave function of heavy neutral (buffer) atoms. In the system with fully repulsive contact interactions, we construct stable spatially periodic patterns (density waves, akin to ionic crystals). The transition to the density wave is identified by analysis of the modulational instability of a uniformly mixed neutral state. The density-wave pattern, which represents the system's ground state (GS), is accurately predicted by a variational approximation. In the 2D case, a stable pattern is produced too, with a quasi-1D shape. The 1D system with contact self-attraction in each component produces bright solitons of three types: neutral ones, with fully mixed components, dipoles, with the components separated by the interspecies contact repulsion, and quadrupoles, with a layer of one component sandwiched between side lobes formed by the other. The transition from the neutral solitons to dipoles is accurately modeled analytically. A chart of the GSs of the different types (neutral solitons, dipoles, or quadrupoles) is produced. Different soliton species do not coexist as stable states. Collisions between traveling solitons are studied too. Collisions are elastic for dipole-dipole pairs, while dipole-antidipole ones merge into stable quadrupoles via multiple collisions.","[Sakaguchi, Hidetsugu] Kyushu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Engn Sci, Dept Appl Sci Elect & Mat, Kasuga, Fukuoka 8168580, Japan; [Malomed, Boris A.] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Engn, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Phys Elect, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Malomed, Boris A.] Tel Aviv Univ, Ctr Light Matter Interact, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Malomed, Boris A.] Univ Tarapaca, Inst Alta Invest, Casilla 7D, Arica, Chile","Sakaguchi, H (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Engn Sci, Dept Appl Sci Elect & Mat, Kasuga, Fukuoka 8168580, Japan.",,,,"Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1286/17]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18K03462]","The work of B.A.M. is supported, in part, by the Israel Science Foundation through Grant No. 1286/17.

These stressors could be particularly destructive in arid systems where species are already water-limited. Understanding plant responses in terms of photosynthesis and growth to drought and rewatering is essential for predicting ecosystem-level responses to climate change. Different drought responses of C(3)and C(4)species could have important ecological implications affecting interspecific competition and distribution of plant communities in the future. For this study, C(4)plantPennisetum centrasiaticumand C(3)plantCalamagrostis pseudophragmiteswere subjected to progressive drought and subsequent rewatering in order to better understand their differential responses to regional climate changes. We tracked responses in gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, biomass as well as soil water status in order to investigate the ecophysiological responses of these two plant functional types. Similar patterns of photosynthetic regulations were observed during drought and rewatering for both psammophytes. They experienced stomatal restriction and nonstomatal restriction successively during drought. Photosynthetic performance recovered to the levels in well-watered plants after rewatering for 6-8 days. The C(4)plant,P. centrasiaticum, exhibited the classic CO2-concentrating mechanism and more efficient thermal dissipation in the leaves, which confers more efficient CO(2)assimilation and water use efficiency, alleviating drought stress, maintaining their photosynthetic advantage until water deficits became severe and quicker recovery after rewatering. In addition,P. centrasiaticumcan allocate a greater proportion of root biomass in case of adequate water supply and a greater proportion of above-ground biomass in case of drought stress. This physiological adaptability and morphological adjustment underline the capacity of C(4)plantP. centrasiaticumto withstand drought more efficiently and recover upon rewatering more quickly thanC. pseudophragmitesand dominate in the Horqin Sandy Land.","[Luo, Yayong; Zhao, Xueyong; Wang, Lilong; Huang, Wenda; Zhang, Rui; Luo, Yongqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yayong; Huang, Wenda] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lab Stress Ecophysiol & Biotechnol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Allington, Ginger R.

By contrast, a positive density-dependent growth rate is thought to favor species exclusion by inhibiting the growth of less competitive species. Yet, such conspecific positive density dependence often reduces extrinsic mortality (e.g. reduced predation), which favors species exclusion in the first place. Here, using a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, I show that this form of positive density dependence can favor the existence of equilibrium points characterized by species coexistence. Those equilibria are not globally stable, but allow the maintenance of species-rich communities in multispecies simulations. Therefore, conspecific positive density dependence does not necessarily favor species exclusion. On the contrary, some forms of conspecific positive density dependence may even help maintain species richness in natural communities. These results should stimulate further investigations into the precise mechanisms underlying density dependence.","[Aubier, Thomas G.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland","Aubier, TG (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.",thomas.aubier@normalesup.org,,"Aubier, Thomas G./0000-0001-8543-5596",,,,73,1,1,3,3,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,JUN 18,2020,9,,,,,,,,e57788,10.7554/eLife.57788,,,18,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,MB9RC,WOS:000542933800001,32553104,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Here we propose a joint compositional- and interaction-based analysis for ecological status assessment and apply it on the benthic communities of the Bagnoli Bay. We found that contamination differentially affects the communities' composition in the bay, with prokaryotes influenced only by depth, and benthos not following the environmental gradient at all. This result is confirmed by analyses of the community structure, whose network structure suggest fast carbon flow and cycling, especially promoted by nematodes and polychaetes; the benthic prey/predator biomass ratio, adjusted for competition, successfully synthesise the status of predator taxa. We found demersal fish communities to separate into a deep, pelagic-like community, and two shallow communities where a shift from exclusive predators to omnivores occurs, moving from the most polluted to the least polluted sampling units. Finally, our study indicate that indices based on interspecific interactions are better indicators of environmental gradients than those defined based on species composition exclusively.","[Mele, Bruno Hay; Russo, Luca; Crocetta, Fabio; Danovaro, Roberto; Musco, Luigi; Riginella, Emilio; Tangherlini, Michael; d'Alcala, Maurizio Ribera; D'Alelio, Domenico] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Gambi, Cristina; Dell'Anno, Antonio; Danovaro, Roberto] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci DiSVA, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60100 Ancona, Italy; [Guglielmo, Rosanna; Patti, Francesco Paolo] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80077 Naples, Italy","Mele, BH (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",bruno.haymele@szn.it,"Mele, Bruno Hay/U-5841-2019; Dell'Anno, Antonio AD/G-9468-2012; D'Alelio, Domenico/ABD-6565-2020; Tangherlini, Michael/AAL-8923-2021; Musco, Luigi/B-7986-2015","Mele, Bruno Hay/0000-0001-5579-183X; Dell'Anno, Antonio AD/0000-0002-4324-7834; Crocetta, Fabio/0000-0002-2800-3735; D'Alelio, Domenico/0000-0002-2189-503X; Riginella, Emilio/0000-0002-1442-8310; Russo, Luca/0000-0002-8550-6400; Musco, Luigi/0000-0003-4750-4129","project AbBaCo - Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research [C62F16000170001]","This work was supported by the project AbBaCo, funded by the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research (grant number C62F16000170001).

We previously found that replacement of the human-origin PA gene segment in avian influenza virus (AIV) could overcome barriers to cross-species transmission. Recently, it was reported that the PA gene segment encodes both the PA protein and a second protein, PA-X. Here, we investigated the role of PA-X. We found that an H9N2 avian influenza reassortant virus bearing a human-origin H1N1/2009 PA gene was attenuated in mice after the loss of PA-X. Reverse genetics analyses of PA-X substitutions conserved in human influenza viruses indicated that R195K, K206R, and P210L substitutions conferred significantly increased replication and pathogenicity on H9N2 virus in mice and ferrets. PA-X R195K was present in all human H7N9 and H1N1/2009 viruses and predominated in human H5N6 viruses. Compared with PA-X 195R, H7N9 influenza viruses bearing PA-X 195K showed increased replication and transmission in ferrets. We further showed that PA-X 195K enhanced lung inflammatory responses, potentially due to decreased host shutoff function. A competitive transmission study in ferrets indicated that 195K provides a replicative advantage over 195R in H1N1/2009 viruses. In contrast, PA-X 195K did not influence the virulence of H9N2 AIV in chickens, suggesting that the effects of the substitution were mammal specific. Therefore, future surveillance efforts should scrutinize this region of PA-X because of its potential impact on cross-species transmission of influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE Four influenza pandemics in humans (the Spanish flu of 1918 [H1N1], the Asian flu of 1957 [H2N2], the Hong Kong flu of 1968 [H3N2], and the swine origin flu of 2009 [H1N1]) are all proposed to have been caused by avian or swine influenza viruses that acquired virulence factors through adaptive mutation or reassortment with circulating human viruses. Currently, influenza viruses circulating in animals are repeatedly transmitted to humans, posing a significant threat to public health. However, the molecular properties accounting for interspecies transmission of influenza viruses remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that PA-X plays an important role in cross-species transmission of influenza viruses. At least three human-specific amino acid substitutions in PA-X dramatically enhanced the adaptation of animal influenza viruses in mammals. In particular, PA-X 195K might have contributed to cross-species transmission of H7N9, H5N6, and H1N1/2009 viruses from animal reservoirs to humans.","[Sun, Yipeng; Hu, Zhe; Zhang, Xuxiao; Chen, Mingyue; Wang, Zhen; Xu, Guanlong; Tong, Qi; Wang, Mingyang; Sun, Honglei; Pu, Juan; Liu, Jinhua] China Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Minist Agr, Key Lab Anim Epidemiol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bi, Yuhai] Chinese Acad Sci, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, Ctr Influenza Res & Early Warning CASCIRE, Inst Microbiol,CAS Key Lab Pathogen Microbiol & I, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Iqbal, Munir] Pirbright Inst, Woking, Surrey, England","Sun, YP; Liu, JH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Minist Agr, Key Lab Anim Epidemiol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",sypcau@163.com; ljh@cau.edu.cn,,"Iqbal, Munir/0000-0001-5165-5339","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31761133003, 31961130381]; National Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars [31522058]; Newton Advanced Fellowships from the Royal Society [NAF\R1\191166]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0501601]; Chang Jiang Scholars ProgramProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31761133003 and 31961130381), the National Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars (31522058), Newton Advanced Fellowships from the Royal Society (NAF\R1\191166), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0501601), and grants from the Chang Jiang Scholars Program.",,60,11,11,5,32,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0022-538X,1098-5514,,J VIROL,J.

Species have a specific functional position in the biological community, resulting in interactions like interspecific competition. In this study, we used biological traits in order to define the life strategies of 205 nektonic species of the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, traits related to resource use were analyzed to determine the level of trait and niche overlap and their relationship to life strategies. Focusing on habitats of importance (Posidonia beds, coralligene formations, and lagoons), we investigated strategies and niches of the species present there. Finally, we examined the life strategy of Lessepsian species and investigated the niche overlap between them and indigenous species. Archetypal analysis indicated the existence of three life histories corresponding to strategies already documented for fish (equilibrium, periodic, and opportunistic), with some species also placed in intermediate positions. Niche overlap was evaluated by multiple correspondence analysis and the generation of a single distance metric between all species pairs. This identified species occupying relatively empty (underexploited) ecological niches, like the Lessepsian species Siganus luridus and S. rivulatus, a finding that can also be associated with their establishment in the Mediterranean. Most Lessepsian species were associated with the opportunistic life history strategy, again an important aspect related to their establishment. Also, we documented that most species occurring in important habitats have a relatively high overlap of niches. No significant differences were found in the life strategies across Mediterranean habitats; however, variation in niche overlap and traits related to habitat use was detected. The findings can be useful to determine theoretical competition between species and to identify empty ecological niches. Fisheries science can also benefit from comprehending the dynamics of competing stocks or predict the responses of data-poor stocks to anthropogenic stressors from known examples of species with shared life strategies.","[Koutsidi, Martha; Moukas, Catherine; Tzanatos, Evangelos] Univ Patras, Dept Biol, GR-26504 Patras, Greece","Koutsidi, M (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Biol, GR-26504 Patras, Greece.",koutsidi@upatras.gr,"Tzanatos, Evangelos/A-7693-2013","Tzanatos, Evangelos/0000-0001-9972-9632; Koutsidi, Martha/0000-0002-7391-8459",University of Patras via K.

Alligator Gar Atractosteus spatula are being stocked as age-0 fish in efforts to re-establish extirpated populations. However, gars are known to be highly cannibalistic in hatcheries, suggesting that age-0 Alligator Gar introduced into natural habitats may face predation pressures from other gar species, limiting the likelihood of released fish recruiting to the population. Furthermore, introduced age-0 gar may not have the proper prey resources for rapid growth that would facilitate recruitment to adulthood. Texoma Reservoir, located on the Oklahoma-Texas border, hosts four native gar species, including the Alligator Gar, whose population is supported by supplemental stocking of age-0 fingerlings. We investigated feeding by age-0 gar to obtain a baseline level of trophic ecology for this group of fishes, including the potential for poststocking cannibalism. Food webs were reconstructed via analysis of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes using Bayesian mixing model approaches. Isotopic values for age-0 fish of all four gar species were similar. Invertebrates represented a large fraction of the diet for all gars, followed by Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella. Competitive interactions among Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, White Bass Morone chrysops, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, and young gar may occur for invertebrates, shads Dorosoma spp., and Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis but are likely short-lived due to the rapid growth of age-0 gar after their transition to piscivory. Trophic position of age-0 Alligator Gar, Longnose Gar Lepisosteus osseus, and Spotted Gar Lepisosteus oculatus was positively related to TL, but this relationship was not observed for Shortnose Gar Lepisosteus platostomus. In Texoma Reservoir, the four native gar species, including stocked Alligator Gar, appear to have adequate food resources for recruitment, with little indication of within-family or interspecific predation. This suggests that stocked Alligator Gar quickly acclimated to their new environment.","[Snow, Richard A.; Porta, Michael J.] Oklahoma Fishery Res Lab, Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, 500 East Constellat, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Stewart, David R.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Biol Sci, 500 Gold Ave Southwest, Albuquerque, NM 87103 USA; [Long, James M.] Oklahoma State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oklahoma Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 007 Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Snow, RA (corresponding author), Oklahoma Fishery Res Lab, Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, 500 East Constellat, Norman, OK 73072 USA.",richard.snow@odwc.ok.gov,,"Long, James/0000-0002-8658-9949; Stewart, David/0000-0003-3103-5372","U.S. Sportfish Restoration Grants [F-86-D-1, F-50-R-20]; Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (ODWC); Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (U.S. Geological Survey); Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (Wildlife Management Institute); Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cooperating)","We thank those individuals who assisted with field and laboratory work and analysis of forage, including J.

While spatial self-organization can have important effects on the functioning, ecology and evolution of communities, the underlying determinants of spatial self-organization remain unclear. Here, we hypothesize that the presence of physical objects across a surface can have important effects on spatial self-organization. Using pairs of isogenic strains of Pseudomonas stutzeri, we performed range expansion experiments in the absence or presence of physical objects and quantified the effects on spatial self-organization. We demonstrate that physical objects create local deformities along the expansion frontier, and these deformities increase in magnitude during range expansion. The deformities affect the densities of interspecific boundaries and diversity along the expansion frontier, and thus affect spatial self-organization, but the effects are interaction-dependent. For competitive interactions that promote sectorized patterns of spatial self-organization, physical objects increase the density of interspecific boundaries and diversity. By contrast, for cross-feeding interactions that promote dendritic patterns, they decrease the density of interspecific boundaries and diversity. These qualitatively different outcomes are probably caused by fundamental differences in the orientations of the interspecific boundaries. Thus, in order to predict the effects of physical objects on spatial self-organization, information is needed regarding the interactions present within a community and the general geometric shapes of spatial self-organization that emerge from those interactions.

When infection advances, other organs can be occupied with severe effects on host individual health and population dynamics. Existing studies focused on these host/parasite systems are still scarce due to the usual low prevalence in ecosystems. Using cockles (Cerastoderma spp.) and two trematode species (Monorchis parvus and Gymnophallus choledochus) infecting these bivalves as first and second intermediate host, the present work aimed to (1) summarize the most relevant literature and (2) provide new information regarding this host/parasite system, taking advantage of a 21-year monthly database from Banc d'Arguin (France). This long-term monitoring showed that different trematode species display varying host size range preference (6-38 and 31-36 mm for M. parvus and G. choledochus, respectively). The occurrence of coinfection was lower than expected, raising some questions related to parasite interspecific competition. This review improved our understanding of the processes shaping the prevalence and distribution of parasitism. This study highlighted that beyond constant trematode assemblage monitoring, there is a need to identify the main predictors of rediae/sporocysts infection, such as the definitive host dynamics and miracidium infection processes, for future better management of host severe disease and mortality episodes.","[Magalhaes, Luisa; Freitas, Rosa] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Daffe, Guillemine] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, Observ Aquitain Sci Univers, UMS 2567 POREA, F-33615 Pessac, France; [de Montaudouin, Xavier] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR EPOC, Stn Marine, 2 Rue Pr Jolyet, F-33120 Arcachon, France","Magalhaes, L (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",luisa.magalhaes@ua.pt,"Magalhaes, Luisa/K-3876-2014; Freitas, Rosa/A-7539-2012","Magalhaes, Luisa/0000-0002-9862-9653; Freitas, Rosa/0000-0003-4900-3897",INTERREG-ATLANTIC programme through the research project COCKLES [EAPA_458/2016]; FCT/MCTESPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDP/50017/2020+UIDB/50017/2020],"Luisa Magalhaes benefited from a post-doctoral research fellowship funded by INTERREG-ATLANTIC programme through the research project COCKLES (EAPA_458/2016 COCKLES Co-Operation for Restoring CocKle SheLlfisheries & its Ecosystem-Services in the Atlantic Area).

Salinity choice experiments revealed that juveniles of this species significantly prefer brackish water (salinity 20) to freshwater (salinity 0) when acclimated to a salinity of 20 in advance. Additional experiments revealed no preference between brackish water and seawater (salinity 35). Since body size was not correlated with the strength of preference for brackish water, and adults of this species are also known to prefer brackish water at a salinity of 20 to freshwater, the preference for saline water may be consistent after migration to a freshwater area. Considering that juvenile G. petschiliensis would often migrate to freshwater areas just after entering streams, the migration should be against its salinity preference. This directly contrasts with other diadromous species, which prefer the salinity of destination areas during and after migration. Adult and juvenile G. petschiliensis may take advantage of high euryhalinity to choose habitats where such ecological costs, such as high predation risk and interspecific competition, are low (i.e., freshwater areas).","[Oto, Yumeki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Div Biol Sci, Kyoto, Japan","Oto, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Div Biol Sci,Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwakecho, Kyoto, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",ooto.yumeki.78s@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

The Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans) is an excellent proxy species because of its wide geographic and temporal distribution: its native and introduced combined range spans half the globe and it has been living for at least seven centuries wherever it was introduced. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of long-term isolation (insularity; up to 4,000 years) and geographic variables on skull shape variation using geometric morphometrics. A sample of 513 specimens from 103 islands and four mainland areas was analysed. This study, to my knowledge the first to extensively sample introduced rats, analysed 59 two-dimensional landmarks on the skull. Landmarks were obtained in three separate aspects (dorsal, lateral, ventral skull view). The coordinate data were then subjected to a multivariate ordination analysis (principal components analysis, or PCA), multivariate regressions, and a canonical variates analysis (CVA). Three measures of disparity were evaluated for each view. The results show that introduced Polynesian rats evolve skull shapes that conform to the general mammalian interspecific pattern of cranial evolutionary allometry (CREA), with proportionally longer snouts in larger specimens. In addition, larger skulls are more tubular in shape than the smaller skulls, which are more balloon-shaped with a rounder and wider braincase relative to those of large skulls. This difference is also observed between the sexes (sexual dimorphism), due to the slightly larger average male size. Large, tubular skulls with long snouts are typical for Polynesia and Remote Oceania, where no native mammals occur. The greater disparity of Polynesian rats on mammal species-poor islands ('exulans-only' region) provides further insight into how diversity may affect diversification through ecological release from predators and competitors.","[van der Geer, Alexandra A.

Phenology, the timing of seasonal biological events including leaf-out, flowering, fruiting, and leaf senescence, is among the most visible and oft-recorded facets of plant ecology. Climate-driven shifts in plant phenology can alter reproductive success, interspecific competition, and trophic interactions. Low-cost phenology research, including observational records and experimental manipulations, is fundamental to our understanding of both the mechanisms and effects of phenological change in plant populations, species, and communities. Traditions of local-scale botanical phenology observations and data leveraged from written records and natural history collections provide the historical context for recent observations of changing phenologies. New technology facilitates expanding the spatial, taxonomic, and human interest in this research by combining contemporary field observations by researchers and open access community science (e.g., USA National Phenology Network) and available climate data. Established experimental techniques, such as twig cutting and common garden experiments, are low-cost methods for studying the mechanisms and drivers of plant phenology, enabling researchers to observe phenological responses under novel environmental conditions. We discuss the strengths, limitations, potential hidden costs (i.e., volunteer and student labor), and promise of each of these methods for addressing emerging questions in plant phenology research. Applied thoughtfully, economically, and creatively, many low-cost approaches offer novel opportunities to fill gaps in our geographic, taxonomic, and mechanistic understanding of plant phenology worldwide.","[McDonough MacKenzie, Caitlin] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, 210 Sawyer, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Gallinat, Amanda S.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Gallinat, Amanda S.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Zipf, Lucy] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA","MacKenzie, CM (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, 210 Sawyer, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",caitlin.mcdonough@maine.edu,,,,,,110,1,1,4,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2168-0450,,,APPL PLANT SCI,Appl.

Co-occurrences between these two recognized genera have been documented from some Pleistocene fossil sites in Thailand, suggesting more widely overlapping distribution in the past than today. However, diet and habitat preferences of these Pleistocene and present-day coexisting species have rarely been investigated so far. For the past three decades, stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses become more commonplace in ecological investigations, allowing us to explore the diets and habitats of ancient and extant animals as well as to reconstruct environmental conditions in the past. We reconstructed diets and habitats of these taxa from five fossil sites in Thailand during the past 400,000 years (from the Middle Pleistocene to the Early Holocene) and from some modern wildlife using the isotopic analysis of carbonate in tooth enamel, in order to test species co-occurrence patterns during the Pleistocene and to examine possible changes of their niche breadths over evolutionary time. Our carbon isotope analysis revealed remarkably different ecological patterns between Naemorhedus and Capricornis. The Pleistocene Sumatran serow has been a greater generalist than both the Himalayan and Chinese gorals that fed on pure C-4 or mixed C-3 and C-4 plants restricted to an open landscape habitat and than its extant population that occupies a closed-canopy forest. This suggests that the habitat contraction of the modern wildlife is likely due to the Holocene climate change and the human impacts on Thai ecosystems. In addition to the loss or reduction of grasslands after the latest Pleistocene when rainforests became dominant and besides the human hunting and predation pressure, the high interspecific competition likely contributed to the extirpation of Himalayan gorals in Thailand. Developing a strategic plan for the future biodiversity conservation, a long-term historical isotope approach allowed us to predict the contrasting habitat suitability, a lowland grassland, for these two threatened goral species as testified by their ecological persistence during the Pleistocene.","[Suraprasit, Kantapon] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Morphol Earth Surface & Adv Geohazards Southeast, Dept Geol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Suraprasit, Kantapon; Bocherens, Herve] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Biogeol, Tubingen, Germany; [Jaeger, Jean-Jacques; Chaimanee, Yaowalak] Univ Poitiers, PALEVOPRIM, UMR CNRS 7262 INEE, Poitiers, France; [Shoocongdej, Rasmi] Silpakorn Univ, Fac Archeol, Dept Archeol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Shoocongdej, Rasmi; Wattanapituksakul, Athiwat] Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Anthropol Ctr, Prehist Populat & Cultural Dynam Highland Pang Ma, Bangkok, Thailand; [Bocherens, Herve] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Res Ctr Human Evolut & Palaeoenvironm, Tubingen, Germany","Suraprasit, K (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Morphol Earth Surface & Adv Geohazards Southeast, Dept Geol, Bangkok, Thailand.; Suraprasit, K (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Biogeol, Tubingen, Germany.",suraprasit@gmail.com,,"Suraprasit, Kantapon/0000-0002-3428-9549","Georg Forster Research Fellowship (Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; MESA RU (Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University); Ratchadaphiseksomphot Endowment Fund, Chulalongkorn UniversityChulalongkorn University; DMR (Bangkok); CNRS-TRF (Caenozoic Biodiversity) Program; Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) [RTA6080001]","For this research, the cost of stable isotope analyses is funded by Georg Forster Research Fellowship (Alexander von Humboldt Foundation).

To date, most studies focused on single-trait analyses, while considering multiple traits is expected to better predict how an individual interacts with its environment. Here, we used a mesocosm experiment with fish Oryzias latipes to test whether individual growth, boldness and functional traits (feeding rate and stoichiometric traits) formed one functional pace-of-life syndrome (POLS). We then tested the effects of among-individual mean and variance of fish functional POLSs within mesocosms on invertebrate community (e.g. zoobenthos and zooplanktonabundances) and ecosystem processes (e.g. ecosystem metabolism, algae stock, nutrient concentrations). Stoichiometric traits correlated with somatic growth and behaviours, forming two independent functional POLS (i.e. two major covariance axes). Mean values of the first syndrome were sex- and environment-dependent and were associated with (i) long-term (10 generations; 4 years) selection for small or large body size resulting in contrasting life histories and (ii) short-term (6 weeks) effects of experimental treatments on resource availability (through manipulation of light intensity and interspecific competition). Specifically, females and individuals from populations selected for a small body size presented fast functional POLS with faster growth rate, higher carbon body content and lower boldness. Individuals exposed to low resources (low light and high competition) displayed a slow functional POLS. Higher mesocosm mean and variance values in the second functional POLS (i.e. high feeding rate, high carbon:nitrogen body ratio, low ammonium excretion rate) were associated to decreased prey abundances, but did not affect any of the ecosystem processes. We highlighted the presence of functional multi-trait covariation in medaka, which were affected by sex, long-term selection history and short-term environmental conditions, that ultimately had cascading ecological consequences. We stressed the need for applying this approach to better predict ecosystem response to anthropogenic global changes.","[Pauli, Beatriz Diaz; Evangelista, Charlotte] Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, Blindernveien 31, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Edeline, Eric] Agocampus Ouest, INRAE, ESE Ecol & Ecosyst Hlth, 65 Rue St Brieuc, F-35042 Rennes, France","Pauli, BD (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biosci, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",Beatriz.Diaz.Pauli@gmail.com,"Evangelista, Charlotte/X-3486-2019; Diaz Pauli, Beatriz/J-9430-2013","Evangelista, Charlotte/0000-0002-9586-0868; Diaz Pauli, Beatriz/0000-0002-9421-7758","Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [251307/F20, 255601/E40]; French government (France) [ANR-10-EQPX-13-01 Planaqua, ANR-11-INBS-0001 AnaEE];  [268218/MO];  [272354]","This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway (projects: 251307/F20, 255601/E40), by its mobility program (projects 268218/MO to B.D.P. and 272354 to C.E.) and by the French government (programs: ANR-10-EQPX-13-01 Planaqua, ANR-11-INBS-0001 AnaEE France).",,66,1,1,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-1434,,,CONSERV PHYSIOL,Conserv.

The articulation between these two categories of mechanisms can be studied through the lens of the intermediate organizational level of functional groups (FGs), defined as clusters of species with similar traits. Indeed, FGs stress ecological differences among species and are thus likely to unravel non-neutral interactions within communities. Here we presented a novel approach to explore how FGs affect species coexistence by comparing species and functional diversity patterns. Our framework considers the Neutral Theory as a mechanistic null hypothesis. It assesses how much the functional diversity deviates from species diversity in communities, and compares this deviation, called the average functional deviation, to a neutral baseline. We showed that the average functional deviation can indicate reduced negative density dependence or environmental filtering among FGs. We validated our framework using simulations illustrating the two situations. We further analyzed tropical tree communities in Western Ghats, India. Our analysis of the average functional deviation revealed environmental filtering between deciduous and evergreen FGs along a broad rainfall gradient. By contrast, we did not find clear evidence for reduced density dependence among FGs. We predict that applying our approach to new case studies where environmental gradients are milder and FGs are more clearly associated to resource partitioning should reveal the missing pattern of reduced density dependence among FGs.","[Laroche, Fabien] INRAE, EFNO, F-45290 Nogent Sur Vernisson, France; [Violle, Cyrille; Taudiere, Adrien] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, CEFE, Univ Montpellier, EPHE,CNRS,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LECA, 2233 Rue Piscine, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Munoz, Francois] CNRS, UMIFRE MAEE 21, Inst Francais Pondichery, 11 Sr Louis St, Pondicherry, India","Laroche, F (corresponding author), INRAE, EFNO, F-45290 Nogent Sur Vernisson, France.",fabien.laroche@inrae.fr,"; Munoz, Francois/C-4239-2015","Laroche, Fabien/0000-0002-6927-2448; Taudiere, Adrien/0000-0003-1088-1182; Munoz, Francois/0000-0001-8776-4705",French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB); European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant Project Ecophysiological and biophysical constraints on domestication of crop plants [ERC-StG-2014-639706-CONSTRAINTS]; French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-18-CE02-0025],"This research is partly supported by the French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB; www.fondationbiodiver site.fr) in the context of the CESAB project Causes and consequences of functional rarity from local to global scales (FREE).

It is well known that ECEs impact community structure and dynamics, but how ECEs alter community assembly remains unclear. The strength of local neighborhood interactions should be altered following ECEs, which could provide a mechanistic basis for how ECEs impact forest community dynamics. In a subtropical forest in China, we monitored the survival of more than 7800 understory seedlings representing 116 tree and shrub species since 2006, and this forest experienced an extreme and unexpected winter storm in February 2008. Here, we quantified changes in the effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition, as well as the effects of environmental variables driving seedling survival before and after the storm. We found that seedling density and Simpson diversity greatly increased after the winter storm. Seedling mortality and recruitment peaked in the second year after the storm, and then returned to pre-storm levels in subsequent census years. Seedling survival was negatively affected by conspecific and heterospecific tree density before the winter storm, while after the storm, survival was affected by conspecific seedling density and nearest taxon functional diversity (NTFd') of tree neighbors, as well as by environmental variables. Moreover, we found a significant difference between abundant and less-abundant species in response to local neighborhood interactions before and after the storm. In short, community dynamics and the effects of local neighborhood on seedling survival were significantly altered following the extreme winter storm. Our study suggests that integrating abiotic and biotic interactions before and after ECEs, and taking functional traits into consideration, contributes to a better understanding of the biological response of forest community dynamics to environmental fluctuations.","[Wang, Yunquan; Zhang, Jintun] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunquan; Mi, Xiangcheng; Ren, Haibao; Liu, Xiaojuan; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunquan; Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Chen, Jianhua] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, 688 Yingbin Rd, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Mingjian] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Conservat Biol Endangered Wildlife, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China","Zhang, JT (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Mi, XC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",yunquanwang@mail.bnu.edu.cn; mcadotte@utsc.utoronto.ca; sky78@zjnu.cn; mixiangcheng@ibcas.ac.cn; renhb@ibcas.ac.cn; liuxiaojuan06@ibcas.ac.cn; fishmj@zju.edu.cn; zhangjt@bnu.edu.cn; kpma@ibcas.ac.cn,"Cadotte, Marc/AAG-8147-2020; Wang, Yunquan/O-6952-2014","Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693; Wang, Yunquan/0000-0001-6022-2340",National Key Research and Development Project of China [2016YFC0500202]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [311774078]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201606040118]; Urban Forest Conservation and Biology chair; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [386151],"This study was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (2016YFC0500202) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (311774078).

In the present study, Bowman-Birk Inhibitor (BBI) was purified from mature seeds of an interspecific advanced hybrid peanut variety (4368-1) using chromatographic techniques. The biochemical and biophysical characteristics such as low molecular mass, presence of several isoinhibitors and higher-ordered dimer/tetramer, predominance of antiparallel beta-sheets and random coils in secondary structure, reactive sites against trypsin and chymotrypsin, broad spectrum of stability toward extreme pH and temperature along with MALDI TOF-TOF analysis (ProteomeXchange identifier PXD016933) ascertained the purified biomolecule from peanut as BBI (PnBBI). Surface plasmon resonance competitive binding analysis revealed the bifunctional PnBBI is a trypsin specific inhibitor with 1:2 stoichiometry as compared to chymotrypsin. A concentration-dependent self-association tendency of PnBBI was further confirmed by 'red shift' in the far-UV CD spectra. Furthermore, the insecticidal potential of PnBBI against Helicoverpa armigera was assessed by in vitro assays and in vivo feeding experiments. A significant reduction in larval body weight was observed with concomitant attenuation in the activity of midgut trypsin-like proteases of H. armigera (HaTPs) fed on PnBBI supplemented diet. The one and two-dimensional zymography studies revealed the disappearance of several isoforms of HaTP upon feeding with PnBBI. qRT-PCR analysis further suggests the role of PnBBI in not only inhibiting the activity of midgut trypsin and chymotrypsin-like proteases but also in modulating their expression. Taken together, the results provide a biochemical and molecular basis for introgressed resistance in peanut interspecific advanced hybrid variety against H. armigera.","[Lokya, Vadthya; Padmasree, Kollipara] Univ Hyderabad, Sch Life Sci, Dept Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Hyderabad, India; [Swathi, Marri] Univ Hyderabad, Sch Life Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Hyderabad, India; [Mallikarjuna, Nalini] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Grain Legumes Program, Legumes Cell Biol, Hyderabad, India","Padmasree, K (corresponding author), Univ Hyderabad, Sch Life Sci, Dept Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Hyderabad, India.",kpssl@uohyd.ac.in,,,"CSIRCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India [38 (1247)/10/EMR-II]; DBTDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) India [BT/PR13261/AGR/05/489/2009/(letter I)]; CSIR-UGC-JRF [18-12/2011 (ii) EU-V]; DST-FIST-I; UGC-SAP-DRS; UPE-Phase I/II; UGC-SAP-CAS; DBT-CREBB, New Delhi, India","This research was supported by grants to KP (PI) and MS (JRF/SRF) from CSIR [No. 38 (1247)/10/EMR-II dt.17/05/2010] and DBT [Ref.

However, how such competition shapes their evolutionary dynamics and depends on intra- and interspecies interactions is poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that Escherichia coli evolution in the mouse gut is more predictable across hosts in the absence of interspecies competition than in the presence of other microbial species. In support, we observed that lrp, a gene encoding a global regulator of amino acid metabolism, was repeatedly selected in germ-free mice 2 weeks after mono-colonization by this bacterium. We established that this specific genetic adaptation increased E. coli's ability to compete for amino acids, and analysis of gut metabolites identified serine and threonine as the metabolites preferentially consumed by E. coli in the mono-colonized mouse gut. Preference for serine consumption was further supported by testing a set of mutants that showed loss of advantage of an lrp mutant impaired in serine metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, the presence of a single additional member of the microbiota, Blautia coccoides, was sufficient to alter the gut metabolome and, consequently, the evolutionary path of E. coli. In this environment, the fitness advantage of the lrpmutant bacteria is lost, and mutations in genes involved in anaerobic respiration were selected instead, recapitulating the eco-evolutionary context frommice with a complex microbiota. Together, these results highlight the metabolic plasticity and evolutionary versatility of E. coli, tailored to the specific ecology it experiences in the gut.","[Barroso-Batista, Joao; Pedro, Miguel F.; Sales-Dias, Joana; Pinto, Catarina J.

Anthropogenic landscape modification and fragmentation result in loss of species and can alter ecosystem function. Assessment of the ecological value of urban reserve networks requires baseline and continued monitoring. However, depending on the desired indicators and parameters, effective monitoring can involve extensive sampling that is often financially or logistically infeasible. Aims. We employed a low-intensity, mixed-detector survey design to monitor the small-mammal community across a network of 53 fragmented forest preserves (225 sites) in a highly urbanised landscape in the Chicago metropolitan area from August to October, 2009-2012. Methods. We used a sequential process to fit single-season occupancy and pairwise co-occurrence models for six common small mammal species to evaluate habitat associations and interspecific interactions. Key results. Shrew species and meadow voles occurred more often in open canopy-associated habitats, whereas occupancy was greater for eastern chipmunks, grey squirrels and white-footed mice in closed-canopy habitats. Habitat associations were complicated by negative pairwise interactions, resulting in reduced occurrence of meadow voles when predatory short-tailed shrews were present and lower occupancy rates of white-footed mouse when chipmunk competitors where present. White-footed mice co-occurred with short-tailed shrews, but detection of white-footed mice was lower when either eastern chipmunks or short-tailed shrews were present, suggesting that densities of these species could be inversely related. Conclusions. We found evidence for both habitat segregation and interspecific interactions among small mammal species, by using low-intensity sampling across the reserve network. Thus, our sampling and analysis approach allowed for adequate assessment of the habitat associations and species interactions within a small-mammal community. Implications. Our findings demonstrated the utility of this monitoring strategy and community as bioindicators for urban-reserve networks. The approach described holds promise for efficient monitoring of reserve networks in fragmented landscapes, critical as human population densities and urbanisation increase, and we discuss how adaptive sampling methods could be incorporated to further benefit conservation efforts.","[Cassel, Kevin W.; Nielsen, Clayton K.] Southern Illinois Univ, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, 251 Life Sci 2,Mail Code 6504, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Cassel, Kevin W.; Nielsen, Clayton K.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Forestry, 251 Life Sci 2,Mail Code 6504, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Morin, Dana J.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Box 9680, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Preuss, Timothy S.; Glowacki, Gary A.] Lake Cty Forest Preserve Dist, 1899 West Winchester Rd, Libertyville, IL 60048 USA; [Cassel, Kevin W.] New Hanover Cty Govt, Dept Pk & Gardens, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Preuss, Timothy S.] Illinois Dept Nat Resources, 28W040 State Route 58, Elgin, IL 60120 USA","Morin, DJ (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Box 9680, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",dana.morin@msstate.edu,,,"Lake County Forest Preserve District; Cooperative Wildlife Research Laboratory; Department of Forestry at Southern Illinois University Carbondale; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project [1020959]","This research was funded by the Lake County Forest Preserve District with additional support from the Cooperative Wildlife Research Laboratory and Department of Forestry at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

The distribution pattern of juveniles and reproductive females was compared to investigate whether habitat partitioning takes place between these species. The sampling occurred monthly, from September/2013 to August/2014, in nine stations of three transects (5 m, 15 m, and 30 m deep) using a shrimp fishing boat. In total, 1076 F. subtilis and 499 L. schmitti individuals were captured. The sex ratio of F. subtilis was skewed toward females, while L schmitti had a 1:1 sex ratio. Females of both species were larger than the males. The size at the onset of sexual maturity of F. subtilis females was large than that of males, while the opposite occurred in L schmitti. The estimated growth parameters of F. subtilis males were: CL infinity = 33.24 mm, k = 2.30/year and longevity = 2.0 years. For the females, they were: CL infinity = 42.49 mm, k = 2.15/year and longevity = 2.12 years. The growth parameters of L schmitti males were: CL infinity = 32.48 mm, k = 2.41/year and longevity = 1.91 years. For the females, they were: CL infinity = 38.78 mm, k = 2.01/year and longevity = 2.29 years. The distribution patterns of juveniles and reproductive females differed between species. F. subtilis females predominated in deeper waters. Juveniles of L. schmitti were aggregated in shallow waters (5 m), while F. subtilis aggregated at 15 m. Considering that (1) the relationship between the environmental factors and the abundance of juveniles and females was not evident, and (2) the reproductive and recruitment periods of these species are synchronized, our results suggest that habitat partitioning takes place to decrease the interspecific competition.

This study aimed at analyzing existing data on cultivated pulse species in the literature to provide a broad and structured description of pulses' interspecific functional diversity. We used a functional trait-based approach to evaluate how pulse diversity could support food production in agroecosystems constrained by low water and nutrient availability and exposed to high weed pressure. We gathered data for 17 functional traits and six agroecosystem properties for 43 pulse species. Our analytical framework highlights the correlations and combinations of functional traits that best predict values of six agroecosystem properties defined as ecosystem services estimates. We show that pulse diversity has been structured both by breeding and by an environmental gradient. The covariance space corresponding to agroecosystem properties was structured by three properties: producers, competitors, stress-tolerant species. The distribution of crop species in this functional space reflected ecological adaptive strategies described in wild species, where the size-related axis of variation is separated from variation of leaf morpho-physiological traits. Six agroecosystem properties were predicted by different combinations of traits. However, we identified ubiquitous plant traits such as leaflet length, days to maturity, seed weight, and leaf nitrogen content, that discriminated agroecosystem properties and allowed us to gather individual species into three clusters, representative of the three strategies highlighted earlier.

Aims: Differences among similar, closely related species which co-occur are still highly debated. In such a scenario, species should diverge morphologically to reduce competition. We studied this phenomenon, in three closely related woodpecker species that co-occur in eastern Slovakia: Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopus major, Syrian Woodpecker Dendrocopus major and White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos. The Great Spotted Woodpecker has the widest niche and lives sympatrically with both Syrian and White-backed Woodpeckers, while the distributions of the latter two species do not overlap because of their use of different habitats. We predicted that Great Spotted Woodpeckers should differ morphologically from both sympatric species: Syrian and White-backed Woodpeckers. Methods: Comparisons were made between species, based on dorsal and lateral views of maxilla using both geometric morphometric techniques and traditional measurements. Results: We confirmed our hypothesis, and found significant differences in bill shape between Great Spotted Woodpecker and both congeners. This is in contrast to the observed higher similarity of Great Spotted Woodpecker and Syrian Woodpecker in traditional body measurements. However, surprisingly, Syrian Woodpecker and White-backed Woodpecker do not differ significantly in bill shape. Conclusions: This work indicates that geometric morphometry appears to be a promising tool for the investigation of how interspecific competition influences the shape of the bill between co-occurring species.","[Myczko, Lukasz; Kubicka, Anna Maria; Sparks, Tim H.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Poznan, Poland; [Mizerova, Zuzana; Hromada, Martin] Univ Presov, Fac Humanities & Nat Sci, Dept Ecol, Lab & Museum Evolutionary Ecol, 17 Novembra 1, Presov 08116, Slovakia; [Hromada, Martin] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Biol Sci, Prof Z Szafrana 1, PL-65516 Zielona Gora, Poland","Hromada, M (corresponding author), Univ Presov, Fac Humanities & Nat Sci, Dept Ecol, Lab & Museum Evolutionary Ecol, 17 Novembra 1, Presov 08116, Slovakia.; Hromada, M (corresponding author), Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Biol Sci, Prof Z Szafrana 1, PL-65516 Zielona Gora, Poland.",hromada.martin@gmail.com,"Kubicka, Anna Maria/AAA-3093-2021; Hromada, Martin/I-7409-2019","Hromada, Martin/0000-0002-5626-1205; Kubicka-Kaczmarska, Anna/0000-0002-7844-9225; Sparks, Tim/0000-0003-4382-7051; Myczko, Lukasz/0000-0002-9305-2306", [OPV ITMS: 26110230119],MH and ZO were supported by grant OPV ITMS: 26110230119.,,75,1,1,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3657,1944-6705,,BIRD STUDY,Bird Stud.,JAN 2,2020,67,1,,,,,8,18,,10.1080/00063657.2020.1726873,,FEB 2020,11,Ornithology,Zoology,MR6FR,WOS:000518520800001,,,,,2021-09-21,

Generalists solve this problem by consuming a variety of food types, and alter their diets with relative ease. Specialists eat few food types, and may starve if those food types are not available. We integrated stable isotope analyses with previously-published stomach contents and environmental data to investigate how the foraging ecologies of three sympatric freshwater turtle species vary across four wetlands that differ in turbidity and primary producer abundance. Results We found that the generalist Emydura macquarii consumes a varied diet (but mostly filamentous green algae) when primary producers are available and water is clear, but switches to a more carnivorous diet when the water is turbid and primary producers are scarce, following the predictions of optimal foraging theory. In contrast, two more-specialized carnivorous species, Chelodina expansa and Chelodina longicollis, do not differ in diet across wetlands, and interspecific competition may increase where E. macquarii is carnivorous. When forced to be more carnivorous, E. macquarii exhibits higher rates of empty stomachs, and female turtles have reduced body condition, but neither Chelodina species are affected. Conclusions Our results provide support for optimal foraging theory, but also show that the ability to change diet does not protect the generalist from experiencing lower foraging success when its preferred food is rare, with direct consequences for their energy budgets. Our results have conservation implications because wetlands in the Murray-Darling river system are increasingly turbid and have low macrophyte abundance, and all three species are declining.","[Petrov, Kristen; Spencer, Ricky-John; Malkiewicz, Natasha; Lewis, Jessica; Van Dyke, James U.] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci, Hawkesbury Inst, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Keitel, Claudia] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, 380 Werombi Rd, Brownlow Hill, NSW 2570, Australia; [Van Dyke, James U.] La Trobe Univ, Sch Mol Sci, Albury Wodonga Campus,POB 821, Wodonga, Vic 3689, Australia","Petrov, K (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci, Hawkesbury Inst, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",17203180@student.westernsydney.edu.au,,"Keitel, Claudia/0000-0003-3101-7529; Spencer, Ricky/0000-0001-8112-4221",ARC Linkage grantAustralian Research Council [LP140100011],This work was supported by ARC Linkage grant (LP140100011).,,49,3,3,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6785,,BMC ECOL,BMC Ecol.,FEB 18,2020,20,1,,,,,,,11,10.1186/s12898-020-00279-6,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KQ9YB,WOS:000517276600001,32070322,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Given the sexual function of such traits, studies generally focus on individual interactions (i.e., displays and contests) in explaining trait origin and persistence. We show that ecological factors can strongly influence the adaptive value of these traits, and changes to these factors can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We compared sexually selected traits in the small Indian mongoose (Urva auropunctata) between their sparsely populated native range and four tropical islands to which they were introduced within the last 150 years and where, due to a lack of interspecific competition and predation, they have become invasive and densely populated. Because of a likely increase in encounter rate, we predicted that selection on long-distance chemical advertisement by males would relax in the introduced range. Accordingly, male, but not female, anal pads (used in scent marking) decreased in size in relation to both time since introduction and population density, and their relationship to body size and condition weakened. Concurrently, as predicted by intensified sperm competition, testis size increased following introduction. The small Indian mongoose thus experienced an inversion in the relative contributions to fitness of two sexual traits, followed by their rapid evolution in line with ecological changes.","[Owen, M.

NOV.; BACTERIA; SEQUENCE; METHANE; RNA; GROWTH; LIPIDS; ACID,"Methanogenesis, a biological process mediated by complex microbial communities, has attracted great attention due to its contribution to global warming and potential in biotechnological applications. The current study unveiled the core microbial methanogenic metabolisms in anaerobic vessel ecosystems by applying combined genome-centric metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Here, we demonstrate that an enriched natural system, fueled only with acetate, could support a bacteria-dominated microbiota employing a multi-trophic methanogenic process. Moreover, significant changes, in terms of microbial structure and function, were recorded after the system was supplemented with additional H-2. Methanosarcina thermophila, the predominant methanogen prior to H-2 addition, simultaneously performed acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic, and methylotrophic methanogenesis. The methanogenic pattern changed after the addition of H-2, which immediately stimulated Methanomicrobia-activity and was followed by a slow enrichment of Methanobacteria members. Interestingly, the essential genes involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway were not expressed in bacterial members. The high expression of a glycine cleavage system indicated the activation of alternative metabolic pathways for acetate metabolism, which were reconstructed in the most abundant bacterial genomes. Moreover, as evidenced by predicted auxotrophies, we propose that specific microbes of the community were forming symbiotic relationships, thus reducing the biosynthetic burden of individual members. These results provide new information that will facilitate future microbial ecology studies of interspecies competition and symbiosis in methanogenic niches.","[Zhu, Xinyu; Treu, Laura; Kougias, Panagiotis G.; Angelidaki, Irini] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Bldg 115, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Zhu, Xinyu; Seshadri, Rekha; Ivanova, Natalia; Kyrpides, Nikos] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA USA; [Campanaro, Stefano; Treu, Laura] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Via U Bassi 58-B, I-35121 Padua, Italy; [Campanaro, Stefano] Univ Padua, CRIBI Biotechnol Ctr, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Kougias, Panagiotis G.] Hellen Org DEMETER, Soil & Water Resources Inst, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece","Treu, L; Kougias, PG (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Bldg 115, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",latr@env.dtu.dk; panak@env.dtu.dk,"Campanaro, Stefano/I-5657-2019; Kyrpides, Nikos C./A-6305-2014; Angelidaki, Irini/AAX-2562-2020; Zhu, Xinyu/C-1479-2017; Kougias, Panagiotis/T-7133-2017","Kyrpides, Nikos C./0000-0002-6131-0462; Angelidaki, Irini/0000-0002-6357-578X; Kougias, Panagiotis/0000-0003-4416-2135; CAMPANARO, STEFANO/0000-0002-9431-1648",Innovation Fund under the project SYMBIO-Integration of biomass and wind power for biogas enhancement and upgrading via hydrogen assisted anaerobic digestion [12132654],"This work was supported by the Innovation Fund under the project SYMBIO-Integration of biomass and wind power for biogas enhancement and upgrading via hydrogen assisted anaerobic digestion, contract 12132654.",,61,21,21,13,41,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2049-2618,,,MICROBIOME,Microbiome,FEB 15,2020,8,1,,,,,,,22,10.1186/s40168-019-0780-9,,,14,Microbiology,Microbiology,KX8QV,WOS:000522140300002,32061251,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

For example, elimination of buffalo from the Serengeti National Park is suggested to have driven increased abundance of smaller antelope as a result of release from competition. The perceived low abundance of small antelope in the contractual Postberg section of the West Coast National Park (the park) has been an ongoing management concern which has been anecdotally attributed to predation by a mesopredator (the caracal, Caracal caracal). However, we hypothesized that the historical overstocking, and consequent overgrazing by larger-bodied managed ungulates would influence small antelope abundance. Using camera traps, we investigated species co-occurrence and temporal activity between small antelope, managed ungulates and caracals in Postberg as well as another part of the park (Langebaan) and a farm outside of the park. Results suggest that small antelope and managed ungulates have a high degree of temporal overlap (Delta = 0.74, 0.79 and 0.86 for the farm, Langebaan and Postberg respectively), while temporal partitioning between small antelope and caracal is apparent (Delta = 0.59). Further, small antelope and managed ungulates appear to occur independently of one another (SIF = 0.91-1 across areas). Managed ungulates were detected almost three times more frequently on fallow lands when compared to the more vegetated sites within the park suggesting that segregated food/cover resources allow for independent occurrence. Small antelope had a much higher probability of occurrence outside of the protected area (e.g., psi = 0.192 and 0.486 for steenbok at Postberg, Langebaan compared to 0.841 on the farm), likely due to less variable (more intact) habitat outside of the protected area. There is not sufficient evidence to currently warrant management intervention for predators. The small size of the protected area provides limited scope for spatial replication thus reducing possibilities to infer the cause and effect for complex interactions (which would historically have taken place over much larger areas) with negative implications for adaptive management. We recommend continued monitoring over multiple seasons and a wider area to determine the spatial information requirements to inform management of small protected areas.","[Winterton, Deborah Jean; van Wilgen, Nicola J.] Cape Res Ctr, SANPk Sci Serv, Cape Town, South Africa; [Winterton, Deborah Jean; Venter, Jan A.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management, George, South Africa; [van Wilgen, Nicola J.] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Venter, Jan A.] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Eugene Marais Chair Wildlife Management, Pretoria, South Africa","Winterton, DJ (corresponding author), Cape Res Ctr, SANPk Sci Serv, Cape Town, South Africa.; Winterton, DJ (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sch Nat Resource Management, George, South Africa.",deborah.winterton@gmail.com,"van Wilgen, Nicola/D-7262-2012","van Wilgen, Nicola/0000-0001-8110-698X",South African National Parks,"This work was supported by South African National Parks.

Information on the current population size and structure of M. georgesi, and the body condition and growth of the surviving individuals, is needed to support planning of conservation actions. Population estimates are also needed for a sympatric population of the widely distributed Macquarie turtle (Emydura macquarii), which has probably been introduced to the Bellinger River and may threaten the persistence of M. georgesi through hybridization, competition, and disease transmission. Data from five turtle surveys between November 2015 and November 2018 were used to estimate populations of the two species in the Bellinger River by an analysis based on habitat extent and turtle detectability. Changes in the body condition of M. georgesi and the body growth of both species were also assessed. Current populations of similar to 150 M. georgesi and similar to 500 E. macquarii are indicated, although the uncertainty of these estimates is high. The estimate for M. georgesi represents a decline of >90% from the historical population. Moreover, about 88% of the surviving M. georgesi are immature, and only about 5% are mature females. However, the body condition of the survivors has improved recently. Growth models suggest that M. georgesi matures later than E. macquarii, which may provide the latter with a competitive advantage. Evidence presented here does not support a previous hypothesis that M. georgesi were predisposed to disease through malnutrition and consequently reduced immune competence caused by high water temperatures and low river flows. Continuing disease, hybridization, and interspecific competition are probably the greatest threats to the persistence of the species.","[Chessman, Bruce C.] UNSW Sydney, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [McGilvray, Gerry; Ruming, Shane] Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Jones, Hugh A.] Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Petrov, Kristen; Spencer, Ricky-John] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Fielder, Darren P.] Redleaf Environm, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Georges, Arthur] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Chessman, BC (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",brucechessman@gmail.com,"Georges, Arthur/D-2153-2009","Georges, Arthur/0000-0003-2428-0361",,,,69,0,0,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

In this study, the structure of assemblages of Squamata was evaluated based on their species richness and two measures of phylogenetic diversity (variability and clustering). I evaluated the composition of the assemblages comparing distinct biogeographic subregions within the Mediterranean: Adriatic, Aegean, Balearic, Corsica-Sardinia, Crete, Gulf of Gabes, Ionian Sea, Ligurian Sea, Malta, Sicily, and Tyrrhenian Sea. The effect of island environments and geographical isolation on the diversity metrics was assessed using generalized linear models. The analyses indicated that species richness was mostly influenced by island area and geographical isolation. Assemblages on smaller islands were poorer in species and phylogenetically dispersed, possibly as an effect of interspecific competition. The species composition of the assemblages was determined by similar environmental drivers within the biogeographic subregions, including island area, island elevation, geographical isolation, and aridity. In several subregions, significant patterns of phylogenetic attraction were found in species co-occurrences, caused by the limits imposed by the island size on large predatory species.","[Escoriza, Daniel] Univ Girona, Inst Aquat Ecol, GRECO, Campus Montillivi, Girona 17071, Spain","Escoriza, D (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Inst Aquat Ecol, GRECO, Campus Montillivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",daniel_escoriza@hotmail.com,"Escoriza, Daniel/AAP-9813-2021","Escoriza, Daniel/0000-0002-6853-0134",,,,87,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The role of species interactions in shaping macroevolutionary trajectories has been studied for centuries and remains a cutting-edge topic of current research. However, despite its deep historical roots, classic and current approaches to this topic are highly diverse. Here, we combine historical and contemporary perspectives on the study of ecological interactions in macroevolution, synthesizing ideas across eras to build a zoomed-out picture of the big questions at the nexus of ecology and macroevolution. We discuss the trajectory of this important and challenging field, dividing research into work done before the 1970s, research between 1970 and 2005, and work done since 2005. We argue that in response to long-standing questions in paleobiology, evidence accumulated to date has demonstrated that biotic interactions (including mutualism) can influence lineage diversification and trait evolution over macroevolutionary timescales, and we outline major open questions for future research in the field.","[Hembry, David H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hembry, David H.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Weber, Marjorie G.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Weber, Marjorie G.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Hembry, DH (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.; Hembry, DH (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",hembry@email.arizona.edu; weberm11@msu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1831164],"We would like to thank the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics for the opportunity to write this article, as well as Judie Bronstein for invaluable feedback throughout the review process.

However, few studies have compared the behaviour of such squirrels in human activity areas with that in their natural forest areas in the tropics. This study describes the activity pattern and resource use of Callosciurus finlaysonii and C. caniceps in a small residential area located in the dry evergreen and dry dipterocarp forests in Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, Thailand, by using route census survey. Both species were active in the morning and evening, just as they are in the forests, but the frequency of detection of C. finlaysonii was higher than that of C. caniceps. Intraspecific interactions were frequently observed in C. finlaysonii; however, interspecific interactions were not observed. Callosciurus finlaysonii used buildings and electric wires located above ground in open areas as pathways, whereas C. caniceps was not observed in open areas. Callosciurus, finlaysonii consumed a greater diversity of food items than C. caniceps, including fruits, leaves, flowers, and seeds, whereas C. caniceps fed mainly on fruits/seeds. The present study showed that C. fitlaysonii can use human activity areas. Callosciurus finlaysonii probably use the human activity area owing to the presence of fewer natural predators, its ability to survive in different type of environments, as well as its wide feeding habits, and the presence of fewer competitors. However, it was observed that C. caniceps scarcely used human modified areas.","[Kobayashi, Shun; Izawa, Masako] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 903023, Japan; [Placksanoi, Jumlong; Taksin, Artchawakom; Waengsothorn, Surachit] Thailand Inst Sci & Technol Res, Sakaerat Environm Res Stn, 1 Moo 9 Udom, Nakhon Ratchasima 30370, Thailand; [Aryuthaka, Chittima] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Fishery, 50 Ngam Wong Wan Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Panha, Somsak] Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Biol, 254 Payathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Panha, Somsak] Ctr Excellence Biodivers, Minist Educ, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Panha, Somsak] Chulalongkorn Univ, Bangkok 10400, Thailand","Kobayashi, S (corresponding author), Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 903023, Japan.",kobashun@sci.u-ryukyu.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Shun/O-7436-2018","Kobayashi, Shun/0000-0003-3167-3358","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H05771]; Centre of Excellence on Biodiversity, Thailand [BDC-PG2-159009]","We are grateful to Naoki Kato (Kyoto University) and staff at Sakaerat Environmental Research Station for supporting this study.

Conservation efforts rely on predictive modelling using abiotic variables and assessments of genetic diversity to determine target species and populations for controlled breeding, germplasm conservation and assisted migration. Biotic factors such as interspecific competition and hybridization, however, are largely ignored, despite their prevalence across diverse taxa and their role as key evolutionary forces. Hybridization between species with well-developed barriers to reproductive isolation often results in the production of offspring with lower fitness. Generation of novel allelic combinations through hybridization, however, can also generate positive fitness consequences. Despite this possibility, hybridization-mediated introgression is often considered a threat to biodiversity as it can blur species boundaries. The contribution of hybridization towards increasing genetic diversity of populations at range margins has only recently gathered attention in conservation studies. We assessed the extent to which hybridization contributes towards range dynamics by tracking spatio-temporal changes in the central location of a hybrid zone between two recently diverged species of pines: Pinus strobiformis and P. flexilis. By comparing geographic cline centre estimates for global admixture coefficient with morphological traits associated with reproductive output, we demonstrate a northward shift in the hybrid zone. Using a combination of spatially explicit, individual-based simulations and linkage disequilibrium variance partitioning, we note a significant contribution of adaptive introgression towards this northward movement, despite the potential for differences in regional population size to aid hybrid zone movement. Overall, our study demonstrates that hybridization between recently diverged species can increase genetic diversity and generate novel allelic combinations. These novel combinations may allow range margin populations to track favourable climatic conditions or facilitate adaptive evolution to ongoing and future climate change.","[Menon, Mitra] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Integrat Life Sci, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Landguth, Erin] Univ Montana, Sch Publ & Community Hlth Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Leal-Saenz, Alejandro] Univ Juarez Estado Durango, Programs Inst, Doctorado Ciencias Agr & Forestales, Durango, Mexico; [Bagley, Justin C.; Eckert, Andrew J.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Rm 126,1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Schoettle, Anna W.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Wehenkel, Christian] Univ Juarez Estado Durango, Inst Silvicultura & Ind Madera, Durango, Mexico; [Flores-Renteria, Lluvia] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Cushman, Samuel A.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Waring, Kristen M.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Menon, M (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Integrat Life Sci, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.; Eckert, AJ (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Rm 126,1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",menonm2@mymail.vcu.edu; aeckert2@vcu.edu,"Landguth, Erin/ABB-8941-2020; Bagley, Justin C./N-9654-2019; Waring, Kristen/A-2506-2014","Bagley, Justin C./0000-0001-6737-8380; Waring, Kristen/0000-0001-9935-9432",,,,91,10,10,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1752-4571,,,EVOL APPL,Evol.

In order to address this shortcoming, we developed a customizable agar-based medium modified from an established plant cell-culture medium to nourish detached leaves laid atop it while also preventing arthropods from escaping the experimental arena. The artificial culture medium was tested with two herbivorous mite species: the wheat curl mite (Aceria tosichella; Eriophyidae) and two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae; Tetranychidae). The proposed approach was a major improvement over a standard protocol for prolonged studies of individual eriophyid mites and also provided some benefits for experiments with spider mites. Moreover, the described method can be easily modified according to the requirements of host plant species and applied to a wide range of microherbivore species. Such applications include investigations of life-history traits and other ecological and evolutionary questions, e.g. mating or competitive behaviours or interspecific interactions, assessing invasiveness potential and predicting possible outbreaks.

However, little is known about the combined effects of dispersal and climate change on biodiversity. Theory predicts that alpha-diversity is maximized at intermediate dispersal rates, resulting in a hump-shaped diversity-dispersal relationship. This relationship is predicted to flatten when competition increases. We anticipate that this same flattening will occur with increased temperature because, in the rising part of the temperature performance curve, interspecific competition is predicted to increase. We explored this question using aquatic communities of Sarracenia purpurea from early- and late-successional stages, in which we simulated four levels of dispersal and four temperature scenarios. With increased dispersal, the hump shape was observed consistently in late successional communities, but only in higher temperature treatments in early succession. Increased temperature did not flatten the hump-shape relationship, but decreased the level of alpha- and gamma-diversity. Interestingly, higher temperatures negatively impacted small-bodied species. These metacommunity-level extinctions likely relaxed interspecific competition, which could explain the absence of flattening of the diversity-dispersal relationship. Our findings suggest that climate change will cause extinctions both at local- and global- scales and emphasize the importance of intermediate levels of dispersal as an insurance for local diversity.","[Parain, Elodie C.; Gray, Sarah M.; Bersier, Louis-Felix] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol Ecol & Evolut, Chemin Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Parain, Elodie C.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 165 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Bersier, LF (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol Ecol & Evolut, Chemin Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",louis-felix.bersier@unifr.ch,"Bersier, Louis-Felix/G-8018-2011","Bersier, Louis-Felix/0000-0001-9552-8032; Gray, Sarah/0000-0002-4025-6487",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [31003A_138489],We would like to thank Rudolf Rohr for his help with the analyses.

Recent studies have shown that species mixing may buffer the temporal variability of productivity. However, most studies have focused on temporal stability of productivity, while species mixing may also affect forest resilience to extreme events. Our understanding of mechanisms underlying species mixing effects on forest stability and resilience remains limited because we ignore how changes from intraspecific to interspecific interactions in the neighbourhood of a given tree might affect its stability and resilience to extreme drought (i.e. response during and after this drought). This is crucial to better understand forests' response to climate change and how diversity may help maintain forest functioning. Here we analysed how local intra- or interspecific interactions may affect the temporal stability and resilience to drought of individual trees in French mountain forests, using basal area increment data over the previous 20 years for Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba and Quercus pubescens. We analysed the effect of interspecific competition on (a) the temporal stability and (b) the resilience to drought (resistance and recovery) of individual tree radial growth. We found no significant interspecific competition effect on temporal stability, but species-specific effects on tree growth resilience to drought. There was a positive effect of heterospecific proportion on the drought resilience of Q. pubescens, a negative effect for A. alba and no effect for F. sylvatica. These differences may be related to interspecific differences in water use or rooting depth. Synthesis: In this study, we showed that stand composition influences individual tree growth resilience to drought, but this effect varied depending on the species and its physiological responses. Our study also highlighted that a lack of biodiversity effect on long-term stability might hide important effects on short-term resilience to extreme climatic events. This may have important implications in the face of climate change.","[Jourdan, Marion; Morin, Xavier] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CEFE,CNRS,UMR 5175,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Jourdan, Marion] ADEME, Angers 01, France; [Kunstler, Georges] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, LESSEM, Grenoble, France","Jourdan, M (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CEFE,CNRS,UMR 5175,IRD, Montpellier, France.; Jourdan, M (corresponding author), ADEME, Angers 01, France.",marion.jourdan@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Kunstler, Georges/F-9179-2012","Kunstler, Georges/0000-0002-2544-1940",Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); French Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie; DISTIMACC [ECOFOR-2014-23]; BioProFor [11-PDOC-030-01],"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; DISTIMACC, Grant/Award Number: ECOFOR-2014-23; BioProFor, Grant/Award Number: 11-PDOC-030-01; French Agence De l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie",,74,11,11,11,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

In particular, the influence of small takes on fish assemblages is poorly understood. Field surveys and stable-isotope analyses were used to evaluate the impact of differing levels of flow abstraction on fish assemblage structure, and native-non-native patterns of coexistence, associated with small surface water abstractions in four streams in New Zealand. Study design accounted for longitudinal processes (spatial autocorrelation) to isolate the effects of abstractions on fish assemblages. Reaches with reduced flows downstream of abstraction points had significantly lower fish abundances per metre of stream length, probably because of decreased habitat size, altered interspecific interactions and barriers to movement. The loss of larger fish in reaches with high abstraction resulted in shallower mass-abundance slopes and shorter stable isotope-derived food-chain lengths, likely to have been caused by fewer trophic links in the food web. The large fish absent from these reaches were flow-sensitive introduced salmonids, resulting in higher relative abundances of small-bodied native fish, probably as a result of predatory and competitive release. Quantification of metrics designed to characterize ecosystem functioning as well as abundance and species composition indicated that small water abstractions can alter both the structure and composition of stream fish assemblages and modify the outcomes of native-non-native species interactions. Thus, a better understanding of the effects of small abstractions could be used to improve the strategic management of fish in invaded riverscapes.","[Boddy, Nixie C.; Fraley, Kevin M.; Warburton, Helen J.; Kelly, Dave; McIntosh, Angus R.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Jellyman, Phillip G.; Booker, Doug J.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand","Fraley, KM (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",kvnfraley@gmail.com,"Fraley, Kevin/J-5107-2019; McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011","Fraley, Kevin/0000-0001-5068-5616; McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813; Jellyman, Phil/0000-0002-5239-8239",NIWA Sustainable Water Allocation Programme; UC,"We thank Dr Richard White and other members of the University of Canterbury (UC) Freshwater Ecology Research Group for field assistance and advice during this project, and Gawler Downs Station for allowing access to sampling sites.

In this study, we analyzed interspecific and ontogenetic variation in dietary composition and trophic niche width in an anuran community from a semi-arid environment. We found a more profound effect of species identity than body size on dietary composition, with the diet of four species dominated by formicids, that of two others by coleopterans and formicids, and that of the remaining species not dominated by specific prey types. We found ontogenetic changes in dietary composition in three of four species analyzed, in which consumption of some small insects decreased as predator size increased, regardless of species. Additionally, we did not find ontogenetic change in prey number consumed in any of the four species, but prey size increased with increasing predator size in all of them. Most species exhibited a narrow trophic niche, which was even narrower in adults in three of the four species analyzed. Costello's modified plots revealed a high variation among individuals in termite consumption in Anaxyrus punctatus, and in more prey types in Spea multiplicata. Our results suggest that this community is not size-structured, and that ontogenetic diet shifts are mainly caused by passive sampling toward prey of different sizes. Finally, comparisons with previous data revealed an interpopulation pattern, in which trophic niche width contracts as aridity increases, possibly because of an increase in interspecific competition for trophic resources.","[Luria-Manzano, Ricardo; Ramirez-Bautista, Aurelio] Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Lab Ecol Poblac, Ctr Invest Biol, Inst Ciencias Basicas & Ingn, Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico","Ramirez-Bautista, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Lab Ecol Poblac, Ctr Invest Biol, Inst Ciencias Basicas & Ingn, Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico.",ramibautistaa@gmail.com,,"Luria Manzano, Ricardo/0000-0002-1539-479X","project CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [27618-N]; Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente (PRODEP) at Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Hidalgo; project CONABIO [R045, W013, JM001]; project SEP-PROMEP [1103.5/03/1130]; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [367157]","This work was supported by the projects CONACyT No. 27618-N, CONABIO R045, CONABIO W013, CONABIO JM001 and SEP-PROMEP 1103.5/03/1130.

In 2011 and 2013, experiments were conducted at Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines, to compare arthropod communities in rice plots and on levees with and without vegetation strips. Vegetation strips included spontaneous weeds, sesame and okra (2011), or mung bean (2013). The plots were treated with one of three nitrogen levels and in one experiment were planted with planthopper-resistant (IR62) and susceptible (IR64) rice varieties. Parasitoids and predators of lepidopteran pests and of the ricebug, Leptocorisa oratorius, were more abundant in high-nitrogen rice plots where their prey/hosts also had highest densities. Planthoppers and leafhoppers were more abundant in low-nitrogen plots. Weedy and sesame/okra bunds provided habitat for a range of natural enemies including spiders, parasitoids and predatory bugs, but did not have higher pest numbers than cleared bunds. Higher abundances of the predator Cythorhinuslividipennis and higher parasitism of planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) eggs by Anagrus sp. were associated with sesame/okra bunds in late season rice plots. Mung bean also provided habitat for key predators and parasitoids that spilled over to adjacent rice; however, mung bean was also associated with higher numbers of lepidopteran and grain-sucking pests in the adjacent rice, albeit without increased damage to the rice. For ricebug in particular, damage was probably reduced by higher parasitoid:pest ratios adjacent to the vegetation strips. Varietal resistance and mung bean strips had an additive effect in reducing abundance of the planthopper Sogatella furcifera and the leafhopper Nephotettix virescens. Reduced numbers of these latter pests close to vegetation strips were often compensated for by other plant-sucking bugs, thereby increasing the intensity of potentially stabilizing interspecific interactions such as competition. We highlight the benefits of diversifying rice landscapes and the need to optimize vegetation strips, e.g., by including lepidopteran trap-plants, for intensive rice production systems.","[Horgan, Finbarr G.; Crisol Martinez, Eduardo] EcoLaVerna Integral Restorat Ecol, Kildinan T56CD39, Cork, Ireland; [Crisol Martinez, Eduardo] COEXPHAL Assoc Vegetable & Fruit Growers Almeria, C Esteban Murillo 3, La Mojonera 04746, Almeria, Spain; [Stuart, Alexander M.; Bernal, Carmencita C.; de Cima Martin, Elena; Almazan, Maria Liberty P.] Int Rice Res Inst, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Fame Ramal, Angelee] Univ Philippines, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Los Banos 4030, Laguna, Philippines","Horgan, FG (corresponding author), EcoLaVerna Integral Restorat Ecol, Kildinan T56CD39, Cork, Ireland.",f.horgan@ecolaverna.org; eduardocrisol@googlemail.com; a.stuart@irri.org; c.bernal@irri.org; eledecima@gmail.com; m.l.almazan@irri.org; angelee.ramal@gmail.com,,"Horgan, Finbarr/0000-0003-3796-667X",Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP),This research was funded by the Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP) under the directorship of Achim Dobermann for research into optimizing ecosystem services in rice production landscapes.,,80,8,8,3,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,328,10.3390/insects10100328,,,28,Entomology,Entomology,JS8TI,WOS:000500573900022,31581452,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Diet analyses were based on gull chick stomach content samples and direct observations of food delivered to tern chicks in 2013 and 2014, complemented in 2014 with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of chick whole-blood samples. Main prey species of Kelp Gull chicks were Cynoscion guatucupa (Cuvier, 1830), a demersal species obtained from recreational fishery waste, Argentine anchovies (Engraulis anchoita Hubbs and Marini, 1935), and insects. Engraulis anchoita and Odontesthes spp. were the main prey of both tern species. Trophic niche and isotopic niche overlap between the Kelp Gull and Royal and Cayenne terns was low. Kelp Gull kleptoparasitism on Royal and Cayenne terns was <= 2.5% and <0.6%, respectively. The use of anthropogenic food subsidies by Kelp Gulls may be mediating the trophic relationships among species, favouring their use of predictable and abundant fishery waste over a more unpredictable pelagic schooling fish such as E. anchoita.","[Marinao, Cristian; Suarez, Nicolas; Yorio, Pablo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos, Blvd Brown 2915,U9120ACV, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Yorio, Pablo] Wildlife Conservat Soc Argentina, Amenabar 1595,Piso 2,Off 19,C1426AKC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Marinao, C (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos, Blvd Brown 2915,U9120ACV, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",marinao@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar,,,Wildlife Conservation Society; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y TecnicasConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [112 01 01061],"This study was funded by the Wildlife Conservation Society and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (project PIP No. 112 01 01061).

The interrelations among hydrology, soils, geomorphic landforms, and tree species composition are the foundation of forest management in bottomland hardwoods, and historically their correspondence has allowed for somewhat predictable forest responses based upon the hydrogeomorphic setting. However, extensive hydrologic and geomorphic modifications in floodplains have disrupted these interrelations and, on many sites, have created novel disturbance regimes resulting in unpredictable forest responses. Reduced or altered timing of surface flooding and groundwater declines are common in the region and have favored increases in stem densities, particularly of species less tolerant of flooding and more tolerant of shade. In these highly modified systems, more process-level understanding of floodplain hydrology, soil moisture dynamics, interspecific tree competition, and regeneration is needed to develop more effective management prescriptions and for forestry to be represented in integrated water-resource management decisions.","[King, Sammy L.] Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Louisiana Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, AgCtr,Sch Renewable Nat Resources 124, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Keim, Richard F.] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","King, SL (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Louisiana Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, AgCtr,Sch Renewable Nat Resources 124, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",sking16@lsu.edu; rkeim@lsu.edu,"Keim, Richard/AAI-6514-2020","Keim, Richard/0000-0003-4488-9537",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [LAB94181]; Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries; Texas Parks and Wildlife,"We thank K.

We used a meta-analytical approach to synthesize density responses to in-stream habitat restoration by young-of-the year (YOY) brown trout and Atlantic salmon in 28 rivers (overall 32 restoration projects) in Finland. We also examined which local and watershed-scale factors most influenced restoration success. Finally, we conducted an expert survey to obtain an independent estimate of a sufficient density enhancement for restoration to be considered successful. Despite strong context-dependency, habitat restoration had an overall positive effect on YOY salmonid density. When compared to target levels derived from the expert survey, density responses mainly reached the minimum expected success rate, but remained short of the level considered to reflect distinct success. Variability in restoration responses of trout was linked mainly to river size, predominant geology, water quality and potential interspecific competition (trout vs. European bullhead). Fishing mortality tended to obscure positive effects of restoration and stocking by YOY fish affected negatively trout's response to restoration, supporting a shift towards self-sustainable schemes in fisheries management. These results imply that habitat restoration is a useful approach for improving the ecological and conservational status of salmonid populations in boreal rivers. To further improve the success rate, and thereby public acceptance, of restorations they need to be complemented by other management measures that enhance the potential for the recovery of threatened salmonid populations.","[Marttila, Maare; Louhi, Pauliina; Maki-Petays, Aki; Erkinaro, Jaakko] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Nat Resources, Oulu, Finland; [Marttila, Maare; Louhi, Pauliina; Muotka, Timo] Univ Oulu, Ecol & Genet Res Unit, Oulu, Finland; [Marttila, Maare] Lapland Ctr Econ Dev Transport & Environm, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Syrjanen, Jukka Tapani] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Muotka, Timo] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Freshwater Ctr, Helsinki, Finland; [Huusko, Ari] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Nat Resources, Paltamo, Finland; [Vehanen, Teppo] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Nat Resources, Helsinki, Finland","Marttila, M (corresponding author), Lapland Ctr Econ Dev Transport & Environm, Rovaniemi, Finland.",maare.marttila@ely-keskus.fi,,,Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation; Maa-ja vesitekniikan tuki ry; Academy of Finland (AKVA) [263597],"Open access funding provided by Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE).

While it is well-established that intratumor, subclonal genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity significantly contribute to resistance, it is not fully understood how tumor sub-clones interact with each other to withstand therapy pressure. Here, we report a previously unrecognized behavior in heterogeneous tumors: cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), in which cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cancer cells when exposed to cancer therapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit we engineered phenotypically diverse non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by conferring mutations in Dicer1, a type III cytoplasmic endoribonuclease involved in small non-coding RNA genesis. We monitored three-dimensional growth dynamics of fluorescently-labeled mutant and/or wild-type cells individually or in co-culture using a substrate-free NanoCulture system under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. By integrating mathematical modeling with flow cytometry, we characterized the growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures using a mathematical model of intra- and interspecies competition. Leveraging the flow cytometry data, we estimated the model's parameters to reveal that the combination of WT and mutants in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug sensitive cells despite drug pressure via induction of cell state transitions described by a cooperative game theoretic change in the fitness values. Finally, we used an ex vivo human tumor model that predicts clinical response through drug sensitivity analyses and determined that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates to prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples. Together, these findings present a new paradox in drug resistance implicating non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells to thwart drug pressure, suggesting that profiling for druggable targets (i.e. mutations) alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy.","[Craig, Morgan] Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Craig, Morgan] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Kaveh, Kamran; Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Woosley, Alec; Brown, Andrew S.] Arrayo, Computat Genom Div, Boston, MA USA; [Goldman, David] 7730E BlackCrest Pl, Tucson, AZ USA; [Eton, Elliot; Goldman, Aaron] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Engn Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mehta, Ravindra M.] Apollo Special Hosp, Intervent Pulmonol & Crit Care Med, Bengaluru, India; [Dhawan, Andrew] Cleveland Clin, Neurol Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Arai, Kazuya] JSR Life Sci Corp, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Rahman, M.

Yet in nature, habitats are interconnected through the exchange of energy and organisms, and the responses of local communities may not extend to emerging community networks (i.e., metacommunities). Using large mesocosms and meiofauna communities as a model system, we investigated the interactive effects of ocean warming and acidification on the structure of marine metacommunities from three shallow-water habitats: sandy soft-bottoms, marine vegetation, and rocky reef substrates. Primary producers and detritus-key food sources for meiofauna-increased in biomass under the combined effect of temperature and acidification. The enhanced bottom-up forcing boosted nematode densities but impoverished the functional and trophic diversity of nematode metacommunities. The combined climate stressors further homogenized meiofauna communities across habitats. Under present-day conditions metacommunities were structured by habitat type, but under future conditions they showed an unstructured random pattern with fast-growing generalist species dominating the communities of all habitats. Homogenization was likely driven by local species extinctions, reducing interspecific competition that otherwise could have prevented single species from dominating multiple niches. Our findings reveal that climate change may simplify metacommunity structure and prompt biodiversity loss, which may affect the biological organization and resilience of marine communities.","[Brustolin, Marco Colossi] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, 23 Symonds St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Brustolin, Marco Colossi] Univ Fed Parana, Ctr Estudos Mar, Pontal Do Parana, Brazil; [Nagelkerken, Ivan; Ferreira, Camilo Moitinho; Goldenberg, Silvan Urs; Ullah, Hadayet] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Nagelkerken, Ivan; Ferreira, Camilo Moitinho; Goldenberg, Silvan Urs; Ullah, Hadayet] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Fonseca, Gustavo] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Inst Mar, Santos, Brazil","Brustolin, MC (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, 23 Symonds St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.; Nagelkerken, I (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.; Nagelkerken, I (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",marcobrustolin@gmail.com; ivan.nagelkerken@adelaide.edu.au,"Brustolin, Marco Colossi/F-2397-2014; Fonseca, Gustavo/B-7673-2011; Nagelkerken, Ivan/E-1093-2011","Brustolin, Marco Colossi/0000-0003-2389-9744; Fonseca, Gustavo/0000-0001-8625-4279; Nagelkerken, Ivan/0000-0003-4499-3940",Australian Research Council Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT120100183]; Environment Institute (The University of Adelaide); Coordination for the Support of Research and Higher Education (CAPES); Araucaria FoundationFundacao Araucaria de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico do Estado do Parana FA [40.783-047/2014]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development of Brazil (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Australian Government's Endeavour awards [5287-2016],"This research was supported by an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship to I.N.

Temporal activity patterns of species are ecologically important as they expose how species exploit their environments. Using camera traps, we evaluated the temporal activity patterns and temporal overlap for a mammalian carnivore assemblage from Sierra Nanchititla Natural Park, central Mexico. We characterized and compared temporal activity patterns and temporal overlap between species pairs using circular statistics. Temporal overlap was analyzed using three temporal domains (full diel, diurnal, and nocturnal), and null models were used to contrast the empirical assemblage-wide temporal overlap in relation to randomly generated distributions. We found that pair-wise temporal overlap comparisons among species were quite heterogeneous and dependent on the temporal domain used for the analyses. Two major inferences can be derived from pair-wise analyses and the null model: (a) most of the carnivore assemblage show a nocturnal activity pattern in common and (b) most of the pair-wise comparisons indicate temporal segregation among species. The highest temporal overlap at the assemblage-wide level was found when only the nocturnal domain was evaluated and we found coincident temporal activities at the full domain level, independent of the temporal resolution used. Overall, our results suggest that carnivores with distinct trophic and habitat use like the margay (Leopardus wiedii) and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) had temporal overlapping activity patterns to full diel and nocturnal domains, and species with similar trophic and habitat use always presented temporal segregation (gray fox and white-nosed coati, Nasua narica). Finally, species with predator-prey relationships (white-nosed coati and cougar, Puma concolor) showed segregation during the day but overlap at night. Our results indicate that species temporal activity patterns likely change in relation to different interspecific interactions such as predation and competition to allow species coexistence within this carnivore assemblage.","[Gomez-Ortiz, Yuriana] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Ctr Invest Recursos Biot, Inst Literario 100, Colonia Ctr 50000, Toluca, Mexico; [Gomez-Ortiz, Yuriana] Univ Intercultural Estado Mexico, Div Desarrollo Sustentable, Libramiento Francisco Villa S-N, San Felipe Del Progreso, Mexico; [Monroy-Vilchis, Octavio] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Ctr Invest Ciencias Biol Aplicadas, Inst Literario 100, Colonia Ctr 50000, Toluca, Mexico; [Castro-Arellano, Ivan] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA","Gomez-Ortiz, Y (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Ctr Invest Recursos Biot, Inst Literario 100, Colonia Ctr 50000, Toluca, Mexico.; Gomez-Ortiz, Y (corresponding author), Univ Intercultural Estado Mexico, Div Desarrollo Sustentable, Libramiento Francisco Villa S-N, San Felipe Del Progreso, Mexico.",yurianagomezortiz@gmail.com; tavomonroyvilchis@gmail.com; ic13@txstate.edu,"Monroy-Vilchis, Octavio/H-8942-2019","Monroy-Vilchis, Octavio/0000-0003-3159-6014","CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [105254, 255868]; PROMEP [103.5/10/0942]",This work was supported by CONACYT (project #105254 and the scholarship #255868 for graduate studies of Gomez-Ortiz Y.) and PROMEP (project #103.5/10/0942).,,51,5,7,3,28,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2199-2401,2199-241X,,MAMMAL RES,Mammal Res.,JUL,2019,64,3,,,,,333,342,,10.1007/s13364-019-00415-8,,,10,Zoology,Zoology,IF3EJ,WOS:000472963400003,,,,,2021-09-21,

The influence of physical and biological environmental factors on capelin distributions was investigated over continental shelf waters in the central Gulf of Alaska (CGOA). Acoustic, oceanographic, and trawl sampling were conducted in summer and fall of 2011 and 2013 as part of the Gulf of Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Research Program. Continuous acoustic sampling across bathymetric gradients showed capelin distributions on the CGOA shelf were primarily concentrated over submarine banks less than 100 m in depth. Acoustic densities of capelin were higher over banks in summer of both years compared to in deeper troughs (>= 100 m depth). Length-based distributions indicated that capelin occurring over banks were mostly age-1 fish, while larger age-2 + capelin were more prevalent in troughs. Environmental factors that influenced occurrence and density of capelin in summer 2013 were identified at two spatial resolutions associated with systematic sampling at discrete stations and continuous sampling along transects. At the station resolution (37 km), the probability of capelin occurrence was associated with relatively warmer bottom temperatures and increased chlorophyll concentrations, while capelin density was associated with close proximity to the edges of banks and reduced thermal stratification. At the transect resolution (0.5 km), increases in capelin density were associated with increases in density of a potential competitor (age-0 pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus) over banks and with increases in prey (macrozooplankton) and predator (semi-demersal groundfish) densities in troughs. We infer that in summer, age-1 capelin concentrate over shallow banks on the CGOA shelf in waters that are well-mixed and more productive to feed on abundant copepods, whereas age-2 + capelin primarily occupy deeper waters in troughs where they consume larger euphausiid and amphipod prey. This suggests that distributions of both life stages over the shelf were likely driven by changes in the availability and composition of prey.","[McGowan, David W.; Horne, John K.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Thorson, James T.] NOAA, Fishery Resource Anal & Monitoring Div FRAM, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Zimmermann, Mark] NOAA, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div RACE, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, NMFS, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","McGowan, DW (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mcgowand@uw.edu,"Thorson, James T/H-8771-2019","Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Zimmermann, Mark/0000-0002-5786-3814; McGowan, David/0000-0003-3974-5117",North Pacific Research Board (NPRB); NOAA FisheriesNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"We thank Captain Ray Haddon, the crew of the F/V Northwest Explorer, and members of the scientific parties on GOAIERP cruises in 2011 and 2013.

The assessment of spatiotemporal overlap among species living within the same burrow system is paramount to explain their strategies of interspecific coexistence. We studied spatiotemporal behavioural patterns of coexistence among four den-sharing mammal species (i.e. the crested porcupine Hystrix cristata, the Eurasian badger Metes metes, the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the European pine marten Martes manes), inhabiting a hilly area of central Italy. Intensive camera trapping (September 2015-September 2018) was used to estimate the interspecific overlap of both temporal and spatial activity patterns for all species combinations. An extensive nocturnal temporal overlap was recorded among all the species, except the diurnal pine marten. However, crested porcupines were mostly active in the darkest nights, whereas bright moonlight enhanced the hunting success of the red fox. Activity of badgers was limited in bright nights only during cold months, when predation pressure and poaching risk were the highest. Crested porcupines avoided spatial sharing outside the den with both nocturnal carnivores, particularly during the winter, when its cubs are in the den. Overlap in ranging areas and activity rhythms between the red fox and the Eurasian badger may be promoted by a remarkable food niche partitioning. Conversely, spatiotemporal overlap between red foxes and pine martens suggested a significant interspecific spatial partitioning, due to the overlap in feeding habits. Den-sharing represents a form of positive interspecific interaction which may limit energy waste and increase local species diversity and densities. Species using the same burrow system may show both spatial and temporal niche partitioning throughout the year, thus allowing a non-competitive coexistence.","[Mori, Emiliano] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Menchetti, Mattia] UPF, CSIC, Inst Biol Evolut, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Menchetti, Mattia] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Biol, Via Madonna Piano 6, I-50019 Florence, Italy","Mori, E (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",moriemiliano@tiscali.it,"Menchetti, Mattia/P-1556-2015","Menchetti, Mattia/0000-0002-0707-7495",,,,77,11,11,3,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-6357,1872-8308,,BEHAV PROCESS,Behav.

MET-based anaerobic digestion (AD) systems treating swine manure were operated at different applied voltages (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9V) and temperatures (25, 35, and 45 degrees C). Among the MET-based AD systems with different applied voltages at 35 degrees C, M4 at 0.7V showed the highest methane production (2.96m(3)-CH4/m(3)) and methane yield (0.64m(3)-CH4/kg-VS). The methane production and yield increased with increasing temperature at an applied voltage of 0.7V. Nevertheless, the MET-based AD systems (LM at 25 degrees C and 0.7V) showed competitive AD performance (2.33m(3)-CH4/m(3) and 0.53m(3)-CH4/VS) compared with the conventional AD system (35 degrees C). The microbial community was affected by the applied voltage and temperature, and hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as M. flavescens, M. hungatei, and M. thermautotrophicus were mainly responsible for methane production in MET-based AD systems. Therefore, the methane production can be enhanced by an applied voltage or by direct interspecies electron transfer because M. flavescens and M. thermautotrophicus were especially predominant in cathode of MET-based AD systems. The MET-based AD systems can help enhance biogas production from swine manure with no significant change in methane content. Furthermore, MET-based AD systems will be a promising AD system through low material development and the optimal operation.","[Yu, Jaecheul] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Kim, Sunwon; Kwon, O-Seob] Inje Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Gimhae 50834, South Korea","Kwon, OS (corresponding author), Inje Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Gimhae 50834, South Korea.",envkos@inje.ac.kr,,,"2015 Inje University Research Grant; Gyeongnam Green Environmental Center of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF-2015R1C1A1A01054204, 2018R1D1A1B07046741]","This study was supported financially by the 2015 Inje University Research Grant, the Gyeongnam Green Environmental Center of Korea, and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2015R1C1A1A01054204 and 2018R1D1A1B07046741).",,40,11,11,2,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1367-5435,1476-5535,,J IND MICROBIOL BIOT,J.

Evolutionary theory predicts that selection for resistance will be accompanied by fitness trade-offs in environments where the stress is absent. Alopecurus myosuroides, an autumn-germinating grass weed of cereal crops in North-West Europe, has evolved resistance to seven herbicide modes-of-action, making this an ideal species to examine the presence and magnitudes of such fitness costs. Here, we use two contrasting A. myosuroides phenotypes derived from a common genetic background, one with enhanced metabolism resistance to a commercial formulation of the sulfonylurea (ALS) actives mesosulfuron and iodosulfuron, and the other with susceptibility to these actives (S). Comparisons of plant establishment, growth, and reproductive potential were made under conditions of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition with wheat, and over a gradient of nitrogen deprivation. Herbicide dose response assays confirmed that the two lines had contrasting resistance phenotypes, with a 20-fold difference in resistance between them. Pleiotropic effects of resistance were observed during plant development, with R plants having a greater intraspecific competitive effect and longer tiller lengths than S plants during vegetative growth, but with S plants allocating proportionally more biomass to reproductive tissues during flowering. Direct evidence of a reproductive cost of resistance was evident in the nitrogen deprivation experiment with R plants producing 27% fewer seed heads per plant, and a corresponding 23% reduction in total seed head length. However, these direct effects of resistance on fecundity were not consistent across experiments. Our results demonstrate that a resistance phenotype based on enhanced herbicide metabolism has pleiotropic impacts on plant growth, development and resource partitioning but does not support the hypothesis that resistance is associated with a consistent reproductive fitness cost in this species. Given the continued difficulties associated with unequivocally detecting costs of herbicide resistance, we advocate future studies that adopt classical evolutionary quantitative genetics approaches to determine genetic correlations between resistance and fitness-related plant life history traits.","[Comont, David; Crook, Laura; Hull, Richard; Neve, Paul] Rothamsted Res, Dept Bointeract & Crop Protect, Harpenden, Herts, England; [Knight, Craig] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Wellesbourne, Warwick, England; [Beffa, Roland] Bayer AG, CropSci Div, Frankfurt, Germany","Comont, D (corresponding author), Rothamsted Res, Dept Bointeract & Crop Protect, Harpenden, Herts, England.",David.Comont@rothamsted.ac.uk,"Neve, Paul/P-8726-2015","Neve, Paul/0000-0002-3136-5286; Comont, David/0000-0002-5235-1035","Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/L001489/1, BBS/OS/CP/000001]; Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB); Bayer CropScience (Frankfurt); University of Warwick (United Kingdom)",This work was funded by the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC; BB/L001489/1 and BBS/OS/CP/000001) and the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB).

The composition of gut microbiota is thought to be largely shaped by interspecies competition for available resources and also by cooperative interactions. However, to what extent the changes could be attributed to external factors such as diet of choice and internal factors including mutual relationships among gut microbiota, respectively, are yet to be elucidated. Due to the advances of high-throughput sequencing technologies, flood of (meta)-genome sequence information and high-throughput biological data are available for gut microbiota and their association with intestinal diseases, making it easier to gain understanding of microbial physiology at the systems level. In addition, the newly developed genome-scale metabolic models that cover significant proportion of known gut microbes enable researchers to analyze and simulate the system-level metabolic response in response to different stimuli in the gut, providing deeper biological insights. Using metabolic interaction network based on pair-wise metabolic dependencies, we found the same interaction pattern in two IBD datasets and one CRC datasets. We report here for the first time that the growth of significantly enriched bacteria in IBD and CRC patients could be boosted by other bacteria including other significantly increased ones. Conversely, the growth of probiotics could be strongly inhibited from other species, including other probiotics. Therefore, it is very important to take the mutual interaction of probiotics into consideration when developing probiotics or microbial based therapies. Together, our metabolic interaction network analysis can predict majority of the changes in terms of the changed directions in the gut microbiota during enteropathogenesis. Our results thus revealed unappreciated interaction patterns between species could underlie alterations in gut microbiota during enteropathogenesis, and between probiotics and other microbes. Our methods provided a new framework for studying interactions in gut microbiome and their roles in health and disease.","[Dai, Die; Wang, Teng; Wu, Sicheng; Gao, Na L.; Chen, Wei-Hua] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Dept Bioinformat & Syst Biol, Key Lab Mol Biophys,Minist Educ,Hubei Key Lab Bio, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei-Hua] Henan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xinxiang, Henan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei-Hua] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Ezhou Ind Technol Res Inst, Ezhou, Peoples R China","Chen, WH (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Dept Bioinformat & Syst Biol, Key Lab Mol Biophys,Minist Educ,Hubei Key Lab Bio, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Chen, WH (corresponding author), Henan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xinxiang, Henan, Peoples R China.; Chen, WH (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Ezhou Ind Technol Res Inst, Ezhou, Peoples R China.",weihuachen@hust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81803850],This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 81803850).,,47,5,5,1,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Initially, humans and wolves were competitors starting interspecific communication in order to avoid risk of injury. The evolutionary continuity of mammalian brains enabled interspecific prosocial contacts between both of them, which reduced stress, and enabled behavioral cultures leading to genetic isolation of those wolves. Dogs are the first domesticated animal living together with humans for about 25,000 years. Domestication means decreased aggression and flight distance toward humans, thus changes in the stress axis are crucial. The hypothesis of Active Social Domestication considers genetic selection as a necessary prediction but not a sufficient explanation of dog domestication. In addition, dog domestication is suggested to be an epigenetic disclosure. Due to changed stress activity, epigenetic mechanisms affect cerebral receptor activity and regulate transposon expressions, thus shaping brain function and behavior. Interspecific prosocial contacts initiated via serotonin release an enzymatic cascade enhancing, epigenetically, the glucocorticoid negative feedback loop. Reduced chronic stress improved social learning capability and inhibitory control. Over time, those wolves could integrate themselves into human social structures, thus becoming dogs. In analogy, human mental skills, such as creating art and culture, might have also improved during the Upper Paleolithic.","[Poertl, Daniela] Teaching Hosp Leipzig, Psychiat Dept, Saale Unstrut Klinikum, Naumburg, Germany; [Poertl, Daniela] Jena Univ, Naumburg, Germany","Portl, D (corresponding author), Teaching Hosp Leipzig, Psychiat Dept, Saale Unstrut Klinikum, Naumburg, Germany.; Portl, D (corresponding author), Jena Univ, Naumburg, Germany.",d.poertl@t-online.de,,,,,,106,4,4,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",2676-8615,2676-8607,,BIOL FUTURA,Biol.

The objective of the present study was to identify the factors that influence interannual variations in the somatic growth rate of herring (Clupea harengus) in the Baltic Sea. This work covers otolith samples collected from commercial catches and during scientific surveys from 1951 to 2017 in the Polish zone of the southern part of the Baltic. Otolith increment widths, which represent changes in fish growth, were analyzed with linear mixed models to investigate different intrinsic and extrinsic sources of fish growth variation. The stock biomass of pelagic species (herring and sprat Sprattus sprattus), sea surface temperature, Baltic Sea Index and land precipitation over the catchment area were considered potential predictors of herring growth. Methods to identify the optimal time window for environmental factors were incorporated in the modeling. Moreover, a wavelet coherence analysis, tests for identification of regime shifts in fish growth and a spatial correlation analysis were applied to the data. The developed multidecadal otolith-based biochronology showed that the growth of Baltic herring is under the strong influence of interspecific competition between herring and sprat, but the biochronology also indicated a high correlation with precipitation patterns over the runoff area and hydrological conditions within the Baltic Sea. A detailed investigation revealed that the relationships between herring growth and abiotic conditions or other ecosystem components can vary over time. The recognized complex ecological effects on herring growth necessitate the application of holistic ecosystem-based approaches for sustainable management and exploitation of small pelagic fish resources.","[Smolinski, Szymon] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland","Smolinski, S (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Kollataja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland.",ssmolinski@mir.gdynia.pl,"Smolinski, Szymon/AAZ-1088-2020","Smolinski, Szymon/0000-0003-2715-984X","BONUS Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [185]; EUEuropean Commission; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany; State Education Development Agency of Latvia; National Centre for Research and Development, PolandNational Centre for Research & Development, Poland; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas","This work resulted from the BONUS BLUEWEBS project which has received funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU, the Academy of Finland, Projekttrager Julich (PtJ), Germany, the State Education Development Agency of Latvia, the National Centre for Research and Development, Poland, and the Swedish Research Council Formas.

The role that climatic change, genetic interbreeding, and interspecies competition played in the extinction of Neanderthal groups is still debated. Hohle Fels is one of several important Middle and Upper Paleolithic sites from the Ach Valley in southwestern Germany which documents the presence of Neanderthals and modern humans in the region. Chronological and stratigraphic records indicate that these two groups occupied the site with little to no overlap or interaction. This provides the opportunity to examine the behavioural variability of Swabian Neanderthal populations without the complication of cross-cultural influence. In this study we contribute a terrestrial paleoenvironmental record derived from the small mammal material from Hohle Fels Cave to the ever-growing archaeological record of this period. By reconstructing the climate and landscape of the Ach Valley during this time we can identify the effect that the OIS 3 environment had on the presence of Neanderthals in the region. Based on indicator taxa and the habitat weighing method, the small mammal record, which includes rodents, insectivores, and bats, from Hohle Fels shows that the earliest Neanderthal occupation took place on a landscape characterized by substantial woodland and forest, rivers and ponds, as well as moist meadows and grasslands. A gradual increase in cold tundra and arctic environments is clear towards the end of the Middle Paleolithic, extending to the end of the early Aurignacian which may correlate with the onset of the Heinrich 4 event (similar to 42,000 kya). Our taphonomic analysis indicates the material was accumulated primarily by opportunistic predators such as the great grey owl, snowy owl, and European eagle owl, and therefore reflects the diversity of landscapes present around the site in the past. Importantly, at the time Neanderthals abandoned the Ach Valley we find no indication for dramatic climatic deterioration. Rather, we find evidence of a gradual cooling of the Swabian landscape which may have pushed Neanderthal groups out of the Ach Valley prior to the arrival of modern human Aurignacian groups.","[Rhodes, Sara E.; Starkovich, Britt M.; Conard, Nicholas J.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Nat Wissensch Archaol, Tubingen, Germany; [Starkovich, Britt M.] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Palaeoenvironm, Tubingen, Germany; [Conard, Nicholas J.] Univ Tubingen, Abt Altere Urgeschichte & Quartarokol, Tubingen, Germany","Rhodes, SE (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Nat Wissensch Archaol, Tubingen, Germany.",sara.rhodes@uni-tuebingen.de,,"Rhodes, Sara/0000-0001-7328-4663; Conard, Nicholas/0000-0002-4633-0385","Deutsche Academischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) Doctoral research grant; Baden-Wurttemberg State Office for Cultural Heritage; Eiszeit Quell; Heidelberger Cement; Ministry of Science of Baden-Wurttemberg; Muesum Gesellschaft Schelklingen; Gesellschaft fur Urgeschichte, Blaubeuren; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); University of Tubingen","S.

Migration can rapidly alter the relative influence of stochastic processes, species interactions, or environmental factors in shaping communities across seasons. Here, we describe seasonal dynamics in the phylogenetic and functional diversity of waterbirds in Mai Po Wetland, a subtropical region with significant and predictable temporal variation in climate and migratory bird density. Phylogenetic alpha diversity varied seasonally, exhibiting a clustered structure (indicative of environmental filtering) in summer, and over-dispersed structure (indicative of biotic filtering) in winter. Phylogenetic diversity in spring and autumn exhibited a more intermediate, random structure, consistent with stochastic arrivals and departures of migrants. Functional diversity was clustered in spring but showed over-dispersion in the other three seasons. Phylogenetic beta diversity in summer and winter assemblages was characterized by two distinct groups, while spring and autumn assemblages were mixed. Our results suggest that waterbird assemblages were primarily shaped by interspecific competition in winter, while random processes tended to shape assemblages in spring and fall. Environmental factors played a more important role in summer, during periods of high heat stress. In addition, species co-occurrence patterns were significantly more strongly related to phylogenetic similarity in winter than in summer. Our results suggest that the relative importance of assemblage mechanisms can vary seasonally in response to changing environmental conditions, suggesting that studies attempting to infer a single dominant assembly mechanism may ignore important assembly processes. Temporal shifts in assembly mechanisms may play an important role in maintaining diversity in subtropical and temperate wetlands and perhaps also in other dynamic systems.","[Che, Xianli] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Che, Xianli] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Che, Xianli; Chen, Daojian; Zhang, Min; Quan, Qing; Zou, Fasheng] Guangdong Inst Appl Biol Resources, Guangdong Key Lab Anim Conservat & Resource Utili, Guangdong Publ Lab Wild Anim Conservat & Utilizat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Sud, Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, CNRS,Ecol Systemat Evolut, Orsay, France","Zou, FS (corresponding author), Guangdong Inst Appl Biol Resources, Guangdong Key Lab Anim Conservat & Resource Utili, Guangdong Publ Lab Wild Anim Conservat & Utilizat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zoufs@giabr.gd.cn,,"Che, Xianli/0000-0002-2082-2664","National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672265]; GDAS Special Project of Science and Technology Development [2017GDASCX-0107, 2018GDASCX-0107]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2016A030313784]; Wildlife Conservation and Management Project of Guangdong Province","National Nature Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31672265; GDAS Special Project of Science and Technology Development, Grant/Award Number: 2017GDASCX-0107 and 2018GDASCX-0107; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, Grant/Award Number: 2016A030313784; Wildlife Conservation and Management Project of Guangdong Province",,56,7,9,4,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0006-3606,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,MAY,2019,51,3,,,,,421,431,,10.1111/btp.12648,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HX9TD,WOS:000467750400017,,,,,2021-09-21,

Standard correlation and/or network analyses may be misleading when taken as an indication of taxon interactions because correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish causation; environmental filtering can lead to correlation between non-interacting taxa. Unfortunately, microbial ecologists have generally used correlation as a proxy for causality although there is a general consensus about what constitutes a causal relationship: causes both precede and predict effects. We apply one of the first causal models for detecting interactions in human microbiome samples. Specifically, we analyze a long duration, high resolution time series of the human microbiome to decipher the networks of correlation and causation of human-associated microbial genera. We show that correlation is not a good proxy for biological interaction; we observed a weak negative relationship between correlation and causality. Strong interspecific interactions are disproportionately positive, whereas almost all strong intraspecific interactions are negative. Interestingly, intraspecific interactions also appear to act at a short timescale causing vast majority of the effects within 1-3 days. We report how different taxa are involved in causal relationships with others, and show that strong interspecific interactions are rarely conserved across two body sites whereas strong intraspecific interactions are much more conserved, ranging from 33% between the gut and right-hand to 70% between the two hands. Therefore, in the absence of guiding assumptions about ecological interactions, Granger causality and related techniques may be particularly helpful for understanding the driving factors governing microbiome composition and structure. Author summary The human microbiome comprises thousands of microbial taxa, each of them potentially having interactions with many other taxa. Elucidating these interactions can be helpful for human health and beyond. The most conclusive approach for understanding microbial interactions would be myriads of controlled experiments in laboratory settings, each designed to test how taxa interact with one another. As this is a formidable challenge, an alternative strategy for constructing such an interaction network is a statistical framework employing formal models. Using conditional Granger causality, we demonstrate that correlation measures, which are very popular statistics in microbiome studies, are unreliable as proxies of microbial interactions. Overall, we found that strong interactions within a genus tended to be negative (e.g., competition), and they tended to occur on very short timescales (1-2 days). Many of such interactions were common across body sites. By contrast, strong interactions between genera tended to be positive (e.g., mutualism/facilitation) and were more evenly distributed over a range of timescales, up to the 20-day window that we considered. Very few of these interactions were conserved across body sites. We conclude that models of causality can be particularly useful in elucidating microbial interaction networks when laboratory investigations of interactions are impractical.","[Mainali, Kumar; Bewick, Sharon; Fagan, William F.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Vecchio-Pagan, Briana; Karig, David] Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Res & Exploratory Dev Dept, Laurel, MD USA; [Mainali, Kumar] Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Bewick, Sharon] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Karig, David] Clemson Univ, Dept Bioengn, Clemson, SC USA","Mainali, K (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Mainali, K (corresponding author), Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA.",kpmainali@utexas.edu,"Karig, David/AAT-9108-2020","Karig, David/0000-0002-9508-6411; Mainali, Kumar/0000-0001-7470-8173",U.S. Army Research LaboratoryUnited States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL); U.S. Army Research Office [W911NF-14-1-0490],"This work was supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the U.S. Army Research Office under contract/grant number #W911NF-14-1-0490.

To test the hypothesis of dietary resource partitioning between batoids within a communal nursery, we investigated two cownose ray species, Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis, which occur in heterospecific groups, a strategy predicted to increase survival and foraging success. Using two biochemical tracers, fatty acids (FA) and stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13), the combined effects of maternal investment and the formation of heterospecific groups implying competition for, or partitioning of available food resources were investigated. Through univariate and multivariate analyses of biochemical tracers in several tissues (fin clip, muscle, liver, red blood cells; RBC) and plasma, our results revealed significant interspecific differences in tracers between the two species. Total FAs ( n-ary sumation saturated FA, n-ary sumation monounsaturated FA and n-ary sumation polyunsaturated FA) and trophic biomarkers (i.e., docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid and delta N-15) were the principle tracers responsible for the differences detected. These data revealed that R. brasiliensis was less enriched in physiologically important essential FAs than R. bonasus. Our findings suggest that these congeneric species differ in maternal investment strategy and moderately partition food resources over relatively fine spatial scales within a single nursery habitat to limit competition. These results provide further knowledge on the foraging strategies adopted by batoids in communal nursery areas, information that is required for improving spatial conservation and management planning.","[Rangel, Bianca de Sousa; Gomes, Aline D.; Moreira, Renata Guinnaraes] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Lab Metab & Reprod Organismos Aquat, Dept Fisiol, Rua Matao,Travessa 14,321,Cidade Univ, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Hussey, Nigel E.] Univ Windsor, Biol Sci, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Rodrigues, Alexandre] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias Botucatu, Lab Biol & Genet Peixes, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Martinelli, Luiz A.] Univ Sao Paulo, CENA, Dept Ecol Isotop, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil","Rangel, BD (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Lab Metab & Reprod Organismos Aquat, Dept Fisiol, Rua Matao,Travessa 14,321,Cidade Univ, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",biarangel.sharks@gmail.com,"Moreira, Renata Guimaraes/K-3122-2012; de Sousa Rangel, Bianca/O-5482-2019","Moreira, Renata Guimaraes/0000-0001-8139-1776; de Sousa Rangel, Bianca/0000-0002-4029-765X","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [FAPESP 2014/16320-7, FAPESP 2016/09095-2]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001]","Funding for this study was provided by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP 2014/16320-7) for the Master's scholarship to B.S.

With one exception, previous studies in southeastern Australia have concentrated on taxa with broad distributions for which convincing scenarios to explain range size reductions are generally lacking. This study investigates the genetic structure of the mussel Austromytilus rostratus, which is a limited-range taxon endemic to the region, to examine the role that demographic instability may have played in its phylogeographic history. A. rostratus presently has no marked geographic structure in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I DNA sequences, although it exhibits very high diversity of haplotypes, with many restricted to one of the three regions where the species is particularly abundant. F-ST values between these regions are low although they are separated by areas of low population density. Sequence mismatch distributions and population genetic statistics suggest that demographic disequilibrium has occurred in A. rostratus overall and within each region. The species may have experienced population size changes, possibly through a decrease in its distribution during climate cycles to southern refugia at glacial minima or to northern refugia at glacial maxima. Under either scenario, however, the operation of indirect factors such as changes in the ranges of predators, interspecific competition or nutrient availability would probably need to be invoked to explain severe reductions in population size.","[Colgan, D.

These novel forests represent a challenge for management, which is further accentuated by anthropogenic global change. Knowledge on the intra-annual growth performance and tree water relations of established and novel tree species is required to elucidate the drivers underlying forest dynamics. Here, we analysed intra-annual radial growth of the introduced tree species Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle and co-occurring Castanea sativa Mill. in novel forest communities in southern Switzerland. We used fouryears of continuously measured growth data in two sites to identify weather conditions in which the species achieved highest hourly growth and conditions in which largest proportions of seasonal growth occurred. While both species reached the largest proportion of seasonal growth and achieved the highest hourly growth under the most frequent weather conditions, A. altissima featured the highest growth rates in a wider range of weather conditions than C. sativa, particularly at hightemperature and highvapour pressure deficit. We conclude that A. altissima has a greater potential than C. sativa to sustain growth in warm-dry conditions. Importantly, the advantages of A. altissima may be more accentuated in forest stands with low interspecific competition.","[Knusel, Simon; Conedera, Marco; Wunder, Jan] WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Community Ecol, A Ramel 18, CH-6593 Cadenazzo, Switzerland; [Knusel, Simon; Bugmann, Harald] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Dept Environm Sci, Forest Ecol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zweifel, Roman; Etzold, Sophia] WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Forest Dynam, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Wunder, Jan] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1020, New Zealand","Knusel, S (corresponding author), WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Community Ecol, A Ramel 18, CH-6593 Cadenazzo, Switzerland.; Knusel, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Dept Environm Sci, Forest Ecol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",simon.knuesel@wsl.ch,"Zweifel, Roman/C-2852-2009","Zweifel, Roman/0000-0001-9438-0582","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); French National Research Agency (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [310030L_156661]; Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN); Swiss Federal Research Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL)","We would like to thank Luca Jelmini, Franco Fibbioli, Ivan Candolfi and Florim Sabani for field and lab assistance.

While numerous studies have documented the ecological implications of this switch, subsequent reductions in nutrient and sediment loading do not consistently result in predictable reversals to macrophyte dominance. Reintroduction of rooted aquatic macrophytes at appropriate scales and species combinations may disrupt these negative feedbacks, although our current limited understanding of these complex mechanisms hinders the development of effective, targeted restoration strategies. We evaluated the potential for restoration of Vallisneria americana (wild celery) in the Lower Bay of Green Bay by altering restoration size and co-planting with the emergent species Schoenoplectus acutus (hardstem bulrush). Wild celery survival among all sites exceeded 90% in 2015 and 110% in 2016. However, in contrast to our expectations the effect of restoration size and interspecific facilitation on survival was either marginal or non-significant. Instead, various environmental effects focused largely on the interaction of water depth, substrate characteristics, and the abundance of unrestored floating macrophytes (i.e. Lemna, Ceratophyllum, and Utricularia spp.) drove variability in restoration success, suggesting that future work focus on identifying restoration methods that can withstand a highly dynamic environment. Our results provide insight into the factors continuing to limit the re-establishment of aquatic macrophytes in degraded systems, suggesting a more limited role of water quality and greater role of interspecific competition and propagule limitation or seedling establishment than previously recognized.

Possibly, rare species experience strong negative frequency dependence (NFD, i.e. strong intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition), which both makes them rare and buffers them against extinction. A second, not mutually exclusive, possibility is that rare species that experience weak NFD go extinct quickly due to demographic and environmental stochasticity. Both possibilities predict that persistent rare species will experience stronger NFD than common ones. A previous study confirmed this prediction in a range of mostly terrestrial communities. Here, we test that prediction in lake zooplankton and explore its theoretical basis. Location Fifty-three temperate lakes. Time period 1970-2011. Major taxa studied Cladocerans, copepods. Methods We used long-term time series data to estimate the covariance between strength of NFD and mean frequency (relative abundance) for crustacean zooplankton. We used a randomization test to ask whether the covariance between NFD and mean frequency is stronger than expected, given sampling error. We also calculated the covariance between NFD and mean frequency in simulated communities from three different ecological models. Results Rare species experience significantly stronger NFD than common species in over half of the communities. The distribution of associations between NFD and rarity is skewed towards weak associations, which always occur in communities with high evenness. All three theoretical models reproduce these empirical results, even though they are based on different mechanisms (demographic or environmental stochasticity, and mathematical constraints on possible NFD-frequency relationships). Main conclusions Rare species typically experience stronger NFD than common ones because there are many different ecological scenarios in which they will do so, and only a few scenarios in which they won't. Like several other macroecological patterns, the tendency for rare species to experience stronger NFD than common ones is a statistical attractor that is hard to avoid.","[Rovere, Jacob; Fox, Jeremy W.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jefox@ucalgary.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN/311728-2010],"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: RGPIN/311728-2010",,46,3,3,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Few data are available to answer this question, as it is rarely possible to document both the decline and recovery of wildlife populations. Here we present the first in-depth quantitative account of war-induced collapse and postwar recovery in a diverse assemblage of large herbivores. In Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, we assembled data from 15 aerial wildlife counts conducted before (1968-1972) and after (1994-2018) the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992). Pre-war total biomass density exceeded 9,000 kg km(-2), but populations declined by >90% during the war. Since 1994, total biomass has substantially recovered, but species composition has shifted dramatically. Formerly dominant large herbivores-including elephant (Loxodonta africana), hippo (Hippopotamus amphibius), buffalo (Syncerus Gaffer), zebra (Equus quagga), and wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus)-are now outnumbered by waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) and other small to mid-sized antelopes. Waterbuck abundance has increased by an order of magnitude, with >55,000 individuals accounting for >74% of large-herbivore biomass in 2018. By contrast, elephant, hippo, and buffalo, which totaled 89% of pre-war biomass, now comprise just 23%. These trends mostly reflect natural population growth following the resumption of protection under the Gorongosa Restoration Project; reintroductions (465 animals of 7 species) accounted for a comparatively small fraction of the total numerical increase. Waterbuck are growing logistically, apparently as-yet unchecked by interspecific competition or predation (apex-carnivore abundance has been low throughout the post-war interval), suggesting a community still in flux. Most other herbivore populations have increased post-war, albeit at differing rates. Armed conflict remains a poorly understood driver of ecological change; our results demonstrate the potential for rapid post-war recovery of large-herbivore biomass, given sound protected-area management, but also suggest that restoration of community structure takes longer and may require active intervention.","[Stalmans, Marc E.; Massad, Tara J.] Dept Sci Serv, Beira, Sofala Province, Mozambique; [Peel, Mike J.

An in vitro competitive binding assay showed that six PFCAs and two PFSAs could bind to recombinant bs and hPPAR alpha LBD proteins in a dose dependent manner. The relative binding affinities (RBAs) of PFASs to bsPPAR alpha were as follows: PFOS > PFDA > PFNA > PFUnDA > PFOA > PFHxS > PFHpA > PFHxA. The RBAs to bsPPAR alpha showed a significant positive correlation with those to hPPAR alpha. In silico PPAR alpha homology modeling predicted that there were two ligand-binding pockets (LBPs) in the bsPPAR alpha and hPPAR alpha LBDs. Structure-activity relationship analyses suggested that the binding potencies of PFASs to PPAR alpha might depend on LBP binding cavity volume, hydrogen bond interactions, the number of perfluorinated carbons, and the hydrophobicity of PFASs. Interspecies comparison of the in vitro binding affinities revealed that bsPPAR alpha had higher preference for PFASs with long carbon chains than hPPAR alpha. The in silico docking simulations suggested that the first LBP of bsPPAR alpha had higher affinities than that of hPPAR alpha; however, the second LBP of bsPPAR alpha had lower affinities than that of hPPAR alpha. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing interspecies differences in the binding of PFASs to PPAR alpha s and their structure activity relationships.","[Ishibashi, Hiroshi; Iwata, Hisato] Ehime Univ, CMES, Bunkyo Cho 2-5, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan; [Ishibashi, Hiroshi] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Agr, 3-5-7 Tarumi, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908566, Japan; [Hirano, Masashi] Kumamoto Coll, Natl Inst Technol, Dept Biol & Chem Syst Engn, 2627 Hirayama Shinmachi, Yatsushiro, Kumamoto 8668501, Japan; [Kim, Eun-Young] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Life & Nanopharmaceut Sci, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Kim, Eun-Young] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Biol, Seoul 130701, South Korea","Iwata, H (corresponding author), Ehime Univ, CMES, Bunkyo Cho 2-5, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan.",iwata.hisato.mz@ehime-u.ac.jp,"Iwata, Hisato/A-5478-2013; Kim, Eun-young/AAI-8613-2020","Iwata, Hisato/0000-0002-6867-0532; Kim, Eun-young/0000-0002-9739-2324; Ishibashi, Hiroshi/0000-0002-4676-4685","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21221004, 26220103, 24380179, 16H05057]; Joint Usage/Research Center Leading Academia in Marine and Environment Pollution Research (LaMer) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Ministry of Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2016R1A2B4007714]; Korean Ministry of Environment [H117-00137-0702]","This study was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (5) (no. 21221004 & 26220103) and (B) (no. 24380179 & 16H05057) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), and Joint Usage/Research Center Leading Academia in Marine and Environment Pollution Research (LaMer) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

Further, a range of density-dependent and density-independent biotic and abiotic processes affect the phenology of mosquito populations, with potentially large knock-on effects for vector dynamics and disease transmission. Whilst it is understood that density-independent and density-dependent processes affect seasonal population levels, it is not clear how these interact temporally to shape the population peaks and troughs. Due to this, the paucity of high-resolution data for validation, and the difficulty of parameterizing density-dependent processes, models of vector dynamics may poorly estimate abundances, which has knock-on effects for our ability predict vector-borne disease outbreaks.ResultsWe present a rich dataset describing seasonal abundance patterns of each life stage of Culex pipiens, a widespread vector of West Nile virus, at a field site in southern England in 2015. Abundance of immature stages was measured three times per week, whilst adult traps were run four nights each week. This dataset is integrated with an existing delay-differential equation model predicting Cx. pipiens seasonal abundance to improve understanding of observed seasonal abundance patterns. At our field site, the outcome of our model fitting suggests interspecific predation on mosquito larvae and temperature-dependent larval mortality combine to act as the main sources of population regulation throughout the active season, whilst competition for resources is a relatively small source of larval mortality.ConclusionsThe model suggests that density-independent mortality and interspecific predation interact to shape patterns of mosquito seasonal abundance in a permanent aquatic habitat and we propose that competition for resources is likely to be important where periods of high rainfall create transient habitats. Further, we highlight the importance of challenging population abundance models with data from across all life stages of the species of interest if reliable inferences are to be drawn from these models, particularly when considering mosquito control and vector-borne disease transmission.","[Ewing, David A.; Purse, Bethan V.; Schafer, Stefanie M.; White, Steven M.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Ewing, David A.; Cobbold, Christina A.] Univ Glasgow, Dept Math & Stat, Univ Pl, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Ewing, David A.] Biomath & Stat Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell Bldg,Peter Guthrie Tate Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Cobbold, Christina A.] Univ Glasgow, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [White, Steven M.] Radcliffe Observ Quarter, Math Inst, Wolfson Ctr Math Biol, Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England","Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.; Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Dept Math & Stat, Univ Pl, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.; Ewing, DA (corresponding author), Biomath & Stat Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell Bldg,Peter Guthrie Tate Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland.",david.ewing@bioss.ac.uk,"Purse, Bethan V/I-6640-2012; Schafer, Stefanie/H-3070-2016","Purse, Bethan V/0000-0001-5140-2710; Schafer, Stefanie/0000-0002-8748-7725; Ewing, David/0000-0002-9974-8179",Natural Environment Research Council Doctoral Training Grant [NE/L501645/1]; Natural Environment Research Council National Capability allocation [NEC05100 HARM]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/P004202/1],This work was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council Doctoral Training Grant (Grant no.

Studies of zonation often focus on invertebrate macrofauna in the sub or inter-tidal regions; rarely has zonation of small mammal communities been considered in dunes. In this study we use 10 years of mammal trapping data and show that a diverse small mammal community was present within a coastal dune system. Nine species were captured within the dune, only one of which was introduced. The invasive house mouse was limited to a narrow band above the beach/dune interface, while the native small mammal assemblage dominated in the rest of the dune field. This clear zonation may result from habitat preference, interspecific competition, predation, species-specific predator risk tolerances, marine or beach subsidies or a combination of these influences.

Dendrobranchiata/Caridea shrimps were the most frequent crustacean prey found in the guts of almost all examined fishes, with high values of relative abundance (N%). Season (summer, autumn) and fish behaviour (demersal, benthic) were not found to affect the diet of the examined fish species.

Differences in the proportion of the main crustacean categories consumed by the examined fish species were observed. The low richness and preference towards specific crustacean taxa or different crustacean species could be considered as an indication of interspecific competition for the same food resource in the oligotrophic waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. The occurrence of different crustacean taxa in the gut of some species through the analysed seasons, could be related to differences in prey availability or to selective preference for certain prey which in turn could be linked to different energetic requirements for growth and reproduction of predators.","[Anastasopoulou, Aikaterini; Mytilineou, Chryssi] Hellenic Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Athens, Greece; [Smith, Christopher J.; Papadopoulou, Konstantia N.] Hellenic Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Iraklion, Greece","Anastasopoulou, A (corresponding author), Hellenic Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Athens, Greece.",kanast@hcmr.gr,,"Smith, Christopher/0000-0002-3031-5316; Papadopoulou, Nadia/0000-0003-4767-9949; ANASTASOPOULOU, AIKATERINI/0000-0003-0872-6984",European CommunityEuropean Commission; Greek General Secretariat for Research and TechnologyGreek Ministry of Development-GSRT,The FP7 CoralFISH project was funded from the European Community with co-financing from the Greek General Secretariat for Research and Technology.,,44,3,3,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Understanding how food resources are used and whether the diets of neighboring species are different are particularly important when considering the coexistence and functional role of species. Territorial damselfish on coral reefs are considered to be herbivores that defend algal mats from other food competitors. However, this guild contains numerous small species whose functional role and dietary diversification is poorly understood. Here, the relationships between diet and spatial distribution of seven intermediate-sized territorial damselfishes at Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea (5 degrees 30S, 150 degrees 05E) were investigated. These species partition habitat across three reef zones with distinct patterns of fine-scale distribution. It was predicted that neighboring species partition food resources with minimal dietary overlap. Examination of isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen delineated three distinct feeding strategies: pelagic, reef-based, and an intermediate group feeding on both prey types. None of the species appear to be strict herbivores. Adjacent species exhibited high-intermediate trophic niche partitioning when examining pelagic versus reef-based production sources, with two species previously described as benthic herbivores exhibiting pelagic feeding. The study demonstrates that diet reinforces the patterns of spatial partitioning and coexistence among ecologically similar damselfishes. These findings add to a growing view that interspecific differences among similar species are lost when categorizing species into broad functional classifications, and that previous studies suggesting that territorial damselfish are strictly reef-based feeders may not be applicable in all systems or for all species.","[Eurich, J.

Bioremediation is generally inhibited by co-contaminate CVOCs; with only a few specific bacterial taxa reported to metabolize or cometabolize 1,4-dioxane being unaffected. Chemical oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (H202) as a non-selective treatment demonstrated 50-80% 1,4-dioxane removal regardless of the initial CVOC concentrations. Post-oxidation bioaugmentation with 1,4-dioxane metabolizer Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190 removed the remaining 1,4-dioxane. The intrinsic microbial population, biodiversity, richness, and biomarker gene abundances decreased immediately after the brief oxidation phase, but recovery of cultivable microbiomes and a more diverse community were observed during the subsequent 9-week biodegradation phase. Results generated from the Illumina Miseq sequencing and bioinformatics analyses established that generally oxidative stress tolerant genus Ralstonia was abundant after the oxidation step, and Cupriavidus, Pseudolabrys, Afipia, and Sphingomonas were identified as dominant genera after aerobic incubation. Multidimensional analysis elucidated the separation of microbial populations as a function of time under all conditions, suggesting that temporal succession is a determining factor that is independent of 1,4-dioxane and CVOCs mixtures. Network analysis highlighted the potential interspecies competition or commensalism, and dynamics of micro biomes during the biodegradation phase, in line with the shifts of predominant genera and various developing directions during different steps of the treatment train. Collectively, this study demonstrated that chemical oxidation followed by bioaugmentation is effective for treating 1,4-dioxane, even in the presence of high levels of CVOC mixtures and residual peroxide, a disinfectant, and enhanced our understanding of microbial ecological impacts of the treatment train. These results will be valuable for predicting treatment synergies that lead to cost savings and improved remedial outcomes in short-term active remediation as well as long-term changes to the environmental microbial communities.

As these interactions often involve a fitness cost, it is unclear how stable cooperation can emerge. Here we use genome-scale metabolic models to investigate whether the release of costless metabolites (i.e. those that cause no fitness cost to the producer), can be a prominent driver of intermicrobial interactions. By performing over 2 million pairwise growth simulations of 24 species in a combinatorial assortment of environments, we identify a large space of metabolites that can be secreted without cost, thus generating ample cross-feeding opportunities. In addition to providing an atlas of putative interactions, we show that anoxic conditions can promote mutualisms by providing more opportunities for exchange of costless metabolites, resulting in an overrepresentation of stable ecological network motifs. These results may help identify interaction patterns in natural communities and inform the design of synthetic microbial consortia.","[Pacheco, Alan R.; Segre, Daniel] Boston Univ, Grad Program Bioinformat, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Pacheco, Alan R.; Segre, Daniel] Boston Univ, Biol Design Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Moel, Mauricio; Segre, Daniel] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Segre, Daniel] Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Segre, Daniel] Boston Univ, Dept Phys, 590 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Segre, D (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Grad Program Bioinformat, Boston, MA 02215 USA.; Segre, D (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Biol Design Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA.; Segre, D (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.; Segre, D (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA.; Segre, D (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Phys, 590 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",dsegre@bu.edu,,"Segre, Daniel/0000-0003-4859-1914; pacheco quispe, alan/0000-0002-5112-1430; Pacheco, Alan/0000-0002-1128-3232","National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Gilliam FellowshipHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [HR0011515303, HR0011-15-C-0091]; U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0004962, DE-SC0012627]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5R01DE024468, R01GM121950, Sub_P30DK036836_PF]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1457695, NSFOCE-BSF 1635070]; MURI GrantMURI [W911NF-12-1-0390]; Human Frontiers Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RGP0020/2016]; Boston University Inter-disciplinary Biomedical Research Office; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [R01DE024468] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM121950] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Dr. Niels Klitgord for pioneering ideas that inspired launch of this work.

Here we analyzed how belowground interactions for water shift under warming and drought, and associated impacts on plant functions. In a semi-arid woodland, adult trees (pinon and juniper) and perennial grasses (blue grama) were exposed to warming and precipitation reduction. After 6 years of continuous treatment exposure, soil and plant water isotopic composition was measured to assess plant water uptake depths and community-level water source partitioning. Warming and drought modified plant water uptake depths. Under warming, contrasting changes in water sources between grasses and trees reduced belowground water source partitioning, resulting in higher interspecific competition for water. Under drought, shifts in trees and grass water sources to deeper soil layers resulted in the maintenance of the naturally occurring water source partitioning among species. Trees showed higher water stress, and reduced water use and photosynthesis in response to warming and drought. This case study demonstrates that neighboring plants shift their competitive interactions for water under prolonged warming and drought, but regardless of whether changes in moisture sources will result in increased competition among species or maintained partitioning of water resources, these competitive adaptations may easily be overridden by climate extremes.","[Grossiord, Charlotte; Sevanto, Sanna; Borrego, Isaac; Ryan, Max] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Bonal, Damien] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Silva, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Dawson, Todd E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Stable Isotope Biogeochem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dawson, Todd E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Wenzhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Environm Evolut & Regulat, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenzhi; McDowell, Nate G.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Earth Syst Sci Div, Richland, WA 99354 USA","Grossiord, C (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",cgrossiord@lanl.gov,"wang, wenzhi/H-5670-2011; Sevanto, Sanna/ABE-6310-2020","wang, wenzhi/0000-0002-9921-2091; Sevanto, Sanna/0000-0001-9127-5285; Borrego, Isaac/0000-0003-1007-8963; Grossiord, Charlotte/0000-0002-9113-3671","Los Alamos National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)Los Alamos National Laboratory; Pacific Northwest National Labs LDRD program; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)","C.G. was supported by a Director's Fellowship from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

In threatened species, such studies are essential for establishing effective conservation measures across the range. We analysed factors potentially influencing breeding in a declining peripheral population of a long-lived bird, the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra). We assessed reproductive success and the effects of infra- and interspecific competition, as well as predation by recording events at nests by remote cameras (camera traps and a webcam). Productivity of storks was low (1.1 fledglings per occupied nest) compared to the other parts of the range and resulted mainly from the lower proportion of successful nests (37% of occupied nests). The main reason for low breeding success was the occupancy ofmany nests (35%) by single non-reproductive birds. Breeders were often visited by non-local conspecifics, which harassed local birds but only seldomly caused direct damage. Impact of predators and interspecific nest-competitors on reproductive success was low. We suggest that many individuals have disappeared from the breeding population and shortage of mates is currently the most important factor lowering reproductive success of the Black Stork at its northern range margin. This mechanism could also limit the peripheral abundance and distribution in other long-lived birds.","[Konovalov, Annika; Vali, Ulo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Nellis, Rein; Nellis, Renno; Nurmla, Am; Sellis, Urmas; Vali, Ulo] Eagle Club, EE-63406 Valgjarve Vald, Polvamaa, Estonia; [Nellis, Rein] Estonian Environm Agcy, Mustamae Tee 33, EE-10616 Tallinn, Estonia","Vali, U (corresponding author), Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.; Vali, U (corresponding author), Eagle Club, EE-63406 Valgjarve Vald, Polvamaa, Estonia.",ulo.vali@emu.ee,"Vali, Ulo/G-8253-2017","Vali, Ulo/0000-0002-2247-0658","Estonian Environmental Board [IUT21-1]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia","Many people helped to set up and maintain cameras; even more people were following the web-camera online and participated in data gathering in a special web-based forum.

A total of 848 stomachs of five species of Astyanax were analyzed. Algae. terrestrial plant and fruit/seed were the most consumed resources. Astyanax bifasciatus and A. dissimilis had predominantly herbivorous diets, A. gymnodontus and A. lacustris were omnivorous, and A. minor was mainly algivorous. Permutational analysis of variance showed the species had different diets, and similarity percentage analysis indicated that fruit/seed and terrestrial plant contributed the most to this differentiation. A paired comparison indicated that the trophic breadth of A. gymnodontus differed from that of other species. The food overlap was low for 55% of Astyanax pairs. These results showed alignment with the niche theory, in which differentiation in the use of food resources facilitates the coexistence of species and minimizes competition. These adjustments to coexistence become relevant in the context of endemic species in a highly isolated basin under intense threat (dams, species introduction, deforestation, and pollution) as is the case for the Iguacu River basin.","[Pini, Suelen F.

The mean air temperature in spring (below -8 degrees C and above 4 degrees C) and the maximum air temperature in February (below -4 degrees C and above 0 degrees C) are the major limiting abiotic factors for the species. Therefore, the abundance of F. latifolia is highest in mountainous areas of the Western Caucasus with a warmer climate.

A good model of co-occurrence mechanisms is developed among predatory animals along a pollution gradient, where shared resources become more limited in more contaminated areas and the energy budget for detoxification is much higher. Community disassembly by heavy metal pollution may occur when the presence of toxic elements shifts patterns of species co-occurrence from structured to random. On the other hand, limited resources on a pollution gradient should lead to higher competition between dominant species. Disassembly may entail the loss of existing co-evolved interactions among species, which has ramifications for community dynamics and the quality of the functioning of polluted ecosystems. We expect an assemblage dominated by competitive species interactions to exhibit a significant segregation of taxa, whereas one dominated by mutualistic or syntrophic interactions would exhibit an aggregation of taxa. Responses of Carabidae co-occurrence patterns and changes in body size measures to heavy metal concentrations were investigated in a zinc contamination gradient in a Scots pine forest in the vicinity of Olkusz (southern Poland), at 12 study sites. The zinc concentration in the humus layer varied between 108 mg ke dw to 6150 mg kg' dw. We used the C-score index, between all possible species pairs in a matrix. The ground beetle assemblages from the reference sites showed a significant segregation pattern. Community disassembly occurred only among assemblages in heavily polluted sites. The average value of skewness and kurtosis were significantly higher in the highly contaminated sites, indicating the greater proportion of small-bodied species in contaminated areas. The Gini coefficient was highest in the low contaminated sites, indicating the body-size inequality of carabid assemblages was greatest in the uncontaminated areas. Our data suggest that increased pollution contributes to the extinction of sensitive forest specialists with large body size and higher competitive abilities, leading to replacement by less sensitive generalists, with smaller body size and that the co-occurrence of species on heavily polluted sites is a result of unstable interactions between species in communities.","[Kedzior, R.] Univ Agr, Dept Ecol Climatol & Air Protect, Krakow, Poland; [Kosewska, A.] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Entomol Phytopathol & Mol Diagnost, Prawochenskiego 17, PL-10687 Olsztyn, Poland; [Skalski, T.] Jan Kochanowski Univ Humanities & Sci, Inst Biol, Kielce, Poland","Kedzior, R (corresponding author), Univ Agr, Dept Ecol Climatol & Air Protect, Krakow, Poland.",r.kedzior@ur.krakow.pl,,"Kedzior, Renata/0000-0001-8075-5734", [DS-3337/KEKiOP],This study was supported by DS-3337/KEKiOP.,,55,2,2,1,34,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",1585-8553,1588-2756,,COMMUNITY ECOL,Community Ecol.,DEC,2018,19,2,,,,,148,155,,10.1556/168.2018.19.2.7,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV5ZA,WOS:000446184200007,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-21,

The problem is that local demographic stochasticity generates eco-evolutionary dynamics that are generally too complicated to make tractable analytical investigations. Here we circumvent this problem by approximating the selection gradient on a quantitative trait that influences local community dynamics, assuming that such dynamics are deterministic with a stable fixed point. The model nonetheless captures unavoidable kin selection effects arising from demographic stochasticity. Our approximation reveals that selection depends on how an individual expressing a trait change influences (1) its own fitness and the fitness of its current relatives and (2) the fitness of its downstream relatives through modifications of local ecological conditions (i.e., through ecological inheritance). Mathematically, the effects of ecological inheritance on selection are captured by dispersal-limited versions of press perturbations of community ecology. We use our approximation to investigate the evolution of helping within species and harming between species when these behaviors influence demography. We find that altruistic helping evolves more readily when intraspecific competition is for material resources rather than for space, because in this case the costs of kin competition tend to be paid by downstream relatives. Similarly, altruistic harming between species evolves when it alleviates downstream relatives from interspecific competition. Beyond these examples, our approximation can help better understand the influence of ecological inheritance on a variety of eco-evolutionary dynamics in metacommunities, from consumer-resource and predator-prey coevolution to selection on mating systems with demographic feedbacks.","[Mullon, Charles; Lehmann, Laurent] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Mullon, C (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",charles.mullon@unil.ch,,,Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PP00P3-123344],"We thank James Rodger for a useful discussion on dispersal evolution.

We investigated the individual and spatial patterns in the feeding of two dominant zooplanktivorous clupeids-herring Clupea harengus membras and sprat Sprattus sprattus-in the Baltic Sea in summer, by means of a taxonomic analysis of stomach content. Both species consumed predominantly the small-sized copepods (Temora longicornis, Eurytemora affinis, and Acartia spp.). E. affinis and T. longicornis were generally positively selected by both species. Centropages hamatus was selected only by sprat. With the exception of Pleopis/ Podon spp. in the case of small sprat, the remaining prey, i. e. the zooplankton taxa that were found in fish stomachs, were consumed at similar proportions as they occurred in zooplankton. Stomach fullness of fish increased with the increasing proportions of prey in the zooplankton community. The share of empty stomachs was lower for sprat, and among smaller fish in both species. Pairwise dietary overlap between fish decreased when zooplankton diversity increased. Dietary overlap was also lowest among the individuals of sprat, probably due to the wider diet spectrum and diversity of stomach content compared to herring. Our results point to high interspecific competition, where sprat seems to be more successful than herring in finding and consuming prey, and therefore may have an advantage over herring when the zooplankton community is dominated by small-sized taxa.","[Ojaveer, Henn; Lankov, Ain; Klais, Riina] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80032 Parnu, Estonia; [Raid, Tiit; Pollumae, Arno] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia","Ojaveer, H (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80032 Parnu, Estonia.",henn.ojaveer@ut.ee,"Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016","Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Klais-Peets, Riina/0000-0003-2895-1273","BONUS - European Union [Art 185]; Estonian Research Council [2012-60]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [SF0180005s10]","We thank Sally Clink for language editing.

However, the performance prediction of CBM is very complex due to its specific production behavior. In the case of the coalbed methane formations two-phase flow, which is caused mainly by hydraulic fracturing process occurs. Discussed production system is more complicated than single-phase flow and finding the relationship between produced gas and produced water is required. In this paper, we propose a novel mathematical model for two-phase flow phenomena in CBM reservoirs. The proposed model uses analogies to natural competition processes and is based on the Lotka-Volterra model, which is one of the most popular populations dynamics model. We implement set of two logistic equations with additional term for the purpose of gas and water production forecasting and modeling their declines curves. This set of two ordinary differential equations was originally used to model dynamics of populations, which compete to each other. Both interspecies and intraspecies interactions are considered in the proposed mathematical model. The developed model was validated by some simulated and field examples. The proposed model was firstly used to match the production history data (gas and water flow rates) in order to estimate the model parameters. These parameters were then used to predict the two-phase CBM production. The obtained results show a good match between the production data and created decline curves based on the proposed model. Therefore, the developed model can be used as a helpful tool in predicting the CBM two-phase production.","[Stopa, Jerzy; Mikolajczak, Edyta] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Drilling Oil & Gas, Al Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland","Mikolajczak, E (corresponding author), AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Drilling Oil & Gas, Al Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",stopa@agh.edu.pl; mikolajczak@agh.edu.pl,"Stopa, Jerzy M/V-7326-2018; Kuk, Edyta/A-6849-2018","Kuk, Edyta/0000-0003-3298-7359",statutory research program of AGH University of Science and Technology [11.11.190.555],Work performed within the statutory research program of AGH University of Science and Technology No. 11.11.190.555.,,37,2,3,3,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-4105,1873-4715,,J PETROL SCI ENG,J.

However, our understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is still emerging on tropical coral reefs [2], where reef-building corals form highly productive assemblages [3, 4] and species respond in different ways to their neighbors [5] and their environment (e.g., water flow) [6]. Experimental coral communities were assembled to quantify the performance of coral colonies with and without neighbors and in the presence of conspecifics versus heterospecifics. Under higher flow, we identified a positive effect of coral species richness on primary productivity (gross and net photosynthesis) indicated by a 53% increase in productivity in multispecies assemblages (2-4 species) relative to monocultures. Productivity in monocultures was predicted by surface areas associated with different species morphologies. In contrast, multispecies assemblages maintained high levels of productivity even in the absence of the most productive species, reflecting non-additive effects of species richness on community functioning. Assemblage performances were regulated by positive and negative interactions between colonies, with many colonies performing better among heterospecific neighbors than in isolation (facilitation). Facilitation occurred primarily among flow-sensitive taxa with simple morphologies and did not occur under lower flow, suggesting that modifications to flow microclimates by corals generated beneficial, interspecific interactions. Our results show that competition and facilitation among neighbors may be important mechanisms regulating coral assemblage productivity in variable environments. Furthermore, shifts in the diversity and identity of neighbors can impair these interactions, with potentially widespread consequences for coral community functioning.","[McWilliam, Mike; Chase, Tory J.; Hoogenboom, Mia O.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, ARC, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Chase, Tory J.; Hoogenboom, Mia O.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McWilliam, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, ARC, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",michael.mcwilliam@my.jcu.edu.au,"Hoogenboom, Mia O/D-3664-2012; McWilliam, Mike/AAB-1179-2019; Chase, Tory/ABF-9222-2020","Hoogenboom, Mia O/0000-0003-3709-6344; Chase, Tory/0000-0002-2044-136X; McWilliam, Mike/0000-0001-5748-0859",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council,"We are grateful to the staff at Orpheus Island Research station and Daniel Roberts, Molly Scott, and Margaux Hein for their assistance when conducting the experiment.

Eichhornia produces N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine (PNA), a compound which can inhibit algae. However, the impact of PNA on allelopathic effects of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa on other phytoplankton species is not clear. In this study, we tested whether PNA can influence the allelopathic effect of M. aeruginosa on the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda. S. quadricauda was more sensitive to PNA than M. aeruginosa, with 72 h-EC50 values of 0.42 and 3.66 mg L-1, respectively. In addition, PNA significantly enhanced allelopathy by M. aeruginosa on S. quadricauda. Consequently, PNA had a greater impact on the green algae when Microcystis was present. In complex ecosystems with multiple species that release allelopathic substances, unintended interspecific interactions may occur, where allelopathy plays an important role under artificial or even natural contexts. It is hard to predict the competition outcomes among allelopathic organisms in these complex ecosystems, therefore a precautionary approach is required for biological control of algae.","[Pei, Ying; Liu, Lei; Xu, Runbing; Wang, Bolin; Li, Chengbin; Chang, Xuexiu] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hilt, Sabine] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany","Chang, XX (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",hilt@igb-berlin.de; changxx@ynu.edu.cn,"Hilt, Sabine/C-4783-2011",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31260138]; Action Plans for Yunnan University Service to Yunnan Province [2016MS18],"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31260138) and the Action Plans for Yunnan University Service to Yunnan Province (2016MS18).

Nevertheless, such dynamics are seldom considered, especially for diverse tropical networks. Here, we evaluated the temporal variation of four plant-pollinator networks in two seasonal ecosystems in Central Brazil (Cerrado and Pantanal). Data were gathered on a monthly basis over 1year for each network. We characterized seasonal and temporal shifts in plant-pollinator interactions, using temporally discrete networks. We predicted that the greater floral availability in the rainy season would allow for finer partitioning of the floral niche by the pollinators, i.e. higher specialization patterns as previously described across large spatial gradients. Finally, we also evaluated how sampling restricted to peak flowering period may affect the characterization of the networks. Contrary to our expectations, we found that dry season networks, although characterized by lower floral resource richness and abundance, showed higher levels of network-wide interaction partitioning (complementary specialization and modularity). For nestedness, though, this between-seasons difference was not consistent. Reduced resource availability in the dry season may promote higher interspecific competition among pollinators leading to reduced niche overlap, thus explaining the increase in specialization. There were no consistent differences between seasons in species-level indices, indicating that higher network level specialization is an emergent property only seen when considering the entire network. However, bees presented higher values of specialization and species strength in relation to other groups such as flies and wasps, suggesting that some plant species frequently associated with bees are used only by this group. Our study also indicates that targeted data collection during peak flowering generates higher estimates of network specialization, possibly because species activity spans longer periods than the targeted time frame. Hence, depending on the period of data collection, different structural values for the networks of interactions may be found.Synthesis. Plant-pollinator networks from tropical environments have structural properties that vary according to seasons, which should be taken into account in the description of the complex systems of interactions between plants and their pollinators in these areas.","[Souza, Camila S.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Programa Pos Grad Ecol & Conservacao, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Maruyama, Pietro K.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Aoki, Camila] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Aquidauana, MS, Brazil; [Aoki, Camila] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Programa Pos Grad Recursos Nat, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Sigrist, Maria R.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Lab Polinizacao Reprod & Fenol Plantas, InBio, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Raizer, Josue] Fundacao Univ Fed Grande Dourados, Programa Pos Grad Ecol & Conservacao, Dourados, MS, Brazil; [Gross, Caroline L.] Univ New England, Ecosyst Management, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [de Araujo, Andrea C.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Ecol Lab, Inst Biociencias, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil","Souza, CS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Programa Pos Grad Ecol & Conservacao, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",souza.camila.bio@gmail.com,"Raizer, Josue/I-8553-2012; Raizer, Josue/AAW-2059-2021; Araujo, Andrea Cardoso/D-9439-2013; Maruyama, Pietro Kiyoshi/I-9561-2016; Souza, Camila/N-9292-2016","Raizer, Josue/0000-0002-3623-4437; Raizer, Josue/0000-0002-3623-4437; Araujo, Andrea Cardoso/0000-0003-0394-2012; Maruyama, Pietro Kiyoshi/0000-0001-5492-2324; Souza, Camila/0000-0003-0856-9392; Sigrist, Maria Rosangela/0000-0003-1971-3564; Gross, Caroline/0000-0001-8014-1548","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2015/21457-4]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Fundacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do SulFundacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT MS); Rufford Foundation [RSG: 21366-1]","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, Grant/Award Number: FAPESP proc. 2015/21457-4; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior; Fundacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul; Rufford Foundation, Grant/Award Number: RSG: 21366-1",,87,33,34,2,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The studied species are spotted seabass Dicentrarchus punctatus (Moronidae), common sole Solea solea (Soleidae), flounder Platichthys fiesus (Pleuronectidae), common goby Pomatoschistus microps and sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus (Gobiidae). The macrozoobenthos was simultaneously sampled in order to explore the trophic use of estuarine habitats by teleosts. Except gobies, teleosts show a high feeding activity and diets are characterized by a wide diversity of prey and a spatial variation. Ragworm (Hediste diversicolor, Nereididae), brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, Crangonidae) and mudshrimp (Corophium volutator, Corophiidae) are the most common prey items. Spatial sharing of macrozoobenthic resources by teleosts occurs and trophic overlap is limited, indicating that competition for trophic resources is minimized, especially in the intertidal area where resources are abundant. Differences between the availability of potential preys and teleost diet show that most teleosts do not feed on the most abundant resources in the habitat but on preys with the highest individual biomass value (and possibly the highest energy content) despite their scarcity. This possibly indicates high mobility, habitat connectivity and low fidelity for estuarine habitats. Only the common sole predominantly fed on local prey, which conversely might indicate a narrow range of movement and reduced feeding area for this species.","[Coiraton, Claire; Selleslagh, Jonathan] Ctr Bordeaux, UR EABX, Irstea, 50 Ave Verdun Gazinet, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Selleslagh, Jonathan] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, Stn Marine Arcachon, UMR EPOC 5805, 2 Rue Prof Jolyet, F-33120 Arcachon, France; [Coiraton, Claire] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Av Joel Montes Camarena S-N, Mazatlan 82040, Sinaloa, Mexico","Coiraton, C (corresponding author), Ctr Bordeaux, UR EABX, Irstea, 50 Ave Verdun Gazinet, F-33612 Cestas, France.; Coiraton, C (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Av Joel Montes Camarena S-N, Mazatlan 82040, Sinaloa, Mexico.",claire.coiraton@gmail.com; jonathan.selleslagh@irstea.fr,,,Irstea; CPER Estuaire project - Fond Europeen FEDER; Region AquitaineRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine,"This study was supported by Irstea and the CPER Estuaire project, funded by the Fond Europeen FEDER and the Region Aquitaine.

Here we use on-animal data loggers to assess whether such trade-offs can be revealed by the breathing rates (BR) and timing of breaths in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephela melas). We used the period immediately following foraging dives in particular, for which respiratory behavior can be expected to be optimized for gas exchange. Breath times and fluke strokes were detected using onboard sensors (pressure, 3-axis acceleration) attached to animals using suction cups. The number and timing of breaths were quantified in non-linear mixed models that incorporated serial correlation and individual as a random effect. We found that pilot whales increased their BR in the 5-10 min period prior to, and immediately following, dives that exceeded 31 m depth. While pre-dive BRs did not vary with dive duration, the initial post-dive BR was linearly correlated with duration of >2 min dives, with BR then declining exponentially. Apparent net diving costs were 1.7 (SE 0.2) breaths per min of diving (post-dive number of breaths, above pre-dive breathing rate unrelated to dive recovery). Every fluke stroke was estimated to cost 0.086 breaths, which amounted to 80-90% average contribution of locomotion to the net diving costs. After accounting for fluke stroke rate, individuals in the small body size class took a greater number of breaths per diving minute. Individuals reduced their breathing rate (from the rate expected by diving behavior) by 13-16% during playbacks of killer whale sounds and their first exposure to 1-2 kHz naval sonar, indicating similar responses to interspecific competitor/predator and anthropogenic sounds. Although we cannot rule out individuals increasing their per-breath O-2 uptake to match metabolic demand, our results suggest that behavioral responses to experimental sound exposures were not associated with increased metabolic rates in a stress response, but metabolic rates instead appear to decrease. Our results support the hypothesis that maximal performance leads to predictable (optimized) breathing patterns, which combined with further physiological measurements could improve proxies of field metabolic rates and per-stroke energy costs from animal-borne behavior data.","[Isojunno, Saana; Miller, Patrick James O'Malley] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Aoki, Kagari] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan; [Cure, Charlotte] UMRAE, Cerema Ifsttar, Strasbourg, France; [Kvadsheim, Petter Helgevold] Norwegian Def Res Estab, Horten, Norway","Isojunno, S (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",si66@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Waxler, Robert/S-4345-2018","isojunno, saana/0000-0002-2212-2135","NL Ministry of Defence; FR Ministry of Defence (DGA) [15860052]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; NOR Ministry of Defence; United States Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-08-1-0984, N00014-10-1-0355, N00014-14-1-0390]","This work was funded by NL Ministry of Defence, NOR Ministry of Defence, United States Office of Naval Research (N00014-08-1-0984, N00014-10-1-0355, and N00014-14-1-0390), and FR Ministry of Defence (DGA) (public market no 15860052).

By biological remediation approach (addition of predators or competitors), it may alter the ecological relationships between the dominant algae and their associated populations in ecosystems. However, it cannot quantify the indirect effects of this approach and the long-term and system-level ecological consequences are hard to assess. Here we focus on the bloom areas of the Ulansuhai Lake in Inner Mongolia. Based on historic data, field monitoring and experimental data, we constructed a quantitative phosphorus cycle network model. Using Ecological Network Analysis (ENA), we evaluated how indirect flow influences dominant algal species and alters network control and utility relationships. Results indicate that: (1) Indirect flows have strong influence on the mutual and control relationships between blooming algae and its related functional groups in the Ulansuhai Lake; (2) Some opposite interspecific relationships between the blooming algae and other functional components have been found by ENA; (3) Key populations controlling the blooming algae are observed from the intuitive Zooplankton and Detritus to network-based Microorganisms, Zoobenthos, Zooplankton and Detritus(water). The research results indicate the importance of including indirect relationship into the control of lake algae bloom.

Thus, understanding important habitat features for marine mammals that depend on sea ice, such as narwhal (Monodon monoceros), during winter will provide insight into impacts of future changes within the pack ice. The objective of this study was to determine narwhal habitat selection for bathymetry, sea ice concentration, thickness, and floe size during the winter season. Nineteen narwhals were equipped with SPLASH tags in Admiralty Inlet and Eclipse Sound (2009-2011), with 50% of the transmitters lasting until April allowing for analysis of the entire winter season. Generalized linear mixed models indicated that both sexes selected similar bathymetric habitat likely corresponding to higher prey densities of Greenland halibut. This preference for prey habitat occurred regardless of the mobile pack ice structure or amount of open water at the ocean surface. In addition, we found evidence of a potential relationship between increased winter movements and decreased ice extent over the 2009-2011 period. Together these findings suggest that changes to sea ice structure likely will not negatively impact narwhal directly in the winter. However, indirect effects of changing sea ice, such as changing prey densities and distribution, increased presence of killer whales (Orcinus orca) as predators, increased interspecies competition for prey, and increased anthropogenic activities could influence winter habitat selection of narwhal. In conclusion, the extensive winter movements indicate that narwhal may be more flexible in their selection of winter habitat than previously believed.","[Kenyon, Krista A.; Barber, David] Univ Manitoba, Ctr Earth Observat Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Yurkowski, David J.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Orr, Jack; Ferguson, Steven H.] Freshwater Inst, Dept Fisheries & Oceans, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","Kenyon, KA (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Ctr Earth Observat Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",krista.kenyon@hotmail.com,,"Yurkowski, David/0000-0003-2264-167X",World Wildlife Fund Canada [G-1215141-02-D]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of Manitoba [45525]; Fisheries and Oceans Canada; Canada Excellence Research Chair; Canada Research ChairNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs; Arctic Science Partnership; Center of Earth Observation Science; W.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the type of concealment of a decomposing resource and the permeability of the material used affect to different extents the animals attracted to the resource. To this end, beetle assemblages were documented for 100 days on 15 domestic pig carcasses, placed individually in soft shell suitcases, trashcans with a hinged lid, and sealable drums in an untended open field in New Brunswick, Canada. Five pigs were allocated to each treatment. During the study, almost 33,000 beetle occurrences from 50 recognizable taxonomic units were documented around containers that concealed carcasses. Results indicated that trashcans, drums, and suitcases had different effects on the patterns of beetle arrival and departure from the vicinity of concealed carcasses, on beetle assembly, on their breeding strategies, as well as on the interspecific relationships between beetles of forensic importance. Of the 50 recognizable taxonomic units, only six species exhibited a somewhat predictable occurrence and yielded information about the time of placement or the type of container. Results also suggested that some of the abundant Silphidae species opted to breed or feed in suboptimal conditions or at a later period to avoid competing with the dominant silphid Necrodes surinamensis (Fabr.). This suggests the occurrence of preferential colonization and/or asymmetrical competition between beetle species, which would affect the potential of these species for PMImin estimations on concealed carcasses.

A neglected idea is that geographic phenotypic variation in a host plant may lead to heterogeneous evolutionary responses of the different members of the associated communities. This could result in diversification on a host plant by ecological speciation in some species, leading to geographic variation in community composition. In this study we investigated geographic variation of inflorescence receptacle size in a plant, Ficus hirta, and how the hymenopteran community feeding in the inflorescences has responded. Our predictions were: 1) Inflorescence size variation affects wasp species differently depending on how they access oviposition sites. 2) In some affected lineages of wasps, we may observe vicariant, parapatric species adapted to different inflorescence sizes. Results: We show that fig (the enclosed inflorescence of Ficus) wall thickness varies geographically. The fig entering pollinating wasp was not affected, while the parasites ovipositing through the fig wall were. Two parapatric species of Philotrypesis, exhibiting strikingly different ovipositor lengths, were recorded. One species of Sycoscapter was also present, and it was restricted, like the shorter-ovipositor Philotrypesis, to the geographic zone where fig walls were thinner. Conclusions: Previous work on fig wasps suggested that parapatric geographic ranges among congenerics were due to adaptation to variation in abiotic factors, complemented by interspecific competition. Our results show that parapatric ranges may also result from adaptation to variation in biotic factors. Within an insect community, differences among species in their response to geographic phenotypic variation of their host plant may result in geographically heterogeneous community structure. Such heterogeneity leads to heterogeneous interaction networks among sites. Our results support the hypothesis that plant geographic phenotypic variation can be a driver of diversification in associated insect communities, and can complement other diversification processes.","[Yu, Hui; Liang, Dan; Tian, Enwei; Zheng, Linna] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Hui; Liang, Dan; Tian, Enwei; Zheng, Linna] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resources Conservat & Sustainable U, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Kjellberg, Finn] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, CEFE, EPHE, IRD,CNRS,UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Yu, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Yu, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resources Conservat & Sustainable U, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yuhui@scib.ac.cn,"Kjellberg, Finn/S-3281-2019","Kjellberg, Finn/0000-0001-6708-9538","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31670395, 31630008, 31370409]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [S2013020012814]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670395; 31630008; 31370409), and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (S2013020012814).",,46,4,6,1,14,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2148,,,BMC EVOL BIOL,BMC Evol.

An important but often overlooked component of global change is the effect of anthropogenic disturbance, and how it interacts with the effects of climate to affect both species and communities, as well as interspecies interactions, such as facilitation and competition. We examined the effects of frequent human trampling disturbances on alpine plant communities in Switzerland, focusing on the elevational range of the widely distributed cushion plant Silene acaulis and the interactions of this facilitator species with other plants. Examining size distributions and densities, we found that disturbance appears to favor individual Silene growth at middle elevations. However, it has negative effects at the population level, as evidenced by a reduction in population density and reproductive indices. Disturbance synergistically interacts with the effects of elevation to reduce species richness at low and high elevations, an effect not mitigated by Silene. In fact, we find predominantly competitive interactions, both by Silene on its hosted and neighboring species and by neighboring (but not hosted) species on Silene. Our results indicate that disturbance can be beneficial for Silene individual performance, potentially through changes in its neighboring species community. However, possible reduced recruitment in disturbed areas could eventually lead to population declines. While other studies have shown that light to moderate disturbances can maintain high species diversity, our results emphasize that heavier disturbance reduces species richness, diversity, as well as percent cover, and adversely affects cushion plants and that these effects are not substantially reduced by plant-plant interactions. Heavily disturbed alpine systems could therefore be at greater risk for upward encroachment of lower elevation species in a warming world.","[Chardon, Nathalie Isabelle; Doak, Daniel Forest] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Chardon, Nathalie Isabelle; Wipf, Sonja; Rixen, Christian; Beilstein, Annabarbara] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Mt Ecosyst, Davos, Switzerland; [Beilstein, Annabarbara] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland","Chardon, NI (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",nathalie.chardon@colorado.edu,"Wipf, Sonja/A-5075-2010","Wipf, Sonja/0000-0002-3492-1399; Chardon, Nathalie/0000-0001-9120-4778",Botanical Society of Switzerland; Zeno Karl Schindler Foundation,Botanical Society of Switzerland; Zeno Karl Schindler Foundation,,59,8,8,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Most eco-geomorphic models have been developed based on the changing biomass of a single species (e.g., Spartina alterniflora) through time; therefore, it still remains a challenge to predict how a vegetation cover consisting of multiple species will change through interspecific competition and facilitation under sea-level variations. In a temperate marsh of the Danish Wadden Sea, the plant species composition across a total of 402 quadrats (1 m(2)) was compared between 2006 and 2012 using multivariate ordination techniques. At low-elevation sites (< 0.8 m Danish Ordnance Zero), where many stress-tolerant species coexisted in 2006, the direction of vegetation changes was dominantly progressive, indicating decreases in stress-tolerant plants and increases in high-marsh competitors over the 6-year study interval. In contrast, whenever the competitive shrubby species Atriplex portulacoides was dominant in 2006 (> 80% relative proportion), the rate of vegetation change was nearly zero, due to little encroachment of other species into this already stable, dense matrix. These discussions imply that the direction and rate of multi-species interactions can be predicted by the initial environmental (i.e., marsh surface elevation, soil bulk density, distance from tidal creek) and biological conditions (i.e., plant species richness and abundance). Based on these findings, it is proposed that the evolution of salt marshes will be better understood by more explicit incorporation of multi-species interactions into future eco-geomorphic modeling efforts.","[Kim, Daehyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, Biogeomorphol Res & Anal Grp, Seoul 08826, South Korea","Kim, D (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, Biogeomorphol Res & Anal Grp, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",biogeokim@snu.ac.kr,,,National Science Foundation of the USANational Science Foundation (NSF) [0825753]; National Research Foundation of South Korea [NRF-2017R1C1B5076922]; Research Resettlement Fund for the new faculty of Seoul National University; 4-Zero Land Space Creation of the Ministry of Education; NRF [1345258304],"Financial support was provided by (1) the National Science Foundation (#0825753) of the USA, (2) the National Research Foundation of South Korea (NRF-2017R1C1B5076922), (3) the Research Resettlement Fund for the new faculty of Seoul National University, and (4) the 4-Zero Land Space Creation of the Ministry of Education and the NRF (#1345258304).",,63,1,1,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,JUL,2018,41,5,,,,,1370,1380,,10.1007/s12237-018-0377-8,,,11,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,GH8KD,WOS:000433916300011,,,,,2021-09-21,

Pinus tabulaeformis forest, Betula platyphylla forest, Betula albo-sinensis forest, Larix principis-rupprechtii forest in the Xiaowutai Mountain were selected as research objects, and four 50mx50m quadrats were set up. We measured diameter at breast height (DBH) and location of trees, and analyzed population structure, spatial distribution pattern, intraspecific and interspecific associations of dominant tree species in four forest communities by point pattern analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation test, in order to provide a theoretical basis and development strategies for natural resource protection in the areas. The results showed that a total of 166 vascular plant species in 49 families were recorded in quadrats. Betula platyphylla had the largest average and maximum of DBH among all plant species. Betula albo-sinensis had the largest average tree height, while Betula platyphylla had the maximum tree height among all plant species. Pinus tabulaeformis presented random distribution within 13.5m and cluster distribution outside 13.5m. Betula platyphylla presented random distribution on all the scales. Betula albo-sinensis and Larix principis-rupprechtii presented cluster distribution on the small scales and random distribution on the larger scales. The study also revealed that Betula platyphylla and Acer mono on the scale of 2.4m-22.5m, and Betula albo-sinensis and Sorbus alnifolia on the scale of 3.5m-7.5m had a significant negative correlation. Furthermore, Pinus tabulaeformis and Larix principis-rupprechtii were expanding populations mainly affected by intraspecific competition. Betula platyphylla and Betula albo-sinensis were stable populations respectively affected by interspecific competition, intraspecific and interspecific competition. Spatial distribution and species associations of four forest types were regulated by dispersal limitation and environmental heterogeneity in the Xiaowutai Mountain.

However, it is now accepted that SADs alone are not sufficient to reveal biological mechanisms. Recent attention focuses on the relative importance of stochastic dispersal processes versus deterministic processes such as interspecific competition and environmental filtering. Here, we combine a study of the commonness and rarity of species (i.e. the SAD) with mechanistic processes underlying community composition. By comparing the occurrence frequencies of each and every species with its abundance, we quantify the relative contributions of common and rare species to the maintenance of community structure. Essentially, we relate the continuum between commonness and rarity with that of niches and neutrality. An individual-based, spatially explicit model was used to simulate local communities in niche spaces with the same parameters. We generated sets of assemblages from which species were eliminated in opposing sequences: from common to rare and from rare to common, and investigated the relationship between the abundance and frequency of species. We tested the predictions of our model with empirical data from a field experiment in the environmentally homogeneous alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Our simulations support the widespread notion that common species maintain community structure, while rare species maintain species diversity, in both local and regional communities. Our results, both from theoretical simulations and from empirical observations, revealed positive correlations between the abundance of a particular species and its occurrence frequency. SAD curves describe a continuum between commonness and rarity. Removing species from the 'rare' end of this continuum has little effect on the similarity of communities, but removing species from the 'common' end of the continuum causes significant increases in beta diversity, or species turnover, between communities. In local communities distributed in a homogenous habitat, species located at the 'common' end of the continuum should be selected by environmental filtering, with niche space partitioning governed by interspecific competition. Conversely, species located at the 'rare' end of the continuum are most likely subject to stochastic dispersal processes. Species situated at intermediate locations on this continuum are therefore determined by niche and neutral processes acting together. Our results suggest that, in homogeneous habitats, SAD curves describing the common-rare continuum may also be used to describe the continuum between niches and neutrality.","[Wang, Xianzhi] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, 768 Jiayuguan Rd, Lanzhou 730020, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Ellwood, M.

It is found that the properties of the two species'isoclines determine the interaction of species, leading to six regimes in the phase diagram of interspecies interaction; i.e., there are six different interspecific relationships described by the LV model. Four regimes allow for nontrivial species coexistence, among which it is found that three of them are stable, namely, weak competition, mutualism, and predator-prey scenarios can lead to win-win coexistence situations. The Lyapunov function for general nontrivial two-species coexistence is also constructed. Furthermore, in the presence of spatial diffusion of the species, the dynamics can lead to steady wavefront propagation and can alter the population map. Propagating wavefront solutions in one dimension are investigated analytically and by numerical solutions. The steady wavefront speeds are obtained analytically via nonlinear dynamics analysis and verified by numerical solutions. In addition to the inter- and intraspecific interaction parameters, the intrinsic speed parameters of each species play a decisive role in species populations and wave properties. In some regimes, both species can copropagate with the same wave speeds in a finite range of parameters. Our results are further discussed in the light of possible biological relevance and ecological implications.","[Zhu, Haoqi; Wang, Mao-Xiang] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lai, Pik-Yin] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Phys, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan; [Lai, Pik-Yin] Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Complex Syst, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan","Wang, MX (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wangmx@njust.edu.cn; pylai@phy.ncu.edu.tw,,"Zhu, Haoqi/0000-0002-1269-7576","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST104-2112-M-008-003-MY3]; NCTS of Taiwan; NSFC of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11204132]","This work has been supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under Grant No. MOST104-2112-M-008-003-MY3, NCTS of Taiwan, and NSFC of China under Grant No. 11204132.",,45,3,3,0,3,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",2470-0045,2470-0053,,PHYS REV E,Phys.

This paradigm is expanded by the theory that niche space can also be saturated by intersexual adaptive divergence (ecological sexual dimorphism) when interspecific competition is relaxed. This theory (here termed niche-packing equivalence') predicts that the evolution of ecological sexual dimorphism constrains the ecological opportunity that would otherwise lead to ecological speciation or colonization, and that saturation of niches by different species constrains divergent selection for divergence between the sexes. Therefore, sexes and species are equivalent, yet antagonistic units of niche occupation. We present the most comprehensive test of the niche-packing equivalence theory at ecological time-scales (assemblage level) to date. Location: South America Major taxa studied: Liolaemus lizards. Methods: We identified 23 Liolaemus assemblages varying in species richness and sexual size dimorphism (SSD), distributed across a wide environmental range. We used mixed effects models, permutation tests and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) regressions to quantify the relationship between SSD and species richness. We then partitioned the body size niche dimension between the sexes and amongst species, and tested for non-overlapping body size distributions. We regressed SSD and species richness of each assemblage against environmental predictors, using multi-model inference and structural equation modelling. Results: Sexual dimorphism declines with increasing species richness, and a strong signal of tension between the two remains following phylogenetic control. This pattern is accompanied by evidence of constraints on body-size partitioning amongst species and between the sexes: the two units of niche saturation tend not to overlap. However, across assemblages, species richness and SSD correlate with different environmental variables, suggesting that their tension is context-specific. Main conclusions: Our evidence supports the prediction that sexual dimorphism and species richness are alternative outcomes of adaptive radiation. However, this antagonism is mediated by a suite of environmental predictors that influence dimorphism and species richness differentially.","[Pincheira-Donoso, Daniel] Univ Lincoln, Sch Life Sci, Lab Evolutionary Ecol Adaptat, Lincoln, Lincs, England; [Pincheira-Donoso, Daniel; Tregenza, Tom; Hodgson, David J.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Cornwall Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, Uruguay; [Butlin, Roger K.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Butlin, Roger K.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden","Pincheira-Donoso, D; Hodgson, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Cornwall Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, Uruguay.",DPincheiraDonoso@lincoln.ac.uk; D.J.Hodgson@exeter.ac.uk,"Butlin, Roger K/F-7709-2013; Tregenza, Tom/B-1078-2014","Butlin, Roger K/0000-0003-4736-0954; Tregenza, Tom/0000-0003-4182-2222",Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; University of Lincoln; NERC Standard Grant [NE/L007770/1]; NERC International Opportunities Fund [NE/N006798/1],"Leverhulme Trust; University of Lincoln; NERC Standard Grant, Grant/Award Number: NE/L007770/1; NERC International Opportunities Fund, Grant/Award Number: NE/N006798/1",,48,12,12,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

The hypothesis tested was that these two species partition available resources spatially, and that the effects of interspecific competition can be reduced by changes in the feeding strategy and using alternative resources. This study was carried out between February 2011 and January 2012, on a beach and three tidal creeks of the Mamanguape River estuary. Data on the distribution and relative abundance of the two species were collected using beach seine, with data on temperature, salinity and turbidity also recorded. The diets of the species (S. testudineus N = 399; C. psittacus N = 108) were analysed by the Index of Relative Importance (IRI). Sphoeroides testudineus was found in the entire area, but was particularly abundant in the upper estuary, while C. psittacus was captured exclusively in the upper estuary, with all individuals assumed to be juveniles. In regard to feeding, juvenile S. testudineus predated on Bivalves, Ceratopogonidae larvae, calanoids and gastropods; whilst C. psittacus showed a diet more specialized in Brachyura and Cirripedia. These results suggest that there are differences in both habitat utilization and feeding habits of these two puffer fish species in this estuary.","[Vasconcelos Araujo, Priscila Rocha] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Lab Dinam Populacoes Marinhas, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Lustosa Costa, Silvia Yasmin; Nascimento Duarte, Maria Rita; Machado Pessanha, Andre Luiz] Univ Estadual Paraiba, Dept Biol, Av Baraunas 351, Campina Grande, PB, Brazil","Pessanha, ALM (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paraiba, Dept Biol, Av Baraunas 351, Campina Grande, PB, Brazil.",andrepessanhauepb@gmail.com,"Pessanha, Andre L M/D-3514-2013; PESSANHA, ANDRE/X-7027-2019","PESSANHA, ANDRE/0000-0003-1878-6251; Nascimento Duarte, Maria Rita/0000-0003-1472-3683; Araujo, Priscila/0000-0001-7170-7968","National System of Research on Biodiversity (SISBIOTA/BRASIL); CNPq - Brazilian National Agency for Scientific and Technological Development [563202/2010-6, 477663/2011-7]",This work was partially supported by the National System of Research on Biodiversity (SISBIOTA/BRASIL) and CNPq - Brazilian National Agency for Scientific and Technological Development (Proc. 563202/2010-6 and Proc. 477663/2011-7).,,45,4,4,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Protected areas are critical for conserving large carnivores, but increasing human-wildlife conflict, tourism, and human population growth near these sanctuaries may have negative effects on the carnivores within sanctuary borders. Our goals were to investigate how anthropogenic disturbance along the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, influences the demography and space-use of two large carnivore species that engage in intense interspecific competition. Here we document, in one disturbed region of the Reserve, a rapid increase in the population size of one large predator, the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), but a striking concurrent decline in numbers of another, the African lion (Panthera leo). Anthropogenic disturbances negatively affected lion populations, and decreasing lion numbers appear to have a positive effect on hyena populations, indicated here by an increase in juvenile survivorship. We also saw an increase in the number of livestock consumed by hyenas. Our results suggest human population growth and indirect effects of human activity along Reserve boundaries may be effecting a trophic cascade inside the Reserve itself. These results indicate both top-down and bottom-up processes are causing a shift in the carnivore community, and a major disruption of guild structure, inside the boundaries of one of the most spectacular protected areas in Africa.","[Green, D.

Biodiversity is expected to decline following habitat loss and isolation, potentially impeding ecosystem function. But because greater isolation usually accompanies habitat loss, the effects of habitat amount and isolation can be confounded. Moreover, the type or quality of the intervening matrix habitat can mediate amount and isolation effects on biodiversity. We used a landscape microcosm of oak leaf litter patches to examine the responses of bacterial communities and the ecosystem function of oak leaf decomposition to patch size, degree of isolation, and matrix habitat type (pine litter or bare ground). We found that oak patch size had no significant effect on bacterial communities or decomposition rates. However, bacterial richness increased with greater patch isolation and when oak litter patches were surrounded by a matrix of pine litter, rather than bare ground. The benefit of patch isolation for biodiversity runs counter to that expected by island biogeography theory, suggesting that spatially dependent interspecific interactions, such as predation or competition, may override direct dispersal effects. Higher bacterial richness in oak litter patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix indicated that spillover from neighboring matrix habitat can increase local richness. Instead of greater bacterial richness enhancing ecosystem functioning, leaf litter decomposition was negatively correlated with bacterial richness: Decomposition was slower in isolated oak litter patches and patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix. This negative relationship may be a result of spatial dynamics that can promote the persistence of bacteria from pine litter habitats that are not well suited to oak litter decomposition. Overall, our experiment indicates that effects of habitat loss, isolation, and matrix quality on richness and composition may depend on spatially constrained interspecific interactions, which can determine the functional ability of communities.","[Spiesman, Brian J.; Inouye, Brian D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Stapper, Andres P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Otolaryngol, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Spiesman, Brian J.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Spiesman, BJ (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Spiesman, BJ (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",brianspiesman@gmail.com,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1110738],"Tania Kim aided with the setup of the study and, along with Nora Underwood and Tom Miller, provided feedback on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

It often exhibits sympatric morphotypes. Question: How do ecosystem characteristics and the life history of Arctic charr interact to generate food webs in subarctic lakes? Organisms: We focus on allometric dietary patterns of Arctic charr. We compare them with selected, co-occurring fish species, including threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) among others, and both benthic and limnetic invertebrates. Field sites: Subarctic lakes in two regions that differ greatly in colonization history (ten in Iceland and four in Alaska). Methods: We used natural variation in the stable isotope ratios delta C-13 and delta N-15 to estimate trends in trophic position and relative use of benthic and limnetic carbon sources with body size among lakes and among species x morph x body size brackets within lakes. Results: (1) In subarctic lakes with low levels of fish diversity, food chains lengthened via insertion of intermediate prey. (2) Ecosystem attributes, including the presence of competitors and competitor resource use, were associated with allometric shifts in Arctic charr resource use. (3) Species attributes, including the presence and nature of polymorphism exhibited by the Arctic charr, likewise shifted allometric trends in resource use. (4) Both the expression of resource polymorphism and interspecific interactions (i.e. predation, competition, or both) affected food web structure.","[Woods, Pamela J.; Skulason, Skuli] Holar Univ Coll, Saudarkrokur, Iceland; [Woods, Pamela J.; Snorrason, Sigurour S.] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Woods, Pamela J.; Quinn, Thomas P.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Woods, Pamela J.] Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland","Woods, PJ (corresponding author), Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",pamela.woods@hafogvatn.is,,,Icelandic Centre for Research; University of Washington (UW) Graduate School Fund for Excellence and Innovation; UW Alaska Salmon Program; Leifur Eiriksson Foundation,"This research was supported by the Icelandic Centre for Research, Leifur Eiriksson Foundation, the University of Washington (UW) Graduate School Fund for Excellence and Innovation, and the UW Alaska Salmon Program.

During fiveyears, representing three to five plant generations, we followed 16 experimental field populations of the forb, Oenothera biennis, originally planted with the same 18 original genotypes. Oenothera biennis usually self fertilizes, which, due to its genetic system (permanent translocation heterozygosity), results in seeds that are clones of the maternal plant. However, rare outcrossing produces genetically novel offspring (but without recombination or increased heterozygosity). We sought to understand whether novel genotypes produced through natural outcrossing had greater fecundity or different multigenerational dynamics compared to our original genotypes. We further assessed whether any differences in fitness or abundances through time between original and novel genotypes were exaggerated in the presence vs. absence of insect herbivores. Over the course of the experiment, we genotyped >12,500 plants using microsatellite DNA markers to identify and track the frequency of specific genotypes and estimated fecundity on a subset (>3,000) of plants. The effective outcrossing rate was 7.3% in the first year and ultimately 50% of the plants were of outcrossed origin by the final year of the experiment. Lifetime fruit production per plant was on average 32% higher across all novel genotypes produced via outcrossing compared to the original genotypes, and this fecundity advantage was significantly enhanced in populations lacking herbivores. Among 43 novel genotypes that were abundant enough to phenotype with replication, plants produced nearly 30% more fruits than the average of their specific two parental genotypes, and marginally more fruits (8%) than their most fecund parent. Mean per capita fecundity of novel genotypes predicted their relative frequencies at the end of the experiment. Novel genotypes increased more dramatically in herbivore-present compared to suppressed populations (45% vs. 27% of all plants), countering the increased competition from dandelions (Taraxacum officinale) that resulted from herbivore suppression. Increased interspecific competition likely also lead to the lower realized fitness of novel vs. original genotypes in herbivore-suppressed populations. These results demonstrate that rare outcrossing and the generation of novel genotypes can create high-fecundity progeny, with the biotic environment influencing the dynamical outcome of such advantages.","[Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Johnson, Marc T.

Previous analyses have made progress in testing these predictions and identifying underlying processes, but have also pointed to theoretical as well as methodological shortcomings. Here we applied a recently developed methodology for spatially explicit analysis of phylogenetic meta-community structure to study the pattern of co-occurrence of functional traits in Afrotropical and Neotropical bird species inhabiting forest fragments. Focusing separately on locomotory, dietary, and dispersal traits, we tested whether environmental filtering causes spatial clustering, or competition leads to spatial segregation as predicted by limiting similarity theory. We detected significant segregation of species co-occurrences in African fragments, but not in the Neotropical ones. Interspecific competition had a higher impact on trait co-occurrence than filter effects, yet no single functional trait was able to explain the observed degree of spatial segregation among species. Despite high regional variability spanning from spatial segregation to aggregation, we found a consistent tendency for a clustered spatial patterning of functional traits among communities in fragmented landscapes, particularly in non-territorial species. Overall, we show that behavioural effects, such as territoriality, and environmental effects, such as the area of forest remnants or properties of the landscape matrix in which they are embedded, can strongly affect the pattern of trait co-occurrence. Our findings suggest that trait-based analyses of community structure should include behavioural and environmental covariates, and we here provide an appropriate method for linking functional traits, species ecology and environmental conditions to clarify the drivers underlying spatial patterns of species co-occurrence.","[Ulrich, Werner] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Chair Ecol & Biogeog, Torun, Poland; [Banks-Leite, Cristina; De Coster, Greet; Tobias, Joseph A.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, London, England; [Banks-Leite, Cristina; De Coster, Greet] Univ Sao Paulo, Biosci Inst, Dept Ecol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Habel, Jan Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Munich, Germany; [Matheve, Hans; Lens, Luc] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Ghent, Belgium; [Lens, Luc] Natl Museums Kenya, Dept Zool, Nairobi, Kenya; [Newmark, William D.] Univ Utah, Nat Hist Museum Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Ulrich, W (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Chair Ecol & Biogeog, Torun, Poland.",ulrichw@umk.pl,"Banks-Leite, Cristina/D-3075-2011","Banks-Leite, Cristina/0000-0002-0091-2857; Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619; Lens, Luc/0000-0002-0241-2215; Tobias, Joseph/0000-0003-2429-6179","Polish National Science Centre [NCN 2014/13/B/NZ8/04681]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I028068/1]; Research Foundation FlandersFWO [G/0308/13N]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2012/06866-7, 2014/14746-7]","This research was partly funded by the Polish National Science Centre (grant NCN 2014/13/B/NZ8/04681 to WU), the Natural Environment Research Council (grant NE/I028068/1 to JAT), Research Foundation Flanders (grant G/0308/13N to LL), and Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP grant 2012/06866-7 and 2014/14746-7 to GDC).",,66,11,11,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2018,127,2,,,,,274,284,,10.1111/oik.04561,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FU4UM,WOS:000423848100010,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Population dynamics is a field rich in theory and poor in long-term observational data. Finding sources of long-term data is critical as ecosystems around the globe continue to change in ways that current theories and models have failed to predict. Here we show how long-term ecological data can improve our understanding about palaeo-population change in response to external environmental factors, antecedent conditions and community diversity. 2. We examined a radiometrically dated sediment core from the Didachara Mire in the mountains of south-western Georgia (Caucasus) and analysed multiple biological proxies (pollen, fern spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, charcoal, diatoms, chrysophyte cysts, midges, mites and testate amoebae). Numerical techniques, including multivariate ordination, rarefaction, independent splitting and trait analysis, were used to assess the major drivers of changes in community diversity and population stability. Integrated multi-proxy analyses are very rare in the Caucasus, making this a unique record of long-term ecological change in a global biodiversity hotspot. 3. Synthesis. Population changes in the terrestrial community coincided primarily with external environmental changes, while populations within the peatland community were affected by both internal and external drivers at different times. In general, our observations accord with theoretical predictions that population increases lead to greater stability and declines lead to instability. Random variation and interspecific competition explain population dynamics that diverged from predictions. Population change and diversity trends were positively correlated in all taxonomic groups, suggesting that population-level instability is greater in more diverse communities, even though diverse communities are themselves more stable. There is a continuing need to confront population theory with long-term data to test the predictive success of theoretical frameworks, thereby improving their ability to predict future change.","[Connor, Simon E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Connor, Simon E.] Univ Algarve, CIMA FCT, Faro, Portugal; [Colombaroli, Daniele; Gobet, Erika; van Leeuwen, Jacqueline F.

Management systems that limit access to certain natural resources likely have an effect on the quality of that knowledge. We explore the distribution of local ecological knowledge as it corresponds to different types of fishing activities and experience among fishermen in the eastern Gulf of Maine. We use a network approach to analyze cognitive maps of the ecosystem structure and dynamics described by fishermen during in-depth, open-ended interviews. The interviews reveal unique perspectives on complex interactions between species and their habitat, providing insights about local fluctuations in water temperature and weather patterns, predator-prey dynamics and interspecies competition, with a particular focus on species of commercial interest. We find a significant positive relationship between individuals' diversification in fisheries and the scope of their knowledge. The preliminary findings suggest that fishermen with diversified fishing portfolios interact with a broader range of components in the system, resulting in a more holistic understanding of the marine environment and its dynamics. Because regulatory measures in fisheries management increasingly constrain the ability of individuals to enter diverse fisheries, these findings have significant implications for sustainability and understanding the role that institutions play in shaping local ecological knowledge more generally. A more systematic investigation of how institutional constraints affect the distribution of local ecological knowledge would be well-positioned to inform ecosystem-based approaches in fisheries management.","[Farr, Emily R.; Stoll, Joshua S.] Maine Ctr Coastal Fisheries, Stonington, ME 04681 USA; [Stoll, Joshua S.] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Beitl, Christine M.] Univ Maine, Dept Anthropol, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Farr, ER (corresponding author), Maine Ctr Coastal Fisheries, Stonington, ME 04681 USA.",,,"Beitl, Christine/0000-0003-3750-4723",Eastern Maine Conservation Initiative; Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries; University of Maine; Maine Sea Grant,"This project would not have been possible without the fishermen who participated in interviews, taking time out of a busy fishing season to share their knowledge with us.

This question is increasingly addressed at the plant community scale to assess the role trait differences play in community assembly. Nevertheless, there remains considerable debate as to the value of native vs. alien trait comparisons. Recommendations are made to address seven conceptual and methodological limitations in current approaches used to assess trait differences between native and alien plants: account for spatial scale dependence, make an informed choice of traits, evaluate multiple trait dimensions, incorporate intraspecific trait variation, use appropriate null models, examine environmental gradients, and assess temporal variation in trait spectra. Tackling these limitations will dramatically improve the value of native vs. alien trait comparisons. Traits should be selected based on expectations of abiotic and/or biotic constraints. Phylogenetic distances can provide valuable insights but are no substitute for the measurement of individual traits when contrasting alien and native species. An ideal set of traits would include one or more leaf, stem, seed and root traits as well as flowering phenology and plant height at maturity. Comparisons of intraspecific trait variation among native and alien species within the same plant community are rare but could improve predictions of interspecific competition and the response of communities to plant invasions. The full plant community should be examined rather than selected species subsets and comparisons between native and alien species traits are better undertaken at a neighbourhood scale. The frequency distribution of alien and native species traits may change over time through competitive exclusion as well as contemporary evolution. Repeated surveys of species abundances and traits are required to understand the consequences of trait differences between aliens and natives for plant community assembly. Analyses of the role of species traits in plant invasions need to quantify differences in a priori identified traits within communities along suitable environmental gradients and test hypothetical trait patterns against appropriate null expectations. The infrequent application of such approaches may explain the limited generalisations regarding the role of trait differences between native and alien species in the invasion of plant communities.

In this study, we compared the relative importance of catchment-scale abiotic and biotic predictors of native and nonindigenous minnow (Cyprinidae) richness in 170 catchments throughout the eastern United States. We compared historic and contemporary cyprinid distributional data to determine catchment-wise native/ nonindigenous status for 152 species. Catchment-scale model predictor variables described natural (elevation, precipitation, flow accumulation) and anthropogenic (developed land cover, number of dams) abiotic features, as well as native congener richness. Native congener richness may represent either biotic resistance via interspecific competition, or trait preadaptation according to Darwin's naturalisation hypothesis. We used generalised linear mixed models to examine evidence supporting the relative roles of abiotic and biotic predictors of cyprinid introduction success. Native congener richness was positively correlated with nonindigenous cyprinid richness and was the most important variable predicting nonindigenous cyprinid richness. Mean elevation had a weak positive effect, and effects of other abiotic factors were insignificant and less important. Our results suggest that at this spatial scale, trait preadaptation may be more important than intrageneric competition for determining richness of nonindigenous fishes.","[Peoples, Brandon K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Midway, Stephen R.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [DeWeber, Jefferson T.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Oregon Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Wagner, Tyler] Penn State Univ, US Geol Survey, Penn Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Peoples, Brandon K.] Clemson Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Conservat, Clemson, SC USA","Midway, SR (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",smidway@lsu.edu,,,Purdue Department of Forestry and Natural Resources; United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey,Purdue Department of Forestry and Natural Resources; United States Geological Survey,,85,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Within small mammals these changes have been mainly reported in rodents but were poorly assessed in soricomorphs. In this study we compared mandible morphology and body condition between mainland and island populations of the greater white-toothed shrew, Crocidura russula. The results indicated that island specimens were bigger and heavier than the mainland counterpart, and they showed changes in mandible shape that were associated with higher mechanical potentials. We suggest that these changes might be the result of the interaction of two main factors taking place in the island population: ecological release (i.e. the decrease of predation and interspecific competition), and consequently the increase of intraspecific competition. While the increase in size and body condition in island shrews could be a direct result from reduced predation and interspecific competition, the changes in mandible shape and the increase of both mechanical potential and sexual dimorphism could have arisen indirectly as a response to stronger intraspecific competition.","[Sanchez-Chardi, Alejandro; Garcia-Pando, Marian; Pujol-Buxo, Eudald; Jose Lopez-Fuster, Maria] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, Fac Biol, Av Diagonal 643, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanchez-Chardi, Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Serv Microscopia, Fac Biociencies, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Pujol-Buxo, Eudald; Jose Lopez-Fuster, Maria] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, Fac Biol, Av Diagonal 643, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Sans-Fuentes, Maria A.] Rhostat Consulting LLC, Tucson, AZ 85705 USA; [Sans-Fuentes, Maria A.] Univ Arizona, Stat GIDP, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Munoz-Munoz, Francesc] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Munoz-Munoz, F (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",francesc.munozm@uab.cat,"Munoz, Francesc Munoz/L-1997-2014; Sans, Maria/ABI-8309-2020","Munoz, Francesc Munoz/0000-0003-2084-0368; ","Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2002ACOM00012, 2009SGR403]; Museu de Gava","The authors thank Dr. Juan Jose Egozcue (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya) and Ms. Nuria Garriga (Universitat de Barcelona) for solving some methodological issues, and Dr. Anna Soler for her help with the map figure.

The partial syntopy of three viper species (V. ammodytes, V. aspis, and V. berus) is exceptional and has become known only from two neighbouring valleys in the southern Julian Pre-Alps along the Italian-Slovenian border (Valle Mea and Nadiza Valley). This unique situation puts forward questions concerning their co-existence, particularly when considering that natural hybrids are known among all three species. Our principal goals for this article were therefore to evaluate variation and integrity of key dorsal colour pattern and body size among V. berus, V. ammodytes, and V. aspis from Mount Stol, Nadiza Valley in Slovenia. We discuss these variations in the context of potential hybridization, interspecific competition, and local to regional synecological properties including diet, habitat, and climate. Despite the fact that a pre-study specimen showed intermediate colour pattern, suggesting a hybrid between V. ammodytes and V. aspis, no further intermediate specimens (n > 100) were detected based on external features. Comparison of body length and mass shows equal sizes between V. ammodytes and V. aspis, whereas V. berus is approximately 30% smaller. Furthermore, V. berus on Mount Stol is also much smaller and lacks melanism, unlike V. berus from a close population in Italy (< 15 km), where they are larger and melanism is relatively frequent. These local character expressions presumably are the result of environmental constraints at high elevations (> 1200 m asl.), such as a harsh climate of open, non-forested habitat and possibly a regionally different predation pressure and diet composition. At mid-elevation < 1200 m asl., syntopic V. ammodytes and V. aspis may compete for food, yet, the previously evaluated microhabitat differences appear sufficient to maintain species integrity for these two viper populations.","[Mebert, Konrad; Ursenbacher, Sylvain] Univ Basel, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Mebert, Konrad; Luiselli, Luca] IDECC, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Luiselli, Luca] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, PMB 5080, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; [Cafuta, Vesna] Herpetolosko Drustvo Soc Herpetol Slovenica, Vecna Pot 111, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Golay, Philippe] Elapsoidea, 21 Chemin Moulin, Bernex Geneva, Switzerland; [Dubey, Sylvain] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bld, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Dubey, Sylvain] Hintermann & Weber SA, Rue Eglise Catholique 9b, CH-1820 Montreux, Switzerland","Mebert, K (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.; Mebert, K (corresponding author), IDECC, Via G Tomasi di Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy.",konradmebert@gmail.com,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,Joachim de Giacomi Foundation; DGHT-ZH,"Funding was supported through Joachim de Giacomi Foundation, DGHT-ZH, and J-C Eichmann.

Nonetheless, although niche segregation has been widely studied, few studies have examined it in disturbed environments. Because of their dependence on mature forests, arboreal squirrels are model organisms for studying how sympatric species coexist in disturbed habitats. We examined niche segregation between Sciurus aureogaster and S. oculatus in an oak-pine forest of Pinal de Amoles, Queretaro, Mexico, disturbed by insect infestation and deforestation. We were interested in the degree of niche overlap in activity patterns, space and tree use, and feeding behavior. Because S. aureogaster has a greater geographic distribution and occurs in a wider range of habitats, we predicted that it would show wider niche values, and would be more tolerant to disturbance compared to S. oculatus. We also predicted that nests would be situated in areas with low deforestation pressure. We searched for squirrels, nests, and tree stumps while walking along dirt roads and trails, and through the dense part of the forest. Levin's measure of niche breadth and Pianka's measure of niche overlap were used to evaluate how both species segregate across resource dimensions. Number of stumps was used to evaluate deforestation pressure around nests and squirrels within 30-m-radius circles. S. aureogaster showed slightly narrower niche breath values in 5 out of 7 dimensions compared to S. oculatus. We found high niche overlap values in all dimensions examined. Both squirrel species strongly relied on pine (Pinus) trees for feeding, traveling, and nesting. S. aureogaster and S. oculatus were observed in areas with similar disturbance, and nests were situated in areas with medium deforestation pressure. Pine trees were mostly logged illegally and for forest sanitation, posing a serious threat to the persistence of arboreal squirrels within the study area.","[Ramos-Lara, Nicolas; Lopez-Gonzalez, Carlos A.] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ciencias Nat, Lab Zool, Ave Ciencias S-N, Santiago De Queretaro 76230, Queretaro, Mexico","Ramos-Lara, N (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ciencias Nat, Lab Zool, Ave Ciencias S-N, Santiago De Queretaro 76230, Queretaro, Mexico.",ramosln@yahoo.com.mx,,,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),We thank the owners of the campground Cruz de Palo for their support during the study.

The studied fossil material primarily included brachiopods and bivalves owing to their abundance throughout the section, but other subordinate taxonomic groups including ostracods and microgastropods were also integrated for discussion. Overall, a succession of three benthonic paleocommunities was recognized representing three connected ecological evolutionary stages across the Permian-Triassic transition. Both Stage 1 and Stage 2 paleocommunities predated the end-Permian boundary mass extinction, and were characterized by relatively high diversity of brachiopods and bivalves, with no or very rare other taxa. Approaching the end-Permian mass extinction and the PTB itself, the paleocommunity abruptly changed and was replaced by the Stage 2 paleocommunity that was characterized by a relatively low Shannon's diversity (H) coupled with a high Simpson's dominance index (D) and, most notably, a changeover from Neochonetes to Tethyochonetes (both are brachiopod genera) as the most significant ecological dominants. This Simpson's dominance index (D) shift correlates well with food shortage (i.e. much reduced terrestrial influx and acritarch abundance), and is therefore interpreted to signify, possibly, intensified interspecific competitions with Tethyochonetes seemingly outcompeting Neochonetes presumably due to its preadapted smaller body size. The post-extinction (Stage 3) paleocommunity is distinguished by a highly characteristic low-diversity and high-abundance fauna comprised mainly of lingulid brachiopods, Claraia bivalves, microgastropods and ostracods, suggesting a unique and highly stressful ecological regime. In this paleocommunity, Claraia might have acted like a disaster taxon and, as such, its ecological functional role in the paleocommunity was activated and elevated because of exceptional ecological conditions (e.g., anoxia, hyperthermal and/or severe food shortage). From the studied section, a number of ecological traits including species abundance distribution, Shannon's diversity (H), community dominance and body-size structure were identified as demonstrating significant changes accompanying community replacement prior to the end-Permian mass extinction. The fact that these changes preceded the mass extinction may suggest that these traits could represent some early warning signals for an impending ecological regime shift. This extended interpretation clearly has significant implications for modern ecological studies to predict future impending ecological regime shifts.","[Zhang, Yang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Shi, G.

On coral reefs, structural complexity is typically measured using a single and small-scale metric ('rugosity') that represents multiple spatial attributes differentially exploited by species, thus limiting a complete understanding of how fish associate with reef structure. We used a novel approach to compare relationships between fishes and previously unavailable components of reef complexity, and contrasted the results against the traditional rugosity index. This study focused on damselfish to explore relationships between fishes and reef structure. Three territorial species, with contrasting trophic habits and expected use of the reef structure, were examined to infer the potential species-specific mechanisms associated with how complexity influences habitat selection. Three-dimensional reef reconstructions from photogrammetry quantified the following metrics of habitat quality: 1) visual exposure to predators and competitors, 2) density of predation refuges and 3) substrate-related food availability. These metrics explained the species distribution better than the traditional measure of rugosity, and each species responded to different complexity components. Given that a critical effect of reef degradation is loss of structure, adopting three-dimensional technologies potentially offers a new tool to both understand species-habitat association and help forecast how fishes will be affected by the flattening of reefs.","[Gonzalez-Rivero, M.; Ganase, A.; Hoegh-Guldberg, O.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Gonzalez-Rivero, M.; Harborne, A.

The eight-year operation of the system has allowed the identification of a highly adapted and effective plant consortium that is convenient for plant assisted metaremediation of wastewater. This constructed wetland pilot station demonstrated effective performance over this extended period. Originally, there were twenty-five plant species. However, because of environmental constraints and pressure from interspecific competition, only seven species persisted. Interestingly, the molecular phylogenetic analyses and an investigation of the photosynthetic physiology showed that the naturally selected plants are predominately monocot species with C4 or C4 like photosynthetic pathways. Despite the loss of 72% of initially used species in the constructed wetland, the removal efficiencies of BOD, COD, TSS, total phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate were maintained at high levels, approximately 90%, 80%, 94%, 60% and 50%, respectively. Concomitantly, the microbiological water tests showed an extremely high reduction of total coliform bacteria and streptococci, about 99%, even without a specific disinfection step. Hence, the constructed wetland system produced water of high quality that can be used for agricultural purposes. In the present investigation, we provide a comprehensive set of plant species that might be used for long-term and large-scale wastewater treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

II) in northeastern Hungary preserves an abundance of forest-adapted ungulate species. To better understand the ecological relationships within this ancient ecosystem, we used analysis of enamel strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca) ratios to infer dietary preferences. The goals of the analysis were to: i) determine whether these ungulate species specialized in specific plants or plant parts; ii) discern whether the Sr/Ca ratios support what was previously suggested about the ecology of these species and iii) evaluate the factors that may have acted to promote coexistence within this diverse community of predominantly browsing herbivores. Results show significant differences in the diets of the sampled species. The highest Sr/Ca ratios were displayed by the suids Parachleuastochoerus kretzoii (FORTELIUS et al., 2005) and Propotamochoerus palaeochoerus (PILGRIM, 1926) implying a preference for Sr-rich underground plant parts. Elevated Sr/Ca ratios yielded by the cervid Lucentia aff. pierensis (THOMAS, 1951) and equid Hippotherium intrans (KRETZOI, 1983) are indicative of intermediate feeding. The bovid Miotragocerus sp. (STROMER, 1928) showed higher Sr/Ca ratios than the gomphothere Tetralophodon longirostris (KAUP, 1832), which is incongruent with morphological and stable isotope data, and suggested browsing by both taxa. This finding is likely the result of a difference in digestive physiology (ruminant vs. monogastric) rather than a difference in dietary behaviour. The lowest Sr/Ca ratios were displayed by the traguild Dorcatherium naui (KAUP AND SCHOLL, 1834) and moschid Micromeryx flourensianus (LARTET, 1851) suggesting a preference for Sr-poor fruits. Resource specialization and partitioning within the local environment likely acted to decrease interspecific competition and promote coexistence within the diverse ungulate community at R.

We examined intra- and interspecific variation in functional morphology and whole-organism performance in a sympatric lizard species pair, Iberolacerta horvathi and Podarcis muralis, in the area with a high potential for competition. 2. The biggest variation between species was found in two functional traits, bite force and climbing speed, linked with corresponding morphological traits. 3. The species with larger and taller heads, P. muralis, exhibited correspondingly stronger bite forces. The other species exhibited smaller and flatter head. Both traits may potentially promote segregation between species in trophic niche (stronger bites relate to harder prey) and in refuge use (flatter heads allow using narrower crevices, hence, influencing escaping from common predators). Stronger bites and larger heads also provide one species with a dominant position in interspecific agonistic interactions. 4. Females had longer trunks that impacted negatively on climbing speed, which may lower anti-predator escape abilities of the more trunk-dimorphic species, but positively influence reproductive effort. 5. Our results exemplify how the joint examination of morphological and functional traits of ecologically similar and sympatric species can provide a mechanistic background for understanding their coexistence, namely, syntopic populations that are frequent in the study area. 6. The identified roles of functional morphology in this system of sympatric rock lizards support the contribution of functional diversification for the complexity of community structure via coexistence.","[Zagar, Anamarija; Carretero, Miguel A.; Kaliontzopoulou, Antigoni] Univ Porto, InBIO, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Vrezec, A.

This behaviour may create a sexual conflict, because females could lose the sperm stored in the spermatheca, used for long-term storage. Comparative evidence suggested antagonistic coevolution between sexes, which might prompt the evolution of narrow spermathecal ducts, or longer spermathecae, hindering sperm removal. Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis and C. splendens coexist and sometimes hybridize. Therefore, here I predicted that if females coevolve with conspecific males, heterospecific males should have an advantage when interspecific matings occur because females will show less resistance to them than to conspecific males. By hand-pairing females to males of both species, I found that in intraspecific and interspecific matings, sperm was almost completely removed from the bursa (97-100%), but only partially from the spermathecae, with more spermathecal removal in interspecific (63-71%) than intraspecific matings (14-33%). This suggests that heterospecific males are more efficient in sperm removal as predicted by a sexually-antagonistic coevolutionary scenario. Furthermore, in most cases, only the left spermatheca was emptied, suggesting that the evolution of more than one spermatheca might also be a female counter-adaptation to regain control over fertilization.","[Cordero-Rivera, Adolfo] Univ Vigo, Escola Enxenaria Forestal, ECOEVO Lab, Campus Univ, Pontevedra 36005, Galiza, Spain","Cordero-Rivera, A (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Escola Enxenaria Forestal, ECOEVO Lab, Campus Univ, Pontevedra 36005, Galiza, Spain.",adolfo.cordero@uvigo.es,"Cordero-Rivera, Adolfo/K-4182-2014","Cordero-Rivera, Adolfo/0000-0002-5087-3550","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [BOS2001-3642, CGL2008-02799, CGL2011-22629, CGL2014-53140-P]; University of Vigo; University La Sapienza di Roma","I thank Rhainer Guillermo-Ferreira, Alex Cordoba-Aguilar and two anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

Here we use original data from a unique natural experiment to study some of the mechanisms by which African lions Panthera leo impact on African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Using a study site where wild dogs outnumbered lions for several years prior to lion population recovery, we aimed to investigate whether or not, and by which means, wild dog populations are regulated and influenced by lions. We used 38 pack-years of demographic and behavioural data across two 4-year periods where lion density differed 20-fold (pre-lion era: 1996-1999 and lion era: 2010-2013) to assess how lions may affect wild dog pack size and age structure, litter size and pup survival (n = 329 pups), as well as den site selection (n = 46 dens). Pack size was significantly greater during the pre-lion era. The pup to adult ratio was lower during the lion era and the change in pack composition was directly attributable to significantly greater lion-induced pup mortality. We also demonstrate a behavioural shift, with locations selected for the vulnerable denning period being in more rugged terrain and in areas with lower prey densities during the lion era, as compared with the pre-lion era. Lower adult recruitment into a population of an obligate cooperative breeder like the African wild dog can have complex consequences, including on feeding and defence of young, and mate finding.","[Groom, R.

For copepods, this is usually based on a few diagnostic morphological characters, which can be highly conserved, resulting in an underestimation of species diversity in many copepod families. We elucidate species richness in the morphologically challenging and ecologically important deep-sea copepod family Spinocalanidae in the tropical Atlantic by applying an integrated taxonomic approach combining morphology, DNA-sequence analyses and proteomic fingerprinting. In total, 28 morphospecies could be discriminated, while 39 putative species were detected using DNA-sequence analyses and 42 using proteomic fingerprinting. This outcome verifies proteomic fingerprinting to simplify and accelerate future biodiversity studies of copepods with high taxonomic resolution. Our findings demonstrate the power of this integrated morphological and molecular taxonomic approach by revealing high numbers of cryptic or pseudocryptic species and thus uncovering the incompleteness of taxonomic guides for this group in the poorly explored mesopelagic realm. Furthermore, our analyses reveal a close relationship of Mospicalanus and Spinocalanus group A and indicate that the genus Spinocalanus may be polyphyletic. The underestimated species diversity suggests complex ecological interactions in terms of predator-prey relationships, interspecific competition and species-specific specializations in the vast, but under-studied mesopelagic realm.","[Bode, Maya; Kaiser, Patricia; Hagen, Wilhelm; Auel, Holger] Univ Bremen, Bremare Bremen Marine Ecol, Marine Zool, POB 330440, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Laakmann, Silke] German Ctr Marine Biodivers Res DZMB, Senckenberg Res Inst, Sudstrand 44, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Cornils, Astrid] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Polar Biol Oceanog, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany","Bode, M (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Bremare Bremen Marine Ecol, Marine Zool, POB 330440, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.",mabode@uni-bremen.de,"Cornils, Astrid/P-2943-2014","Cornils, Astrid/0000-0003-4536-9015; Laakmann, Silke/0000-0003-3273-7907; Hagen, Wilhelm/0000-0002-7462-9931; Kaiser, Patricia/0000-0002-9517-3515",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [CO 706/2-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in the framework of the priority programme Antarctic Research with comparative investigations in Arctic ice areas by the grant (CO 706/2-1 to A.C.).,,85,19,21,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

We used a diachronic approach to track species shifts in a mixed oak stand (Quercus petraea-Quercus robur) at a fine spatiotemporal scale. Species assignment was made using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) fingerprints employing clustering and parentage analysis. Mating patterns and reproductive success were assessed by parentage analysis. Plot-based inventories of soil parameters and sapling densities provided ecological and demographic information, respectively. Sapling density and reproductive success was higher in Q. petraea than in Q. robur, and were correlated with a spatial expansion of Q. petraea (50% to 67% of the area). Admixed trees resulting from hybridization and backcrossing between the two species were more frequent under the Q. robur canopy. We suspect that species' differential responses to ongoing environmental changes and interspecific competition are the predominant factors accounting for the recruitment success of Q. petraea, while human interference, differential reproduction and hybridization (and backcrossings) are probably of more limited importance. We anticipate in mixed Q. petraea-Q. robur stands, under current ongoing environmental change, that these processes will be enhanced, at least in the western part of the distribution of the two species.","[Truffaut, Laura; Chancerel, Emilie; Ducousso, Alexis; Ehrenmann, Francois; Kremer, Antoine] INRA, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33610 Cestas, France; [Truffaut, Laura; Chancerel, Emilie; Ducousso, Alexis; Ehrenmann, Francois; Kremer, Antoine] Univ Bordeaux, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Dupouey, Jean Luc; Badeau, Vincent] Univ Lorraine, INRA, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, Route Amance, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Kremer, A (corresponding author), INRA, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33610 Cestas, France.; Kremer, A (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33615 Pessac, France.",antoine.kremer@pierroton.inra.fr,"Dupouey, Jean-Luc/AAF-5511-2020; Kremer, Antoine/G-2272-2018","Dupouey, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-7396-8691; BADEAU, Vincent/0000-0003-2832-7315; Ehrenmann, Francois/0000-0003-2727-0070; Kremer, Antoine/0000-0002-3372-3235","European Research Council through the Advanced Grant Project TREEPEACE [FP-7339728]; French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the 'Investissements d'Avenir' programme, Labex ARBREFrench National Research Agency (ANR); French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the 'Investissements d'Avenir' programme, Labex COTEFrench National Research Agency (ANR)","This research was supported by the European Research Council through the Advanced Grant Project TREEPEACE (no.

In these disturbed landscapes, the juxtaposition of multiple habitat types can be especially important to fledglings and young birds, which may leave breeding grounds in human-altered habitat for different habitats nearby that provide increased foraging opportunities, reduced competition, and higher protection from predators. In this study, we evaluated the importance of three habitat types to two life stages of the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi), a synanthropic songbird endemic to Andros, The Bahamas. First, we determined the avian species composition and relative abundance of I. northropi among three major vegetation types on Andros: Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea) forest, coppice (broadleaf dry forest), and anthropogenic areas, dominated by nonnative vegetation (farmland and developed land). We then compared the foraging strategies and social interactions of two age classes of adult Bahama Orioles in relation to differential habitat use. Bird surveys late in the Bahama Oriole's breeding season indicated the number of avian species and Bahama Oriole density were highest in coppice. Some bird species occurring in the coppice and pine forest were never observed in agricultural or residential areas, and may be at risk if human disturbance of pine forest and coppice increases, as is occurring at a rapid pace on Andros. During the breeding season, second-year (SY) adult Bahama Orioles foraged in all vegetation types, whereas after-second-year (ASY) adults were observed foraging only in anthropogenic areas, where the species nested largely in introduced coconut palms (Cocos nucifera). Additionally, SY adults foraging in anthropogenic areas were often observed with an ASY adult, suggesting divergent habitat use for younger, unpaired birds. Other aspects of foraging (vegetation features, food-gleaning behavior, and food items) were similar for the two age classes. Older Bahama Orioles exhibited relatively higher rates of social interactions (intraspecific and interspecific pooled) in anthropogenic areas, and won more interaction outcomes compared to younger adults. Our findings concur with those of other studies indicating dry broadleaf forest is vitally important to migrating, wintering, and resident birds, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole, which appears to depend heavily on this vegetation type during certain life stages.","[Price, Melissa R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Hayes, William K.] Loma Linda Univ, Dept Earth & Biol Sci, Loma Linda, CA 92350 USA","Price, MR (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",melrprice@gmail.com,"Price, Melissa/AAM-7749-2020","Price, Melissa/0000-0003-1836-3769",Insular Species Conservation Society; Department of Earth and Biological Sciences at Loma Linda University,"Funding was provided by the Insular Species Conservation Society, and by the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences at Loma Linda University.

These species could serve as potential sentinels for the presence of xenobiotics in marine ecosystems. In this study, liver carboxylesterase (CbE) activity was determined for 20 species of chondrichthyans. Carboxylesterase activity, a known esterase involved in the metabolism of pesticides, lipids and certain drugs, was measured using two substrates: 4-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) and alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha NA). Rajiformes (rays and skates) showed higher CbE activity than sharks, and the order Chimaeriformes showed the lowest values. In vitro sensitivity to CbE inhibitors was assessed in the shark Scyliorhinus canicula. The substrate alpha NA was found to be the most adequate as it displayed the highest activity and was more sensitive to the organophosphate dichlorvos in the liver (IC50 = 2.37 mu M) and plasma (IC50 = 0.051 mu M). The high interspecific variation of CbE activity and its sensitivity to inhibition by fenofibrate suggest that this enzyme could contribute to species-specific differences in drug detoxification.","[Nos, David; Navarro, Joan; Barrie, Claudio; Sole, Montserrat] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Navarro, Joan] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Ave Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain","Nos, D (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",davidnosfrancisco@gmail.com,"Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Sole, Montserrat/C-7398-2013; Francisco, David Nos/AAA-3094-2019; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Barria, Claudio/J-8998-2017","Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Sole, Montserrat/0000-0002-9920-5051; Francisco, David Nos/0000-0002-9116-294X; Barria, Claudio/0000-0001-6769-4578","Andalucia Talent Hub Program (European Union's Seventh Framework Program); Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions; Andalusian Knowledge Agency, Spain) [291780]; CONICYT Becas ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness, Spain [CTM2011-26333]","We acknowledge Marta Coll and Raquel Saez for their help in the species collection and laboratory work.

Predicting RPH population dynamics and identifying their source areas are crucial for the management of these migratory pests in China, but the origins of the migrants to temperate and subtropical regions in China remains unclear. In particular, their early migration to China in March and April have not yet been explored due to a lack of research data available from potential source areas, Central Vietnam and Laos. In this study, we examined the population dynamics and migratory paths of N. lugens and S. furcifera in Vietnam and South China in 2012 and 2013. Trajectory modeling showed that in March and April in 2012 and 2013, RPH emigrated from source areas in Central Vietnam where rice was maturing to the Red River Delta and South China. Early migrants originated from Southern Central Vietnam (14-16 degrees N), but later most were from Northern Central Vietnam (16-19 degrees N). Analysis of meteorological and light-trap data from Hepu in April (1977-2013) using generalized linear models showed that immigration increased with precipitation in Southern Central Vietnam in January, but declined with precipitation in Northern Central Vietnam in January. These results determined that the RPH originate from overwintering areas in Central Vietnam, but not from southernmost areas of Vietnam. Winter precipitation, rather than temperature was the most important factor determining the number of RPH migrants. Based on their similar population dynamics and low population densities in Central Vietnam, we further speculated that RPH migrate to track ephemeral food resources whilst simultaneously avoiding predators. Migrations do not seem to be initiated by interspecific competition, overcrowding or host deterioration. Nevertheless, S. furcifera establishes populations earlier than N. lugens South China, perhaps to compensate for interspecific competition. We provide new information that could assist with forecasting outbreaks and implementing control measures against these migratory pests.","[Hu, G.; Tuan, H.

Interspecific resource competition could place an additional strain on ice-associated marine mammals already facing loss of sea ice habitat. Using fatty acid (FA) profiles, FA trophic markers, and FA stable carbon isotope analyses, we found that walruses and bearded seals partitioned food resources in 2009-2011. Interspecific differences in FA profiles were largely driven by variation in non-methylene FAs, which are markers of benthic invertebrate prey taxa, indicating varying consumption of specific benthic prey. We used Bayesian multi-source FA stable isotope mixing models to estimate the proportional contributions of particulate organic matter (POM) from sympagic (ice algal), pelagic, and benthic sources to these apex predators. Proportional contributions of FAs to walruses and bearded seals from benthic POM sources were high [44 (17-67)% and 62 (38-83)%, respectively] relative to other sources of POM. Walruses also obtained considerable contributions of FAs from pelagic POM sources [51 (32-73)%]. Comparison of delta C-13 values of algal FAs from walruses and bearded seals to those from benthic prey from different feeding groups from the Chukchi and Bering seas revealed that different trophic pathways sustained walruses and bearded seals. Our findings suggest that (1) resource partitioning may mitigate interspecific competition, and (2) climate change impacts on Arctic food webs may elicit species-specific responses in these high trophic level consumers.","[Oxtoby, L.

Although regional differences in realized soil pH niche ('niche shifts') have been reported since the 19th century, no study has disentangled how they are influenced by spatial differences in substrate availability, macroclimate, and competitors. We linked plot-level data on species occurrence and measured soil pH from dry grasslands in eight regions across Eurasia (n. 999 plots), spanning a geographic gradient of 6862 km. We calculated regional shifts in niche optimum (D-opt) and width (D-width) for 73 Species x Region 1 x Region 2 combinations (SRRs; 38 study species) using extended Huisman-Olff-Fresco models. Next, we used commonality analysis to partition the contribution of substrate availability, precipitation, and species traits indicative of competitive ability to variation in regional niche shifts. Shifts in optimum were rare (5% of SRRs with D-opt > 1 pH units) but many species did not show optima within regions. By contrast, shifts in niche width were common (22% of SRRs with D-width >= 1 pH units) and there were pronounced interspecific differences. Whereas none of the three predictors significantly explained shifts in niche optimum, common and unique effects of substrate availability and precipitation accounted for 85% of variation in niche width. Our results suggest that substrate availability and precipitation could be the driving factors behind species regional shifts in niche width. Studies that address additional factors, such as other edaphic niches, and their variability at the regional and micro-scale will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying species distributions.","[Wagner, Viktoria; Chytry, Milan; Zeleny, David; Danihelka, Jiri; Lustyk, Pavel; Merunkova, Kristina; Palpurina, Salza; Preislerova, Zdenka] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CZ-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Danihelka, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Dept Vegetat Ecol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Zeleny, David] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei, Taiwan; [von Wehrden, Henrik] Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany; [von Wehrden, Henrik] Leuphana Univ, Ctr Methods, Luneburg, Germany; [Brinkert, Annika; Hoelzel, Norbert; Kamp, Johannes] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, Munster, Germany; [Jansen, Florian] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, Greifswald, Germany; [Wesche, Karsten] Senckenberg Museum Nat Hist, Gorlitz, Germany; [Wesche, Karsten] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany","Wagner, V (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CZ-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",wagner@sci.muni.cz,"Jansen, Florian/W-3309-2019; Holzel, Norbert/H-8753-2013; Danihelka, Jiri/G-4792-2014; Chytry, Milan/J-4954-2012; Palpurina, Salza/S-9406-2017; Zeleny, David/A-2655-2010","Jansen, Florian/0000-0002-0331-5185; Holzel, Norbert/0000-0002-6367-3400; Danihelka, Jiri/0000-0002-2640-7867; Chytry, Milan/0000-0002-8122-3075; Palpurina, Salza/0000-0003-0416-5622; Zeleny, David/0000-0001-5157-044X; Wagner, Viktoria/0000-0002-2665-9888",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P504-11-0454]; UK government's Darwin Initiative [18004]; Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity in Kazakhstan (ACBK),This study was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (project no.

Here, we partition the variance in an anti-predator behaviour, flight initiation distance (FID), and assess how its within-and between-population variance are related to life history, distribution, dispersal and habitat ecology. Although the composition of within-species variance in FID depended on the phylogeny, most variance occurred within populations. When accounting for allometry, density-dependence, uncertainty in the phylogenetic hypothesis and heterogeneity in data quality, within-population variance was significantly associated with habitat diversity and population size. Between-population variance was a significant predictor of natal dispersal, senescence and habitat diversity.

However, little data exists on local- and broad-scale tree seed immigration and recruitment in these communities. Interspecific competition and seed predation are two major causes of recruitment failure for plants. In North American urban forests, these pressures may be exacerbated by an altered disturbance regime and prevalent invasive species combined with dense populations of rodents and browsers. Preliminary investigation in an urban forest on the eastern shore of Lake Erie indicated very low long-term tree seedling recruitment in the mature canopy stands. Our competing hypotheses were that seed establishment (habitat suitability) and seed limitations (seed availability) explained the tree recruitment failure. We tested seed establishment using field experiments (burning and vertebrate herbivore exclosures) and seed limitation by introducing native tree seeds. Moreover, we tested also seed limitation by examining local and regional seed input using seed traps. We found that seedling recruitment increased significantly with experimental reductions in predators and competitors, suggesting strong biotic establishment limitations in the urban forest. In addition, seed rain correlated significantly with immediately proximate parent plants, but no species arrived beyond what occurs within 50 m of the experimental plots. Essentially, then, the existing canopy species are not replacing themselves and extant seeds are not immigrating to replace them. At the patch scale, habitat quality, particularly seed predation and browsing, as well as competition from nonnative understory shrubs, constrained native tree recruitment in the urban forest. At the landscape scale, the evidence of poor long-term seed recruitment and the lack of long-distance seed input also suggest low native tree seed availability. The tree recruitment failure suggests that, in the absence of active management, this urban forest may eventually convert to an invasive-species dominated urban shrubland.","[Labatore, Adam C.; Potts, Daniel L.; Warren, Robert J., II] SUNY Buffalo State, Dept Biol, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA; [Spiering, David J.] Buffalo Museum Sci, Tifft Nat Preserve, 1200 Fuhrmann Blvd, Buffalo, NY 14203 USA","Warren, RJ (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo State, Dept Biol, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",hexastylis@gmail.com,,,,,,65,11,12,1,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,APR,2017,20,2,,,,,393,401,,10.1007/s11252-016-0601-x,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,ER7RP,WOS:000399011500012,,,,,2021-09-21,

Models focused on interspecific competition expect species with similar ecological requirements to be spatially segregated. While both models are corroborated by field work, few empirical studies have tried to infer under which habitat conditions these patterns of co-occurrence prevail. Here we use an exceptional data set on central European pine forest understorey plant communities to assess the change in community structure along gradients of soil productivity and heterogeneity. We found all understorey communities to be significantly nested. The degree of segregation increased with increasing soil Ca and Mg content, as well as with increasing pH, nutrient availability, and moisture. However, variability in soil characteristics did not significantly influence the pattern of species co-occurrence. We also found an intimate link between productivity, species richness, and species segregation making any causal inference challenging.

There is no theoretical limit to the number of levels in a facilitation cascade, yet the existence of more than two has rarely been examined. We manipulated biogenic substrate produced by a primary facilitator (cockle shells) and a secondary facilitator (barnacles and their empty tests) in a space-limited subtidal community to test the hypothesis that solitary ascidians would be the third-level facilitator. In the field, most ascidians were found on barnacles, and most barnacles occupied cockle shells. To produce this pattern, barnacles could nurse ascidians (a longer 'facilitation chain') or outcompete them from cockle shells (a shorter chain). Experimental results clearly supported the nursing hypothesis providing evidence for a facilitation cascade with three hierarchical levels of foundation species. Our findings confirm that like predation and competition, positive interspecific interactions nest into multi-tier hierarchies with numerous levels. While the number of foundation species should increase community stability and resilience as it increases diversity and reduces environmental stress, facilitation chain length may have the opposite effect.","[Yakovis, Eugeniy; Artemieva, Anna] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia","Yakovis, E (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",eugene@yakovis.com,"Artemieva, Anna/AAD-9578-2019; Yakovis, Evgeny/M-8540-2019","Yakovis, Evgeny/0000-0003-3489-3671; Artemieva, Anna/0000-0002-1935-7021","Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [02-04-50020, 05-04-48927, 05-04-63041, 06-04-63077, 07-04-10075, 08-04-01373, 08-04-10109, 09-04-10092, 10-04-10094, 11-04-01248, 11-04-10031, 12-04-10059, 13-04-10178, 14-04-00972, 14-04-10124, 17-04-00651]","We thank Michael Fokin, Michael Smirnov, Vladimir Krapivin,.arina Varfolomeeva, Dmitry Grebelniy, Sergey Grebelniy, Vladislav Dzhurinskiy, Anna Kuritsina, Alexey Filinovitch, Nastasia Arkhipova, Anastasia Koval, Michael Yakovis, Natalia Shunatova and Alexey Grishankov for their assistance in the field.

Despite long-term data collection over the nearly three decades since the spill, tremendous uncertainty remains as to how significantly the spill affected fishery resources. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and some wild Pacific salmon populations (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Prince William Sound declined in the early 1990s, and have not returned to the population sizes observed in the 1980s. Discerning if, or how much of, this decline resulted from the oil spill has been difficult because a number of other physical and ecological drivers are confounded temporally with the spill; some of these drivers include environmental variability or changing climate regimes, increased production of hatchery salmon in the region, and increases in populations of potential predators. Using data pre-and post-spill, we applied time-series methods to evaluate support for whether and how herring and salmon productivity has been affected by each of five drivers: (1) density dependence, (2) the EVOS event, (3) changing environmental conditions, (4) interspecific competition on juvenile fish, and (5) predation and competition from adult fish or, in the case of herring, humpback whales. Our results showed support for intraspecific density-dependent effects in herring, sockeye, and Chinook salmon, with little overall support for an oil spill effect. Of the salmon species, the largest driver was the negative impact of adult pink salmon returns on sockeye salmon productivity. Herring productivity was most strongly affected by changing environmental conditions; specifically, freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska was linked to a series of recruitment failures-before, during, and after EVOS. These results highlight the need to better understand long terms impacts of pink salmon on food webs, as well as the interactions between nearshore species and freshwater inputs, particularly as they relate to climate change and increasing water temperatures.","[Ward, Eric J.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Adkison, Milo] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK USA; [Couture, Jessica] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Dressel, Sherri C.; Brenner, Rich] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Commercial Fisheries, Juneau, AK USA; [Litzow, Michael A.] Farallon Inst Adv Ecosyst Res, Petaluma, CA USA; [Moffitt, Steve] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Commercial Fisheries, Cordova, AK USA; [Neher, Tammy Hoem] NOAA, Kasitsna Bay Lab, Natl Ocean Serv, Homer, AK USA; [Trochta, John] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ward, EJ (corresponding author), NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",eric.ward@noaa.gov,"Couture, Jessica/AAU-3840-2021",,NCEAS working group (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis); Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOSTC)Exxon Mobil Corporation,"This project was funded as an NCEAS working group (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) by Kristin Marshall, Applying portfolio effects to the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem.

Differences in body size that are associated with foraging strategies and spatial distribution are believed to promote the coexistence of closely related species by reducing competition. However, the fact that many babbler species do not differ significantly in their morphology has challenged this view. We studied the foraging ecology of nine sympatric babbler species (i.e., Pellorneum capistratum, P. bicolor, P. malaccense, Malacopteron cinereum, M. magnum, Stachyris nigriceps, S. nigricollis, S. maculata, and Cyanoderma erythropterum) in the Krau Wildlife Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia. We investigated; i) how these babblers forage in the wild and use vegetation to obtain food, and ii) how these trophically similar species differ in spatial distribution and foraging tactics. Results indicated that most babblers foraged predominantly on aerial leaf litter and used gleaning manoeuvre in intermediate-density foliage but exhibited wide ranges of vertical strata usage, thus reducing interspecific competition. The principal component analysis indicated that two components, i.e., foraging height and substrate are important as mechanisms to allow the coexistence of sympatric babblers. The present findings revealed that these bird species have unique foraging niches that are distinct from each other, and this may apply to other insectivorous birds inhabiting tropical forests. This suggests that niche separation does occur among coexisting birds, thus following Gause' law of competitive exclusion, which states two species occupying the same niche will not stably coexist.","[Mansor, Mohammad Saiful; Ramli, Rosli] Univ Malaya, Inst Biol Sci, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Mansor, Mohammad Saiful] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Environm & Nat Resource Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia","Mansor, MS; Ramli, R (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Inst Biol Sci, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.; Mansor, MS (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Environm & Nat Resource Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.",msaifulmansor@gmail.com; rosliramli@um.edu.my,"Ramli, Rosli/A-8498-2010","Ramli, Rosli/0000-0003-0410-9604; Mansor, Mohammad Saiful/0000-0002-8472-780X",University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [PG019-2013B],We are grateful to University of Malaya Research Fund (PG019-2013B) that provides financial support for this wildlife research.,,77,9,10,0,22,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 2,2017,12,3,,,,,,,e0172836,10.1371/journal.pone.0172836,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,EN4XX,WOS:000396011300041,28253284,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

E. Smith) and the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) are among the main pests of maize. Both species exhibit cannibalistic behavior and quite often share the same feeding guild in maize (maize ears), which can result in several interspecific and intraspecific interactions. Paired interaction scenarios of intraspecific and interspecific larvae were assessed in arenas in the presence and absence of food to characterize movements resulting from interactions of these insects. There was a difference in the frequency of behavioral movements in all the interactions, except for S. frugiperda in the presence of food. Head touching and recoiling were the predominant movements in most of the interaction scenarios. Spodoptera frugiperda exhibited a predominance of defensive movements when competing against H. zea in the same instars. Cannibalism and predation occurred frequently in interactions involving 6th instar of H. zea against opponents in 4th instar. Larvae of H. zea show a higher aggressive movement than S. frugiperda. The larvae of S. frugiperda take advantage during the interactions, although they present more defensive movements compared to H. zea. This study provides relevant information regarding the interaction of these species and intraguild interaction, which might influence the population dynamics and the competitive displacement of pest species that share the same ecological niche.","[Bentivenha, Jose P.

We developed a distribution model for northern spotted owls that incorporates both habitat suitability and probability of territory occupancy while accounting for interspecies competition. We developed range-wide habitat suitability maps for two time periods (1993 and 2012) for northern spotted owls that accounted for regional differences in habitat use and home range size. We used these maps for a long-term demographic monitoring study area to assess habitat change and estimate the number of potential territories based on available habitat for both time periods. We adjusted the number of potential territories using known occupancy rates to estimate owl densities for both time periods. We evaluated our range-wide habitat suitability model using independent survey data. Our range-wide habitat maps predicted areas suitable for territorial spotted owl presence well. On the demographic study area, the amount of habitat declined 19.7% between 1993 and 2012, while our estimate of the habitat-based carrying capacity declined from 150 to 146 territories. Estimated number of occupied territories declined from 94 to 57. Conservation and recovery of at-risk species depends on understanding how habitat changes over time in response to factors such as wildfire, climate change, biological invasions, and interspecies competition, and how these changes influence species distribution. We demonstrate a model-based approach that provides an effective planning tool.","[Glenn, Elizabeth M.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Oregon State Off, 2600 SE 98th Ave Suite 100, Portland, OR 97266 USA; [Glenn, Elizabeth M.] Dept Interior Northwest Climate Sci Ctr, 777 NW 9th St,Suite 400, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Lesmeister, Damon B.] US Forest Serv, Forestry Sci Lab, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Davis, Raymond J.] US Forest Serv, Forestry Sci Lab, USDA, Pacific Northwest Reg, Corvallis, OR 97731 USA; [Hollen, Bruce] Oregon State Off, Bur Land Management, 1220 SW 3rd Ave, Portland, OR 97204 USA; [Poopatanapong, Anne] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Reg, Reg Off, 1220 SW 3rd Ave, Portland, OR 97204 USA","Glenn, EM (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Oregon State Off, 2600 SE 98th Ave Suite 100, Portland, OR 97266 USA.; Glenn, EM (corresponding author), Dept Interior Northwest Climate Sci Ctr, 777 NW 9th St,Suite 400, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.",eglenn@usgs.gov,,,USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; USDI Bureau of Land Management,"Funding for monitoring spotted owl populations was primarily provided by USDA Forest Service and USDI Bureau of Land Management as agreed upon under the Northwest Forest Plan.

This study investigated three-way interactions between saprotrophic fungi in wood and across soil, and indicated that pairwise combinations are often inaccurate predictors of the outcomes of multispecies competition in wood block interactions. This inconsistency was especially true of intransitive combinations, resulting in increased species coexistence within the resource. Furthermore, the addition of a third competitor frequently destabilised the otherwise consistent outcomes of pairwise combinations in wood blocks, which occasionally resulted in altered resource decomposition rates, depending on the relative decay abilities of the species involved. Conversely, interaction outcomes in soil microcosms were unaffected by the presence of a third combatant.

In the field, the carbohydrate (C) to protein (P) intake of Mormon crickets Anabrus simplex Haldeman (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) is indicative of a nutritional imbalance affecting both migration and immunity. In the present study, dietary choice experiments in the laboratory are used to investigate the preferences of Mormon cricket nymphs and adults for C and P. Diets of differing C : P ratios and amounts are presented in pairs to permit Mormon crickets to reach an intake target of C: P from four unique starting points. After the last pair of diets is removed, phenoloxidase (PO) and anti-bacterial activity are assayed. Both males and females at the adult and nymphal stages show a strong preference for the diet richest in macronutrients, with an equal preference for C or P. When given a choice between a high C diet or a high P diet, Mormon crickets select both at random, balancing their daily intake of C and P. Weight gain is dependent on the mass of P consumed, with a conversion factor greater than four times that of C consumed. As predicted, Mormon cricket nymphs and adults that consume more P have higher titres of total phenoloxidase and, in addition, lysozyme-like anti-bacterial activity is independent of dietary treatment. In nature, omnivores might consume an excess of one macronutrient because they often find the other through active searching of their local habitat. However, environmental change and interspecific or intraspecific competition can challenge the ability of an organism to encounter the required nutrients on a local scale, contributing to long-distance migratory behaviours.","[Srygley, Robert B.] USDA ARS, Northern Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Srygley, RB (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Northern Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",robert.srygley@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,34,6,6,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6962,1365-3032,,PHYSIOL ENTOMOL,Physiol.

Otariid seals (fur seals and sea lions) breed sympatrically in several regions and, where this occurs, differences in lactation length and body size (which in-fluence foraging behaviour and diet) are apparent. However, congeneric Australian fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus (AUFS) and New Zealand fur seals A. forsteri (NZFS) breed sympatrically on several islands within south-eastern Australia, and display complete overlap in breeding period. How these populations segregate resources is unknown. We assessed the for aging ecology and diet of adult females of both species breeding on Kanowna Island, south-eastern Australia. Foraging locations and diving behaviour differed between species, with AUFS diving deeper (consistent with benthic foraging; 70.6 +/- 2.3 m [SD]), while NZFS predominantly dived to shallow depths (16.9 +/- 3.7 m), suggesting an epipelagic foraging mode. A bimodal pattern in foraging range was observed in NZFS, with animals either foraging near the colony (15.7 +/- 13.0 km) or travelling beyond the continental shelf (363.4 +/- 17.2 km), while AUFS foraged within 79.8 +/- 8.8 km of the colony. Although dietary composition was similar, the relative importance of prey differed. NZFS predominantly consumed pelagic species, while AUFS primarily consumed a variety of benthic/demersal species (niche overlap 0.39). These differences coincide with the divergence in population demography of the 2 species (AUFS exhibit lower, more stable fecundity compared to NZFS) and are consistent with predictions that foraging mode influences life history traits in otariid seals.","[Hoskins, Andrew J.; Schumann, Nicole; Arnould, John P.

Decomposition of dead organic matter is a key ecological process that ensures soil formation, nutrient availability, and carbon sequestration. To gain understanding of how biodiversity and ecosystems function together to control leaf-litter decomposition processes in a tropical rain forest (Yasuni National Park, Ecuador), we predicted the consequences of the decomposition process using a protocol in which we systematically disassemble the structural functionality of the soil macrofauna communities. We (1) describe the structure and function of the edaphic communities in detail and (2) explore the functional consequences of structural changes in these communities using a non-random exclusion experiment to simulate body size-related extinctions. To do this, we manipulated access of five size classes of soil invertebrates to eight types of plant leaf-litter resources. After measuring and identifying about 4400 soil individuals belonging to 541 morphospecies, 12 functional groups, and following the fate of about 2000 tree leaves in a 50-ha plot, we showed that (1) soil invertebrate communities were composed of a few common and many rare morphospecies that included mostly leaf-litter transformer groups, with the most morphospecies and the greatest abundance coming from Hymenoptera, Collembola, and Coleoptera; (2) our survey captured 63-74% of the total soil biodiversity of the study area (meaning there may be up to 860 morphospecies); (3) litter transformers covered the widest range of body volume, and all groups were evenly distributed at small and large spatial scales (i.e., we found no patterns of spatial aggregation); (4) changes in food web structure significantly altered biomass loss for only three of the eight leaf-litter treatments, suggesting the decomposition process was highly resistant to drastic changes such as size-biased biodiversity loss independent of resource quality. We conclude organic matter decomposition may depend on all non-additive effects that arise from multi-species interactions, including facilitation, interspecific interference competition, and top-down control that predators exert over detritivores at all body size ranges.","[Cardenas, Rafael E.; Argoti, Adriana; Dangles, Olivier] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Museo Zool QCAZ, Lab Entomol, Av 12 Octubre 1076 & Roca,Apdo 17-01-2184, Quito, Ecuador; [Cardenas, Rafael E.; Dangles, Olivier] LEGS CNRS, IRD, UPR 9034, UR 072, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Cardenas, Rafael E.; Dangles, Olivier] Univ Paris Sud 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Donoso, David A.] Escuela Politec Nacl, Inst Ciencias Biol, Av Ladron Guevara E11-253, Quito, Ecuador","Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Museo Zool QCAZ, Lab Entomol, Av 12 Octubre 1076 & Roca,Apdo 17-01-2184, Quito, Ecuador.; Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), LEGS CNRS, IRD, UPR 9034, UR 072, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.; Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), Univ Paris Sud 11, F-91405 Orsay, France.",recardenasm@yahoo.com,"Cardenas, Rafael E/AAY-9755-2020; Donoso, David A/A-2059-2016","Donoso, David A/0000-0002-3408-1457; Cardenas, Rafael E./0000-0002-0375-9384","French Institute for Research and Development (IRD); SENESCYT/ Prometeo Project [20140548BP]; PUCE [I13045, J13041]","The PUCE (codes I13045 and J13041) and the French Institute for Research and Development (IRD) supported this study through research grants.

Competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) theory is a prominent plant functional strategy scheme previously applied to local floras. Globally, the wide geographic and phylogenetic coverage of available values of leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) (representing, respectively, interspecific variation in plant size and conservative vs. acquisitive resource economics) promises the general application of CSR strategies across biomes, including the tropical forests hosting a large proportion of Earth's diversity. 2. We used trait variation for 3068 tracheophytes (representing 198 families, six continents and 14 biomes) to create a globally calibrated CSR strategy calculator tool and investigate strategy-environment relationships across biomes world-wide. 3. Due to disparity in trait availability globally, co-inertia analysis was used to check correspondence between a 'wide geographic coverage, few traits' data set and a 'restricted coverage, many traits' subset of 371 species for which 14 whole-plant, flowering, seed and leaf traits (including leaf nitrogen content) were available. CSR strategy/environment relationships within biomes were investigated using fourth-corner and RLQ analyses to determine strategy/climate specializations. 4. Strong, significant concordance (RV = 0.597; P < 0.0001) was evident between the 14 trait multivariate space and when only LA, LDMC and SLA were used. 5. Biomes such as tropical moist broadleaf forests exhibited strategy convergence (i.e. clustered around a CS/CSR median; C:S:R = 43: 42: 15%), with CS-selection associated with warm, stable situations (lesser temperature seasonality), with greater annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Other biomes were characterized by strategy divergence: for example, deserts varied between xeromorphic perennials such as Larrea divaricata, classified as S-selected (C: S: R = 1:99:0%) and broadly R-selected annual herbs (e.g. Claytonia perfoliata; R/CR-selected; C:S:R = 21:0:79%). Strategy convergence was evident for several growth habits (e.g. trees) but not others (forbs). 6. The CSR strategies of vascular plants can now be compared quantitatively within and between biomes at the global scale. Through known linkages between underlying leaf traits and growth rates, herbivory and decomposition rates, this method and the strategy-environment relationships it elucidates will help to predict which kinds of species may assemble in response to changes in biogeochemical cycles, climate and land use.","[Pierce, Simon; Luzzaro, Alessandra] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci DiSAA, Via G Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Negreiros, Daniel; Barbosa, Newton P.

The aim of this study was to verify, from an assemblage perspective, if sediment is the most important variable affecting Uca species distribution, and if mouth appendage morphology (setae type and curvature) would be related to habitat occupancy. Niche metrics and null model approaches were used to assess and test the hypothesis. The relevance of spoon-tipped setae curvature to Uca distribution was verified for the first time. A fragmented mangrove area was divided into seven subareas, and sampling of crabs and environmental variables took place in June and November 2010. Of 10 species recorded for Brazil, seven were found in the study area: U. burgersi, U. cumulanta, U. leptodactyla, U. maracoani, U. rapax, U. thayeri and U. uruguayensis. Multivariate analysis showed that sediment grain size and the presence of vegetation were the most important variables explaining distribution, reinforcing results commonly obtained by univariate approaches. The overlap of habitat occupancy was generally low and no relationship between mouth appendages was found with breadth and overlap measures. Contrary to predictions, most non-random overlap values were lower than expected by chance, suggesting that interspecific competition might influence species distribution. Also, variables such as the presence of vegetation are important and influence crab distribution, limiting the potential distribution that would be predicted by mouth adaptations alone. Thus, the use of these adaptations as surrogates of fiddler crab distribution is not recommended.","[Checon, Helio Herminio] Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Anim Biol, Grad Program Ecol, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Costa, Tania Marcia] Sao Paulo State Univ, UNESP, Lab Ecol & Anim Behav, Biosci Inst, Sao Vicente, SP, Brazil","Costa, TM (corresponding author), Praca Infante Dom Henrique S-N,Caixa Postal 73610, BR-11380972 Sao Vicente, SP, Brazil.",costatm@clp.unesp.br,"Costa, Tania M/AAC-6750-2019; Checon, Helio H./N-7525-2018; Costa, Tania M/C-8066-2012","Checon, Helio H./0000-0002-5867-3799; Costa, Tania M/0000-0003-0230-8431",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/06023-4],This work was supported by the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) under grant number 2010/06023-4.,,53,11,12,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",1745-1000,1745-1019,,MAR BIOL RES,Mar.

Environmental monitoring was conducted for an entire year through beach profiling, collection of the vegetation, of substrate samples and of the chemico-physical parameters of the ground water. Macroinvertebrates were assessed seasonally with two line transects of pitfall traps whereas monthly captures were carried out for coleopterans only. Zonations were also calculated to subdivide dune slack residents from nonresidents. The plant and invertebrate specie were then grouped using Hierarchical Cluster analysis. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was instead used to evaluate the effect of the environmental parameters of the dune slack on the vegetation structure and macroinvertebrate composition. To evaluate the relative contribution of the different food sources to the diets of the macroinvertebrates a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model was employed. The study clearly showed that the inhabiting dune slack fauna was subdivided in two main guilds of non-predator and predator species and that slacks could be used all year round by resident species adopting particular behaviours or avoiding interspecific competition by modulating their spatial and temporal strategies. Furthermore slacks were exploited as nursery grounds for immature stages of specific species and in other cases as important feeding areas for predators. These findings indicated that macroinvertebrates exploited beach compartments according to the different stages of their life-cycle and that the integrity of the entire beach ecosystem is a key factor to promote a high biodiversity in a sandy beach-dune ecosystem.","[Colombini, Isabella; Fallaci, Mario; Chelazzi, Lorenzo] Univ Florence, Museum Nat Hist, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [Chelazzi, Lorenzo] CNR, Inst Ecosyst Studies, Via Madonna del Piano 10, I-50019 Florence, Italy","Chelazzi, L (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Museum Nat Hist, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy.; Chelazzi, L (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Ecosyst Studies, Via Madonna del Piano 10, I-50019 Florence, Italy.",chelazzi@ise.cnr.it,,,Italian National Council of ResearchConsiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),The research was funded by the Italian National Council of Research.

However, temporal patterns in species-specific habitat use, for instance due to climatic variation, may affect the strength of interspecific interactions, and generate temporal variation in niche partitioning. We assessed temporal variation in habitat overlap between a wild ungulate, moose Alces alces, and two freeranging domestic ungulates, sheep Ovis aries and cattle Bos taurus, on a boreal forest range in southern Norway. We also calculated the distance between species' realised niches, as well as the width of their realised niches to evaluate the extent of temporal niche partitioning under different diurnal weather conditions. Analyses of each habitat variable suggested complex relationships between species-specific habitat use, photoperiod, and weather, related to species-specific behaviour and activity patterns. We found shorter overall niche distance between moose and sheep, compared to moose and cattle, and shorter niche distances during day and night than during the twilight hours. The niche distance between moose and sheep was positively related to temperature during night, but negatively during day. Moreover, niche distance between moose and both sheep and cattle was negatively related to precipitation at daytime. Moose niche width was narrower in periods with short niche distance to sheep, while we did not find such pattern towards cattle. A lack of similar moose response to cattle could be attributed to lower niche overlap between moose and cattle. Our results suggest that temporal niche partitioning between moose and livestock breaks down under the weather conditions that are predicted to become more common as climate change, potentially increasing wildlife-livestock interactions in the future.","[Herfindal, Ivar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Lande, Unni Stobet] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Div Forest & Forest Resources, Tingvoll, Norway; [Solberg, Erling Johan; Rolandsen, Christer Moe] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Trondheim, Norway; [Roer, Ole] Faun Naturforvaltning AS, Fyresdal, Norway; [Wam, Hilde Karine] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Div Forest & Forest Resources, As, Norway","Herfindal, I (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",ivar.herfindal@ntnu.no,"Herfindal, Ivar/A-4609-2015","Herfindal, Ivar/0000-0002-5860-9252; Rolandsen, Christer Moe/0000-0002-5628-0385",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [215647/E40]; Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme [223257],"The study was funded by the Research Council of Norway, project no. 215647/E40 (Intensified harvesting of forests - implications for enterprises related to wild and domestic ungulates).

Traits directly linked to cell/body stoichiometry, such as nutrient uptake and storage, as well as the associated trade-offs, have the potential to shape ecological interactions such as competition and predation within ecosystems. Further, traits that indirectly influence and are influenced by nutritional requirements, such as cell/body size and growth rate, are tightly linked to organismal stoichiometry. Despite their physiological and ecological relevance, traits are rarely explicitly integrated in the framework of ES and, currently, the major challenge is to more closely inter-connect ES with trait-based ecology (TBE). Here, we highlight four interconnected nutrient trait groups, i.e., acquisition, body stoichiometry, storage, and excretion, which alter interspecific competition in autotrophs and heterotrophs. We also identify key differences between producer-consumer interactions in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For instance, our synthesis shows that, in contrast to aquatic ecosystems, traits directly influencing herbivore stoichiometry in forested ecosystems should play only a minor role in the cycling of nutrients. We furthermore describe how linking ES and TBE can help predict the ecosystem consequences of global change. The concepts we highlight here allow us to predict that increasing N:P ratios in ecosystems should shift trait dominances in communities toward species with higher optimal N:P ratios and higher P uptake affinity, while decreasing N retention and increasing P storage.","[Meunier, Cedric L.; Boersma, Maarten] Helmholtz Zenfrum Polar & Meeresforsch AWI, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Alfred Wegener Inst, Helgoland, Germany; [Boersma, Maarten] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol Chem FB2, Bremen, Germany; [El-Sabaawi, Rana] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Halvorson, Halvor M.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Herstoff, Emily M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Van de Waal, Dedmer B.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vogt, Richard J.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Litchman, Elena] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Meunier, CL (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zenfrum Polar & Meeresforsch AWI, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Alfred Wegener Inst, Helgoland, Germany.",cedric.meunier@awi.de,"Meunier, Cedric L/K-2792-2015; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013; Herstoff, Emily/K-7137-2019; Van de Waal, Dedmer B/B-8002-2012","Meunier, Cedric L/0000-0002-4070-4286; Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X; Herstoff, Emily/0000-0001-5355-008X; Van de Waal, Dedmer B/0000-0001-8803-1247; Litchman, Elena/0000-0001-7736-6332",David Schindler Professorship of Aquatic Sciences at Trent University; Trent University; Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution,"This article summarizes the work done in the Workshop on Biological Stoichiometry and Trait-Based Ecology that took place during the Conference On Biological Stoichiometry (2015, Trent, Canada).

In those lakes, roach abundance was only little affected by the abiotic and biotic variables such as lake characteristics, water transparency, nutrient concentrations, pH or related variables, predation and competition. This was probably due to the generalist characteristics of the roach as it is adaptive to a wide variety of environments. Instead, the population structure and agespecific growth of the roach were strongly affected by various environmental variables. The growth rate was negatively related to water colour, calcium and nutrient concentration and roach abundance, and positively related to perch abundance and lake size. The growth patterns and relatively stable abundance showed flexibility in adaptation to different environmental conditions. Our results indicate that the ongoing environmental changes, recovery from acidification and brownification may notably affect the structure and production of roach populations, and may alter the role of the roach in lake ecosystems.","[Olin, Mikko; Estlander, Satu; Horppila, Jukka; Nurminen, Leena; Tiainen, Joni; Vinni, Mika; Lehtonen, Hannu] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Rask, Martti] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Survontie 9 A, FI-40500 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Olin, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",mikko.olin@helsinki.fi,"Olin, Mikko/I-9258-2012",,,,,57,2,2,0,21,FINNISH ENVIRONMENT INST,HELSINKI,"P O BOX 140, FIN-00251 HELSINKI, FINLAND",1239-6095,1797-2469,,BOREAL ENVIRON RES,Boreal Environ.

Our goal was to examine the hypothesis that during prelaying visits, cowbird females form a dynamic memory library of laying opportunities, which they deploy to target suitable nests at a later predawn period. We recorded presence of radio-tagged females within a fixed area around nests of chalked-browed mockingbirds, Mimus saturninus (a common host of shiny cowbirds), and baywings, Agelaioides badius (the main host of screaming cowbirds), using proximity data loggers placed at nests during prelaying, laying and early incubation. Our data confirmed that females of both species visit potential host nests prior to laying and that parasitic events occurred before dawn, earlier in screaming than shiny cow-birds but with little chance of host nests having been discovered on the laying day. There were interesting species differences: visits were less frequent in shiny than screaming cowbirds and the former rarely returned after laying, while screaming cowbirds visited nests repeatedly after laying and occasionally showed repeat parasitism. The higher frequency of revisiting by screaming cowbirds to baywing nests is consistent with the uncommonly long and variable baywing prelaying period, and the incidence of repeat parasitism may reflect low availability of baywing nests and greater flexibility of its parental care potential thanks to it being a social breeder. Significance statement Avian brood parasites synchronize their laying with that of their hosts, as this reduces egg rejection and optimizes hatching time. They also avoid parasitizing nests repeatedly, thus preventing harm to their own previously laid eggs and competition among their offspring. Further, they lay at dawn, so that location of target nests must be known from previous days' exploration. It has been argued that these adaptations must depend on memory for the location and status of host nests within their home range, a memory feat known as 'bookkeeping'. We study nest prospecting in a host specialist and a host generalist parasitic cowbird, using a combination of proximity radio tracking and video recordings. Our results confirm the prospecting hypothesis, report previously unknown interspecies differences and illustrate how cognitive adaptations can be studied in the context of field behavioural ecology.","[Scardamaglia, Romina C.; Fiorini, Vanina D.; Reboreda, Juan C.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Pabellon 2 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Scardamaglia, Romina C.; Fiorini, Vanina D.; Reboreda, Juan C.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, IEGEBA CONICET, Pabellon 2 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Kacelnik, Alex] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Scardamaglia, RC (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Pabellon 2 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.; Scardamaglia, RC (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, IEGEBA CONICET, Pabellon 2 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",rscardamaglia@ege.fcen.uba.ar,"Reboreda, Juan C/E-5548-2012; Scardamaglia, Romina/AAJ-3760-2021; Scardamaglia, Romina/AAJ-4635-2021","Scardamaglia, Romina/0000-0002-5400-6083; ",University of Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires [W808]; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y TecnologicaANPCyT [PICT-2011-0045],The study was funded by research grants of the University of Buenos Aires (W808) and Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICT-2011-0045).,,57,13,13,0,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

In particular, recovery of the critically endangered red wolf (Canis rufus) has been challenging because of its vulnerability to extinction via human-caused mortality and hybridization with coyotes (Canis latrans). Therefore, understanding red wolf space use and habitat selection is important to assist recovery because key aspects of wolf ecology such as interspecific competition, foraging, and habitat selection are well-known to influence population dynamics and persistence. During 2009-2011, we used global positioning system (GPS) radio-telemetry to quantify space use and 3rd-order habitat selection for resident and transient red wolves on the Albemarle Peninsula of eastern North Carolina. The Albemarle Peninsula was a predominantly agricultural landscape in which red wolves maintained spatially stable home ranges that varied between 25 km(2) and 190 km(2). Conversely, transient red wolves did not maintain home ranges and traversed areas between 122 km(2) and 681 km(2). Space use by transient red wolves was not spatially stable and exhibited shifting patterns until residency was achieved by individual wolves. Habitat selection was similar between resident and transient red wolves in which agricultural habitats were selected over forested habitats. However, transients showed stronger selection for edges and roads than resident red wolves. Behaviors of transient wolves are rarely reported in studies of space use and habitat selection because of technological limitations to observed extensive space use and because they do not contribute reproductively to populations. Transients in our study comprised displaced red wolves and younger dispersers that competed for limited space and mating opportunities. Therefore, our results suggest that transiency is likely an important life-history strategy for red wolves that facilitates metapopulation dynamics through short- and long-distance movements and eventual replacement of breeding residents lost to mortality.","[Hinton, Joseph W.; Chamberlain, Michael J.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Proctor, Christine; Kelly, Marcella J.; Vaughan, Michael R.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA; [van Manen, Frank T.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, Bozeman, MT USA","Hinton, JW (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jhinton@uga.edu,"Kelly, Marcella J/B-4891-2011","T. van Manen, Frank/0000-0001-5340-8489",North Carolina Department of Transportation VT - NCDOT [09-0776-10]; Warnell of School of Forestry and Natural Resources,This work was supported by the North Carolina Department of Transportation VT - NCDOT Contract No. 09-0776-10.

In maize, both species tend to infest the ear. The introduction of H. armigera in Brazil has created a new scenario, where these Helicoverpa species might cohabit and interact with one another, affecting the prevalence of each species in the agroecosystem, integrated pest management, and insect resistance management. In this study, larval occurrence and proportion of these species in maize was assessed in three regions of Brazil during three crop seasons. Interaction between the species was evaluated in interspecific and intraspecific scenarios under laboratory and field conditions. Helicoverpa zea was predominant in Rio Grande do Sul and the Planaltina, DF (central Brazil). In western Bahia, H. zea was predominant in the first collection, but approximately equal in number to H armigera in the second crop season. Both species exhibit high cannibalism/predation rates, and larval size was the primary factor for larval survival in the interaction studies. Larva of H. zea had higher survival when interacting with H. armigera, indicating that H. zea has an advantage in intraguild interactions with H. armigera in maize. Overall, the results from this study indicate that maize might play a role as a source of infestation or a sink of insecticide or Bt protein unselected H. armigera populations, depending on the H. zea:H. armigera intraguild competition and adult movement in the landscape.","[Bentivenha, Jose P.

Given that most plant mortality occurs in seeds and seedlings, recruitment success often predicts plant community assemblage and patterning, but observational patterns do not reveal whether plant populations are seed or habitat limited. Grassland plant species make up a sizable portion of the overall native flora in northeastern North America (N.A.), but approximately 30 % of the area's threatened and endangered flora are grassland species, possibly leftovers from the post-glacial landscape. Yet, close relatives of many rare grassland species thrive in the same range. We investigated whether seed or habitat limitation explained rarity and commonness in remnant grassland species. We used seed addition experiments coupled with microhabitat manipulations (burning and herbivore exclusion) in three different habitat types to evaluate recruitment (germination and seedling survival) limitation for three rare and three common grassland species. Rare grassland species successfully recruited where burning reduced initial competitor density, but seedling survival suggested they were severely limited by interspecific competition. Both the rare and common plant species survived equally well in forest habitats where herbaceous density was low whereas neither survived in the edge habitats. Only the common plants thrived in the high-competition meadow habitat, further suggesting that the rare grassland species are poor competitors. Commonness and rarity are temporal designations that can change as disturbance alters the landscape. Glacial retreat and low precipitation in northeastern N.A. created a landscape suitable for poor competitors that tolerated poor conditions. Our results suggest that rare remnant grassland plants, unlike their close relatives, display more biotic than abiotic limitation as they do not compete well with other plants. These results suggest that suitable habitat is not a spatial location but a temporally transient assemblage of species requirements.","[Candeias, M.; Warren, R.

The study was carried out in an agricultural area in SW Hungary and was based on scat analysis (jackal n = 373, fox n = 268 samples). The jackal primarily consumed small mammals in all seasons (mean biomass consumed: 72 %). The secondary food sources were wild ungulates (in winter and spring; mainly wild boar Sus scrofa, including piglets) and plants (in summer and autumn; mainly wild fruits). The consumption of cervids in winter and in spring was only detected in low proportions. The fox also primarily consumed small mammals (50.3 % of trophic niche breadth, B), but their consumption dropped in summer and autumn. Two-thirds of the summer and autumn diet consisted of plants, while the bird consumption was higher in spring and summer. The diet compositions of both predators were similar.

We evaluated if males of the South American tree frog (Hypsiboas pulchellus) select calling sites in undisturbed subtropical wetlands based on specific habitat cues. The study was designed to represent a snapshot of the male calling activity under low densities of intra-and interspecific competitors and little variation of climatic conditions. We characterized calling sites by measuring the vegetation attributes and flood levels of calling sites occupied by 59 males and comparing them to available microhabitats. We found that males exhibit some degree of selectivity for calling sites, often selecting microhabitats with greater density of vegetation > 50 cm tall. Calling site selection was not affected by water depth or area flooded. Most individuals vocalized in sites near the ground (<= 25 cm), a pattern that is the contrary to that expected to maximize sound propagation. We suggest that, due to the open habitat of the studied area, the choice of calling sites is more related to the need for shelter from predation and avoidance of desiccation and heat loss than to bioacoustic performance.","[Pio da Silva dos Santos, Nathalia Luiz; de Avila, Fernanda Rodrigues; de Oliveira, Mateus; Tozetti, Alexandro Marques] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Programa Posgrad Biol, Lab Ecol Vertebrados Terr, Ave Unisinos 950, BR-93022970 Sao Leopoldo, SP, Brazil; [Colombo, Patrick] Fdn Zoobot Rio Grande Sul, Museu Ciencias Nat, Secao Zool Vertebrados, Rua Doutor Salvador Franca 1-427, BR-90690000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","dos Santos, NLPD (corresponding author), Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Programa Posgrad Biol, Lab Ecol Vertebrados Terr, Ave Unisinos 950, BR-93022970 Sao Leopoldo, SP, Brazil.",alexandro.tozetti@gmail.com,"Colombo, Patrick/D-2989-2013","Colombo, Patrick/0000-0003-3957-3255; Rodrigues de Avila, Fernanda/0000-0002-1572-2722",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [446910/2014-7]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [2556/10]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do SulFundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS),"We thank many students from Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Laboratorio de Ecologia de Vertebrados Terrestres for their field assistance.

This study sought to investigate the effects of soil nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) heterogeneity on tree species diversity in the Xishuangbanna tropical seasonal rainforest in southwestern China. Thirty-nine plots of 400 m(2) (20 x 20 m) were randomly located in the Xishuangbanna tropical seasonal rainforest. Within each plot, soil nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) availability and heterogeneity, tree species diversity, and community phylogenetic structure were measured. Soil phosphorus heterogeneity and tree species diversity in each plot were positively correlated, while phosphorus availability and tree species diversity were not. The trees in plots with low soil phosphorus heterogeneity were phylogenetically over-dispersed, while the phylogenetic structure of trees within the plots became clustered as heterogeneity increased. Neither nitrogen availability nor its heterogeneity was correlated to tree species diversity or the phylogenetic structure of trees within the plots. The interspecific competition in the forest plots with low soil phosphorus heterogeneity could lead to an overdispersed community. However, as heterogeneity increase, more closely related species may be able to coexist together and lead to a clustered community. Our results indicate that soil phosphorus heterogeneity significantly affects tree diversity in the Xishuangbanna tropical seasonal rainforest, suggesting that deterministic processes are dominant in this tropical forest assembly.","[Xu, Wumei; Ci, Xiuqin; Song, Caiyun; Li, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Plant Phylogenet & Conservat Grp, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Wumei; Ci, Xiuqin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Tianhua] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA, Australia; [Zhang, Wenfu; Li, Qiaoming] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Li, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Plant Phylogenet & Conservat Grp, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Li, QM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",lqm@xtbg.ac.cn; jieli@xtbg.ac.cn,"He, Tianhua/Y-5372-2019","He, Tianhua/0000-0002-0924-3637","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31370267, 31500454]; CAS 135 program [XTBG-T01]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31370267 and 31500454; CAS 135 program, Grant/Award Number: XTBG-T01",,60,10,12,4,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Invasive crayfish alter invaded habitats causing community and population level impacts due to competition, predation and transmission of diseases. We experimentally evaluated the potential impacts of invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis) on native Piedmont crayfish (Cambarus sp. C) using size-matched pairs. We tested 1) species-specific aggressive behavior with aggression assays, and 2) survival in sympatry with survival analysis. Both invasive crayfish species tended to express higher levels of aggression compared to the native counterpart. However, we failed to detect any statistically significant differences. During survival experiments, the proportional survival of native Cambarus sp. C in sympatry with invasive O. virilis was significantly lower than that of invasive O. virilis. However, we did not find a significant difference in the proportional survival between invasive P. clarkii and native Cambarus sp. C. These experiments demonstrate inconsistent and limited negative impacts of two invasive crayfish species on a native species, when size-matched. Therefore, in order to make novel and effective decisions in managing these invasive species, it is critical to understand species-specific invasion dynamics and size-dependent potential impacts of invasive crayfish on native taxa.","[Hale, Patricia; Wilson, James; Henkanaththegedara, Sujan] Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA; [Loughman, Zachary] West Liberty Univ, Dept Nat Sci & Math, West Liberty, WV USA","Henkanaththegedara, S (corresponding author), Longwood Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",Henkanaththegedarasm@longwood.edu,,,Virginia Academy of Science Small Project Research Grant; Longwood University Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences; Longwood University Faculty Research Grant; Longwood University Perspectives on Research In Mathematics & Science (LU-PRISM) Summer Undergraduate Research Program,"We thank Bryan Ditursi and Jackson Wagstaff for helping with preliminary experiments which led to these experiments; Johnny Leder, Eric Salamon, Nicole Sadecky, Zachary Dillard and Samuel Hull for assistance in field sampling, setting up the experiments and crayfish care; Shawn Goodchild, Christoph Chucholl, Kit Magellan and two anonymous reviewers for reviewing an earlier draft of the manuscript; Virginia Academy of Science Small Project Research Grant, the Longwood University Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences, Longwood University Faculty Research Grant and Longwood University Perspectives on Research In Mathematics & Science (LU-PRISM) Summer Undergraduate Research Program for research funding.

Breeding phenology even in similar species can differ due to different selective pressures on the timing of reproduction. These selection pressures define species' responses to warming springs. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis suggests that timing of breeding in animals is selected to match with food availability (synchrony). Alternatively, time-dependent breeding success (the date hypothesis) can result from other seasonally deteriorating ecological conditions such as intra-or interspecific competition or predation. We studied the effects of two ultimate factors on the timing of breeding, synchrony and other time-dependent factors (time-dependence), in sympatric populations of two related forest-dwelling passerine species, the great tit (Parus major) and the willow tit (Poecile montanus) by modelling recruitment with long-termcapture-recapture data. We hypothesized that these two factors have different relevance for fitness in these species. We found that local recruitment in both species showed quadratic relationships with both time-dependence and synchrony. However, the importance of these factors was markedly different between the studied species. Caterpillar food played a predominant role in predicting the timing of breeding of the great tit. In contrast, for the willow tit time-dependence modelled as timing in relation to conspecifics was more important for local recruitment than synchrony. High caterpillar biomass experienced during the pre- and post-fledging periods increased local recruitment of both species. These contrasting results confirm that these species experience different selective pressures upon the timing of breeding, and hence responses to climate change may differ. Detailed information about life-history strategies is required to understand the effects of climate change, even in closely related taxa. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis should be extended to consider subsequent critical periods when food needs to be abundantly available.","[Pakanen, Veli-Matti; Orell, Markku; Vatka, Emma; Rytkonen, Seppo] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Broggi, Juli] UO CISC, Res Unit Biodivers, UMIB, PA, Ed Invest 5a C Gonzalo Gutierrez Quiros S-N, Mieres 33600, Spain; [Broggi, Juli] Lund Univ, Sect Evolutionary Ecol, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Pakanen, VM (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",veli-matti.pakanen@oulu.fi,"Pakanen, Veli-Matti/L-8134-2015; Broggi, Juli/AAB-1796-2020","Broggi, Juli/0000-0002-1706-4014","Academy of Finland, Research Council for Biosciences and EnvironmentAcademy of Finland [128193, 258638, 278759]; Thule Institute of the University of Oulu; Foundations' Professor Pool","The Academy of Finland, Research Council for Biosciences and Environment (to MO, project numbers 128193 and 258638; to VMP, project number 278759) http://www.aka.fi/en/, Thule Institute of the University of Oulu (to MO) http://www.oulu.fi/thuleinstitute/, and Foundations' Professor Pool (to MO) http://www.professoripooli.fi/index_en.php?cat=1&lang=3.",,55,12,12,0,29,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,SEP 9,2016,11,9,,,,,,,e0162643,10.1371/journal.pone.0162643,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,DV9JE,WOS:000383255900143,27611971,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

When immatures exhibit decreased feeding competency, these differences are attributed to a spectrum of experience-and strength-related constraints and are often linked to qualitative assessments of food difficulty. However, few have investigated age-related differences in feeding ability relative to mechanical property variation across the diet, both within and among food types. In this study, we combined dietary toughness and feeding behavior data collected in the wild from cross-sectional samples of two primate taxa, Sapajus libidinosus and Trachypithecus phayrei crepusculus, to test the prediction that small-bodied juveniles are less efficient at processing tough foods than adults. We defined feeding efficiency as the time spent to ingest and masticate one food item (item bout length) and quantified the toughness and size of foods processed during those feeding bouts. To make the datasets comparable, we limited the dataset to foods processed by more than one age class and opened without tools. The overall toughness of foods processed by both species overlapped considerably, and juveniles and adults in both taxa processed foods of comparable toughness. Feeding efficiency decreased in response to increasing food toughness in leaf monkeys and in response to food size in both taxa. Age was found to be a significant predictor of bout length in leaf monkeys, but not in bearded capuchins. Juvenile S. libidinosus processed smaller fruits than adults, suggesting they employ behavioral strategies to mitigate the effect of consuming large (and occasionally large and tough) foods. We suggest future intra-and interspecific research of juvenile feeding competency utilize intake rates scaled by food size and geometry, as well as by detailed measures of feeding time (e.g., ingestion vs. mastication), in addition to food mechanical properties to facilitate comparisons across diverse food types and feeding behaviors. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the former is widespread in mammals, rodents and other small mammals usually exhibit low levels of sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Here, we investigate patterns of sexual dimorphism in 34 vole species belonging to the subfamily Arvicolinae in a phylogenetic comparative framework. We address the potential role of sexual selection and fecundity selection in creating sex differences in body size. No support was found for hyperallometric scaling of male body size to female body size. We observed a marginally significant relationship between SSD and the ratio of male to female home range size, with the latter being positively related to the level of intrasexual competition for mates. This suggests that sexual selection favours larger males. Interestingly, we also found that habitat type, but not mating system, constitutes a strong predictor of SSD. Species inhabiting open habitats - where males have extensive home ranges in order to gain access to as many females as possible - exhibit a higher mean dimorphism than species inhabiting closed habitats, where females show strong territoriality and an uniform distribution preventing males to adopt a territorial strategy for gaining copulations. Nonetheless, variation in the strength of sexual selection is not the only selective force shaping SSD in voles; we also found a positive association between female size and litter size across lineages. Assuming this relationship also exists within lineages (i.e. fecundity selection on female size), this suggests an additional role for variation in the strength of fecundity selection shaping interspecific differences in female size, and indirectly in SSD. Therefore our results suggest that different selective processes act on the sizes of males and females, but because larger size is favoured in both sexes, SSD is on average relatively small.","[Garcia-Navas, Vicente; Bonnet, Timothee; Postma, Erik] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bonal, Raul] Univ Extremadura, INDEHESA, Forest Res Grp, Plasencia, Spain","Garcia-Navas, V (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",vicente.garcianavas@gmail.com,"Postma, Erik/B-7258-2008; Bonnet, Timothee/B-8899-2015","Postma, Erik/0000-0003-0856-1294; Bonnet, Timothee/0000-0001-7186-5288; BONAL, RAUL/0000-0002-6084-1771; Garcia-Navas, Vicente/0000-0002-9362-2663",Forschungskredit of the Univ. of Zurich [FK-14-103]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [SNF-31003A-141110]; 'Atraccion de Talento Investigador' programme (Gobierno de Extremadura),"Sara Magalhaes improved an earlier version of this manuscript.

Species may reach oceanic islands by three mechanisms: (1) mating flights of reproductives, (2) rafting, and (3) human-assisted dispersal. Past land bridge connections may be important for continental shelf islands. Patterns of species accumulation may be similar even when primary mechanisms of dispersal differ. Colonizing propagules are limited primarily by the presence of suitable habitat and interspecific competition or predation from other ants. Although island area is usually a significant predictor of species richness, the diversity of habitat types is often a better predictor. Distance, or isolation, has often been found to be only a weak predictor of ant species richness, probably because many islands that have been studied are not very distant relative to most species' dispersal abilities. Interspecific competition appears to result in mutually exclusive distributions within islands for some of the more aggressive species, although the effects of habitat affinities have not been well studied. With the exception of very small islands, competition does not appear to result in exclusions of species from entire islands, and robust patterns of nestedness have been observed. Populations go extinct from and immigrate to small islands in ecological time, although such turnover appears to be relatively low compared with other arthropods. Only a few archipelagoes, however, have been the focus of turnover studies. Some species may reach extremely high population abundances on islands but subsequently decline. The exact mechanisms underlying these population fluctuations are not known with certainty, although the presence of honeydew-producing insects has often been associated with the most dramatic cases. Endemicity varies greatly and ranges from 0 to > 96%, peaking at intermediate distances in the Pacific and reaching the highest levels on islands in the Indian Ocean. Anthropogenic disturbances appear to present the greatest driver of change to insular ant communities and result in increasing numbers and abundances of exotic ant species, which may have deleterious effects on the rest of the community.","[Morrison, Lloyd W.] Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 S Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA","Morrison, LW (corresponding author), Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 S Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA.",LloydMorrison@MissouriState.edu,,,National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society,"Thanks to Nicholas Gotelli and Florian Steiner for inviting me to write this article, and to Ken Helms and an anonymous reviewer for their insightful comments.

Previously proposed models provide a theoretical framework that is herein applied to three sets of level-bottom communities representing different phases of the Jurassic diversification of marine life. The analysis shows that mean alpha-diversity remained surprisingly constant through most of the Jurassic, whereas beta-diversity increased by a factor of 2.6 during the same time interval. Diversification that is primarily driven by increasing beta-diversity is indicative of late diversification phases in ecosystems with low interspecific competition and/or high predation, as typical for marine level-bottom communities. Although generality of this conclusion is not claimed because of data limitations, the example demonstrates that the study of diversity partitioning provides a promising approach to the basic question about the factors that control the diversification of life.","[Hautmann, Michael] Univ Zurich, Palaontol Inst & Museum, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Hautmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Palaontol Inst & Museum, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",michael.hautmann@pim.uzh.ch,"Hautmann, Michael/E-3656-2012","Hautmann, Michael/0000-0002-7322-8749",,,,46,4,4,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0891-2963,1029-2381,,HIST BIOL,Hist.

In aquaria, we tested the effect of differing densities of both un-branched and branched stalks, where the amount of material in the branched stalk equaled four-times that of the un-branched. The results clearly showed that it was the amount of material, not how it was arranged, that elicited responses from shrimp. Also, although stalks were not purposefully designed to mimic structural elements found in nature, they did resemble biogenic structure such as hydroids, algae, or plants. In order to test shrimp attraction to a different, perhaps more unfamiliar habitat type, we examined responses to plastic army men. These structural elements elicited similar attraction of shrimp, and, in general, shrimp response correlated well with the fractal dimension of both stalks and army men. Overall, these results indicate that attraction to physical structure, regardless of its nature, may be an important driver of high abundances often associated with complex habitats.","[Crooks, Jeffrey A.] Tijuana River Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Imperial Beach, CA 91932 USA; [Crooks, Jeffrey A.; Chang, Andrew L.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Tiburon, CA USA; [Ruiz, Gregory M.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Crooks, JA (corresponding author), Tijuana River Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Imperial Beach, CA 91932 USA.; Crooks, JA (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Tiburon, CA USA.",jcrooks@trnerr.org,"Chang, Andrew/J-8058-2016","Chang, Andrew/0000-0002-7870-285X; Ruiz, Gregory/0000-0003-2499-441X",Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; Maryland Sea Grant Program [R/IS-10],"Portions of this work were funded by the Smithsonian Institution and the Maryland Sea Grant Program (R/IS-10).

Reduced growth and survival are a function of insect population and defoliation level. It is feasible to make short-term (annual) predictions of insect population and defoliation based upon sampling, but long-term, multi-year predictions are problematic. Given the historical record, it is expected that outbreaks will occur with relatively predictable frequency and basic host relationships and abiotic constraints will not change dramatically. However, the precision of predictions at fine scales is variable and reduced over time. Relationships between tree growth reduction, survival, and cumulative defoliation or beetle population level are available for major insect species. Understanding insect outbreak effects hinges on mortality, changes in interspecies competition, regeneration, and succession. Altered stand dynamics caused by insects can be interpreted for indicators such as wildlife habitat, old forest, riparian buffer cover, viewscapes, and connectivity. Anthropogenic changes are altering impacts via range expansions, northward shifts, and changes in forest composition. We can better understand effects of insect outbreaks and how best to ameliorate damage through a combination of empirical permanent plot studies, modelling, and manipulative experiments.","[MacLean, David A.] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, POB 4400, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada","MacLean, DA (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, POB 4400, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada.",macleand@unb.ca,"MacLean, David A/G-6011-2011","MacLean, David A/0000-0002-0314-4435",,,,130,35,35,0,35,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0008-347X,1918-3240,,CAN ENTOMOL,Can.

Consecutive satellite images of the same area through time are commonly used to assess landscape changes, and image data are increasingly used to generate predictor variables for species-habitat models. A time series of satellite images has, however, rarely been used in conjunction with a species-habitat model to map changes in habitat extent or to predict wildlife-habitat dynamics through time. We used a time series of forest disturbance encompassing 16530km(2) of forestland in Maine to map and quantify change in forest types that influence probability of occurrence (POC) of the threatened Canada lynx Lynx canadensis. Integration with a predictive occurrence model developed from landscape conditions c. 2004 allowed us to retrospectively (1973-2004) assess changes at 2- to 4-year intervals, update predictions (2004-2010) and project the spatial distribution and extent of lynx foraging habitat over the next decade. Between 1975 and 1991, 40% of mature conifer forest in our study area was removed by stand-replacing harvests, coincident with the last regional outbreak of eastern spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.). As those areas regenerated between 1991 and 2010, POC increased dramatically as broad-scale habitat conditions for lynx's primary prey, snowshoe hare Lepus americanus, improved. Projections suggest that continued forest regrowth will provide new habitat over the next decade, but fragmentation will increase, and by 2022 the habitat distribution will shift southwards into areas where climate change or interspecific competition may limit lynx population expansion.Synthesis and applications. Conservation planning for vagile species that depend on ephemeral forest types, such as the Canada lynx in the north-eastern USA, requires habitat monitoring strategies that can adapt to changing landscape conditions. Although Maine's lynx population has increased since the 1990s, we recommend that continued monitoring of lynx habitat and population status is critical given habitat and climate uncertainty. We also recommend that habitat management efforts be targeted not only at areas currently occupied by lynx but also where habitat loss is expected to occur near-term from succession or in anticipation of the next budworm outbreak.","[Simons-Legaard, Erin M.; Harrison, Daniel J.] Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Simons-Legaard, Erin M.; Legaard, Kasey R.] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Simons-Legaard, EM (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.; Simons-Legaard, EM (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",erin.simons@maine.edu,,"Legaard, Kasey/0000-0003-2874-8734; Simons-Legaard, Erin/0000-0002-9815-2285",Maine Cooperative Forestry Research Unit; Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station at the University of Maine; US Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; US Geological Survey Maine Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research UnitUnited States Geological Survey; US Forest Service Agenda 20/20 Program; National Council on Air and Stream Improvement; University of Maine Center for Research on Sustainable Forests; Nature Conservancy; USDA National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [MEO-M-6-00470-11],"This research was funded by Maine Cooperative Forestry Research Unit, Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station at the University of Maine, US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Geological Survey Maine Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, US Forest Service Agenda 20/20 Program, National Council on Air and Stream Improvement, University of Maine Center for Research on Sustainable Forests, and The Nature Conservancy.

The processes resulting in predictable community structure (e.g. particular host behaviours, cross-immunity, interspecific competition) could be affected by traits that vary within a parasite species, like growth or antigenicity. We experimentally infected three-spined sticklebacks with a large tapeworm (Schistocephalus solidus) that impacts the energy needs, foraging behaviour and immune reactions of its host. The tapeworms came from two populations, characterized by high or low growth in sticklebacks. Our goal was to evaluate how this parasite, and variation in its growth, affects the acquisition of other parasites. Fish infected with S.solidus were placed into cages in a lake to expose them to the natural parasite community. We also performed a laboratory experiment in which infected fish were exposed to a fixed dose of a common trematode parasite. In the field experiment, infection with S.solidus affected the abundance of four parasite species, relative to controls. For two of the four species, changes occurred only in fish harbouring the high-growth S.solidus; one species increased in abundance and the other decreased. These changes did not appear to be directly linked to S.solidus growth though. The parasite exhibiting elevated abundance was the same trematode used in the laboratory infection. In that experiment, we found a similar infection pattern, suggesting that S.solidus affects the physiological susceptibility of fish to this trematode. Associations between S.solidus and other parasites occur and vary in direction. However, some of these associations were contingent on the S.solidus population, suggesting that intraspecific variability can affect the assembly of parasite communities.","[Benesh, Daniel P.; Kalbe, Martin] Max Planck Inst Evolut Biol, August Thienemann Str 2, D-24306 Plon, Germany; [Benesh, Daniel P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Benesh, DP (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Evolut Biol, August Thienemann Str 2, D-24306 Plon, Germany.; Benesh, DP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",daniel.benesh@lifesci.ucsb.edu,"Benesh, Daniel/M-8998-2019","Benesh, Daniel/0000-0002-4572-9546","DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [BE 5336/1-1, KA 2970/1-1]","The authors would like to thank R.

Here, we take advantage of the divergent vocalizations of two closely related howler monkey species (Alouatta pigra and A. palliata) to better understand vocal evolution. In addition to comparing multiple acoustic and temporal features of roars and the calling bouts in which they are produced, we tested several predictions. First, A. pigra should have roars with lower fundamental frequency and lower formant dispersion because they are larger than A. palliata and have a larger hyoid apparatus. Second, A. pigra should have faster calling rates, longer roars, longer bouts, and exaggerated call features linked to vocal effort (e.g., nonlinear phenomena and emphasized frequencies) because they are the more aggressive species during intergroup encounters. We found significant interspecific differences supporting our predictions in every tested parameter of roars and bouts, except for roar duration and barking rate. Stepwise discriminant function analyses identified the best features for differentiating roars (acoustic features: formant dispersion followed by highest frequency; temporal features: longest syllable duration followed by number of syllables). Although resembling each other more than they resemble South American howler monkeys, our comparison revealed striking differences in the vocalizations of the two Mesoamerican species. While we cannot completely rule out the influence of body size or the environmental conditions in which the two species evolved, vocal differences were likely influenced by sexual selection. The exaggerated roars and intense calling patterns in A. pigra seem more suitable for intergroup competition, whereas A. palliata calls may be better suited for mate attraction and competition within groups. With interspecific acoustic differences quantified, we will now be able to examine how vocalizations contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of the A. palliata x A. pigra hybrid zone in southern Mexico.

We know now from theory and work in experimental and model systems that these processes can feed back on each other on mutually relevant time-scales. Here, we present evidence of a soil-mediated eco-evolutionary feedback on the population dynamics of an invasive biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata. As populations age, natural selection drives down production of A.petiolata's important antimycorrhizal allelochemical, sinigrin. This occurs due to density-dependent selection on sinigrin, which is favoured under interspecific, but disfavoured under intraspecific, competition. We show that population stochastic growth rates ((S)) and plant densities are positively related to sinigrin concentration measured in seedling roots. This interaction is mediated by sinigrin's positive effect on seedling and summer survival, which are important drivers of (S). Together, these illustrate how the evolution of a trait shaped by natural selection can influence the ecology of a species over a period of just years to decades, altering its trajectory of population growth and interactions with the species in the soil and plant communities it invades. Our findings confirm the predictions that eco-evolutionary feedbacks occur in natural populations. Furthermore, they improve our conceptual framework for projecting future population growth by linking the variation in plant demography to a critical competitive trait (sinigrin) whose selective advantages decrease as populations age.","[Evans, Jeffrey A.; Davis, Adam S.] Univ Illinois, ARS, USDA, Global Change & Photosynth Res Unit, Turner Hall,1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Lankau, Richard A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, 2502 Miller Plant Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Raghu, S.] CSIRO, GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Raghu, S.] USDA ARS Australian Biol Control Lab, GPO Box 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Landis, Douglas A.] Ctr Integrated Plant Syst Lab, 578 Wilson Rd,Room 204, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lankau, Richard A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Plant Pathol, Russell Labs Bldg,1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Evans, JA (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, ARS, USDA, Global Change & Photosynth Res Unit, Turner Hall,1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jeffrey.evans@ars.usda.gov,"Lankau, Richard A/B-9760-2008; Raghu, S./A-1281-2010; Landis, Douglas A./L-7991-2019","Lankau, Richard A/0000-0001-9995-328X; Raghu, S./0000-0001-5843-5435; Davis, Adam/0000-0002-7196-1197",NSF DEB Award [0918450]; USDA CSREES AwardUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35320-15312]; EPA STARUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [FP-91650101]; Michigan State Plant Sciences Fellowship; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Life Sciences,"We wish to thank the many field and laboratory assistants who collected data for this project, land owners and managers who provided access to field sites, Rachel Nodurft for assistance with the quantitative genetics study and Doug Schemske for his role in the original demography study.

Species planted or sown in sites where they naturally occur are expected to perform better or equally well compared to sites at which they do not occur or are rare. This, however, contrasts with the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and commonly reported intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback. The few previous studies indicating poorer performance of plants at sites where they naturally occur did not explore the mechanisms behind this pattern. Aims and Methods In this study, we used field translocation experiments established using both seeds and seedlings to study the determinants of local abundance of four dominant species in grass-lands. To explore the possible effects of intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback on our results, we tested the effect of local species abundance on the performance of the plants in the field experiment. In addition, we set up a garden experiment to explore the intensity of intraspecific as well as interspecific feedback between the dominants used in the experiment. Key Results In some cases, the distribution and local abundances of the species were partly driven by habitat conditions at the sites, and species performed better at their own sites. However, the prevailing pattern was that the local dominants performed worse at sites where they naturally occur than at any other sites. Moreover, the success of plants in the field experiment was lower in the case of higher intraspecific abundance prior to experimental setup. In the garden feedback experiment, two of the species performed significantly worse in soils conditioned by their species than in soils conditioned by the other species. In addition, the performance of the plants was significantly correlated between the two experiments, suggesting that plant-soil feedback is a likely explanation of the patterns observed in the field. Conclusions All of the results indicate that intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback, either biotic or abiotic, may be a key factor determining the performance of the plants in our field translocation experiment. The possible effects of negative feedback should thus be considered when evaluating results of translocation experiments in future studies.","[Knappova, Jana; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hemrova, Lucie; Knappova, Jana; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic","Munzbergova, Z (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Prague, Czech Republic.; Munzbergova, Z (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.",zuzmun@natur.cuni.cz,"Knappova, Jana/I-7197-2016; Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013; Hemrova, Lucie/H-1590-2014","Knappova, Jana/0000-0002-8095-2583; Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220; Hemrova, Lucie/0000-0003-4058-9975","grant Agency of Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [16-09659S]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Ministry of Education of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic; European Social Fund (ESF)European Social Fund (ESF) [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0048]; national budget of the Czech Republic through the Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness (OPEC)","The work was supported by the grant Agency of Czech Republic (www.gacr.cz, Grant no. 16-09659S to ZM) and partly by the Czech Academy of Sciences (www.cas.cz, RVO 67985939), and by Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic (www.msmt.cz).

The growth dynamics of Z. japonica at its upper and lower distributional limits in the intertidal zone were investigated in Koje Bay on the southern coast of Korea to examine the environmental stresses and limiting factors on the growth of intertidal seagrasses. The shoot density and morphology, biomass, and leaf productivity of Z. japonica were measured in relation to coincident measurements of environmental factors at its upper and lower distributional limits and in an intermediate zone of the intertidal area. The mean exposure time to the atmosphere during low tide in the upper intertidal zone was approximately 1.5- and 1.9-fold longer than that in the intermediate and lower intertidal zones, respectively. Shoot density and biomass were significantly higher in the intermediate zone than at the upper and lower distributional limits. Longer emersion leading to a various of environmental stresses appeared to reduce Z. japonica growth in the upper intertidal zone, whereas interspecific competitive interactions related to irradiance seemed to affect Z. japonica growth in the lower intertidal zone. Shoot size, density, biomass, and leaf productivity were lower in the upper than in the lower zone, implying that emersion-associated stresses in the upper zone had a greater detrimental effect on Z. japonica growth than did stresses occurring in the lower zone. The productivity of Z. japonica showed strong positive correlations with air and water temperature, suggesting enhancement of Z. japonica production at higher temperatures. Thus, the predicted increases in air and water temperature associated with global climate change might have positive effects on the growth and extension in distributional range of this species.

These aquatic systems are dominated by a high prokaryotic diversity, shaped by the stress of low nutrient supplies and interspecific competition. Although fungi constitute a diverse and important component of microbial diversity, the microfungal diversity in the CCB remains to be unveiled. With the aim to explore microfungal diversity and ecological patterns in this area, we present the first investigation analyzing cultivable taxa from sediment and water, as well as lignocellulolytic taxa obtained from incubated submerged plant debris, and wood panels in three contrasting freshwater systems in the CCB: Churince, Becerra and Pozas Rojas. We chose a culture-based approach to analyze sediment and water samples in order to obtain fungal cultures, providing opportunities for a posteriori studies, and the possibility of ex situ preservation of the diversity. We evaluated sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer including the 5.8 rDNA region for 126 isolates, revealing 37 OTUs. These OTUs were phylogenetically affiliated to several genera in the fungal phyla: Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota. We recorded two OTUs with saline affinity, agreeing with previous findings on the prokaryotic communities with ancestral marine resemblances. All the studied systems showed moderate diversity levels, however discrepancies among the diversity indexes were observed, due to the occurrence of abundant taxa in the samples. Our results indicated that lignocellulolytic microfungal communities are dominated by transient fungal taxa, as resident species were not recorded perhaps as a result of the long-term strong competition with the highly adapted prokaryotic community. Moreover, the obtained microfungal taxa occurred mostly on the resident plant debris, rather than submerged wood panels, perhaps as a result of the high adaptation to specific environmental conditions. In conclusion, the CCB possess a moderate taxonomical diversity compared to other arid environments, probably as a result of high selective pressures. Nonetheless, due to high spatial and temporal heterogeneity, the functional fungal diversity was considerable as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Decisively, the assessment of microfungal diversity freshwater systems is relevant, since this ecological group of microorganisms represents an important indicator of trophic complexity and biotic interactions among microbial communities, having important implications for understanding eukaryotic survival at the oligotrophic limit for life.","[Velez, Patricia; Gasca-Pineda, Jaime; Eguiarte, Luis E.; Espinosa-Asuar, Laura; Souza, Valeria] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Rosique-Gil, Edmundo] Univ Juarez Autonoma Tabasco, Div Acad Ciencias Biol, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico","Velez, P; Souza, V (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",pvelezaguilar@gmail.com; souza.valeria2@gmail.com,"ASUAR, LAURA ESPINOSA/AAJ-9223-2021","souza, valeria/0000-0002-2992-4229; Rosique-Gil, Edmundo/0000-0002-1028-6650; Espinosa-Asuar, Laura/0000-0001-5540-8837",Alianza WWF- Fundacion Carlos Slim project; DGAPA-UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),"This work was carried out with the financial support from the Alianza WWF- Fundacion Carlos Slim project.

Thus, it is difficult to determine the real ecological role of this group in ecosystems and how their communities are structured. In the present study, we analyzed the diet of six co-occurring Neotropical land planarians and their success in capturing prey, based on experiments in the laboratory, in order to determine how they share resources in the same environment. We also calculated indices of food niche breadth and food niche overlap for land planarians for the first time. The diet of Luteostriata abundans comprises only woodlice and the diets of Obamaficki and Obama ladislavii are composed only of gastropods, while Paraba multicolor and Obama anthropophila feed on both gastropods and other land planarians. An invasive species recently found in Western Europe, Obama nungara, showed the highest food niche breadth, feeding on gastropods, earthworms and planarians. We found the highest niche overlap between O. anthropophila and P. multicolor. The results suggest that land planarians are frequent predators of woodlice and land gastropods in the Neotropical ecozone and thus are important for the maintenance of native ecosystems and for the control of invasive species. The coexistence of several species in the same habitat is possible due to the use of different species as main prey, which reduces interspecific competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

This study analyzed the effect of season and vegetation type on community structure. Pitfall traps baited with human dung were sampled at six sites on three dates (early rainy season, dog days, and late rainy season). In total, 4,040 beetles in 17 species were trapped. Vegetation type and sampling season affected average dung beetle abundance, species richness, and Simpson diversity index. Scrublands had more abundance and richness but least diversity than grasslands. Abundance diminished during dog days but richness increased during this season and the rains after it. Diversity had an inverse pattern with more during early rains than during the dog days or late rains. The community structure was determined by microhabitats for nesting provided by the combination of vegetation type and soil compaction. Telecoprids like Canthon humectus (Say) were dominant as predicted for Mexican arid zones; paracoprids were present in deeper soils and endocoprids in shallower soils. Abundance increased during periods of rainfall and diminished during dog days, which increased richness. This change because of vegetation and season could indicate a strategy to reduce interspecific competition by partial partitioning of the ecological niche. This was the first faunistical and ecological work and provided the first dung beetle records for the municipality.","[Lizardo, Viridiana; Castellanos-Vargas, Ivan] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Lizardo, Viridiana] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Colecc Nacl Insectos CNIN, Dept Zool, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Lizardo, V (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.; Lizardo, V (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Colecc Nacl Insectos CNIN, Dept Zool, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",lizardova@ciencias.unam.mx,"Lizardo, Viridiana/AAA-2605-2021","Lizardo, Viridiana/0000-0003-3958-3373",,,,33,4,4,5,13,SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC,DALLAS,"17360 COIT RD, DALLAS, TX 75252-6599 USA",0147-1724,2162-2647,,SOUTHWEST ENTOMOL,Southw.

In the Pacific Northwest, USA, salmonid management plans have typically focused on degraded freshwater habitat, dams, fish passage, harvest rates, and hatchery releases. However, such plans inadequately address threats related to human population and economic growth, intra-and interspecific competition, and changes in climate, ocean, and estuarine conditions. Based on reviews conducted on eight conservation and/or recovery plans, we found that though threats resulting from such changes are difficult to model and/or predict, they are especially important for wide-ranging diadromous species. Adaptive management is also a critical but often inadequately constructed component of those plans. Adaptive management should be designed to respond to evolving knowledge about the fish and their supporting ecosystems; if done properly, it should help improve conservation efforts by decreasing uncertainty regarding known and diffuse threats. We conclude with a general call for environmental managers and planners to reinvigorate the adaptive management process in future management plans, including more explicitly identifying critical uncertainties, implementing monitoring programs to reduce those uncertainties, and explicitly stating what management actions will occur when pre-identified trigger points are reached.","[Maas-Hebner, Kathleen G.; Hughes, Robert M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Schreck, Carl] Oregon State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oregon Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hughes, Robert M.] Oregon State Univ, Amnis Opes Inst, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Yeakley, J.

Such an effect will likely be observed in the abundance of polar cod, Boreogadus saida (Lepechin, 1774), as well as interspecific interactions of this intermediate-level trophic taxon, particularly in more southerly fringing seas in the Arctic. Polar cod and capelin, Mallotus villosus (Muller, 1776), are pelagic, planktivorous forage fishes, which occupy similar dietary niches and are the primary prey of marine predators. Co-occurring polar cod and capelin were collected at seven stations in Darnley Bay, NT, during August 2013. Standard length (SL), used as a proxy for age, suggested that polar cod (mean +/- A 1 SD: 71.1 +/- A 10.3 mm) were predominantly age 1+ and capelin (96.2 +/- A 13.4 mm) were mostly age 2+. Stomach content analyses indicated that both species feed extensively on calanoid copepods (Calanus hyperboreus, C. glacialis, Metridia longa) and amphipods (Themisto libellula). There was high dietary overlap between capelin and polar cod, evidenced by Schoener's index (0.80). Additionally the quantity of dietary items, biomass and energetic content consumed differed among size classes in both capelin (SL, 70.5-132.0 mm) and polar cod (SL, 42.1-114.4 mm). This study illustrates that the diets of these sympatric forage fishes in an Arctic ecosystem are very similar, indicating a high potential for interspecific competition as the sub-Arctic capelin expands its range into Arctic regions with climate change.","[McNicholl, D.

Data were collected from January 2013 to January 2015 by positioning camera traps in 200 sample stations. During 3479 trap days, we collected 1048 independent videos of target carnivore species, which revealed a general spatial coexistence among carnivores with some differences in seasonal occurrence of species. The red fox and the European badger showed temporal segregation, as their activity patterns suggested a differential use of night-time in all seasons. Activity patterns of the red fox and the wolf revealed moderate-high overlap and similar density distributions in all seasons except during winter. Coexistence between these species may be allowed by temporal segregation during winter and spatial segregation during spring. Finally, results regarding the European badger and the wolf suggest a moderate temporal segregation with a marked avoidance effect for the European badger induced by the presence of tracks left by wolves. Programmes aimed at carnivore conservation, and management should treat the entire guild, as it has been demonstrated that populations of different carnivores interact with each other in complex ways and that fine-scale mechanisms regulating carnivore assemblage influence different aspects of natural communities.","[Torretta, E.] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Torretta, E.; Serafini, M.; Puopolo, F.; Schenone, L.] Antola Reg Pk, Via Provvidenza 3, I-16029 Genoa, Italy; [Puopolo, F.; Schenone, L.] Aveto Reg Pk, Via Marre 75, I-16041 Genoa, Italy","Torretta, E (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.; Torretta, E (corresponding author), Antola Reg Pk, Via Provvidenza 3, I-16029 Genoa, Italy.",torretta.elisa@gmail.com; teos.teos@libero.it; fpuopolo@libero.it; fpuopolo@libero.it,,,Regional Administration of Liguria (ROP/ERDF funds); Regional Administration of Liguria; Aveto Regional Park (RDP funds),"We are very grateful to A.

Ecology may play a role in acoustic divergence through direct selection (e.g., local adaptation to abiotic environment), constraint of correlated traits (e.g., acoustic traits linked to another trait under selection), and/or interspecific competition (e.g., character displacement). However, genetic drift alone can also drive acoustic divergence. It is not always easy to differentiate the role of ecology versus drift in acoustic divergence. In this study, we tested the role of ecology and drift in shaping geographic variation in the advertisement calls of Microhyla fissipes. We examined three predictions based on ecological processes: (1) the correlation between temperature and call properties across M. fissipes populations; (2) the correlation between call properties and body size across M. fissipes populations; and (3) reproductive character displacement (RCD) in call properties between M. fissipes populations that are sympatric with and allopatric to a congener M. heymonsi. To test genetic drift, we examined correlations among call divergence, geographic distance, and genetic distance across M. fissipes populations. We recorded the advertisement calls from 11 populations of M. fissipes in Taiwan, five of which are sympatrically distributed with M. heymonsi. We found geographic variation in both temporal and spectral properties of the advertisement calls of M. fissipes. However, the call properties were not correlated with local temperature or the callers' body size. Furthermore, we did not detect RCD. By contrast, call divergence, geographic distance, and genetic distance between M. fissipes populations were all positively correlated. The comparisons between phenotypic Q(st) (P-st) and F-st values did not show significant differences, suggesting a role of drift. We concluded that genetic drift, rather than ecological processes, is the more likely driver for the geographic variation in the advertisement calls of M. fissipes.","[Lee, Ko-Huan; Shaner, Pei-Jen L.; Lin, Si-Min] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, 88,Sec 4,TingZhou Rd, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Yen-Po] Taiwan Endem Species Res Inst, Div Zool, Nantou, Taiwan","Lin, SM (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, 88,Sec 4,TingZhou Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.",fish@ntnu.edu.tw,"Lee, Ko-Huan/AAQ-5309-2021","Lee, Ko-Huan/0000-0001-5577-8619; Shaner, Pei-Jen/0000-0001-8112-4299","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 102-2621-B-003-003-MY3, NSC 103-2923-B-003-001-MY3]","This work was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (NSC 102-2621-B-003-003-MY3 and NSC 103-2923-B-003-001-MY3).",,65,23,23,2,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, there have only been few studies that have assessed the relative and absolute contribution of different modes of selfing to total reproductive isolation acting between species. Because selfing can be expected to increase fitness costs when offspring are sired from more outcrossing sister taxa, it can be hypothesized that the contribution of post-zygotic barriers to total reproductive isolation becomes stronger in selfing than in more outcrossing relatives. To assess the efficiency of different modes of selfing against heterospecific mating, we conducted mixed-pollination experiments in three Centaurium species showing strong differences in mating system (i.e. delayed selfing in Centaurium erythraea, competing selfing in C.littorale and prior selfing in C.pulchellum). The contribution of selfing to total reproductive isolation was further examined by quantifying the strength of three pre-zygotic (flowering phenology, pollinator fidelity and pollen production) and four intrinsic post-zygotic (seed set and germination, survival and flowering capacity) barriers for each of the six species pair combinations. Although autonomous selfing as a reproductive barrier was unable to completely impede gene flow, its efficiency as a mechanism to prevents heterospecific pollination strongly depended on the mode of selfing, with prior selfing being by far the most efficient mechanism and delayed selfing only offering a limited protection against hybrid fertilization at the end of a flower's lifetime. Apart from the prevention effect of selfing, differences in pollinator fidelity and pollen production also contributed substantially to total reproductive isolation. Post-zygotic hybrid costs were high and most prevalent for seed production and germination success. Reductions in hybrid vigour were significantly associated with the mating system of the maternal species, with the highest reductions in the most selfing C.pulchellum and the lowest reductions in predominant outcrossing C.erythraea.Synthesis. Our findings indicate that selfing may prevent species from interspecific gene flow and hybridization. The association between the capacity to self-autonomously and hybrid vigour further suggests that selfing may foster post-zygotic costs following hybridization.","[Brys, Rein] Res Inst Nat & Forest, Kliniekstr 25, BE-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Brys, Rein; van Cauwenberghe, Jannick; Jacquemyn, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Heverlee, Belgium","Brys, R (corresponding author), Res Inst Nat & Forest, Kliniekstr 25, BE-1070 Brussels, Belgium.; Brys, R (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Heverlee, Belgium.",rein.brys@inbo.be,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; , Rein/0000-0002-0688-3268; Van Cauwenberghe, Jannick/0000-0002-2934-5542",European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [260601 - MYCASOR]; Flemish Fund for Scientific Research (FWO)FWO [G.0982.13],"Both RB and HJ were supported by the European Research Council (ERC starting grant 260601 - MYCASOR) and the Flemish Fund for Scientific Research (FWO, project G.0982.13).",,55,22,24,1,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Determining factors that influence interactions between species provides a framework for understanding evolution in natural environments. Plethodontid salamanders are model taxa frequently used to study species interactions in regard to competition, coexistence, and exclusion. Past studies have suggested that P. ventralis and P. websteri exhibit character displacement in color and may competitively interact when in sympatry. We studied P. ventralis and P. websteri at a sympatric location in Jefferson County, Alabama and compared this population to allopatric populations of each species to identify whether these species differed in morphology and diet, which are indicators for interspecific competition. We found that P. ventralis and P. websteri differed in head shape, in general, and that head shape differed among populations within species. However, we did not find significant shifts within species between allopatric and sympatric locations, which would have indicated character displacement or convergence. Furthermore, species did not differ in diet at any of the studied locations. Interestingly, we discovered that variation in head shape among locations of both species, regardless if the location was allopatric or sympatric, was significant. This result reiterates the importance of including population variation in the context of character displacement and competition. Results of this study can be placed in a robust theoretical context developed from numerous studies of salamander interactions and, thus, lead to a greater understanding of population variation, competition, and species interactions between ecologically similar species.","[Deitloff, Jennifer; Floyd, Claire; Graham, Sean P.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 331 Funchess Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Deitloff, Jennifer] Lock Haven Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 301 W Church St, Lock Haven, PA 17745 USA; [Floyd, Claire] Sci Port Louisianas Sci Ctr, Shreveport, LA 71101 USA; [Graham, Sean P.] Univ Findlay, Dept Biol, 1000 N Main St, Findlay, OH 45840 USA; [Graham, Sean P.] Sul Ross State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Phys Sci, Box C-64, Alpine, TX 79832 USA","Deitloff, J (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 331 Funchess Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.; Deitloff, J (corresponding author), Lock Haven Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 301 W Church St, Lock Haven, PA 17745 USA.",jmd240@lhup.edu; clairecfloyd@gmail.com; sean.graham@sulross.edu,,,,,,68,1,1,0,14,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,MAR,2016,104,1,,,,,233,242,,10.1643/CE-15-319,,,10,Zoology,Zoology,DM2OK,WOS:000376185900028,,,,,2021-09-21,

Relatively few studies on hypoxia and its effects on benthic macrofauna have been done in tropical marine ecosystems. This study describes the temporal response of the water column, sediments and macrofauna to seasonal hypoxia in a semi-enclosed bay (Cienfuegos, Caribbean Sea). The Calisito site was sampled monthly from June 2010 until February 2012, yielding 21 sampling times. At each sampling event water and sediment samples were collected for measuring the abiotic variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, redox potential discontinuity, silt/clay and organic matter content) and macrofauna (abundance and species richness). Temperature and surface salinity followed a typical temporal pattern during the summer/rainy and the winter/dry periods. Salinity stratification occurred in the rainy period, lasting three months in 2010 and six months in 2011. The bottom water dissolved oxygen indicated hypoxic and anoxic events during the wet periods of 2010 and 2011 associated with salinity stratification, low hydrodynamics and oxidation of the accumulated organic matter. Over the study period, 817 individuals were collected and identified. Polychaetes were the dominant group in terms of abundance (57 % of total) followed by mollusks (41%). Hypoxia (and occasionally anoxia) caused strong deleterious effects on the abundance and species richness of macrofaunal communities in the study site. The most abundant polychaetes were opportunistic species with high tolerance to hypoxic conditions: Prionospio steenstrupi, Polydora sp.and Paraprionospio pinnata. Most of them colonized relatively fast once hypoxia ended. Persistent species such as Caecztm pulchellum and Parvanachis obesa were present during hypoxia with fluctuating densities and apparently recover to higher abundances when normoxic conditions are re-established. Macoma tenta and Tellina consobrina colonized approximately 1-2 months later than the first polychaete peak during normoxia. Probably, the deleterious effects of hypoxia on the macrofauna were intensified by negative interspecific relationships such as competition by suitable space and predation. The recolonization of macrofauna depended possibly on local transport by currents within the bay because the connection with the Caribbean Sea is relatively limited. In summary, seasonal hypoxia in Cienfuegos Bay influences the water and sediment geochemistry and reduces both the abundance and diversity of macrofauna.","[Diaz-Asencio, Lisbet; Helguera, Yusmila; Fernandez-Garces, Raul; Gomez-Batista, Miguel; Rosell, Guillermo; Hernandez, Yurisbey; Pulido, Anabell] Minist Ciencia Tecnol & Medio Ambiente, Ctr Estudios Ambient Cienfuegos, Carretera Castillo Jagua Km 1-5, Cienfuegos 59350, Cuba; [Armenteros, Maickel] Univ La Habana, Ctr Invest Marinas, Playa 11300, Habana, Cuba","Diaz-Asencio, L (corresponding author), Minist Ciencia Tecnol & Medio Ambiente, Ctr Estudios Ambient Cienfuegos, Carretera Castillo Jagua Km 1-5, Cienfuegos 59350, Cuba.",lisbet@ceac.cu; yusmilahelguera@ceac.cu; rfg@gestion.ceac.cu; miguel@ceac.cu; maickel@cim.uh.cu,"Armenteros, Maickel/C-6103-2008; Armenteros, Maickel/U-4672-2019","Armenteros, Maickel/0000-0002-9736-9247; ","Cuban Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Provincial Dependency of Cienfuegos [6.03.64]; International Foundation for Science (IFS)International Foundation for Science [A/4004-2]; Environmental Analysis Laboratory from the Centro de Estudios Ambientales de Cienfuegos","The Cuban Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Provincial Dependency of Cienfuegos, Project No. 6.03.64 conferred the financial support for this research.

The first is the land-tenure hypothesis, which predicts that carnivores regulate their density through territoriality and temporal avoidance. The second is the kinship hypothesis, which predicts related individuals will be clumped within populations, and the third is the resource dispersion hypothesis, which suggests that resource richness may explain variable sociality, spatial overlap or temporary aggregations of conspecifics. Research on the socio-spatial organization of animals is essential in understanding territoriality, intra- and interspecific competition, and contact rates that influence diverse ecology, including disease transmission between conspecifics and courtship behaviours. We explored these hypotheses with data collected on a solitary carnivore, the cougar (Puma concolor), from 2005 to 2012 in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem, Wyoming, USA. We employed 27 annual home ranges for 13 cougars to test whether home range overlap was better explained by land tenure, kinship, resource dispersion or some combination of the three. We found support for both the land tenure and resource dispersion hypotheses, but not for kinship. Cougar sex was the primary driver explaining variation in home range overlap. Males overlapped significantly with females, whereas the remaining dyads (F-F, M-M) overlapped significantly less. In support for the resource dispersion hypothesis, hunting opportunity (the probability of a cougar killing prey in a given location) was often higher in overlapping than in non-overlapping portions of cougar home ranges. In particular, winter hunt opportunity rather than summer hunt opportunity was higher in overlapping portions of female-female and male-female home ranges. Our results may indicate that solitary carnivores are more tolerant of sharing key resources with unrelated conspecifics than previously believed, or at least during periods of high resource availability. Further, our results suggest that the resource dispersion hypothesis, which is typically applied to social species, is applicable in describing the spatial organization of solitary carnivores.","[Elbroch, L.

Which ecological processes could structure these patterns? Possible processes include dispersal limitation, self-thinning, facilitation and competition between species and life stages. LocationA tropical broad-leaved forest in north-central Vietnam. MethodsWe used univariate and bivariate pair-correlation functions to investigate the spatial distribution and association patterns of 18 abundant tree species. To disentangle first- and second-order effects, we used a scale separation approach with the heterogeneous Poisson process as null model. Results(1) Sixteen of 18 species had aggregated patterns at various scales and regardless of their abundance. (2) Significant and aggregated patterns were found in 64% of all specific life stages. (3) At scales up to 15m, 12.4% species pairs showed significant associations, among that 71% were spatial attractions, 5% were spatial repulsions and 24% were non-essential interactions. (4) In different life stage associations, attractions (81%) predominated over repulsions (19%) at small scales of up to 15m. ConclusionsOur findings provide evidence that dispersal limitation may regulate the spatial patterns of tree species. Moreover, positive spatial associations between tree species and life stages suggest the presence of species herd protection and/or facilitation in this forest stand, while the persistence of intraspecific aggregation through life stages suggests a very late onset or even absence of self-thinning. Habitat heterogeneity plays an important role for species distribution patterns, and the spatial segregation occurs at a scale around 15m in this forest.","[Hong Hai Nguyen; Wiegand, Kerstin] Univ Gottingen, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Dept Ecosyst Modelling, Buesgenweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Hong Hai Nguyen] Vietnam Forestry Univ, Fac Silviculture, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Uria-Diez, Jaime] Univ Navarra, Dept Environm Biol, Irunlarrea S-N, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Uria-Diez, Jaime] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Resource Management, Fac Forest Sci, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Nguyen, HH (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Dept Ecosyst Modelling, Buesgenweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.; Nguyen, HH (corresponding author), Vietnam Forestry Univ, Fac Silviculture, Hanoi, Vietnam.",hnguyen@uni-goettingen.de; juriadiez@gmail.com; mail@kerstin-wiegand.de,"Hai, Nguyen Hong/AAD-7602-2019; Uria-Diez, Jaime/H-3651-2019","Nguyen, Hai/0000-0001-5066-7565; Wiegand, Kerstin/0000-0003-4854-0607",Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam,This study was supported with funds from the Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam.

Morphologically, similar species are expected to be ecologically alike and exhibit little niche differentiation, which makes it difficult to explain the co-occurrence of cryptic species. Here, we investigated interspecific niche differentiation within a complex of cryptic bumblebee species that co-occur extensively in the United Kingdom. We compared the interspecific variation along different niche dimensions, to determine how they partition a niche to avoid competitive exclusion. We studied the species B. cryptarum, B. lucorum, and B. magnus at a single location in the northwest of Scotland throughout the flight season. Using mitochondrial DNA for species identification, we investigated differences in phenology, response to weather variables and forage use. We also estimated niche region and niche overlap between different castes of the three species. Our results show varying levels of niche partitioning between the bumblebee species along three niche dimensions. The species had contrasting phenologies: The phenology of B. magnus was delayed relative to the other two species, while B. cryptarum had a relatively extended phenology, with workers and males more common than B. lucorum early and late in the season. We found divergent thermal specialisation: In contrast to B. cryptarum and B. magnus, B. lucorum worker activity was skewed toward warmer, sunnier conditions, leading to interspecific temporal variation. Furthermore, the three species differentially exploited the available forage plants: In particular, unlike the other two species, B. magnus fed predominantly on species of heather. The results suggest that ecological divergence in different niche dimensions and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the environment may contribute to the persistence of cryptic species in sympatry. Furthermore, our study suggests that cryptic species provide distinct and unique ecosystem services, demonstrating that morphological similarity does not necessarily equate to ecological equivalence.","[Scriven, Jessica J.; Whitehorn, Penelope R.; Tinsley, Matthew.

Since biofilm bacteria are faced with starvation and other environmental stress (e.g., antibiotics from competitors, oxidative stress from host immune systems), it behooves them to be able to ramp down their metabolism in a highly regulated manner and enter a resting state known as persistence to weather stress. Hence, persister cells are metabolically dormant cells that arise predominantly as a response to stress through elegant gene regulation that includes toxin/antitoxin systems. In this review, an analysis is made of the genetic pathways that lead to persistence, of cell signaling via the interspecies and interkingdom signal indole that leads to persistence, and the means found to date for combatting these cells which are frequently tolerant to a range of antibiotics.

As many as 94 out of every 100 individual arthropods in rainforests are ants [1], and they constitute up to 15% of animal biomass in the Amazon [2, 3]. Moreover, ants are pervasive agents of natural selection as over 10,000 arthropod species are specialized inquilines or myrmecomorphs living among ants or defending themselves through mimicry [4, 5]. Such impact is traditionally explained by sociality: ants are the first major group of ground-dwelling predatory insects to become eusocial [3], increasing efficiency of tasks and establishing competitive superiority over solitary species [6, 7]. A wealth of specimens from rich deposits of 99 million-year-old Burmese amber resolves ambiguity regarding sociality and diversity in the earliest ants. The stem-group genus Gerontoformica maintained distinct reproductive castes including morphotypes unknown in solitary aculeate (stinging) wasps, providing insight into early behavior. We present rare aggregations of workers, indicating group recruitment as well as an instance of interspecific combat; such aggression is a social feature of modern ants. Two species and an unusual new genus are described, further expanding the remarkable diversity of early ants. Stem-group ants are recovered as a paraphyletic assemblage at the base of modern lineages varying greatly in size, form, and mouthpart structure, interpreted here as an adaptive radiation. Though Cretaceous stem-group ants were eusocial and adaptively diverse, we hypothesize that their extinction resulted from the rise of competitively superior crown-group taxa that today form massive colonies, consistent with Wilson and Ho lldobler's concept of dynastic succession.''","[Barden, Phillip; Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Barden, Phillip] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Grimaldi, David A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Grimaldi, David A.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA","Barden, P (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.; Barden, P (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",pbarden@amnh.org,,"Barden, Phillip/0000-0001-6277-320X",Richard Gilder Graduate School (AMNH); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1313547],"We thank Tyler Janovitz, James Zigras, and Scott Anderson for providing specimens; Stefan Cover, Gavin Broad, and Vincent Perrichot for advice, hosting visits, and providing access to specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Natural History Museum in London, and University of Rennes, respectively; Morgan Hill and Henry Towbin at the AMNH Microscopy and Imaging Facility and Mark Riccio at the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center Imaging Facility for assistance with CT imaging; Paul Nascimbene (AMNH) for amber preparation of delicate and important specimens; and Steve Thurston for figure preparation.

Curiously, little attention has been paid to the qualitative and quantitative variation of the seed-stored molecules and on their ecological significance. Here, we analysed the oil content and oil composition of ca. 200 weed seed species from agricultural fields in France based on single seed accessions, concentrating on interspecies differences and ignoring within-species variation. The relationships between seed weight, oil %, fatty acids (FAs) and the energetic value of the seed and its antioxidant properties were also investigated. The antioxidant activity could contribute to protect the oily seed reserves from alteration over time. Among the species analysed, we found a considerable quantitative (oil%) and qualitative variation of FAs stored in the seeds. Such variation was largely related to the plant family of the different species, but intrafamily variation was also found. Heavier seeds contained less oil on a per gram basis than lighter seeds, suggesting a trade-off between seed weight and oil ratio in the seed and that oil storage strategy depends on seed size. Moreover, oily seeds contained more polyunsaturated FAs. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we did not found a higher antioxidant capability in oily seed extracts than in non-oily seeds, nor to the quantitative or to the qualitative variation of FAs in the seeds. Considering the role of these important trait variations on weed ecological strategies, such as germination period, seed predation rate and competition-colonisation trade-off, could improve the sustainable management of weed communities.","[Bretagnolle, F.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Biogeosci UMR6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Bretagnolle, F.] CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Matejicek, A.; Reboud, X.; Gaba, S.] INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, F-21065 Dijon, France; [Gregoire, S.] INRA, Ctr Sci Gout & Alimentat, UMR1324, Dijon, France","Bretagnolle, F (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Biogeosci UMR6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.; Bretagnolle, F (corresponding author), CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",francois.bretagnolle@u-bourgogne.fr,"Gaba, Sabrina/H-5240-2018","Gaba, Sabrina/0000-0002-7145-6713",ANR SysterraFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [STRA-08-02 Advherb],The authors would like to acknowledge Emilie Cadet for the access on seed collection and Youssef Mouacha for seed lipid extraction and Michel Prost from the SPIRAL Society.

In Madagascar, several small spatial scale studies have shown that anthropogenic habitat modification affects the density and distribution of many lemur species. Ecological niche models can be used to examine broad-scale influences of anthropogenic impacts on primate distributions. In this study, we examine how climate and anthropogenic factors influence the distribution of 11 Eulemur species using ecological niche models. Specifically, we created one set of models only using rainfall and temperature variables. We then created a second set of models that combined these climate variables with three anthropogenic factors: distance to dense settlements, villages, and croplands. We used MaxEnt to generate all the models. We found that the addition of anthropogenic variables improved the climate models. Also, most Eulemur species exhibited reduced predicted geographic distributions once anthropogenic factors were added to the model. Distance to dense settlements was the most important anthropogenic factor in most cases. We suggest that including anthropogenic variables in ecological niche models is important for understanding primate distributions, especially in regions with significant human impacts. In addition, we identify several Eulemur species that were most affected by anthropogenic factors and should be the focus of increased conservation efforts.","[Kamilar, Jason M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Anthropol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Kamilar, Jason M.] Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Kamilar, Jason M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Tecot, Stacey R.] Univ Arizona, Sch Anthropol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Kamilar, JM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Anthropol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.; Kamilar, JM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.; Kamilar, JM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",jkamilar@umass.edu,"Tecot, Stacey/AAN-6933-2020","TECOT, STACEY/0000-0002-6640-5049",,,,90,13,13,0,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0164-0291,1573-8604,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

Uncertainties in predicting responses of these ecosystems to climate change arise from high tree species diversity, complex links between eco-physiology and demography, and the role of ontogeny and competition in mediating individual tree responses to climate. The dynamic nature of second-growth forests adds further uncertainty to our ability to quantify the relative importance of climate in mediating successional trajectories. To address these uncertainties, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian neighbourhood modelling approach that quantifies how the joint response of two key functional axes, wood density and specific leaf area (SLA), modulate impacts of inter-annual variation in seasonal water stress (number of days during dry season >1kPa vapour pressure deficit) and night-time temperature on growth and survival of small (5-10cm dbh) and large (10cm dbh) trees for 171 rainforest species in 6s-growth and 2 old-growth 1-ha mapped stands. We use model results to examine potential climate impacts on the successional trajectories of these stands. High water stress reduced large tree growth but favoured growth of small trees. Drought also reduced tree survival for both large and small trees. Tree species with high wood density suffered lower growth reductions and had higher survival under water stress. High SLA magnified the negative effects of water stress on tree growth and survival. Across all tree sizes, high night-time temperatures did not influence growth or survival. Simulated successional trajectories under different climate scenarios using these results suggest that multi-annual droughts will have substantial impacts of the successional trajectories of tropical forests, leading to lower stem numbers, basal area and biomass. Sustained drought will also shift functional composition of second-growth forest by favouring species with low SLA which tend to dominate in late stages of succession. By incorporating trait-mediated effects on key drivers of tree demography and successional dynamics, our approach provides an integrated perspective on interspecific variation in vulnerability to drought and consequences for successional trajectories in tropical rainforests. Our results suggest that multi-annual drought stress will significantly alter structure, composition and dynamics of second-growth forests and, from a functional perspective, accelerate succession. However, this effect may be hampered by dispersal limitation of old-growth species into second-growth forests.","[Uriarte, Maria; Lasky, Jesse R.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Boukili, Vanessa K.; Chazdon, Robin L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Uriarte, M (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mu2126@columbia.edu,"Chazdon, Robin/O-9766-2018","Chazdon, Robin/0000-0002-7349-5687; Boukili, Vanessa/0000-0002-5950-2123","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-1137239, DEB-1050957]; Andrew Mellon Foundation; UConn Research Foundation; US NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0424767, 0639393, 1147429]; NASA ROSES Grant [NNH08ZDA001N-TE]; US NSF (GRFP) [DEB-1110722]","M.U. acknowledges financial support from U.S. National Science Foundation (award EF-1137239 and DEB-1050957).

However, the ability of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to form embryonic chimeras remains in question. Here we show using a stage-matching approach that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the capacity to participate in normalmouse development when transplanted into gastrula-stage embryos, providing in vivo functional validation of hPSC pluripotency. hiPSCs and hESCs form interspecies chimeras with high efficiency, colonize the embryo in a manner predicted from classical developmental fate mapping, and differentiate into each of the three primary tissue layers. This faithful recapitulation of tissue-specific fate post-transplantation underscores the functional potential of hPSCs and provides evidence that human-mouse interspecies developmental competency can occur.","[Mascetti, Victoria L.; Pedersen, Roger A.] Univ Cambridge, Anne McLaren Lab, Wellcome Trust Med Res Council, Dept Surg,Cambridge Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge CB2 0SZ, England; [Mascetti, Victoria L.; Pedersen, Roger A.] Univ Cambridge, British Heart Fdn, Ctr Regenerat Med, Cambridge CB2 0SZ, England","Mascetti, VL (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Anne McLaren Lab, Wellcome Trust Med Res Council, Dept Surg,Cambridge Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge CB2 0SZ, England.; Mascetti, VL (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, British Heart Fdn, Ctr Regenerat Med, Cambridge CB2 0SZ, England.",vlm37@cam.ac.uk,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1R21ID012228]; Medical Research Council/British Heart FoundationUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)British Heart Foundation [G1000847]; British Heart FoundationBritish Heart Foundation; British Heart Foundation Centre of Regenerative Medicine [RM/13/3/3015]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G0600275, G1000847, G0800784] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant No. 1R21ID012228 (R.A.P.); Medical Research Council/British Heart Foundation grant No. G1000847 (R.A.P.); British Heart Foundation Ph.D. studentship (V.L.M.); British Heart Foundation Centre of Regenerative Medicine (Oxford grant RM/13/3/3015); core support from the Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute; and the Cambridge NIHR Biomedical Research Centre.

The latter are matriarchies, and bear only a superficial similarity to those of the lion and cheetah, which evolved separately and in response to very different selection pressures. There is no evidence for intraspecific social behavior in the ancestral species Felis silvestris, and hence, the capacity for group formation almost certainly evolved concurrently with the self-domestication of the cat during the period 10,000 to 5,000 years before present. Social groups of F. catus are characterized by cooperation among related adult females in the raising of kittens from parturition onward and competition between adult males. Unlike more social Carnivora, cats lack ritualized submissive signals, and although peck-order hierarchies can be constructed from exchanges of aggressive and defensive behavior, these do not predict reproductive success in females, or priority of access to key resources, and thus do not illuminate the basis of normal cat society. Cohesion in colonies of cats is expressed as, and probably maintained by, allorubbing and allogrooming; transmission of scent signals may also play a largely uninvestigated role. The advantages of group living over the ancestral solitary territorial state have not been quantified adequately but are likely to include defense of permanent food sources and denning sites and protection against predators and possibly infanticide by invading males. These presumably outweigh the disadvantages of communal denning, enhanced transmission of parasites, and diseases. Given the lack of archaeological evidence for cats kept as pets until some 4,000 years before present, intraspecific social behavior was most likely fully evolved before interspecific sociality emerged. Signals directed by cats toward their owners fall into 3 categories: those derived from species-typical actions, such as jumping up, that become signals by association; signals derived from kitten-to-mother communication (kneading, meow); and those derived from intraspecific cohesive signals. Social stress appears widespread among pet cats, stemming from both agonistic relationships within households and territorial disputes with neighborhood cats, but simple solutions seem elusive, most likely because individual cats vary greatly in their reaction to encounters with other cats.

Information about the predominant fishing arts, catch per effort unit and seasonality of fish production, as well as environmental information, were also obtained. Monthly field campaigns for sampling were done, when the researchers followed the fishing activity, making a detailed record of the catches and the employed fishing gears. It was found that gill net is the least selective among the four modalities practiced, but it is the only one which has legal support. Higher selective fishing gears, such as trawls, cast nets and fishing beat, act mainly on tilapia, a non-native species whose exploitation could be considered beneficial to the conservation of the native fish populations through the reduction of the interspecific competition for resources. Thus it is suggested the restriction of the use of less selective fishing equipment and the liberation of fishing gear that targets the non-native species of cichlids, aiming to reduce the fishing pressure on indigenous species.","[David, Gianmarco Silva] APTA, Polo Ctr Oeste Jau, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Genova de Castro Campanha, Paula Maria; Maruyama, Lidia Sumile] IP APTA SAA SP, Inst Pesca, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Carvalho, Edmir Daniel] UNESP Botucatu, Inst Biociencias, Botucatu, SP, Brazil","David, GS (corresponding author), APTA, Polo Ctr Oeste Jau, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",gianmarco@apta.sp.gov.br; pgenova@pesca.sp.gov.br,"Maruyama, Lidia/AAR-7861-2020",,,,,39,4,4,1,10,INST PESCA,SAO PAULO,"AV FRANCISCO MATARAZZO, 455, SAO PAULO, SP 05001-900, BRAZIL",0046-9939,1678-2305,,BOL INST PESCA,Bol.

However, increasing habitat structural complexity has been shown to reduce cannibalism through a reduction in encounter rates and the provision of more refuge and oviposition sites. This study investigated the use of different rearing media and its ability to mitigate cannibalism in the predatory mite Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman & McGregor). The rearing substrates tested were buckwheat husks, gorse husks, rice husks, vermiculite, and wheat bran, which were compared against a control treatment with no substrate. These laboratory experiments were done in two different relative humidities (70% and 85%) with both water and pollen (Typha orientalis Presl) supplementation. The rearing media had a strong significant effect on populations of A. limonicus while humidity did not. Rice husk was found to hold the highest populations of the predator, whereas the control and wheat bran treatments had the lowest. The higher populations associated with the rice husk treatment were attributed to a decrease in encounter rates, the provision of additional shelter and oviposition sites, and low mould infestation. Issues with sampling bias, effects of mould in the system, and potential applications of rice husk are discussed.","[Lee, Ming Hui; Zhang, Zhi-Qiang] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Zhang, Zhi-Qiang] Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland, New Zealand","Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.; Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland, New Zealand.",ZhangZ@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/L-6079-2019","Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/0000-0003-4172-0592","Core funding for Crown Research Institutes from Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE); Plant & Food Research (Christchurch)","This paper is part of the MSc thesis of MHL who thanks Landcare Research (Auckland) for providing all the necessary equipment and facilities.

In CNP, H. bimaculata occurs in the absence of other fish species and major invertebrate predators along an approximately 1000 m elevation gradient. This allowed for the examination of trait variation along the gradient without the confounding effects of interspecific interactions or habitat patchiness. Heterandria bimaculata exhibited traits characteristic of a low-predation environment: balanced sex ratio, slow growth, late maturity and large female size. Females produced more, smaller eggs from upstream to downstream, but overall reproductive allocation remained constant along the gradient. Maximum male length and annual growth rates increased from upstream to downstream, but female growth showed no trend. The patterns of growth and reproductive allocation tradeoff are consistent with predicted response to a longitudinally-increasing productivity gradient in which food resources become more abundant downstream. Macrobrachium and Bellastoma could have caused some predation, but were sparse and patchily distributed. Fish density remained fairly constant among elevations; if food resources were limiting in upstream habitats, per-capita resource availability would be lower and density-dependent competition would drive selection for larger but fewer, more competitive offspring. Future work should quantify longitudinal changes in productivity and conduct experiments to decouple the effects of stream order and fish density dependence.","[Olinger, Charles T.; Peoples, Brandon K.; Frimpong, Emmanuel A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Peoples, Brandon K.] Operat Wallacea, Wallace House, Spilsby PE23 4EX, Lincs, England","Frimpong, EA (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",colinger@vt.edu; bpeoples@vt.edu; frimp@vt.edu,,,Operation Wallacea,"This project was funded by Operation Wallacea.

We investigated the foraging strategy of a widely spread community consisting of Desert hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii), Midday gerbils (Meriones meridianus), Northern three-toed jerboas (Dipus sagitta) and Long-eared hedgehogs (Hemiechinus auritus) in the Alashan Desert, China. The aim was to analyse foraging as a result of biotic and abiotic factors in undisturbed habitats, i.e. we did not manipulate any surrounding conditions and all animals were free ranging. Three habitats were investigated, named after the dominant species: Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, Corispermum sp. and Zygophyllum pterocarpum. The following results can be summarised: (1) we found no or only slight differences for the GUD within the habitats between open and sheltered places; (2) lunar illumination affected foraging during waxing and waning moon phases within the first part of the night; (3) ambient temperature and the presence of moonlight resulted in changes in the interspecific competition that impacted the GUD; and (4) we determined prominent differences amongst habitats within the four moon phases, especially between the more covered habitats Ammopiptanthus and Zygophyllum, in contrast to the Corispermum habitat with its sparse coverage ratio. In general, foraging effort was elevated in the more covered habitats. We found a preferred foraging activity in warm and dark parts of the night which may lead to elevated inter-individual competition resulting in higher GUDs. Warmer periods were preferred in nights with constant light conditions, although resource competition was again elevated. We concluded that the foraging strategy was mainly affected by habitat, whereas moonlight and temperature modulate the resulting GUD in undisturbed environments. The availability of vegetal shelters influences foraging only in detail.","[Roschlau, C.] Univ Stuttgart, Dept Anim Physiol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Scheibler, E.] Univ South Wales, Sch Appl Sci, Treforest, Wales","Scheibler, E (corresponding author), Univ South Wales, Sch Appl Sci, Fac Comp Engn & Sci, Alfred Russel Wallace Bldg, Glyntaff Treforest CF37 4AT, Wales.",elke.scheibler@southwales.ac.uk,,,"Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Margarete-von-Wrangell programme; Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany","This work was supported by the Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg and the European Social Fund, by the Margarete-von-Wrangell programme.

Whilst some recovery has been observed, this has been restricted to the shallows (a parts per thousand currency sign5 m). We report a newly discovered, isolated population recovery on Banco Capiro, Honduras, representing the largest recorded post-mortality densities beyond the shallowest environments (0.74-2.27 individuals m(-2) at depths a parts per thousand yen10 m) alongside an unusually high mean percentage scleractinian coral cover of 49-62 %, likely no coincidence. On the nearby island of Utila, we report D. antillarum densities of 0.003-0.012 individuals m(-2) and scleractinian coral cover of 12 % at depths a parts per thousand yen10 m, typical for a contemporary Caribbean coral reef. The three order of magnitude disparity in population density between sites separated by < 60 km presents a unique opportunity to investigate barriers preventing their region-wide recovery by simultaneously addressing a range of previously proposed hypotheses. Despite concerns over the impacts of asynchronous spawning in low-density populations, we find that recruitment is occurring on Utila. This suggests that, whilst Allee effects are likely to be a contributing factor, the major barriers suppressing recovery are instead impacting juvenile survival into adulthood. Similarly, variations in heterospecific echinoids, interspecific competitors, and nutrient availability fail to account for population differences. Instead, we highlight a lack of structural complexity on contemporary Caribbean reefs as the most likely explanation for the limited recovery through a lack of provision of juvenile predation refugia, representing a further consequence of the recent ubiquitous phase shifts throughout the region. Using these findings, we propose future management strategies to stimulate recovery and, consequently, reef health throughout the Caribbean.","[Bodmer, Max D.

Topographically simple but physically harsh intertidal benches supported eight or nine species of generally small body size [mean shell length (SL) 22 mm] but relatively high population density (0.2 m(-2)). Structurally more complex, physically benign, subtidal coral reef platforms supported more species (7-19, mean = 12) of much broader size range and larger mean SL (41 mm), but at lower population densities (0.02-0.14 m(-2)). Most species (85 %) preyed on polychaete worms. One preyed exclusively on a hemichordate worm, two on fishes, and three on gastropods. In general, species specialized more on different prey taxa than different microhabitats. These results are generally consistent with those previously reported for Conus spp. assemblages in similar habitats elsewhere in the tropical Indo-Pacific. They support the hypotheses that (1) resource partitioning, especially of food resources but also of microhabitats, facilitates assemblages of numerous co-occurring Conus spp. and their avoidance of interspecific competition, and (2) ecological differentiation has contributed importantly to the striking Cenozoic adaptive radiation of Conus. The fieldwork, in 1957-1958, also provides baseline data for future studies of how changing marine environmental conditions affect coral reef-associated biotas.","[Kohn, Alan J.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Kohn, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kohn@uw.edu,,"Kohn, Alan/0000-0002-3223-4923","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GB-17735, 0316338]","The Yale Seychelles Expedition was made possible by the generosity of the late Alfred C.

Spatial heterogeneity, or patchiness, has been recognized as an important feature in a number of lake systems. In this study, we analysed changes in the seasonal dynamics of fish community in a subtropical lake over one year, focusing on the spatial and temporal distribution of fish biomass and species composition. Mangueira is a large shallow lake (3 m deep in average, 90 km long, 3-10 km wide, approximate to 820 km(2)) located along the Atlantic coast-line in southern Brazil (33 degrees 31'22S 53 degrees 07'48W). Mangueira Lake presents longitudinal gradients in both biotic and abiotic factors, and a principal components analysis (PCA) showed temporal and spatial gradients in the system. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed significant differences between the north and south extremes of Mangueira Lake. Secchi transparency (p < 0.001), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (p = 0.03) and chlorophyll a (p < 0.001) were identified as the driving factors for this spatial gradient. A two-way ANOVA was adjusted for each data set. Chlorophyll a (p = 0.017), fish captures (p = 0.033) and fish richness (p = 0.026) were different according to the sampling site (after removing the seasonal effect), while only fish richness presented significant seasonal variation after removing the sampling site effect (p = 0.041). This longitudinal gradient can be related to two main driving pressures. The first is prevailing winds from northeast to southwest, with predictable consequences for the whole trophic cascade. The other structuring pressure is the interface of the Taim wetland with northern Mangueira Lake. Thus, the northern part presents more turbid water, muddy sediments and increased chlorophyll a concentration, while the southern part is characterized by increased water transparency, less chlorophyll a concentration and more PVI (percent volume infested) of submerged macrophytes, demonstrating the spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem.","[Rodrigues, Lucia Ribeiro; Marques, David da Motta] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul, Lab Ecotecnol & Limnol, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Fontoura, Nelson Ferreira] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Fac Biociencias, Lab Ecol Aquat, BR-90619900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","Rodrigues, LR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul, Lab Ecotecnol & Limnol, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",luciarrodrigues@gmail.com,"Fontoura, Nelson F/I-6397-2012; Rodrigues, Lucia R./F-3136-2013","Fontoura, Nelson F/0000-0001-9978-2812; Rodrigues, Lucia R./0000-0003-2915-3185",,,,41,8,8,1,25,ASOC ESPAN LIMNOL-MISLATA,MISLATA (VALENCIA),"C/ LOS ANGELES, 33, MISLATA (VALENCIA), SPAIN",0213-8409,1989-1806,,LIMNETICA,Limnetica,DEC,2015,34,2,,,,,495,506,,,,,12,Limnology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,CZ1QX,WOS:000366881500018,,,,,2021-09-21,

In many species, a colony's workers compete with the queen and each other over the production of males. Interspecific comparisons demonstrate the importance of within-colony relatedness in determining the outcome of such conflicts [3, 4], but facultative responses to within-colony relatedness are rarely reported [5-7]. Here, I report facultative matricide (worker killing of a colony's queen) in the social wasp Dolichovespula arenaria. Matricide is strongly associated with high worker-worker relatedness, as predicted by theory, because closely related workers value nephews more than brothers [8]. This pattern is the result of variation in both paternity frequency and the paternity skew of colonies with multiple patrilines, implicating worker-worker relatedness rather than a direct effect of multiple mating on queen survival. Furthermore, occasional inbreeding can explain why some multiple-patriline colonies exhibit high paternity skew associated with matricide. In general, these results support the hypothesis that workers can facultatively respond to intracolony relatedness determined by queen mating behavior and demonstrate a novel benefit of polyandry in annual social insects. Facultative matricide shows dramatically how workers are evolutionary actors with interests that can diverge from the queen's, rather than being extrasomatic projections of her personal genome [9].","[Loope, Kevin J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Loope, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",kj175@cornell.edu,,"Loope, Kevin J./0000-0002-1206-5640",NSF-GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [DGE-1144153]; NSF-DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1210645],"I thank Tom Seeley and Kern Reeve, as well as Paul Sherman, Cole Gilbert, Kerry Shaw, and the NBB Lunch Bunch, for discussions and feedback.

The most widely accepted hypothesis states that at smaller scales (such as patch scale), interspecific interactions are the major drivers structuring communities, whereas at larger regional scales, factors such as climate, topography and soil act as ecological filters that determine assemblage composition. The general aim of this-paper is to compare different exogenous drivers in terms of their relative dominance in structuring desert small mammal communities across a range of spatial scales, from patch to regional, and compare them with previous results on endogenous drivers. Our results show that as spatial scale increases, the explanatory power of exogenous factors also increases, e.g. from 17% at the patch scale (i.e. abundance) to 99% at the regional scale (i.e. diversity). Moreover, environmental drivers vary in type and strength depending on the community estimator across several spatial scales. On the other hand, endogenous drivers such as interspecific interactions are more important at the patch scale, diminishing in importance towards the regional scale. Therefore, the relative importance of exogenous versus endogenous drivers affects small mammal assemblage structure at different spatial scales. Our results fill up a knowledge gap concerning ecological drivers of assemblage structure at intermediate spatial scales for Monte desert small mammals, and highlight the importance of dealing with multi-causal factors in explaining ecological patterns of assemblages.

However, males of stingless bees have been observed sharing nonspecific reproductive aggregations. This uncommon behavior appears to confer no obvious increase of individual fitness. It has been suggested that this reproductive strategy is due to the similarity between male odors common to different stingless bee species. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are candidate odors of interest because their nonvolatile pheromone nature allows them to play an important role in sexual behavior and species recognition. Here, we review the literature to evaluate whether any phylogenetic patterns exist among male stingless bees that aggregate with closely or distantly related species. We also compared the CHC profiles of males of Neotropical stingless bee species (Plebeia sp. Schwarz, Trigona spinipes (F.), Tetragona clavipes (F.), Nannotrigona testaceicornis (Lepeletier), Scaptotrigona aff. depilis (Moure), Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille), and Melipona subnitida (Ducke) to reveal any chemical similarities among their male odors. We found males of 21 stingless bee species involved in interspecific interactions mainly from Neotropical and Indo-Malayan/Australasian regions. Alien males did not necessarily visit host aggregations of closely related species. Furthermore, the CHC profiles of different studied species were very distinct from each other and do not overlapped at all.

However, emergent genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic evidence now challenges this role to be at best equivocal to other processess. Cnidaria are arguably the most ancient phylum of the extant metazoa that are venomous and such provide a definitive ancestral anchor to examine the evolution of this trait. Methods: Here we compare predicted toxins from the translated genome of the coral Acropora digitifera to putative toxins revealed by proteomic analysis of soluble proteins discharged from nematocysts, to determine the extent to which gene duplications contribute to venom innovation in this reef-building coral species. A new bioinformatics tool called HHCompare was developed to detect potential gene duplications in the genomic data, which is made freely available (https://github.com/rgacesa/HHCompare). Results: A total of 55 potential toxin encoding genes could be predicted from the A. digitifera genome, of which 36 (65 %) had likely arisen by gene duplication as evinced using the HHCompare tool and verified using two standard phylogeny methods. Surprisingly, only 22 % (12/55) of the potential toxin repertoire could be detected following rigorous proteomic analysis, for which only half (6/12) of the toxin proteome could be accounted for as peptides encoded by the gene duplicates. Biological activities of these toxins are dominatedby putative phospholipases and toxic peptidases. Conclusions: Gene expansions in A. digitifera venom are the most extensive yet described in any venomous animal, and gene duplication plays a significant role leading to toxin diversification in this coral species. Since such low numbers of toxins were detected in the proteome, it is unlikely that the venom is evolving rapidly by prey-driven positive natural selection. Rather we contend that the venom has a defensive role deterring predation or harm from interspecific competition and overgrowth by fouling organisms. Factors influencing translation of toxin encoding genes perhaps warrants more profound experimental consideration.","[Gacesa, Ranko; Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, London SE1 9NH, England; [Chung, Ray; Ward, Malcolm] Kings Coll London, Prote Facil, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London SE5 8AF, England; [Dunn, Simon R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reefs Ecosyst Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Weston, Andrew J.] UCL Sch Pharm, Mass Spectrometry Lab, London WC1N 1AX, England; [Jaimes-Becerra, Adrian; Marques, Antonio C.; Morandini, Andre C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Marques, Antonio C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Biol Marinha, BR-11600000 Sao Sebastiao, Brazil; [Hranueli, Daslav; Starcevic, Antonio] Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Sect Bioinformat, Dept Biochem Engn, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Dept Chem, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Brazil Inst, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Long, Paul F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Ciencias Farmaceut, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Long, PF (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",paul.long@kcl.ac.uk,"Morandini, Andre Carrara/A-9892-2012; Marques, Antonio Carlos/E-8049-2011; Morandini, Andre Carrara/AAC-2320-2020; Gacesa, Ranko/AAG-5358-2019; Starcevic, Antonio/AAB-9379-2021","Morandini, Andre Carrara/0000-0003-3747-8748; Marques, Antonio Carlos/0000-0002-2884-0541; Morandini, Andre Carrara/0000-0003-3747-8748; Gacesa, Ranko/0000-0003-2119-0539; ","United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC grant) [G82144A]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/50174-7, 2011/50242-5]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq grant)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [301039/2013-5]; Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP grant) [13.1.1502.9.8]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [1406848] Funding Source: researchfish","We are indebted to Dr. Walter C.

This is particularly true for narrow endemics occurring within distributional ranges of widespread congeners. An excellent example is provided by the plant genus Knautia (Caprifoliaceae): Locally endemic K.carinthiaca is reported from two isolated populations in southern Austria situated within an area predominantly occupied by widespread K.arvensis. While K.carinthiaca usually inhabits low-competition communities on rocky outcrops, K.arvensis occurs mainly in dry to mesic managed grasslands, yet both species can coexist in marginal environments and were suspected to hybridize. Flow cytometry revealed that diploid K.carinthiaca only occurs at its locus classicus, whereas the second locality is inhabited by the morphologically similar but tetraploid K.norica. In the, therefore, single population of K.carinthiaca, flow cytometry and AFLP fingerprinting showed signs of introgressive hybridization with diploid K.arvensis. Hybridization patterns were also reflected in intermediate habitat preferences and morphology of the hybrids. Environmental barriers to gene flow seem to prevent genetic erosion of K.carinthiaca individuals from the core ecological niches, restricting most introgressed individuals to peripheral habitats. Efficient conservation of K.carinthiaca will require strict protection of its habitat and ban on forest clear cuts in a buffer zone to prevent invasion of K.arvensis. We demonstrate the large potential of multidisciplinary approaches combining molecular, cytometric, and ecological tools for a reliable inventory and threat assessment of rare species.","[Certner, Martin; Kolar, Filip] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic; [Certner, Martin; Kolar, Filip] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Kolar, Filip] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Natl Ctr Biosystemat, NO-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Schoenswetter, Peter; Frajman, Bozo] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Bot, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Certner, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic.",martin.certner@gmail.com,"Certner, Martin/I-6330-2016; kolar, filip/E-3826-2012; Schonswetter, Peter/T-8241-2017","Certner, Martin/0000-0001-5231-4579; kolar, filip/0000-0002-8793-7992; Schonswetter, Peter/0000-0001-9225-4566; Frajman, Bozo/0000-0002-3667-1135","Austrian Exchange Service (OeAD); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic","This study was partly financed by the program Wissenschaftlich-technische Zusammenarbeit (WTZ) from the Austrian Exchange Service (OeAD) (project Across- and within-ploidy hybridisation of rare Czech and Austrian endemics of Knautia (Dipsacaceae) to P.S. and Tomas Fer).

During co-infection, interactions between these two species are possible, yet the extent to which such interactions influence disease dynamics or the outcome of control efforts remains poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we analyse epidemiological data from three West African countries co-endemic for urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis (Senegal, Niger and Mali) to test whether the impact of praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, subsequent levels of re-infection or long-term infection dynamics are altered by co-infection. In all countries, positive associations between the two species prevailed at baseline: infection by one species tended to predict infection intensity for the other, with the strength of association varying across sites. Encouragingly, we found little evidence that co-infection influenced PZQ efficacy: species-specific egg reduction rates (ERR) and cure rates (CR) did not differ significantly with co-infection, and variation in treatment success was largely geographical. In Senegal, despite positive associations at baseline, children with S. mansoni co-infection at the time of treatment were less intensely re-infected by S. haematobium than those with single infections, suggesting competition between the species may occur post-treatment. Furthermore, the proportion of schistosome infections attributable to S. mansoni increased over time in all three countries examined. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that while co-infection between urinary and intestinal schistosomes may not directly affect PZQ treatment efficacy, competitive interspecific interactions may influence epidemiological patterns of re-infection post-treatment. While re-infection patterns differed most strongly according to geographic location, interspecific interactions also seem to play a role, and could cause the community composition in mixed species settings to shift as disease control efforts intensify, a situation with implications for future disease management in this multi-species system.","[Knowles, Sarah C.

A small frog in eastern Brazil, Phyllodytes luteolus (Wied-Neuwied, 1824), is widely distributed in association with bromeliads. At the end of the last glaciation, parts of the mainland became islands due to rising sea levels, thereby isolating frog populations on these islands. If the island rule holds, we predicted that frogs on islands would tend to be larger than frogs on the mainland. We compared sizes (weight and length) of 30 randomly selected male frogs from the mainland with 30 from an island in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. We also sampled population density on the island and mainland because concurrent with changing sizes, depending on the causal relationship, density may also change. As predicted, island frogs tended to be larger (both in snout-vent length and weight) and were much more abundant. While not specifically addressed in this study, the absence of predators and interspecific competitors may explain both of these trends.","[Mageski, Marcio; Ferreira, Rodrigo B.; Jesus, Paulo R.; da Costa, Larissa C.; Roper, James J.] Univ Vila Velha, Dept Ecol Ecossistemas, BR-29102920 Vila Velha, ES, Brazil; [Ferreira, Paulo D.] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Gemol, BR-29075710 Vitoria, ES, Brazil","Mageski, M (corresponding author), Univ Vila Velha, Dept Ecol Ecossistemas, Rua Comissario Jose Dantas de Melo 21, BR-29102920 Vila Velha, ES, Brazil.",marcioherpetologia@gmail.com,"Roper, James Joseph/H-7986-2012","Roper, James Joseph/0000-0002-2947-5136; Ferreira, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6099-5116; Corteletti, Larissa/0000-0002-2821-2561",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Espirito Santo (FAPES); Universidade Vila Velha (UVV); Ecology Center at Utah State University; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [231020/2013-9],"We are grateful to Shai Meiri, Renato Feio and Rute Carvalho for their comments and great suggestions and Elaine Campinhos, Mariana Mageski, Rebeka Ferreira, Werther Krohling and Weslley Rangel for their help in the field.

Yet we know little about the mechanisms that drive parasite dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. Recent mathematical models have shown how habitat can shape parasite dynamics through influencing the efficacy of parasite transmission; however, these predictions have yet to be tested at larger ecological scales. Here, we present a comparative analysis of parasitism in planktonic communities, assembling data from a range of host and parasite taxa, habitat types, and geographic regions. Our results suggest that the prominent depth-prevalence relationship observed in studies on Daphnia in temperate lakes of North America is applicable to a wide range of aquatic habitats, hosts, and parasites; however, differences in transmission strategies between parasites can lead to considerable variation in parasite dynamics. Observational studies which incorporate a diversity of habitat types will be important in uncovering the mechanisms which underlie this relationship. In particular, more experimental work on transmission stage survivability and infectivity in aquatic environments will be necessary before we can make accurate predictive models of parasite spread in these ecosystems.","[Valois, Amanda E.; Poulin, Robert] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Valois, AE (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",amanda.valois@otago.ac.nz,"Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Valois, Amanda/0000-0002-9868-7300",Otago University,We would like to thank the Evolutionary and Ecological Parasitology Research Group for stimulating discussion and comments on the manuscript.

Examination of rich material from the Late Cretaceous of central Europe extends the fossil record of this ichnotaxon and revealed a set of previously unrecognised morphological features which appear to be typical for this time period and the respective anomiid trace maker. Excellent preservation of a large number of trace fossil specimens with a complete set of morphological characters allowed a biometrical analysis and additional observations indicating a distinct substrate preference for belemnite rostra, a strong intra- and interspecific competition for settlement space, as well as interactions with durophaguous predators. Further implications for anomiid palaeobiology and palaeoecology arise from allometric shell growth and an etched outline suture in the substrate along the dorsal, lateral and ventral shell margins. These features enhanced a firm attachment and increased shear resistance, and thus are interpreted as an effective defence mechanism against shell-crushing enemies under the intensified predation pressure in marine environments in the Late Cretaceous.","[Neumann, Christian; Aberhan, Martin] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Naturkunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Wisshak, Max] Senckenberg Meer Marine Res Dept, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany","Neumann, C (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Naturkunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",christian.neumann@mfn-berlin.de; max.wisshak@senckenberg.de; martin.aberhan@mfn-berlin.de; p.girod@gmx.de; richard@bromley.dk,"Wisshak, Max/A-3418-2011","Wisshak, Max/0000-0001-7531-3317",European UnionEuropean Commission [DK-TAF-2388],"We thank the journal reviewers Jordi Martinell (University of Barcelona, Spain) and Winfried Werner (Bayerische Staatssammlung fur Geologie und Palaontologie, Munich, Germany) for their constructive comments on the manuscript.

All species live in a small, isolated area on the Istrian Peninsula in the NW Balkans. The distributional ranges of the species are partially overlapping and all species are living in springs. We reconstructed their ecological niches using morphological traits related to feeding, bioclimatic niche envelope and species' preference for epi-hypogean habitats. The ecological meaning of differences in niches was evaluated using distributional data and co-occurrence frequencies. We show that the species comprise two pairs of sister species. All species differ from each other and the degree of differentiation is not related to phylogenetic relatedness. Moreover, low co-occurrence frequencies in sympatric zones imply present or past interspecific competition. This pattern suggests that species are not differentiated enough to reduce interspecific competition, nor ecologically equivalent to co-exist via neutral dynamics. We tentatively conclude that the question of ecological equivalence relates to the scale of the study: at a fine scale, species' differences may influence dynamics in a local community, whereas at the regional level these species likely play roughly similar ecological roles.","[Fiser, Ziga; Zaksek, Valerija; Fiser, Cene] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Biol, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Altermatt, Florian] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Altermatt, Florian] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Knapic, Tea] Slovenian Museum Nat Hist, Ljubljana, Slovenia","Fiser, Z (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Dept Biol, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",fiser.ziga@gmail.com,,"Altermatt, Florian/0000-0002-4831-6958; Fiser, Ziga/0000-0003-4576-5173","Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P1-0184]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [31003A_135622, PP00P3_150698]","The project was funded by Slovenian Research Agency, program P1-0184 (to ZF, VK and CF), and by the Swiss National Science Foundation, grants nr. 31003A_135622 and PP00P3_150698 (to FA).",,67,34,34,0,15,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUL 30,2015,10,7,,,,,,,e0134384,10.1371/journal.pone.0134384,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CO0JT,WOS:000358837700085,26226375,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,2021-09-21,

Prey will initiate flight soon after detecting a predator so as to minimize attentional costs related to on-going monitoring of the whereabouts of the predator. Such costs may compete with foraging and other maintenance activities and hence be larger than the costs of immediate flight. The drivers of interspecific variation in escape strategy are poorly known. Here we investigated the morphological, life history and natural history traits that correlate with variation in avian escape strategy across a sample of 96 species of birds. Brain mass, body size, habitat structure and group size were the main predictors of escape strategy. The direction of the effect of these traits was consistent with selection for a reduction of monitoring costs. Therefore, attentional costs depend on relative brain size, which determines the ability to monitor the whereabouts of potential predators and the difficulty of this task as reflected by habitat and social complexity. Thus brain size, and the cognitive functions associated with it, constitute a general framework for explaining the effects of body size, habitat structure and sociality identified as determinants of avian escape strategy.","[Samia, Diogo S.

The bluegill Lepomis macrochirus are known to undergo ontogenetic shifts in diet preference, but because their diet is affected by population density, interspecific competition, and seasonal changes in prey availability, they are considered generalist predators. We investigated whether the diet shifts of the bluegill were associated with a change in the location of the AC (total length of fish specimens, range 44-243 mm). The AC was located temporally in the retina of smaller fish (40-100 mm), and the area of increased density included the ventral and central regions of the retina. Conversely, the AC was located in the dorso-temporal region of the retina in larger (100-200 mm) fish. Lastly, in the largest bluegill (> 200 mm), the AC was located in the temporal region of the retina. In all cases, the orientation of the visual axis was consistent with the known diet preferences of the different size classes.","[Gomi, Yuuki; Miyazaki, Taeko] Mie Univ, Grad Sch Bioresources, Dept Life Sci, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan","Miyazaki, T (corresponding author), Mie Univ, Grad Sch Bioresources, Dept Life Sci, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.",y.gm3@pref.chiba.lg.jp; taeko@bio.mie-u.ac.jp,,,,,,27,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0919-9268,1444-2906,,FISHERIES SCI,Fish.

Theoretical and empirical work has focused on interspecific variation in elemental composition, and stoichiometric imbalances between resources and consumers in determining productivity, particularly at the base of foodwebs. Recent work has found considerable intraspecific variation in elemental composition. We know little about the ecological relevance of such variation, and whether predictions of stoichiometric theory hold at the intraspecific level. Here, we used two genotypes of a primary producer Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and two genotypes of a primary consumer Daphnia pulex, which are already known to vary considerably in their phosphorus (P) use physiology, under conditions of P abundance and limitation, to explore whether such intraspecific differences alter primary as well as secondary production. Specifically, we tested whether there are intraspecific differences in the carbon: phosphorus (C:P) stoichiometry of Chlamydomonas genotypes, whether such differences affect growth and abundance of the two Daphnia genotypes, and whether the two Daphnia genotypes had distinct effects on primary production and growth of the two Chlamydomonas genotypes. We found significant differences in C:P stoichiometry between the two Chlamydomonas genotypes in both P supply conditions. Such intraspecific differences altered the growth of Daphnia genotypes, and affected the outcome of genotypic competition. Finally, Daphnia genotype affected primary production, and interacted with P supply to distinctly affect the growth of the two Chlamydomonas genotypes. Together, our results highlight the potential ecological relevance of intraspecific differences in nutrient use physiology and elemental composition, and the utility of ecological stoichiometry in understanding such consequences.","[Lind, Patrick R.; Jeyasingh, Punidan D.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Lind, PR (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 501 Life Sci West, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",plind@okstate.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0924401],"This work was supported by NSF Grant No. 0924401 to PDJ.

However, little is known about how interactions with neighbours, such as competition and facilitation, alter the emerging gap patterns after extreme events. Using a spatially explicit community model we demonstrate that negative interactions, especially intraspecific competition, greatly promote both average gap size and gap-size diversity relative to positive interspecific interaction. This suggests that competition would promote diversity maintenance but also increase community invasibility, as large gaps with a wide size variety provide more diverse niches for both local and exotic species. Under interspecific competition, both gap metrics interestingly increased with species richness, while they were reduced under intraspecific competition. Having a wider range of species interaction strengths led to a smaller average gap size only under intraspecific competition. Increasing conspecific clumping induced larger gaps with more variable sizes under intraspecific competition, in contrast to interspecific competition. Given the range of intraspecific clumping in real communities, models or experiments based on randomly synthesized communities may yield biased estimates of the opportunities for potential colonizers to fill gaps. Overall, our static model on gap formation offers perspectives to better predict recolonization opportunity and thus community secondary succession under extreme event regimes.","[Liao, Jinbao; Nijs, Ivan] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Res Grp Plant & Vegetat Ecol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Liao, Jinbao] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Poyang Lake Wetland & Watershed Res, Nanchang 330022, Peoples R China; [Bogaert, Jan] Univ Liege, Biodivers & Landscape Unit, Gembloux Agro Bio Tech, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium","Liao, JB (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Res Grp Plant & Vegetat Ecol, Campus Drie Eiken,Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",jinbao.liao@uantwerpen.be,,"Nijs, Ivan/0000-0003-3111-680X",Methusalem Programme of the Flemish Government via the PLECO research group,J.

Animals are thought to evolve smaller clutches of larger offspring on islands in response to release from predation pressure and interspecific competition, and the resulting increases in population density and intraspecific competition. These forces become more pronounced with diminishing island size, and life histories are thus expected to become slowest on small, isolated islands. We measured clutch sizes in 12 insular populations of Mediodactylus kotschyi, a small gecko from the Cyclades Archipelago, a set of land-bridge islands in the Aegean Sea (Greece). We analyse variation in clutch size in relation to island area, island age, maternal body size, the presence of putative competitors and nesting seabirds (which increase resource abundance in the form of marine subsidies), and richness of predators. Clutch size of M. kotschyi decreases with increasing island area, in departure from classic island syndrome predictions, suggesting the evolution of faster life histories on smaller islands. There are no relationships between clutch size and island age, maternal size, the presence of competitors or predator richness. Instead, larger clutches on small islands could simply reflect the beneficial effect of marine subsidies derived from resident seabird colonies. Indeed, populations of M. kotschyi on islands with nesting seabirds have clutch sizes 30.9 % larger (1.82 vs. 1.39 eggs) than populations on islands without nesting seabirds. Thus, our data suggest that bottom-up effects of marine subsidies may supersede the expression of a simple island syndrome in the Aegean M. kotschyi.","[Slavenko, Alex; Itescu, Yuval; Meiri, Shai] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Foufopoulos, Johannes] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pafilis, Panayiotis] Univ Athens, Sch Biol, Dept Zool & Marine Biol, Panepistimiopolis, Ilissia, Greece","Slavenko, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",slavenko@mail.tau.ac.il,"Slavenko, Alex/ABC-7200-2020; Meiri, Shai/D-2403-2010","Slavenko, Alex/0000-0002-3265-7715; Pafilis, Panayiotis/0000-0002-1832-4906; Foufopoulos, Johannes/0000-0002-8341-8271; Meiri, Shai/0000-0003-3839-6330",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1005/12],"We thank Nir Enav, Gaya Savyon, Stav Brown, Shani Levinkind, Amir Lewin, Maayan Mania and Rachel Schwarz for their invaluable help in the field.

The model combines the related processes of organic carbon oxidation, denitrification, nitrification and Anammox and phenomena of substrate reaction and diffusion, biomass growth and advection, detachment. The biofilm growth process is governed by nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs and substrate dynamics are dominated by semilinear parabolic PDEs. It follows a complex system of PDEs on a free boundary domain. Equations are integrated numerically by using the method of characteristics as strongly suggested by the qualitative analysis of the free boundary value problem. Mass conservation equation plays an important role in checking the accuracy of simulations. The model has been applied to simulate Anammox competition and to evaluate the influence of substrate diffusion on microbial stratification. Specific scenarios are analyzed. The results reveal that in a thick multispecies biofilm, including heterotrophic, aerobic autotrophic nitrifying and Anammox bacteria, oxygen diffusion limitation determines the formation of both aerobic and anoxic microenvironments favouring interspecies competition. In contrast, oxygen excess causes a disturbance on microbial interactions leading to Anammox bacteria loss. The model predictions may help engineers or operators to have a better insight into biofilm dynamics in order to optimize process design or practical operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The prevalence of metabolic interactions in microbial communities, however, has remained largely unknown. Here, we systematically survey, by using a genome-scale metabolic modeling approach, the extent of resource competition and metabolic exchanges in over 800 communities. We find that, despite marked resource competition at the level of whole assemblies, microbial communities harbor metabolically interdependent groups that recur across diverse habitats. By enumerating flux-balanced metabolic exchanges in these co-occurring subcommunities we also predict the likely exchanged metabolites, such as amino acids and sugars, that can promote group survival under nutritionally challenging conditions.

Consequently, the structure of carnivore guilds can be critical to ecosystem patterns. Body size is a crucial influence on intraguild interactions, because it affects access to prey resources, effectiveness in scramble competition, and vulnerability to intraguild predation. Coyotes (Canis latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) occur sympatrically throughout much of North America and overlap in resource use, indicating potential for interspecific interactions. Although much is known about the autecology of the individual species separately, little is known about factors that facilitate coexistence and how interactions within this guild influence distribution, habitat use, and temporal activity of the smaller carnivores. To assess how habitat autecology and interspecific interactions affect the structure of this widespread carnivore guild, we conducted a large-scale, non-invasive carnivore survey using an occupancy modeling framework. We deployed remote cameras during 3-week surveys to detect carnivores at 1,118 camera locations in 357 2.6-km(2) sections (3-4 cameras/section composing a cluster) in the 16 southernmost counties of Illinois (16,058 km(2)) during January-April, 2008-2010. We characterized microhabitat at each camera location and landscape-level habitat features for each camera cluster. In a multistage approach, we used information-theoretic methods to evaluate competing models for detection, species-specific habitat occupancy, multispecies co-occupancy, and multiseason (colonization and extinction) occupancy dynamics. We developed occupancy models for each species to represent hypothesized effects of anthropogenic features, prey availability, landscape complexity, and vegetative land cover. We quantified temporal activity patterns of each carnivore species based on their frequency of appearance in photographs. Further, we assessed whether smaller carnivores shifted their diel activity patterns in response to the presence of potential competitors. Of the 102,711 photographs of endothermic animals, we recorded photographs of bobcats (n=412 photographs), coyotes (n=1,397), gray foxes (n=546), raccoons (n=40,029), red foxes (n=149), and striped skunks (n=2,467). Bobcats were active primarily during crepuscular periods, and their activity was reduced with precipitation and higher temperatures. The probability of detecting bobcats decreased after a bobcat photograph was recorded, suggesting avoidance of remote cameras after the first encounter. Across southern Illinois, bobcat occupancy at the camera-location and camera-cluster scale (local=0.240.04, camera cluster cluster=0.750.06) was negatively influenced by anthropogenic features and infrastructure. Bobcats had high rates of colonization (</mml:mover>=0.86) and low rates of extinction (E</mml:mover>=0.07), suggesting an expanding population, but agricultural land was less likely to be colonized. Nearly all camera clusters were occupied by coyotes (</mml:mover>cluster=0.95 +/- 0.03). At the local scale, coyote occupancy (</mml:mover>local=0.58 +/- 0.03) was higher in hardwood forest stands with open understories than in other areas. Compared to coyotes, gray foxes occupied a smaller portion of the study area (</mml:mover>local=0.13 +/- 0.01, </mml:mover>cluster=0. 29 +/- 0.03) at all scales. At the scale of the camera cluster, gray fox occupancy was highest in fragmented areas with high proportions of forest, and positively related to anthropogenic features within 100% home-range buffers. Red foxes occupied a similar proportion of the study area as gray foxes (</mml:mover>local=0.12 +/- 0.02, </mml:mover>cluster=0.26 +/- 0.04) but were more closely associated with anthropogenic features. Only anthropogenic feature models made up the 90% confidence set at all scales of analysis for red foxes. Extinction probabilities at the scale of the camera cluster were higher for both gray foxes (E</mml:mover>=0.57) and red foxes (E</mml:mover>=0.35) than their colonization rates (gray fox </mml:mover>=0.16, red fox </mml:mover>=0.06), suggesting both species may be declining in southern Illinois. Striped skunks occupied a large portion of the study area (</mml:mover>local=0.47 +/- 0.01, </mml:mover>cluster=0.79 +/- 0.03) and were associated primarily with anthropogenic features. Raccoons were essentially ubiquitous within the study area, being photographed in 99% of camera clusters. We observed little evidence for spatial partitioning based on interspecific interactions, with the exception of the gray fox-coyote pairs, and found that habitat preferences were more important in structuring the carnivore community. Habitat had a stronger influence on the occupancy of foxes than did the presence of bobcats. However, the level of red fox activity was negatively correlated with bobcat activity. Gray fox occupancy and the number of detections within occupied sites were reduced in camera clusters occupied by coyotes but not bobcat occupancy. Overall, gray fox occupancy was highest at camera locations with fewer hardwood and more conifer trees. However, gray foxes were more likely to occupy camera locations in hardwood stands than conifer stands if coyotes were also present indicating that hardwood stands may enhance gray fox-coyote coexistence. The 2 fox species appeared to co-occur with each other at the local scale more frequently than expected based on their individual selection of habitat. Similarly, occupancy of camera location by red foxes was higher when coyotes were present. These positive spatial associations among canids may be a response to locally high prey abundance or unmeasured habitat variables. Activity levels of raccoons, bobcats, and coyotes were all positively correlated. Overall, our co- occurrence and activity models indicate competitor-driven adjustments in space use among members of a carnivore community might be the exception rather than the norm. Nevertheless, although our results indicate that gray foxes and red foxes currently coexist with bobcats and coyotes, their distribution appears to be contracting on our study area. Coexistence of foxes with larger carnivores may be enhanced by temporal partitioning of activity and by habitat features that reduce vulnerability of intraguild predation. For instance, hardwood stands may contain trees with structure that enhances tree-climbing by gray foxes, a behavior that probably facilitates coexistence with coyotes. Efforts to enhance gray fox populations would likely benefit from increasing the amount of mature oak-hickory forest. Additionally, the varying results from different scales of analyses underscore the importance of considering multiple spatial scales in carnivore community studies.

Here it is shown that dimorphism in the shape of the dermal plates of Stegosaurus mjosi (Upper Jurassic, western USA) does not result from non-sex-related individual, interspecific, or ontogenetic variation and is most likely a sexually dimorphic feature. One morph possessed wide, oval plates 45% larger in surface area than the tall, narrow plates of the other morph. Intermediate morphologies are lacking as principal component analysis supports marked size-and shape-based dimorphism. In contrast, many non-sex-related individual variations are expected to show intermediate morphologies. Taphonomy of a new quarry in Montana (JRDI 5ES Quarry) shows that at least five individuals were buried in a single horizon and were not brought together by water or scavenger transportation. This new site demonstrates co-existence, and possibly suggests sociality, between two morphs that only show dimorphism in their plates. Without evidence for niche partitioning, it is unlikely that the two morphs represent different species. Histology of the new specimens in combination with studies on previous specimens indicates that both morphs occur in fully-grown individuals. Therefore, the dimorphism is not a result of ontogenetic change. Furthermore, the two morphs of plates do not simply come from different positions on the back of a single individual. Plates from all positions on the body can be classified as one of the two morphs, and previously discovered, isolated specimens possess only one morph of plates. Based on the seemingly display-oriented morphology of plates, female mate choice was likely the driving evolutionary mechanism rather than male-male competition. Dinosaur ornamentation possibly served similar functions to the ornamentation of modern species. Comparisons to ornamentation involved in sexual selection of extant species, such as the horns of bovids, may be appropriate in predicting the function of some dinosaur ornamentation.","Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Saitta, ET (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",evansaitta@gmail.com,"Saitta, Evan Thomas/H-6884-2019",,Princeton University's Office of the Dean of the College; Princeton University's Mountlake Field Research Fund; Princeton University's Fred Fox Class,"This work was supported by Princeton University's Office of the Dean of the College, Princeton University's Mountlake Field Research Fund, and Princeton University's Fred Fox Class of 1939 Fund.

Traditional species interactions (e.g., competition, predation, symbiosis) have received a great deal of deserved attention and their general importance in shaping the evolution of populations and structure of communities is unquestioned. Recently, reproductive interference has been receiving attention as an important species interaction. Reproductive interference is defined as interspecific reproductive activities that decrease the fitness of at least one of the species involved in the interaction. Reproductive interference has the potential to affect the evolutionary trajectories of populations and structure of communities. Here, I comment on seven papers that make up this special feature on reproductive interference. Along the way I highlight key discoveries of these studies and areas of research that may contribute to our understanding of the causes and consequences of reproductive interference.","Southwestern Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Weatherford, OK 73096 USA","Cothran, RD (corresponding author), Southwestern Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 100 Campus Dr, Weatherford, OK 73096 USA.",rickey.cothran@swosu.edu,,,,,,20,8,8,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

The impacts of each environmental change upon population dynamics are usually assumed be independent of the state of other aspects of the environment, despite evidence at the individual level indicating that the combined impacts are often non-additive. The importance of indirect effects mediated through community interactions also has high uncertainty. We used experimental microcosms to determine whether environmental factors interact to affect species dynamics and the relative importance of direct and indirect effects on species dynamics. We factorially manipulated three aspects of the environment (temperature, food availability and salinity) and examined reciprocal invasions of competing protist species under each environment. Experimental observations were used to parameterize a dynamic model of the system. Using this model and a novel variance decomposition method, we examined the mechanisms by which environmental changes altered species invasion rates. The three environmental factors interacted when modifying species growth rates, intra- and interspecific competition, causing the impact of each environmental change on species dynamics to depend crucially on the state of other aspects of the environment. Indirect changes in the abundance of the resident competitor and its interspecific competitive ability were the main cause of environmental driven variation in invasion rates, whilst direct effects on species intrinsic growth rates were relatively unimportant. This indicates that, to understand and ultimately predict species and community responses to multiple environmental changes, we should consider their joint impacts and the mechanisms by which they interact to modify key ecological processes such as competition.","[Griffiths, Jason I.; Warren, Philip H.; Childs, Dylan Z.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Griffiths, JI (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",jason.griffiths@sheffield.ac.uk,"Childs, Dylan/P-7388-2018","Childs, Dylan/0000-0002-0675-4933","Natural Environment Research Council PhD Studentship; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [1233106, NE/I022027/1] Funding Source: researchfish",This research was funded by a Natural Environment Research Council PhD Studentship.

The intensity of intra- and interspecific competition for dung as a breeding resource is substantially higher in WA. First, we tested whether differential resource competition in the two exotic ranges is associated with divergences in life history traits, which impact on resource use. We predicted that high levels of resource competition in WA should favor females that produce brood balls more efficiently and of altered size, and produce offspring more readily when a breeding opportunity arises. Furthermore, we predicted that larvae from WA populations may have evolved more efficient development and thus exhibit higher eclosion success, shorter development time, and altered body size under standardized conditions. Second, we examined the likely developmental mechanisms underlying these divergences, that is, genetic differentiation, developmental plasticity, or parental effects in a common garden experiment. Field-collected EUS and WA populations significantly differed, as predicted, in most of the traits examined. However, these differences are facilitated by a complex combination of proximate mechanisms. Developmental plasticity and (grand) parental effects mediated differences related to reproductive performance, whereas genetic differentiation mediated differences in the duration of larval development. Our study highlights that population divergences can be the product of a patchwork of proximate mechanisms, with each mechanism adjusting different traits in a way that the resulting composite phenotype may be better suited to its competitive environment.","[Beckers, Oliver M.; Anderson, Wendy; Moczek, Armin P.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Beckers, OM (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 915 East Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",obeckers@murraystate.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32 HD094336-09]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS 0744585, 1120209, 0820411]","We thank Emilie Snell-Rood, Melissa Pespeni, Daniel Schwab and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful criticism and editing of the manuscript and Thomas Jackson for statistical support.

Tropical areas hold more species than temperate ones. This difference in species number may favour ecological processes that minimize interspecific competition in species-rich areas. There is theoretical evidence that both modularity (i.e. the presence of semi-independent groups of highly interacting species) and nestedness (i.e. specialists interact with a subset of the species interacting with generalists) reduce the effects of competition. Thus, we expect high degrees of modularity or nestedness at low latitudes in seed-dispersal networks. Moreover, we test whether climate, topography and human impact influence network structure. LocationThirty-four qualitative and 21 weighted seed-dispersal interaction networks located world-wide. MethodsWe related the degree of modularity and nestedness of seed-dispersal interaction networks with latitude. To disentangle the macroecological drivers of network structure, we also associated modularity/nestedness with species richness, altitudinal range, human impact and an array of climate predictors: precipitation, temperature, precipitation/temperature seasonality and historical climate-change velocity and anomaly. ResultsBinary networks showed stronger macroecological patterns than weighted networks. Latitude was unrelated to the structure of seed-dispersal networks, but more nested assemblages were species rich and were located in areas with a high degree of human impact, high temperature seasonality, low precipitation, and, especially on the mainland, high stability in precipitation. Modular networks were species rich and found in areas with low human impact. For both nestedness and modularity, the effects of species richness and human impact were especially strong and consistent. Main conclusionsAs for previous macroecological studies of mutualistic networks, we found that the structure of seed-dispersal assemblages was related to current and historical climate. The largest influences on nestedness and modularity, however, were the number of competing species and the degree of human impact. This suggests that human disturbance, not just climate, is an important factor determining the structure of a seed-dispersal network.","[Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther; Guimaraes, Paulo R., Jr.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Dalsgaard, Bo] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Sandel, Brody] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Sebastian-Gonzalez, E (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 385 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",esebgo@gmail.com,"Guimaraes-Junior, Paulo R/M-1298-2016; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/J-7883-2012; Guimaraes, Paulo R./E-1915-2016","Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/0000-0001-7229-1845; Guimaraes, Paulo R./0000-0001-9161-8305; Dalsgaard, Bo/0000-0003-2867-2805","FAPESP Research FoundationFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao Amazonia de Amparo a Estudos e Pesquisas (FAPESPA) [2011/17968-2, 2009/054422-8]; Danish National Research FoundationDanmarks Grundforskningsfond","E.S.G and P.R.G. benefited from FAPESP Research Foundation grants numbers 2011/17968-2 and 2009/054422-8 respectively, and B.D. thanks the Danish National Research Foundation for its support of the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate.

After a schematic overview of different scenarios of interactions between competitive and abiotic effects, we analysed spatial variation in abundance in four sets of closely related (sister) species with extensive range overlap. LocationSouthern Africa. MethodsWe used occupancy models that separate species presence from species detection and account for sampling biases and uncertainties, applied to citizen science data from the Southern African Bird Atlas Project aggregated at the quarter-degree resolution. ResultsThe abundant centre syndrome was present in all species, but its explanatory power was stronger in species with a concave, central range than in species with a convex, elongated and coastal range, and it could be locally undetectable. The decline in abundance towards the range boundary was partly or entirely mirrored by the variation in abundance of sister species. One species replaced another geographically without local decrease in abundances near the contact zone, and in two species pairs a dominant species negatively affected a subordinate species, which we interpret as evidence for interspecific competition shaping range limits. ConclusionWe introduce a typology of competitive interactions based on spatial correlations of species' abundances and on ancillary information such as phenology. This typology can facilitate general inference about the differences between fundamental and realized climatic niches, and associated predictions.","[Peron, Guillaume; Altwegg, Res] Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Peron, Guillaume] Colorado State Univ, Colorado Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Peron, Guillaume] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD USA; [Altwegg, Res] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa","Peron, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",peron_guillaume@yahoo.fr,"PERON, Guillaume/C-5379-2013","PERON, Guillaume/0000-0002-6311-4377",SANBI; National Research Foundation (NRF) of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [85802],"We thank the volunteer atlasers who collected the data and the Animal Demography Unit at the University of Cape Town for making the data available to us.

Urban growth in Brazil has led to severe fragmentation, especially in the Atlantic Forest and savannas. The effects of this fragmentation on the common funnel-web spider Aglaoctenus lagotis were examined in two forest fragments within the interior savanna: a smaller fragment within an urban environment and a larger fragment within a rural environment. The reproductive period occurred in October, coinciding with the beginning of the rainy season, when the species was aggregated in the two forest fragments. The smaller fragment contained a larger population, and the spiders had a larger average prosoma size and web area. The presence of a larger population in a smaller area within the urban centre may reflect a limited dispersal ability, reduced predator abundance or low interspecific competition. The larger prosoma length and web area in the smaller habitat fragment suggest greater resource availability and a higher probability of capturing prey in the urban environment. In both areas, a larger number of capture threads was positively correlated with the presence of inquiline spiders in the webs. The genetic data indicate close similarity between and within the two areas, indicating that the species has low genetic variability or that the areas studied, consistent with their proximity, have separated only recently. Most savannas and forests in midwestern Brazil have recently undergone severe fragmentation, and further studies of this nature are needed.","[Stefani, Vanessa; Del-Claro, Kleber] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, BR-38400 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil","Del-Claro, K (corresponding author), Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, Av Engenheiro Dinz 1178,CP 593, BR-38400 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.",delclaro@ufu.br,"Del-Claro, Kleber/N-3700-2019; Del-Claro, K/C-5570-2013","Del-Claro, K/0000-0001-8886-9568","National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [473055/2012, 72046/2011, 301248/2009]; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher-Education Personnel - National Post-Doctoral Plan (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Plano Nacional de Pos-Doutorado; CAPES-PNPD) [2556/2011]",KDC thanks the National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; CNPq) [grant numbers 473055/2012; 72046/2011; 301248/2009].

According to recent paleontological research, amebelodontines were predominant proboscideans in faunas of the early to middle Miocene of East Asia. In addition to the abundant Platybelodon, other amebelodontines are known, but they have been largely neglected by researchers. Here we describe two species of Protanancus, Pr. tobieni and Pr. brevirostris, sp. nov., from China. The former was present during the middle Miocene in Tongxin and Qin'an and was previously attributed to Amebelodon or Serbelodon; the latter was present during the early Miocene in the Linxia Basin. Cladistic analysis indicates that the two species appear to represent primitive members of Protanancus. However, the phylogenetic relationship among Protanancus, Platybelodon, and Amebelodon remains unresolved because of their strong parallel evolution. Our study suggests intensive competition between Protanancus and Platybelodon based on similarities in their mandibular morphologies and dental microwear patterns, with the former genus disappearing from East Asia by the late middle Miocene. This scenario is supported by a mechanical model, in which lower tusks with dentinal tubules, as occur in Platybelodon, show greater resistance to the adverse effects of both a heavy load and abrasion than those with concentric laminae, present in Protanancus. The model aids in interpreting the evolution of the inner structure of the lower tusks of amebelodontines, which may have provided a competitive advantages for these species.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:4D33BD71-CB05-4058-B9DD-337060B0B7CBSUPPLEMENTAL DATASupplemental materials are available for this article for free at www.tandfonline.com/UJVP","[Wang, Shiqi; Deng, Tao; Tang, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Xie, Guangpu] Gansu Prov Museum, Lanzhou 730050, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuguang] Beijing Nat Hist Museum, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China; [Wang, Duoqing] Qinan Museum, Qinan 741600, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shiqi; Tang, Tao] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Wang, SQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",wangshiqi@ivpp.ac.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB821900]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB03020104]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41372001, 41430102]","We thank P.

We examined seasonal variation in the song rate of Red-throated Ant-tanagers (Habia fuscicauda), a socially monogamous species in which males predominantly sing during the breeding season, to determine to what extent increased song rate is driven by (1) increased territory defense, (2) pair coordination of nest initiation, and (3) competition for extra-pair mating opportunities. Song was infrequent during the non-breeding season, increased dramatically prior to nesting (17 % time spent singing), and increased even more so during nesting (32 % time spent singing). Male song output was inversely related to frequency of interactions between pairs at territorial borders; however, interactions may also serve in a mating context. Extra-pair matings were common, and 17 of 41 nestlings in ten of 19 broods were extra-pair young, suggesting that high male song output may be sexually selected via extra-pair mate choice. Although males spent much less time singing prior to nesting, our results also indicate that male initiation of singing was associated with female egg-laying date, indicating also a role in within-pair coordination of reproduction. Our results suggest that high song output during the breeding season may be more common in omnivorous species that experience increased seasonality and that it may be indicative of an extra-pair mating system. More studies of species with diverse life histories are needed to examine the ecological conditions that explain interspecific variation in song output.","[Chiver, Ioana; Stutchbury, Bridget J.

In an agricultural context, climate change might alter the intensity of competition or facilitation interactions among pests with, potentially, negative consequences on the levels of damage to crop. This could threaten the productivity of agricultural systems and have negative impacts on food security, but has yet been poorly considered in studies. In this contribution, we constructed and evaluated process-based species distribution models for three invasive potato pests in the Tropical Andean Region. These three species have been found to co-occur and interact within the same potato tuber, causing different levels of damage to crop. Our models allowed us to predict the current and future distribution of the species and therefore, to assess how damage to crop might change in the future due to novel interactions. In general, our study revealed the main challenges related to distribution modeling of invasive pests in highly heterogeneous regions. It yielded different results for the three species, both in terms of accuracy and distribution, with one species surviving best at lower altitudes and the other two performing better at higher altitudes. As to future distributions our results suggested that the three species will show different responses to climate change, with one of them expanding to higher altitudes, another contracting its range and the other shifting its distribution to higher altitudes. These changes will result in novel areas of co-occurrence and hence, interactions of the pests, which will cause different levels of damage to crop. Combining population dynamics and species distribution models that incorporate interspecific trade-off relationships in different environments revealed a powerful approach to provide predictions about the response of an assemblage of interacting species to future environmental changes and their impact on process rates.","[Crespo-Perez, Veronica; Rebaudo, Francois; Dangles, Olivier] CNRS, UR 072, Lab Evolut Genomes & Speciat, UPR 9034,IRD, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Crespo-Perez, Veronica; Rebaudo, Francois; Dangles, Olivier] Univ Paris 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Crespo-Perez, Veronica; Dangles, Olivier] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Lab Entomol, Quito, Ecuador; [Crespo-Perez, Veronica; Chuine, Isabelle] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Regniere, Jacques] Nat Resources Canada, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Crespo-Perez, V (corresponding author), CNRS, UR 072, Lab Evolut Genomes & Speciat, UPR 9034,IRD, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",mvcrespo@puce.edu.ec,"Dangles, Olivier/C-4924-2009; Rebaudo, Francois/F-9115-2011; Rebaudo, Francois/AAA-7176-2020; Crespo-Perez, Veronica/AAJ-7499-2020","Dangles, Olivier/0000-0002-1987-8433; Rebaudo, Francois/0000-0002-3672-0101; Rebaudo, Francois/0000-0002-3672-0101; Crespo-Perez, Veronica/0000-0002-8811-1965",McKnight Foundation [C09-031]; Agence Nationale pour la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12-JSV7-0013-01]; French Embassy in Ecuador; Departement Soutien et Formation des communautes scientifiques du Sud (DSF) of the IRD,"This work was part of the research conducted within the project Innovative Approaches for integrated Pest Management in changing Andes (C09-031) funded by the McKnight Foundation and the project Adaptive Management in Insect Pest Control in Thermally Heterogeneous Agricultural Landscapes (MAN-PEST) funded by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR-12-JSV7-0013-01).

I employed nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination analyses to evaluate patterns of ant species assembly on 42 islands across remote Polynesia. Patterns on islands in the Hawaiian archipelago were distinctly separate from those of more southerly islands. Patterns on high islands were distinctly separate from those of atolls and low-lying islands. Patterns on small islets on the barrier reefs of high islands were more similar to those of distant atolls than those of the nearby high islands. Latitude and elevation were most strongly correlated with ordination axes; area and longitude were weakly correlated with ordination axes. Patterns are consistent with humanassisted dispersal through long-distance shipping as a primary vector of colonization, and with a greater diversity of habitat types with increasing island elevation. Similar results were obtained when a subset of 19 islands that had been more thoroughly surveyed was analyzed. I also examined patterns in species composition among communities (within islands) on three French Polynesian islands (Bora Bora, Huahine, and Moorea). On all three islands, sites grouped together distinctly in ordination space as a function of the dominant ant species. A substantial number of species pairs co-occurred less frequently than predicted by chance. Although interspecific competition appears to be important in structuring ant communities within islands, habitat affinities probably also play a role.","Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, Springfield, MO 65897 USA","Morrison, LW (corresponding author), Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 South Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65897 USA.",LloydMorrison@MissouriState.edu,,"Morrison, Lloyd/0000-0002-9375-843X",,,,38,1,1,0,13,UNIV HAWAII PRESS,HONOLULU,"2840 KOLOWALU ST, HONOLULU, HI 96822 USA",0030-8870,1534-6188,,PAC SCI,Pac.

Terrestrial seminatural habitats, such as hedgerows and grassy field margins, can enhance the abundance and diversity of spiders in adjoining fields, whereas the potential of riparian margins has rarely been studied. We compared the effects of hedgerows and riparian margins on aerial web-building spiders in adjacent cereal fields. While species richness and overall abundance did not significantly respond to distance from or type of field margin, each of the four dominant species responded differently. The abundance of Tetragnatha cf. montana Simon 1874 increased towards both hedgerows and riparian margins. Tetragnatha extensa (Linnaeus 1758) differentiated between field margin types and abundances increased only towards riparian margins. By contrast, Phylloneta impressa (L. Koch 1881) abundances decreased from field centers towards the field margins irrespective of the type. Type of field margin and distance showed an interactive effect on Mangora acalypha (Aralckenaer 1802) abundances, which decreased from field centers towards hedgerows but changed only little towards riparian margins. Increasing spider densities towards field margins can be explained by the preference of spiders for adjoining seminatural habitats (overwintering, food availability, microclimate, vegetation structure), whereas increases towards field centers might be caused by interspecific competition and enhanced predation pressure near seminatural habitats and high prey numbers in crop fields. Overall, our study demonstrates that aerial web-building spider species respond differently to hedgerows and riparian margins.","[Pfister, Sonja C.; Schafer, Ralf B.; Schirmel, Jens; Entling, Martin H.] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, D-76829 Landau, Germany","Pfister, SC (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",pfister@uni-landau.de,"Schafer, Ralf Bernhard/E-1926-2011; Entling, Martin H/C-6953-2008; Schirmel, Jens/I-3467-2012","Schafer, Ralf Bernhard/0000-0003-3510-1701; Pfister, Sonja C./0000-0001-5362-3330",,,,57,10,13,0,29,AMER ARACHNOLOGICAL SOC,COLLEGE PARK,"UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT ENTOMOLOGY, 4112 PLANT SCIENCES BLDG, COLLEGE PARK, MD 20742-4454 USA",0161-8202,1937-2396,,J ARACHNOL,J.

In spite of the biological richness of the invaded area, no study ever addressed the evolution of the invasion process. We aimed to investigate the current distribution and status of the mink in NW Portugal and discuss some contributing factors to explain the rate of invasion. We detected mink presence using floating rafts as footprint tracking devices, and scats as a molecular tool aiding in species identification. Results demonstrate a clear range expansion southwards, with mink already occupying most of the region's hydrographic basins. After a first phase of slow expansion (55 km in 20 years), mink seems to have expanded its range quite rapidly in only 2 years (45 km). The initial delay could be due to local thriving otter populations, whereas the recent establishment of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in the area could be a plausible explanation for the acceleration in the mink's expansion. Being a key food resource, crayfish may be playing an important role as an expansion facilitator. Mink eradication is probably no longer feasible since well established populations near the border continue to function as sources for the Portuguese population. Therefore, a control program should start immediately in the NW region, preferably in conjunction with Spanish authorities.","[Rodrigues, Diana C.; Simoes, Luciana; Mullins, Jacinta; Mendes, Raquel C.; Fernandes, Carlos; Rebelo, Rui; Santos-Reis, Margarida] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Biol Ambiental, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lampa, Simone] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Conservat Biol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Rodrigues, DC (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Biol Ambiental, Ed C2-5 Piso,Campo Grande, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",rodriguesdia@gmail.com,"Fernandes, Carlos/AAB-5256-2019; Santos-Reis, Margarida/H-4064-2011; Fernandes, Carlos/J-3045-2013; Rebelo, Rui/D-7054-2013","Fernandes, Carlos/0000-0002-1386-8103; Fernandes, Carlos/0000-0002-1386-8103; Rebelo, Rui/0000-0003-2544-1470; Santos-Reis, Margarida/0000-0002-0337-963X",Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia''Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PTDC/BIA-BEC/102433/2008]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [D/07/49405]; Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),"We would like to thank the Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia'' for funding Project DILEMA-Alien species and conservation dilemmas: the effects of native competitors and alien prey species on the spread of the American mink in Portugal'' (PTDC/BIA-BEC/102433/2008).

High degree of eurybiontity of these species, allowing them to successfully resist the effects of sharp fluctuations in abiotic environmental factors in the coastal zone, is noted. Comparison of the elements of life strategies of I. balthica basteri and L. monodi in the fouling community is made. The balance of interspecific relationships of these species within the fouling community is recorded. Competitive relations of I. balthica basteri and L. monodi are diffuse, reflecting relatively weak in strength interspecific interactions. It is shown that the ecological niches of these species overlap only on the axis of the habitat. Food competition between them has been greatly weakened due to trophic specialization of each species, owing to the features of the functional morphology of their mouthparts. Main elements of their life cycles associated with periods of mass reproduction and migration from the coastal zone are separated in time. It is found that both species exhibit a fairly high degree of care for their offsprings. Comparison of annual biomass changeability of both species, reflecting the characteristics of their reproductive cycle in fouling communities, is made. It is shown that these species reach their maximum biomass in different seasons. We also noted their pronounced protective coloration integument of the body, which is the passive way of protection from predators.

Results from field studies, however, are inconsistent: Some showing that coexisting plant species predominantly utilize inorganic N, while others reveal distinct interspecies preferences for different N forms. As a result, the extent to which hypothetical niches are realized in nature remains unclear. Here, we used in situ stable isotope tracer techniques to test the idea, in temperate grassland, that niche partitioning of N based on chemical form is related to plant productivity and the relative availability of organic and inorganic N. We also tested in situ whether grassland plants vary in their ability to compete for, and utilize peptides, which have recently been shown to act as an N source for plants in strongly N-limited ecosystems. We hypothesized that plants would preferentially use NO3--N and NH4+-N over dissolved organic N in high-productivity grassland where inorganic N availability is high. On the other hand, in low-productivity grasslands, where the availability of dissolved inorganic N is low, and soil availability of dissolved organic N is greater, we predicted that plants would preferentially use N from amino acids and peptides, prior to microbial mineralization. Turves from two well-characterized grasslands of contrasting productivity and soil N availability were injected, in situ, with mixtures of N-15-labeled inorganic N (NO3- and NH4+) and (CN)-C-13-N-15 labeled amino acid (l-alanine) and peptide (l-tri-alanine). In order to measure rapid assimilation of these N forms by soil microbes and plants, the uptake of these substrates was traced within 2.5hours into the shoots of the most abundant plant species, as well as roots and the soil microbial biomass. We found that, contrary to our hypothesis, the majority of plant species across both grasslands took up most N in the form of NH4+, suggesting that inorganic N is their predominant N source. However, we did find that organic N was a source of N which could be utilized by plant species at both sites, and in the low-productivity grassland, plants were able to capture some tri-alanine-N directly. Although our findings did not support the hypothesis that differences in the availability of inorganic and organic N facilitate resource partitioning in grassland, they do support the emerging view that peptides represent a significant, but until now neglected, component of the terrestrial N cycle.","[Wilkinson, Anna; Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Wilkinson, Anna; Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Hill, Paul W.; Farrar, John F.; Jones, Davey L.] Bangor Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Vaieretti, Maria V.] Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina","Wilkinson, A (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",anna.wilkinson@manchester.ac.uk,"jones, davey/AAN-5606-2020; Jones, Davey L/C-7411-2011; Jones, Davey/AAD-6037-2020","Jones, Davey L/0000-0002-1482-4209; Jones, Davey/0000-0002-1482-4209","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/E017304/1]; NERC Life Sciences Mass Spectrometry Facility; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I012303/1, NE/E013732/1, NER/G/S/2003/00008, NE/I027150/1, ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish","We gratefully acknowledge funding provided by the Natural Environment Research Council (Grant Number NE/E017304/1) awarded to RDB, DLJ and JF, and the support of Dr Andy Stott and Helen Grant of NERC Life Sciences Mass Spectrometry Facility in carrying out stable isotope analyses.",,41,14,14,5,81,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Changes in fruit structural and material properties are predicted to have key effects on predispersal granivory. Methods: Here, we asked whether plant structure can increase the fitness of a hybrid invasive relative to its progenitors. We compared fruit traits of the hybrid-derived lineage, California wild radish, with its progenitors, cultivated radish and jointed charlock. Key results: The hybrid lineage is significantly different from one or both ancestors in fruit length, mass, diameter, volume, shape, wall strength, and internal seed distribution. We experimentally exposed the fruits of both hybrid and wild progenitor to avian granivores and found (1) different types and degrees of damage at the different fruit sections and (2) significant differences in the inflicted damage at different sections of the fruit. Conclusions: Combining our descriptive and experimental data, we conclude that the novel seed protection of the hybrid California wild radish is an important defense mechanism. It offers differential protection to its seeds and according to our findings, better protection of seeds that have been found to be better competitors. We suggest then that the fruit has enabled, at least in part, the successful replacement of the parental species by the hybrid lineage.","[Heredia, Sylvia M.; Ellstrand, Norman C.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Heredia, Sylvia M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Heredia, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",sylviah@biodiversity.ubc.ca,,,John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation; U.

We combined stable isotopes and quantitative mouthpart morphometric data to investigate trophic structure among sympatric species in a diverse subterranean amphipod assemblage in the Edwards Aquifer, Texas, U.S.A. Seven amphipod species occupied different regions of isotopic (C-13 and N-15) space, suggesting the use of different food resources. Trophic position, measured as N-15, was negatively correlated with planar area of the mandible and number of molar ridges, while it was positively correlated with incisor width. Reduced molar size and robust incisors are generally associated with predatory feeding strategies in non-subterranean amphipods. C-13 exhibited non-significant relationships with mouthpart morphology although one species, Texiweckeliopsis insolita, had significantly different mouthpart and C-13 values. Another species, Stygobromus russelli, had more generalised mouthparts, but isotope values indicate that it had a unique and unidentified feeding method and food source, illustrating the obfuscating effect of phylogeny on form-function relationships. Intraspecific relationships between body size and isotope values indicate that amphipod species showed little to moderate ontogenetic shifts in trophic position. Furthermore, body size did not predict trophic position when data were combined across species, suggesting that larger amphipods do not necessarily feed at higher trophic levels in this community. Our results indicate that sympatric subterranean amphipod species can exhibit specialised feeding strategies, suggesting that competition among species is driving niche partitioning. These results contradict the assumption that variable resource availability in groundwater habitats selects for trophic generalists among sympatric species.","[Hutchins, Benjamin T.] Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept, 4200 Smith Sch Rd, Austin, TX 78744 USA; [Hutchins, Benjamin T.; Schwartz, Benjamin F.; Nowlin, Weston H.] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX USA","Hutchins, BT (corresponding author), Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept, 4200 Smith Sch Rd, Austin, TX 78744 USA.",ben.hutchins@tpwd.texas.gov,,"Hutchins, Benjamin/0000-0003-2030-4215; Schwartz, Benjamin/0000-0002-0072-344X","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [s 1210270, 0742306]","Funding for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF award #s 1210270, 0742306), The Crustacean Society and Geological Society of America.

Here, we quantify the phylogenetic structure of individual primate communities to evaluate these factors relative to a null model. Then, we examine the effects of species richness and local climate on variation in community phylogenetic structure. We analyze 71 haplorhine and 29 strepsirrhine communities in Africa and quantify their net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon (NTI) indices. Significantly low, i.e., phylogenetically even, NRI and NTI values are indicative of interspecific competition in the past, resulting in closely related species not being found in the same community. In contrast, significantly high, i.e., phylogenetically clustered, NRI and NTI values suggest that closely related species have similar ecological requirements, resulting in closely related species occupying the same community. In a second set of analyses, we used simultaneous autoregressive models to examine if species richness, rainfall, and temperature predict variation in community phylogenetic structure. Most individual communities exhibited phylogenetically random species assemblages. However, significantly structured haplorhine communities were even whereas strepsirrhine communities were clustered. Species richness significantly predicted variation in haplorhine phylogenetic structure, whereas abiotic factors significantly predicted variation in strepsirrhine phylogenetic structure. We suggest that past interspecific competition and habitat filtering have affected a relatively small proportion of African primate communities, but that past interspecific competition has more strongly influenced haplorhine communities whereas environmental conditions have more strongly influenced strepsirrhine communities. Our study illustrates the utility of phylogenetic metrics and spatially explicit models for understanding primate communities.","[Kamilar, Jason M.; Reed, Kaye E.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kamilar, Jason M.] Midwestern Univ, Dept Anat, Arizona Coll Osteopath Med, Glendale, AZ 85308 USA; [Beaudrot, Lydia] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Beaudrot, Lydia] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Reed, Kaye E.] Arizona State Univ, Inst Human Origins, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Kamilar, JM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",jkamilar@midwestern.edu,"; Beaudrot, L./M-6936-2017","Kamilar, Jason/0000-0001-6082-9396; Beaudrot, L./0000-0001-8135-7519",,,,66,7,7,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0164-0291,1573-8604,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

Although many models have been established to avoid the problem, most of them are rather complicated. This paper considers a mutualism model of two species, which is derived from reactions on lattice and has a form similar to that of LVEs. Population sizes in the model will not increase infinitely since there is interspecific competition for sites on the lattice. Global dynamics of the model demonstrate essential features of mutualisms and basic mechanisms by which the mutualisms can lead to persistence/extinction of mutualists. Our analysis not only confirms typical dynamics obtained by numerical simulations in a previous work, but also exhibits a new one. Saddle-node bifurcation, transcritical bifurcation and pitchfork bifurcation in the system are demonstrated, while a relationship between saddle-node bifurcation and pitchfork bifurcation in the model is displayed. Numerical simulations validate and extend our conclusions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Confirmed reports of cougar in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have increased dramatically in frequency during the last five years, leading to speculation that cougars may re-establish in the Upper Great Lakes (UGL) region, USA. Recent work showed favorable cougar habitat in northeastern Minnesota, suggesting that the northern forested regions of Michigan and Wisconsin may have similar potential. Recolonization of cougars in the UGL states would have important ecological, social, and political impacts that will require effective management. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we extended a cougar habitat model to Michigan and Wisconsin and incorporated primary prey densities to estimate the capacity of the region to support cougars. Results suggest that approximately 39% (>58,000 km(2)) of the study area could support cougars, and that there is potential for a population of approximately 500 or more animals. An exploratory validation of this habitat model revealed strong association with 58 verified cougar locations occurring in the study area between 2008 and 2013. Conclusions/Significance: Spatially explicit information derived from this study could potentially lead to estimation of a viable population, delineation of possible cougar-human conflict areas, and the targeting of site locations for current monitoring. Understanding predator-prey interactions, interspecific competition, and human-wildlife relationships is becoming increasingly critical as top carnivores continue to recolonize the UGL region.","[Oneil, Shawn T.; Rahn, Kasey C.; Bump, Joseph K.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Bump, JK (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",jkbump@mtu.edu,,"O'Neil, Shawn/0000-0002-0899-5220",School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science Ecosystem Science Center at Michigan Technological University,"This project was funded and supported by the School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science Ecosystem Science Center at Michigan Technological University.

We show that the spin-dependent interactions, which break the (pseudo-) spin-rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian, generally lead to the appearance of a magnetically ordered phase at temperatures above the superfluid transition. In three dimensions, we predict a normal easy-axis (easy-plane) ferromagnet for sufficiently strong repulsive (attractive) interspecies interactions, respectively. The normal easy-axis ferromagnet is the bosonic analog of Stoner ferromagnetism known in electronic systems. For the case of interspecies attraction, we also discuss the possibility of a bosonic analog of the Cooper-paired phase. This state is shown to significantly lose in energy to the transverse ferromagnet in three dimensions, but is more energetically competitive in lower dimensions. Extending our calculations to a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus-type couplings (as recently realized in experiment), we investigate the possibility of stripe ordering in the normal phase. Within our approximations, however, we do not find an instability towards stripe formation, suggesting that the stripe order melts below the condensation temperature, which is consistent with the experimental observations of Ji et al.","[Radic, Juraj; Natu, Stefan S.; Galitski, Victor] Univ Maryland, Joint Quantum Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Radic, Juraj; Natu, Stefan S.; Galitski, Victor] Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, Condensed Matter Theory Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Galitski, Victor] Monash Univ, Sch Phys, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Radic, J (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Joint Quantum Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,Army Research Office (ARO) MURIMURI; Physics Frontier Center at the Joint Quantum Institute - National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) MURIUnited States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)MURI; ARO; Aspen Center of Physics (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1066293]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1430094] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This work was supported by the Army Research Office (ARO) MURI (J.

Habituation has invaluable strengths, particularly in quantity and diversity of data collected, but along with these come substantial weaknesses, i.e., costs both in time and effort, health risks, and potential exposure of subjects to poaching. With new technologies, we are able to extend our studies beyond the limitations of habituation; camera traps are one technology that can be used to study unhabituated primate groups. In this study we used eight camera traps over the course of 2 yr (1542 camera trap days) to capture thousands of still images of West African savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Fal,m, region of southeastern Senegal. Images corroborated behavioral observations from habituated chimpanzees at the Fongoli site, where researchers have observed nocturnal activity and cave use. The cameras also captured interspecies interactions at water sources during the dry season and allowed us to determine demographic composition and minimum community size. The photographs provide data on local fauna, including predators (Panthera pardus pardus, Panthera leo senegalesis, and Crocuta crocuta), potential prey, and competitor species (Papio papio, Cercopithecus aethiops, and Erythrocebus patas). As primate habitat across Africa is further threatened and human-wildlife conflict increases, camera trapping could be used as an essential conservation tool, expanding studies of primates without exacerbating potential threats to the species.","[Boyer-Ontl, Kelly M.; Pruetz, Jill D.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Boyer-Ontl, KM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",kmboyer@iastate.edu,"Ontl, Kelly Boyer/P-5052-2019","Ontl, Kelly Boyer/0000-0001-7441-0289; Pruetz, Jill/0000-0002-9151-8571",Houston Zoo Inc.'s Naturally Wild Conservation Department; United States Fish and Wildlife Service Great Ape Conservation Fund; Margot Marsh Biodiversity Fund; Blank Park Zoo; Department of Anthropology at Iowa State University,"We thank the Republic of Senegal and Department of Eaux et Forets for permission to work in Senegal.

It assumes that extinction and adaptation are negligible at ecological scales. Meanwhile, shifts associated with global change have been observed in metacommunity composition (species pools affected by extinctions and introductions) and in phenotypes. This suggests that predictions of future composition must move beyond re-sorting present-day species with fixed traits. We extend plant species-sorting concepts to consider biogeography and demography. We give an empirical context, highlighting the influences of biogeography, species-sorting and adaptation on community composition. LocationGlobal; case studies focus on the terrestrial mediterranean biome. MethodsWe review case studies of empirical approaches that have examined community composition at various scales. We develop a mathematical model based on community mechanics that incorporates species-sorting with shifting phenotypes and species pools. ResultsAs illustrated by real examples, community composition is influenced by factors such as history, modern extinction risk, species-sorting, biotic interactions, adaptation and ecological drift. There is ample evidence that species pools and phenotypes are not constant at ecological scales in the context of global change. Any implicit assumption in community analysis that they are constant should therefore be revisited. Our model breaks down shifting community constraints into intraspecific components - including genotype sorting, selection and plasticity - and interspecific components, including changes in relative abundance and species replacement from a shifting metacommunity. Main conclusionsPredictions of community composition could benefit from extending species-sorting, to allow species pools and species traits to shift through time, as dealt with explicitly in our framework. The model predicts that responses to a shifting community constraint can be more diverse than deterministic species re-sorting. Consequently, the rate of species replacement depends on factors such as species adaptive capacity, competition, physical disturbance and habitat fragmentation.","[Guerin, Greg R.; Biffin, Ed; Baruch, Zdravko; Breed, Martin F.; Christmas, Matthew J.; Cross, Hugh B.; Lowe, Andrew J.] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Martin-Fores, Irene] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Ecol, Madrid, Spain; [Cross, Hugh B.; Lowe, Andrew J.] Dept Environm Water & Nat Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Lowe, Andrew J.] S Australian Museum, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia","Guerin, GR (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",greg.guerin@adelaide.edu.au,"Guerin, Greg R./R-8955-2019; Martin-Fores, Irene/F-3544-2016; Breed, Martin F/G-5482-2011","Martin-Fores, Irene/0000-0003-3627-0347; Breed, Martin F/0000-0001-7810-9696; Guerin, Greg/0000-0002-2104-6695; Christmas, Matthew/0000-0002-6355-7581; Lowe, Andrew/0000-0003-1139-2516","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP110100721, FS110200051]; South Australian Premier's Science and Research Fund; Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Network","Funding and support were provided by the Australian Research Council (Linkage Project LP110100721; Super Science Fellowship FS110200051), South Australian Premier's Science and Research Fund and the Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Network.",,50,8,8,2,97,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

In company with consequences for nutrient release patterns influences on the survival of fungal plant pathogens and their phytopathogenicity can be expected. Both, litter decomposition and pathogen survival, was analyzed in a 70-day litterbag incubation experiment. Continuous +4 degrees C was compared to permanent frost (-3 degrees C) and different freeze-thaw cycles for the decomposition of maize residues and disease potential of soil-borne plant pathogens Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium graminearum, and Rhizoctonia solani. Frost generally reduced maize residue decomposition. On the lower levels of CO2 production in the permanent or occasionally frost treatments pathogen inoculation had large effects on microbial maize use, indicating high saprotrophic activity of pathogens even in cold winter scenarios. Pathogen inoculation led to higher amino sugar contents of maize residue dwelling microbial organisms. At constant 4 degrees C remarkable high amounts of glucosamine were detected, indicating higher substrate use efficiency without frost. Both, temperature treatments as well as intra- and interspecific competition directed the development of pathogens after inoculation. F. culmorum took large advantage from the non-frost scenario, while no significant increase was found under continuous frost. F. graminearum was also able to increase its abundance at +4 degrees C. But this was strongly reduced when F. graminearum was in competition to the other two pathogens. In summary, E culmorum was found to be highly frost tolerant and competitive against E graminearum, particularly under conditions of freeze-thaw cycles since F. culmorum was able to take a large share of saprotrophic litter residue use under the cold conditions. Biomass of R. solani was strongly decomposed in all treatments. We conclude that constant mild conditions during winter can increase biomass of E culmorum and F. graminearum in crop residues, causing increased infection pressure in the next season. In contrast to that, frost and freeze-thaw events can lower the build-up of Fusarium biomass and thus diminish the risk of crop infection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Phylogenetic clustering of species, when species are more closely related than expected by chance, suggests a process of evolutionary niche conservatism. Because such communities share much evolutionary history and an affinity for similar environmental conditions, they may be particularly susceptible to threats such as insects and diseases and shifting climate conditions. Meanwhile, a pattern of phylogenetic evenness, in which the species are less closely related than by chance, may indicate competitive exclusion or interspecies facilitation. The ecological integrity of such communities may be less at risk because they may encompass a wider variety of evolutionary adaptations. Using a network of more than 100,000 forest inventory plots across the conterminous United States, we tested whether community phylogenetic structure was significantly clustered or even at multiple scales. Clustering predominated across most of the study area, indicating the widespread significance of evolutionary niche conservatism, except in areas of the west. Phylogenetic structure varied along environmental gradients, suggesting that clustering predominates in more favorable locations and evenness predominates in areas with harsher environments. These results have implications for broad-scale forest health monitoring.","[Potter, Kevin M.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27713 USA; [Koch, Frank H.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Station, Washington, DC USA","Potter, KM (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27713 USA.",kpotter@ncsu.edu; fhkoch@fs.fed.us,"Potter, Kevin M./I-4455-2019","Potter, Kevin M./0000-0002-7330-5345; Koch, Frank/0000-0002-3750-4507","USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [06-JV-11330146-124, 08-JV-11330146-078, 12-JV-11330146-063]; North Carolina State University [06-JV-11330146-124, 08-JV-11330146-078, 12-JV-11330146-063]","We appreciate the technical assistance of Cam Webb, Kurt Riitters, and Bill Smith, and we extend our appreciation to Mark Ambrose for his discussions and comments about the analyses, as well as to two anonymous reviewers who provided helpful comments.

By tracking the fates of all 701 horses known to have lived on Sable Island, Canada, from 2009 to 2013 (where there is no predation, human interference, or interspecific competition for food), we present a detailed analysis of structured population dynamics with focus on interacting effects of intraspecific competition and weather on reproduction and survival. Annual survival of adult females (0.866 +/- 0.107 [(x) over bar +/- SE]) was lower than that of 3-year-olds (0.955 +/- 0.051), although annual fecundity (producing a foal in a year that was observed during our census) was higher in adults (0.616 +/- 0.023) compared to 3-year-olds (0.402 +/- 0.054). Milder winters and lower densities during gestation increased fecundity. Density negatively impacted survival for all age and sex categories; however, highest adult female survival was observed during high-density years coupled with a harsh winter, the result expected if pregnancy loss during winter or loss of foals in spring improved survival. Three-year-old females, which reproduced at lower rates, experienced higher survival than adults. Our results contrast with a previous study of feral horses that suggested recently feral ungulates might be artificially selected to reproduce even when costs to survival are high. In part, this may be because of the comparably long history of feralization (250 years; at least 25 generations) for Sable Island horses.","[Richard, Emmanuelle; Simpson, Steven E.; Medill, Sarah A.; McLoughlin, Philip D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada","Richard, E (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.",emmanuelle.richard@rocketmail.com,,,,,,51,11,11,6,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Quantitative genetic theory suggests that the sex under historically stronger directional selection will exhibit greater interspecific variance in size, with covariation between allometric slopes (male to female size) and the strength of SSD across clades. Rensch's rule (RR) also suggests a correlation, but one in which males are always the more size variant sex. Examining free-living pelagic and parasitic Copepoda, we test these competing predictions. Females are commonly the larger sex in copepod species. Comparing clades that vary by four orders of magnitude in their degree of dimorphism, we show that isometry is widespread. As such we find no support for either RR or for covariation between allometry and SSD. Our results suggest that selection on both sexes has been equally important. We next test the prediction that variation in the degree of SSD is related to the adult sex ratio. As males become relatively less abundant, it has been hypothesized that this will lead to a reduction in both inter-male competition and male size. However, the lack of such a correlation across diverse free-living pelagic families of copepods provides no support for this hypothesis. By comparison, in sea lice of the family Caligidae, there is some qualitative support of the hypothesis, males may suffer elevated mortality when they leave the host and rove for sedentary females, and their female-biased SSD is greater than in many free-living families. However, other parasitic copepods which do not appear to have obvious differences in sex-based mate searching risks also show similar or even more extreme SSD, therefore suggesting other factors can drive the observed extremes.","[Hirst, Andrew G.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Hirst, Andrew G.; Kiorboe, Thomas] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark","Hirst, AG (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",a.g.hirst@qmul.ac.uk,"Kiorboe, Thomas/ABI-4733-2020; Kiorboe, Thomas/G-3190-2011","Kiorboe, Thomas/0000-0002-3265-336X; Hirst, Andrew/0000-0001-9132-1886",Villum Foundation; Villum Fonden [00007178] Funding Source: researchfish,The Centre for Ocean Life is a VKR Centre of Excellence funded by the Villum Foundation.,,56,31,31,0,46,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

While some experimental and simulation studies have shown that these effects can be compensated by lower browsing pressure, it is not clear how species composition and stand basal area may respond in the short and long term, and to which extent. We investigated the response of forests to isolated and combined changes of climatic conditions and ungulate browsing intensity in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), a strictly protected forest reserve. To this aim, we firstly characterized the browsing variability within the BFNP and among each tree species. Based on this, we implemented new equations in the forest gap model ForClim v3.0 and simulated the short- and long-term development of different forest types according to pertinent scenarios of browsing intensity. The model predicted a large dieback of the dominant Picea abies and Abies alba due to the increase in summer drought and winter temperatures; these species were progressively replaced by Fagus sylvatica. While climate change may have a positive impact on tree diversity in the short term (similar to 100 years), long-term simulations (>1000 years) revealed reduced tree diversity and stand basal area compared to those predicted under current climate. While species composition was strongly dependent on browsing intensity under current climate through the changes in seedling selectivity by ungulates and in light regimes, the trajectory of vegetation development under climate change was not significantly altered by browsing. Even for highly palatable species such as A. alba, an eradication of ungulates could not compensate the decline of drought-intolerant species. We conclude that forest management tools to reduce ungulates population may be helpful to promote species diversity in P. abies dominated forest. However they may not be sufficient to compensate for the reduction in basal area and diversity that is induced by climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We also explored whether interspecific competition between invaders could drive phenotypic divergence. Residence time had no significant effect on genetic diversity, phenotypic divergence, effective population size, or signatures of expansion of invasive trout. In contrast, secondary releases had a major effect on trout invasions, and rainbow trout populations mostly affected by aquaculture escapees showed significant divergence from less affected populations. Coexistence with brown trout had a positive effect on phenotypic divergence of rainbow trout. Our results highlight an important role of secondary releases in shaping fish invasions, but do not support the contention that older invaders are more differentiated than younger ones. They also suggest that exotic trout may not have yet developed local adaptations in these recently invaded habitats, at least with respect to growth-related traits.","[Monzon-Argueello, Catalina; Consuegra, Sofia; Marco-Rius, Francisco; Fowler, Daniel M.; de Leaniz, Carlos Garcia] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Gajardo, Gonzalo] Univ Los Lagos, Lab Genet Acuicultura & Biodiversidad, Osorno, Chile; [DeFaveri, Jacquelin] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Helsinki, Finland","de Leaniz, CG (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",c.garciadeleaniz@swansea.ac.uk,"de Leaniz, Carlos Garcia/AAQ-4171-2020; Gajardo, Gonzalo/AAN-3507-2020; G., Gonzalo Gajardo/H-6104-2019; Consuegra, Sofia/G-1788-2010","de Leaniz, Carlos Garcia/0000-0003-1650-2729; Gajardo, Gonzalo/0000-0001-8634-141X; Consuegra, Sofia/0000-0003-4403-2509","DEFRA Darwin Initiative [162/15/020, EIDPOC 041]; Fundacion Alfonso Martin Escudero (Spain)","We thank Kyle Young, Hector Venegas, Patricia Beristain, Jose Sanzana, Anita Cerda, Gabriel Orellana, Delphine Vanhaecke, and several volunteers for collecting the samples, Paolo Prodohl for facilitating the brown trout primers, Florent Bourlette for helping with scale readings, and Juha Merila, Craig Primmer, Kay Lucek, and an anonymous reviewer for useful comments on the manuscript.

While the exceptional floristic richness of the South African Cape has largely been attributed to adaptive divergence ('ecological' speciation), a combination of climatic dynamism and complex topography has likely provided ample opportunities for 'non-ecological' vicariant speciation, a mechanism which is perhaps more likely to produce cryptic species. We explore the role of topography as a driver of 'non-ecological' speciation in the high-elevation sedge Tetraria triangularis. Within this species, molecular and morphological data reveal five cryptic or semi-cryptic lineages of Miocene-Pliocene age which qualify as evolutionary species. At least three of these maintain their distinctness in sites of sympatry, identifying them as biological species. Negligible range overlap, and the identification of topography as a significant predictor of range turnover, identifies speciation as allopatric and a result of impeded gene flow across low-elevation topographic features. Weak morphological and ecological divergence implies a limited role for adaptive divergence in powering speciation, with character displacement in sympatry possibly arising as a consequence of interspecific competition. Although we cannot exclude a role for disruptive selection in species differentiation, we identify isolation of populations on topographically separated mountains as the principal motor of speciation. We suggest that the importance of topography in the genesis of Cape floristic diversity has been inadequately acknowledged. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

They are composed by a sequence of nominal entities (syllables, words and sentences) and by magnitude modulation confirming in such a way contemporarily a behavioural and ecological nature. The acoustic codes find evidence in the acoustic niche hypothesis by which species in order to reduce interspecific competition (acoustic overlap) occupy a restricted portion of the available frequencies modulating very precise acoustic cues (codes). Their evolution, like other aspect of biology, is under control of the environmental conditions assuming the more favourable configurations. These nominal entities respond also to the amount of energy by which are emitted allowing to the eavesdropping individuals to range the distance at which a potential competitor is broadcasting a signal. Environmental alterations, especially if of anthropogenic origin, can produce severe consequence of the acoustic codes that in turn may affect the prey-predator balance and the complexity of communities. In fact acoustic codes under an environmental constraint like human noise intrusion can be modified in order to reduce a masking effect, demonstrating their phenological plasticity. The new ecological discipline of soundscape ecology offers the possibility to investigate the nature and the evolution of the acoustic codes in different environmental conditions.","[Farina, Almo; Pieretti, Nadia] Univ Urbino, Dept Basic Sci & Fdn, I-61029 Urbino, Italy","Farina, A (corresponding author), Univ Urbino, Dept Basic Sci & Fdn, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",almo.farina@uniurb.it,,"Pieretti, Nadia/0000-0003-1701-9368",,,,36,11,13,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1875-1342,1875-1350,,BIOSEMIOTICS-NETH,Biosemiotics,AUG,2014,7,2,,,,,321,328,,10.1007/s12304-014-9213-0,,,8,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; History & Philosophy Of Science",Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; History & Philosophy of Science,AP6TW,WOS:000342211700010,,,,,2021-09-21,

Studies of vertebrates, including reptiles, report conflicting results regarding the generality of this evolutionary pattern. We studied the size evolution of insular turtles at the intra- and interspecific levels, as well as the clade level. We examined the evolutionary patterns, the relationship of habitat preferences and insular turtle size and whether the island rule extends to turtles. Location Islands world-wide and adjacent continents. Methods We collected data from the literature and expanded our database by measuring turtle specimens in museum collections. We used reduced major axis regression to test the island rule at the inter- and intraspecific levels, after accounting for phylogenetic effects. In addition, we compared body size frequency distributions of insular versus mainland turtles at the clade level. Results Our analyses revealed no support for the island rule in turtles. Intraspecifically, we found no systematic pattern of body size evolution. Interspecifically, large turtle species tend to become larger on islands, in contrast to the island rule predictions. Islands generally harbour larger turtles than mainland regions. This pattern is especially apparent when recently extinct species are considered. We found no impact of habitat preferences on the evolution of body size on islands. Main conclusions Turtles on islands do not follow the island rule. We suggest that both physiological and ecological factors drive turtle body size evolution on islands, and their tendency for insular gigantism. Large turtles can survive longer periods of water or food shortage on small oceanic islands. Increased intraspecific competition and reduced interspecific competition and predation on islands may favour large body size. A non-mutually exclusive explanation is that the presence of giant tortoises on islands may reflect founder effects rather than evolution - large turtles are better island colonizers.","[Itescu, Yuval; Meiri, Shai] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Karraker, Nancy E.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Raia, Pasquale] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ambiente & Risorse, I-80138 Naples, Italy; [Pritchard, Peter C.

The likelihood of finding individuals of both species in the inner or outer fjord areas was dependent on water temperature in the inner area (especially for S. alpinus), the temperature difference between the inner and outer areas (especially for S. trutta) and fish fork length (both species). The strongest predictor was the water temperature in the inner area, and particularly S. alpinus left this area and moved to the outer areas with increasing temperatures in the inner area. At 8 degrees C in the inner area, the likelihood of finding S. alpinus in the outer areas was >50%. This predictor had a smaller effect on S. trutta, and the likelihood of finding S. trutta in the outer areas only started to increase at around 14 degrees C. The relationships between temperature and area use did not correspond to the species' optimal growth temperatures, but to their previously documented temperature preferences. Individuals of both species used mainly the littoral fjord areas, and to a lesser extent the pelagic areas. In conclusion, temperature differences between the inner and outer marine areas probably resulted in the segregated area use between the species, because water temperatures or factors influenced by temperature affected their migratory behaviour and habitat use differently. The results indicate that increased marine temperatures with global warming may lead to increased spatial overlap between S. trutta and S. alpinus, which again may lead to increased interspecific competition during their marine phase, and with S. alpinus probably being the more negatively affected.

We conducted two concurrent experiments over 3 years to examine how tree seedling diversity, density and herbivory affected forest regeneration. One experiment factorially manipulated plant diversity (one versus 15 species) and the presence/absence of deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found that mixtures outperformed monocultures only in the presence of deer. Selective browsing on competitive dominants and associational protection from less palatable species appear responsible for this herbivore-driven diversity effect. The other experiment manipulated monospecific plant density and found little evidence for negative density dependence. Combined, these experiments suggest that the higher performance in mixture was owing to the acquisition of positive interspecific interactions rather than the loss of negative intraspecific interactions. Overall, we emphasize that realistic predictions about the consequences of changing biodiversity will require a deeper understanding of the interaction between plant diversity and higher trophic levels. If we had manipulated only plant diversity, we would have missed an important positive interaction across trophic levels: diverse seedling communities better resist herbivores, and herbivores help to maintain seedling diversity.","[Cook-Patton, Susan C.; LaForgia, Marina; Parker, John D.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Cook-Patton, SC (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",cook-pattons@si.edu,"Parker, John D/F-9761-2010","Parker, John D/0000-0002-3632-7625",Smithsonian Scholarly StudiesSmithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Postdoctoral FellowshipSmithsonian Institution,A Smithsonian Scholarly Studies grant to J.D.P. and a Smithsonian Postdoctoral Fellowship to S.C.C. supported this work.,,50,29,30,3,108,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In vitro studies of Bacteroides and other bacteria have addressed mechanisms of conjugative transfer and some phenotypic outcomes of these DNA acquisitions in the recipient, such as the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. However, few studies have addressed the horizontal transfer of genetic elements between bacterial species coresident in natural microbial communities, especially microbial ecosystems of humans. Here, we examine the genomes of Bacteroidales species from two human adults to identify genetic elements that were likely transferred among these Bacteroidales while they were coresident in the intestine. Using seven coresident Bacteroidales species from one individual and eight from another, we identified five large chromosomal regions, each present in a minimum of three of the coresident strains at near 100% DNA identity. These five regions are not found in any other sequenced Bacteroidetes genome at this level of identity and are likely all integrative conjugative elements (ICEs). Such highly similar and unique regions occur in only 0.4% of phylogenetically representative mock communities, providing strong evidence that these five regions were transferred between coresident strains in these subjects. In addition to the requisite proteins necessary for transfer, these elements encode proteins predicted to increase fitness, including orphan DNA methylases that may alter gene expression, fimbriae synthesis proteins that may facilitate attachment and the utilization of new substrates, putative secreted antimicrobial molecules, and a predicted type VI secretion system (T6SS), which may confer a competitive ecological advantage to these strains in their complex microbial ecosystem. IMPORTANCE By analyzing Bacteroidales strains coresident in the gut microbiota of two human adults, we provide strong evidence for extensive interspecies and interfamily transfer of integrative conjugative elements within the intestinal microbiota of individual humans. In the recipient strain, we show that the conjugative elements themselves can be modified by the transposition of insertion sequences and retroelements from the recipient's genome, with subsequent transfer of these modified elements to other members of the microbiota. These data suggest that the genomes of our gut bacteria are substantially modified by other, coresident members of the ecosystem, resulting in highly personalized Bacteroidales strains likely unique to that individual. The genetic content of these ICEs suggests that their transfer from successful adapted members of an ecosystem confers beneficial properties to the recipient, increasing its fitness and allowing it to better compete within its particular personalized gut microbial ecosystem.","[Coyne, Michael J.; Comstock, Laurie E.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zitomersky, Naamah Levy] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Gastroenterol, Boston, MA USA; [McGuire, Abigail Manson; Earl, Ashlee M.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA USA","Comstock, LE (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",lcomstock@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"Manson, Abigail/B-7132-2016","Manson, Abigail/0000-0002-3800-0714; Zitomersky, Naamah/0000-0002-4047-1048; Earl, Ashlee/0000-0001-7857-9145","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U54-HG004969]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human ServicesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [HHSN272200900018C, AI081843, AI093771]; NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [U54HG004969] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI093771, R01AI081843, U19AI110818] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We acknowledge NIH for funding the sequencing of CL0 strains with grant U54-HG004969 to the Broad Institute.

First, we predicted and experimentally confirmed the species ratio to which a two-species mutualistic consortium converges and the equilibrium composition of a newly engineered three-member community. We next identified a specific spatial arrangement of colonies, which gives rise to what we term the ''eclipse dilemma'': does a competitor placed between a colony and its cross-feeding partner benefit or hurt growth of the original colony?

In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of the invasion mechanisms and ecological impacts of Gracilaria vermiculophylla, a red agarophyte native to Asia Northwest Pacific, which now has become a rapid and successful coastal invader in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Eco-physiological and chemical studies have revealed that some ecological traits, including survival in dark condition (e.g. the ballast water), tolerance to grazing and extreme salinities and temperatures, insensitive to UVR and light intensity and nutrient levels, adaptation to a wide diversity of habitats, and chemical defense to potential predators, may provide G. vermiculophylla an unmatched advantage during its global invasion. The rapid growth, flexible reproduction through fragmentation, efficient recruitment on hard substratum, seeding success on various vectors, and interaction with local community organisms may also contribute to its rapid increase in abundance and effects on the invaded coastal ecosystems. G. vermiculophylla showed both negative and positive impacts to the marine ecosystems through changing interspecific competition, increasing habitat diversity, altering the community complex, and transforming biogeochemical cycles and estuarine food webs. Future surveys such as marine exotic genomics, transcriptome sequencing and epigenetic variation between native and invasive entities may provide insightful promise on molecular mechanisms of seaweed invasion.","[Hu, Zi-Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zi-Min; Juan, Lopez-Bautista] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Hu, ZM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",huzimin9712@163.com,"Hu, Zi-Min/A-7938-2011","Hu, Zi-Min/0000-0002-1313-1785","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31000103]; US National Science Foundation Assembling the Tree of Life ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1036495, DEB-0937978]","We thank everyone who shared with us observations from both experimental and field surveys.

Although it is widely assumed that invasive species impact will increase with density, theory suggests interspecific competition may diminish at high densities due to increased intraspecific interactions. To test this theory, we experimentally examined intra- and interspecific interactions between a globally invasive fish, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and three native species at different round goby densities in a tributary of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Eighteen 2.25 m(2) enclosures were stocked with native fish species at natural abundances, while round gobies were stocked at three different densities: 0 m(-2), 2.7 m(-2), and 10.7 m(-2). After 52 days, native fish growth rate was significantly reduced in the low density goby treatment, while growth in the high density goby treatment mirrored the goby-free treatment for two of three native species. Invertebrate density and gut content weight of native fishes did not differ among treatments. Conversely, gut content weight and growth of round gobies were lower in the high goby density treatment, suggesting interactions between round gobies and native fishes are mediated by interference competition amongst gobies. Our experiment provides evidence that invasive species effects may diminish at high densities, possibly due to increased intraspecific interactions. This is consistent with some ecological theory, and cautions against the assumption that invasive species at moderate densities have low impact.","[Kornis, Matthew S.; Carlson, Jedchada; Lehrer-Brey, Gabrielle; Vander Zanden, M.

Competition for limited resources is predicted to cause strong niche differentiation and a highly structured, but low diversity, bird assemblage. Using multivariate and bipartite network analyses based on 1771 foraging observations (33% of 5320 behavioral observations), we examined resource partitioning by 20 terrestrial bird species in mangroves of north Australia. The mangrove bird community largely comprised generalist insectivores that partitioned insects by size with moderate-to-high interspecific overlap in diet. Gleaning for insects was the most common foraging mode. Few species specialized on nectar. Flowers of one or more mangrove species were available in every month of the year and insect abundance was correlated with flowering peaks. Niche differentiation by birds was determined by food type and foraging mode more than by broad spatial (mangrove zones) or temporal (seasonal) segregation of the use of resources. There was little evidence of bird species saturation or species sorting, suggesting loose species packing and a lesser role than expected for species interactions and interference competition in structuring the bird assemblage in mangroves.","[Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan; Noske, Richard A.; Lawes, Michael J.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Resource Sci & Technol, Dept Zool, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia","Lawes, MJ (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",Michael.Lawes@cdu.edu.au,"Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan/AAJ-7304-2020; Lawes, Michael J/N-2132-2013","Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan/0000-0001-5513-6237; Lawes, Michael J/0000-0002-2381-6147",Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS); Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR); ARCAustralian Research Council [LP0667619],"MAJ was supported by Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and an ARC research grant LP0667619.

In the present study, the microbial diversity of the dominant psychrotrophic LAB recovered after incubation of plates at 22 degrees C for 5 days was determined using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. A total of 212 LAB isolates were identified using a combination of rep-PCR fingerprinting, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis and pheS gene sequencing. Leuconostoc gasicomitatum, Leuconostoc gelidum, Leuconostoc spp., Lactococcus piscium and Lactobacillus algidus proved to be the most competent and predominant species that may go undetected by the widely applied mesophilic enumeration protocols (ISO 4833:2003 and ISO 15214:1998).

Thirty-seven plots were studied along an altitudinal transect reaching from sea level (lowland rain forest) to an altitude of 1,830 m (mossy forest). A total of 1,755 specimens were collected and were assigned to 68 land-snail species. Eleven species were new records for Bioko. At least 15 of the recorded species are endemic to Bioko. The degree of endemism was high in mossy forest (23%) and in lowland rain forest (20%), but lower in montane forest (8%). Species richness showed a hump-shaped distribution along the altitudinal gradient with a maximum at 500 m a.s.l. Species richness peaked in forests in which there had been selective logging more than 50 years ago, indicating that some disturbance may have beneficial effects on biodiversity. Species richness was correlated with the thickness of leaf litter. The availability and quality of suitable microhabitats is more important for the occurrence of snail species than gradients of otherwise often decisive environmental parameters like temperature, which are strongly correlated with altitude. A lack of clustering of the occurrences of different snail species along the altitudinal gradient indicated a Gleasonian meta-community structure with individualistic responses of the various species to environmental parameters. No negative co-occurrence patterns that might provide evidence for interspecific competition could be detected. The frequent coexistence of morphologically similar, and presumably ecologically equivalent, congeneric species may indicate that such equivalents do not exclude each other as predicted by the neutral theory of biodiversity. However, current knowledge about individual snail species is too scanty to exclude the possibility that niches of congeneric species differ in some details.","[Wronski, Torsten] Umutara Polytech, Fac Vet Med, Dept Wildlife & Aquat Resource Management, Nyagatare, Rwanda; [Micha, Baltasar] Univ Nacl Guinea Ecuatorial, Fac Medio Ambiente, Malabo, Equat Guinea; [Hausdorf, Bernhard] Univ Hamburg, Zool Museum, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Wronski, T (corresponding author), Umutara Polytech, Fac Vet Med, Dept Wildlife & Aquat Resource Management, POB 57, Nyagatare, Rwanda.",t_wronski@gmx.de,"Hausdorf, Bernhard/E-9829-2016","Hausdorf, Bernhard/0000-0002-1604-1689; Gilbert, Kadeem/0000-0003-0105-8020; Wronski, Torsten/0000-0002-0853-6008",Bioko Biodiversity Protection Program (BBPP),"We would like to thank Jose Manuel Esara from the Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial for providing collection and export permits.

In CF patients Staphylococcus aureus is often the initial pathogen colonizing the lungs during childhood, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant pathogen isolated in adolescents and adults. During chronic infection, P. aeruginosa undergoes adaptation to cope with antimicrobial therapy, host response and co-infecting pathogens. However, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa often co-exist in the same niche influencing the CF pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to investigate the reciprocal interaction of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and understand the influence of P. aeruginosa adaptation to the CF lung in order to gain important insight on the interplay occurring between the two main pathogens of CF airways, which is still largely unknown. P. aeruginosa reference strains and eight lineages of clinical strains, including early and late clonal isolates from different patients with CF, were tested for growth inhibition of S. aureus. Next, P. aeruginosa/S. aureus competition was investigated in planktonic co-culture, biofilm, and mouse pneumonia model. P. aeruginosa reference and early strains, isolated at the onset of chronic infection, outcompeted S. aureus in vitro and in vivo models of co-infection. On the contrary, our results indicated a reduced capacity to outcompete S. aureus of P. aeruginosa patho-adaptive strains, isolated after several years of chronic infection and carrying several phenotypic changes temporally associated with CF lung adaptation. Our findings provide relevant information with respect to interspecies interaction and disease progression in CF.","[Baldan, Rossella; Testa, Francesca; Cirillo, Daniela M.] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Cigana, Cristina; Bianconi, Irene; De Simone, Maura; Bragonzi, Alessandra] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Infect & Cyst Fibrosis Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Pellin, Danilo; Di Serio, Clelia] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Univ Ctr Stat Biomed Sci, Milan, Italy","Cirillo, DM (corresponding author), Ist Sci San Raffaele, Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy.",cirillo.daniela@hsr.it,"Cigana, Cristina/D-2883-2016; Cirillo, Daniela Maria/AAB-3646-2019; Di Serio, Clelia/AAO-5494-2020","Cigana, Cristina/0000-0003-0436-9721; Cirillo, Daniela Maria/0000-0001-6415-1535; Bianconi, Irene/0000-0002-5923-4296; Baldan, Rossella/0000-0002-4674-4326; DI SERIO, Mariaclelia Stefania/0000-0001-6385-6058; Bragonzi, Alessandra/0000-0002-5808-7669",Fondazione per la ricerca sulla Fibrosi Cistica (project FFC) [9/2010],"This study was supported to DMC and AB by Fondazione per la ricerca sulla Fibrosi Cistica (project FFC#9/2010).

While pH1N1 is now considered to be in a post-pandemic stage in humans it has nevertheless spilled back into swine in at least 20 countries. Understanding the factors that increase the risk of spillover events between swine and humans is essential to predicting and preventing future outbreaks. We assessed risk factors that may have led to spillover of pH1N1 from humans to swine in Cameroon, Central Africa. We sampled swine, domestic poultry and wild birds for influenza A virus at twelve sites in Cameroon from December 2009 while the pandemic was ongoing, to August 2012. At the same time we conducted point-count surveys to assess the abundance of domestic livestock and wild birds and assess interspecific contact rates. Random forest models were used to assess which variables were the best predictors of influenza in swine. Results: We found swine with either active pH1N1 infections or positive for influenza A at four of our 12 sites. Only one swine tested positive by competitive ELISA in 2011-2012. To date we have found pH1N1 only in the North and Extreme North regions of Cameroon (regions in Cameroon are administrative units similar to provinces), though half of our sites are in the Central and Western regions. Swine husbandry practices differ between the North and Extreme North regions where it is common practice in to let swine roam freely, and the Central and Western regions where swine are typically confined to pens. Random forest analyses revealed that the three best predictors of the presence of pH1N1 in swine were contact rates between free-ranging swine and domestic ducks, contact rates between free-ranging swine and wild Columbiformes, and contact rates between humans and ducks. Sites in which swine were allowed to range freely had closer contact with other species than did sites in which swine were kept penned. Conclusions: Results suggest that the practice of allowing swine to roam freely is a significant risk factor for spillover of influenza from humans into swine populations.","[Larison, Brenda; Njabo, Kevin Y.; Chasar, Anthony; Fuller, Trevon; Harrigan, Ryan J.; Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Larison, Brenda; Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Larison, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Trop Res, 619 Charles E Young Dr East, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",blarison@ucla.edu,"Fuller, Trevon/B-8087-2014; Njabo, Kevin/AAQ-7907-2021","Fuller, Trevon/0000-0001-9954-4267; Larison, Brenda/0000-0002-0264-7276",NIH/NSFUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; Fogarty International CenterUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01-TW007869]; Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01TW007869] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Office Of Internatl Science &EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1243524] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This work is supported by an NIH/NSF Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases award from the Fogarty International Center R01-TW007869.

Originally a perish-urban forest, it has now become intra-urban, and shelters three statements of natural forests, administrative buildings, plantations of Pinus sp. and Eucalyptus sp., an arboretum dedicated to the wet dense forests of the Congo Basin, the sporting and university installations and a zoological park. The Patte d'Oie forest and the four others which completely disappeared (the Tsieme, the Corniche, the Glaciere and the Tchad) from urban space, these four forest statements have not been the object of an in-depth study. Before this study, the phytoecological data on the three forest statements were partial and generalized from studies carried on less than 1000 m(2). Moreover, they do not make any difference between the natural forest and the plantations. The floristic inventory of the forest statements reveals pauciflorous ecosystems (with 79.5 +/- 5.5 species per statement) compared to the wet dense forests of the Congo Basin. The floristic composition is sub-identic in the three statements forest and it is dominated by the Guineo-Congolese species (30 to 37.8%), in particular those belonging to the endemism sub-centre of the Low-Guinean (22 to 24%). The predominance of the sarcochores indicates that the principal mode of dissemination is the sarcochory (zoochory). However, the proportion of the anemochores dominated by pterochores (6 to 19%) and the good representativeness of heliophilous species are obvious signals of the disturbance of these ecosystems. The relative diversity of the families varies from 0.5 to 19.4% in the forest statements; the most represented are Rubiaceae, Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Dioscoreaceae. The relative frequency of taxa varies between 0.5 and 2.7%, whereas the relative density varies from 0.03 to 37.6%. The most abundant species are Rothmannia octomera, Rhabdophyllum arnoldianum, Markhamia tomentosa, Caloncoba welwitschii and Chaetocarpus africanus. Within this flora, the phanerophytes are dominating over the geophytes and the chamephytes. Finally, from a phytoecological standpoint, the three stands fall within the same ecological group. The analysis of the underwood flora reveals that only introduced species are represented by large trees, whereas the indigenous woody flora is represented by the shrubby species (Bosqueiopsis gilletii, Dracaena arborea, Voacanga chalotiana, Strychnos variabilis, Millettia eetveldeana and Markhamia tomentosa). The relative frequencies and the densities indicate that, except for Markhamia tomentosa, all the ligneous species characterising these ecosystems are disseminated. The consequence, induced by this space distribution of the ligneous species, is an insufficient installation of sowings, thus a poor natural regeneration. Moreover, the immigrant taxa have a good representativeness, in general, in the underwood forest stands. By associating remarkably density and interspecific competition, these species should characterise in the future the three stands of the Patte d'Oie forest.","[Kimpouni, Victor; Mbou, Paul; Apani, Ernest; Motom, Marcel] Univ Marien Ngouabi, Ecole Normale Super, BP 237, Brazzaville, Rep Congo","Kimpouni, V (corresponding author), Univ Marien Ngouabi, Ecole Normale Super, BP 237, Brazzaville, Rep Congo.",vkimpouni@yahoo.com,,,,,,74,1,1,1,12,SOC BOTANIQUE FRANCE,LILLE-CEDEX,"FACULTE DE PHARMACIE, BP 83, F-59006 LILLE-CEDEX, FRANCE",1253-8078,2166-3408,,ACTA BOT GALLICA,Acta Bot.

Monitoring the number of species of social wasps nesting attached to buildings is important to evaluate the effect of this activity on colony productivity. This study evaluated the effect of habitat alteration, particularly by human activity on the productivity of colonies of the wasp Polistes versicolor. We evaluated 20 abandoned nests and compared the productivity parameters: number of cells constructed, number of adults produced, nest dry mass, proportion of productive cells, number of generations, and diameter of the petiole. Most of these parameters showed higher values in the colonies nesting in the habitat less altered by human activity. Therefore, productivity was significantly higher in this habitat. In the nests, regardless of the site, the cells that were central and closer to the petiole were the most productive. Colonies in the two habitats used different strategies: in the habitat more altered by human activity, the wasps invested more in reusing cells than in enlarging the nest. However, the species continues to nest in the urban area, probably because of decreased interspecific competition, predation, and interference from climate variations.","[Torres, R. F.; Torres, V.

Relative influences of these processes should vary according to habitat features and dispersal. Species dispersion within assemblage trait space also should vary in relation to species richness, strength of competition, and the spatiotemporal scale of analysis. We examined ecomorphological diversity of two freshwater fish families (Neotropical Cichlidae, Nearctic Centrarchidae) to test theories of local assembly from regional species pools and theories of species packing within mesohabitat patches. Cichlid and centrarchid assemblages were surveyed in four floodplain rivers (two in South America and two in North America) during low-water periods when fish densities are highest. Surveys were conducted in four mesohabitat types (submerged wood, leaf litter, rocks, sand bank) within river channels and floodplain lakes. We measured 23 morphological traits associated with locomotion and feeding. Principal components analysis was performed on the species x traits matrix, and species axis scores were used to calculate species pairwise Euclidean distances and indices of dispersion within assemblage morphospace: mean nearest-neighbor distance (indicating similarity), mean distance to centroid (assemblage morphospace size), and standard deviation of nearest-neighbor distance (evenness of dispersion within assemblage morphospace). A null model was used to assess whether patterns were significantly nonrandom. When data for all mesohabitat types were combined for each river, species were significantly overdispersed and the assemblage morphospace was larger than predicted at random in every case. Analysis of assemblages within mesohabitat patches of different types revealed, in every case, significant overdispersion of species in morphospace indicative of limiting similarity. The total assemblage morphospace was greater than expected for tropical cichlids, but not for temperate centrarchids. Trends of species dispersion with assemblage morphospace in relation to species richness within mesohabitat patches were not consistent among or within river systems, possibly indicating that patches were already saturated with these perciform fishes. Interregional comparisons suggest an influence from both adaptive diversification and environmental filtering at broad spatial scales. At the scale of mesohabitat patches in lowland rivers, cichlid and centrarchid assemblages revealed patterns of trait complementarity that imply limiting similarity and strong influence of biotic interactions.","[Montana, Carmen G.; Winemiller, Kirk O.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Sutton, Andrew] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Montana, CG (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA.",cgmontan@ncsu.edu,,"Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0516831]; estate of George and Carolyn Kelso via the International Sportfish Fund; American Cichlid Association; Clark Hubbs Research Scholarship; Tom Slick Graduate Research Fellowship at Texas AM University,"We are grateful to the members of the Cinaruco Fishing Club and Jose Garcia and family for logistic support during our fieldwork in Cinaruco River, and to members of the Posada Amazonas lodge for their logistic support during our field work in the Tambopata River.

Population dynamics of rodents in all deserts are driven mainly by resource pulses induced by rainfall events. In a long-term perspective, this pattern is sometimes interrupted by rare extreme weather events and by habitat transformation due to wildfire or climate change. Rainfall-population density relations were found to be modified by intrinsic (population autoregulation, habitat selection) and extrinsic (interspecific competition, predation) processes, but the relative importance and geographic specificity of these processes are unclear. Density-dependent habitat selection was found in all studied desert rodent species inhabiting more than one habitat. Density-dependent habitat selection was expressed in different types of population regulation, resulting in density-dependent or density-independent habitat distribution. However, processes of density-dependent habitat selection have been studied in only one region; there are no data yet to analyze how different strategies of habitat selection vary among different desert regions. Dynamics of community composition include one widely distributed pattern, an increase in species richness with density. Another pattern, zero-sum community dynamic, was found in North American deserts. Dynamics of the niche community structure is expressed in the increase of niche overlap with density growth. In Palaearctic deserts, this increase in niche overlap was accompanied by stronger aggregation of niches in spatial guilds. The last phenomenon was not recorded in North American deserts, which reflects differences in expression of spatial guilds between Palaearctic and Nearctic rodent communities.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Shenbrot, G (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",shenbrot@bgu.ac.il,,,"Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [ISF 414/02, ISF 298/07]",The author is grateful to A.

DCE was first noticed about 50 years ago but till now the questions on causes of its origin, its scale and intensity remain open due to the lack of field data as well as methodological problems. In the article, these questions have been tested using arboreous tier of the West Caucasus forest phytocenoses as a case study. An analysis of actual data is conducted by means of numerical experiments. Three scenarios have been modeled: in the first one there has been assumed no manifestations of compensatory processes; in the second, after dropping some species out of community, all the other species rose in abundance; in the third, DCE was manifested through abundance increase of dominant species only. Model predictions on the analyzed parameters relationships have been checked against actual measurements. The results obtained suggest that for the DCE to occur, the absolute number of species in a community is not so much important as the ratio between their specific capacities, which is determined by environmental conditions, and the actual number of species, which may not match the capacity due to interference of regional processes (e.g., the history of cenoses formation, isolation, etc.). Thus, DCE does not appear to be an invariable consequence of environmental extremity and may occur in cenoses consisted of both many and few species.","[Akatov, V. V.; Chefranov, S.

Floodplains of the Amazon and its lowland tributaries are characterized by strong, yet predictable, hydrological seasonality, seasonal availability of fruits, seeds, and other food resources of terrestrial origin, and diverse assemblages of frugivorous fishes, including morphologically similar species of several characiform families. Here, we investigated how diets of frugivorous fishes in the Amazon change in response to fluctuations in food availability, and how this influences patterns of interspecific dietary overlap. We tested predictions from classical theories of foraging and resource competition by estimating changes in diet breadth and overlap across seasons. We monitored fruiting phenology to assess food availability, and surveyed local fish populations during three hydrological seasons in an oligotrophic river and an adjacent oxbow lake in the Colombian Amazon. We analyzed stomach contents and stable isotope data to evaluate temporal and interspecific relationships for dietary composition, breadth, and overlap. Diets of six species of characiform fishes representing three genera changed according to seasonal fluctuations in food availability, and patterns of diet breadth and interspecific overlap during the peak flood pulse were consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory. During times of high fruit abundance, fishes consumed items to which their functional morphological traits seemed best adapted, potentially enhancing net energy and nutritional gains. As the annual flood pulse subsided and availability of forest food resources in aquatic habitats changed, there was not a consistent pattern of diet breadth expansion or compression. Nonetheless, shifts in both diet composition and stable isotope ratios of consumer tissues during this period resulted in trophic niche segregation in a pattern consistent with competition theory.","[Correa, Sandra Bibiana; Winemiller, Kirk O.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, Sect Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Correa, SB (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, 715 Sumter St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",correas@mailbox.sc.edu,,"Correa, Sandra Bibiana/0000-0003-4466-6923; Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129",Wildlife Conservation Society's Research Fellowship Program; estate of Carolyn Wierichs Kelso,"We are grateful to field assistants (J.

Despite several studies have shown the effects of fertilization on primary production of alpine plants, only few studies have considered the influences of nutrients on reproduction. Here, we investigated the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) amendments on cover, number of ramets, flowering effort and phenological timing of Gnaphalium supinum, an arctic-alpine widespread snowbed species. We set up an experimental design with four fertilization treatments (low N, P without additional N, low N + P, and high N+P) and an unfertilized control for three years (2003-2005), within a late snowbed located in the Italian Alps (Gavia Pass, 2700 m a.s.l.). The cover of Gnaphalium supinum was recorded at the peak of the aboveground biomass development in the three years, while the temporal dynamic of ramet density and reproductive phenophases were monitored during the 2005 growing season. The clonal growth of G. supinum resulted to be co-limited by N and P, while the flowering effort was stimulated by P. Flowering date was advanced by P supply, while N alone did not show any significant effect on phenology. In a warming scenario, with a predicted increase in N and P availability by nutrient mineralization and atmospheric deposition, this species should probably experience some benefits for its growth and reproduction if not limited by other factors such as the length of the growing season or interspecific competition.

Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change.

The anticipated success of this programme will release the island's tundra-like vegetation from well over a century of grazing and disturbance from House Mouse (Mus musculus), Ship Rat (Rattus rattus) and most significantly European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). This study describes results from 30years of vegetation quadrat monitoring (prior to the most recent and comprehensive pest eradication programme) when lower level pest animal control programmes were underway. Plant species were assigned to one of five distinct functional plant groups: Indigenous short-lived perennials, Introduced short-lived perennials, Indigenous perennials rarely grazed by rabbits, Indigenous perennials occasionally grazed by rabbits and Indigenous long-lived perennials heavily grazed by rabbits, with one species, Agrostis magellanica, analysed as a sixth monospecific group. Results from monthly rabbit counts were used to compare changes in abundance of these six groups under different rabbit populations. It was found that there were three distinct phases of rabbit activity during the study period, indicated by (i) an initial very high count year in 1980-1981, followed by (ii) 20years of low counts ending in 2001-2002 after which (iii) counts rose to medium/high until the commencement of the eradication programme in 2010-2011. Vegetation composition and progression were distinct for these three rabbit count phases. The first four of the plant functional groups decreased under lower count periods and increased in cover under higher rabbit count periods. Agrostis magellanica appears to respond primarily to interspecies competition and is disadvantaged under extended periods of low rabbit numbers. Indigenous long-lived perennials heavily grazed by rabbits, which includes the large tussocks and megaherbs, is inversely related to rabbit numbers. During the study period, there has also been an overall decline in plant species richness with average species count per quadrat falling by between 0.6 and 2.7 taxa. This study attempts to address the observed vegetation change from this long-term monitoring, to discuss other potential contributing factors and to use the results to predict likely future vegetation changes after eradication of vertebrate pests.",,"Whinam, J (corresponding author), Tasmanian Dept Primary Ind Pk Water & Environm, Biodivers Conservat Branch, GPO Box 44, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Jennie.Whinam@dpipwe.tas.gov.au; Tasbotanic@gmail.com; Micah.Visoiu@dpipwe.tas.gov.au; copson1@bigpond.com,,"Fitzgerald, Nicholas/0000-0002-1281-6897",,,,42,12,13,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-7001,1442-8903,,ECOL MANAG RESTOR,Ecol.

In this respect, an analysis of the modern expansion of barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) is highly interesting. The main objective of this work is to show barnacle goose breeding in new sites far from the sea in relation to feeding base quality. We analyzed the seasonal dynamics of feeding and the structure of the diet of barnacle goose in the nesting and post-nesting periods (27.05-29.07). We used the coprological cuticular method for the analysis. We chose three areas as model plots, i.e. a slope, a lake depression and a willow-sedge bog tundra. Samples from 10 incubating females in every plot we collected once per 10 days. To determine the diet spectrum, we also gathered additional samples in anthropogenic habitats, the river delta, and in coastline and salt marshes. Simultaneously, we made cuts and plant length measurements. In addition, we compared the diet structure between invasive barnacle goose and the aboriginal species Anser albifrons (white-fronted goose) and A. fabalis (Bean Goose). The similarity of the diets was estimated using cluster analysis (UPGMA), (Multivariate Exploratory Technics of Statistica 10 (2011)). As a measure of pairwise distances, we used the Czekanowski index of niche overlap. Altogether, 185 barnacle goose, 84 white-fronted goose and 3 bean goose samples were analyzed, respectively. We also estimated the possibility of interspecific competition and the ecological advantages of these species. The estimation of diet overlaps between barnacle goose and white-fronted goose was made, based 011 24 groups of feeding plants. We estimated the width and variability of the whole diet spectra and their exclusive parts. For barnacle goose and white-fronted goose, we made an analysis of six intrapopulation groups in 4 phases of the reproduction period. In the tundra, barnacle goose use willow (up to 67%), mosses (up to 41%), Ranunculus pallasii (up to 39%), Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Dycotiledonae (up to 63%) even in the habitats dominated by Carex aquatilis. Barnacle goose feed intensively during the nesting period, not being restricted by the spectrum of feeding plants. There is a tendency to combining the nesting and feeding area. They use habitats without salt marsh vegetation throughout the breeding season. High breeding success indicates that incubating females feed adequately in the tundra. The absence of broods and molting bird's migration to salt marshes shows that the feeding base does not affect the goslings' growth. The overlap of the diets is great, but all feeding resources (except salt marshes) are still unlimited. Competition with the other goose species during the brood rearing period and molting is possible. If the barnacle goose population continues to grow, we expect a decline in the numbers of the aboriginal goose species on Kolguev Island.","[Rozenfeld, S.

Hence, understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of DF vectors, Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) and Ae. (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), is paramount. In the Philippines, resources are limited and entomological surveillance and control are generally commenced during epidemics, when transmission is difficult to control. Recent improvements in spatial epidemiological tools and methods offer opportunities to explore more efficient DF surveillance and control solutions: however, there are few examples in the literature from resource-poor settings. The objectives of this study were to: (i) explore spatial patterns of Aedes populations and (ii) predict areas of high and low vector density to inform DF control in San Jose village, Muntinlupa city, Philippines. Fortnightly, adult female Aedes mosquitoes were collected from 50 double-sticky ovitraps (SOs) located in San Jose village for the period June-November 2011. Spatial clustering analysis was performed to identify high and low density clusters of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed by examination of semivariograms, and ordinary kriging was undertaken to create a smoothed surface of predicted vector density in the study area. Our results show that both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were present in San Jose village during the study period. However, one Aedes species was dominant in a given geographic area at a time, suggesting differing habitat preferences and interspecies competition between vectors. Density maps provide information to direct entomological control activities and advocate the development of geographically enhanced surveillance and control systems to improve DF management in the Philippines.","[Duncombe, Jennifer; Hu, Wenbiao; Clements, Archie C.

Several interspecific studies have demonstrated how these features correlate, and it has been hypothesized that selection may drive changes in these sperm traits. Here, we examine the association between sperm design and swimming velocity in a study conducted at an intraspecific level in Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus). We addressed how the structure of different sperm subpopulations, based on sperm morphometry and velocity, are interrelated and, in turn, how they associate with fertility. Our results show that males with high fertility rates have ejaculates with high percentages of spermatozoa exhibiting fast and linear movements and that these are highly correlated with a large proportion of spermatozoa having small and elongated heads. On the other hand, males with low fertility are characterized by a subpopulation structure in which slow and nonlinear as well as small and wide spermatozoa are predominant. These findings provide insight regarding how sperm size and velocity are interrelated and how they both are associated with fertility.","[Ramon, Manuel] Junta Comunidades Castilla La Mancha, CERSYRA, Valdepenas, Spain; [Ramon, Manuel; Josefa Soler, Ana; Garcia-Alvarez, Olga; Maroto-Morales, Alejandro; Julian Garde, Jose] SaBio CSIC UCLM JCCM, Albacete, Spain; [Antonio Ortiz, Jose] Medianilla SL Finca Las Lomas, Cadiz, Spain; [Roldan, Eduardo R.

Thus, dispersion of trait values, or functional diversity (FD) of a community can offer insights into processes driving community assembly. For example, underdispersion of FD suggests that habitat filtering of species with unfavorable trait values restricts the species that can exist in a particular habitat, while even spacing of FD suggests that interspecific competition, or biotic sorting, discourages the coexistence of species with similar trait values. Since assembly processes are expected to vary as a function of spatial scale, we should also expect patterns of FD to reflect scale dependence in filtering and biotic sorting. Here we present the concept of the functional-diversity-area relationship (FAR), which is similar to the species-area relationship but plots a measure of phenotypic trait diversity as a function of spatial scale. We develop a set of null model tests that discriminate between FARs generated predominantly by filtering or biotic sorting and indicate the scales at which these effects are pronounced. The utility of the FAR for addressing long-standing issues in ecology is illustrated with several examples. A multi-scale examination of FD and its pattern relative to null expectations provides an important tool for ecologists interested in understanding the scale dependence of community assembly processes.","[Smith, Adam B.] Missouri Bot Garden, Ctr Conservat & Sustainable Dev, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Sandel, Brody] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Kraft, Nathan J.

Dinosaurs' successors as the dominant terrestrial vertebrate life form, the mammals, give birth to live young, and have much larger offspring and less complex ontogenetic histories. The larger number of juveniles in dinosaur as compared to mammal ecosystems represents both a greater diversity of food available to predators, and competitors for similar-sized individuals of sympatric species. Models of population abundances across different-sized species of dinosaurs and mammals, based on simulated ecological life tables, are employed to investigate how differences in predation and competition pressure influenced dinosaur communities. Higher small-to medium-sized prey availability leads to a normal body mass-species richness (M-S) distribution of carnivorous dinosaurs (as found in the theropod fossil record), in contrast to the right-skewed M-S distribution of carnivorous mammals (as found living members of the order Carnivora). Higher levels of interspecific competition leads to a left-skewed M-S distribution in herbivorous dinosaurs (as found in sauropods and ornithopods), in contrast to the normal M-S distribution of large herbivorous mammals. Thus, our models suggest that differences in reproductive strategy, and consequently ontogeny, explain observed differences in community structure between dinosaur and mammal faunas. Models also show that the largest dinosaurian predators could have subsisted on similar-sized prey by including younger life stages of the largest herbivore species, but that large predators likely avoided prey much smaller than themselves because, despite predicted higher abundances of smaller than larger-bodied prey, contributions of small prey to biomass intake would be insufficient to satisfy meat requirements. A lack of large carnivores feeding on small prey exists in mammals larger than 21.5 kg, and it seems a similar minimum prey-size threshold could have affected dinosaurs as well.","[Codron, Daryl; Clauss, Marcus] Univ Zurich, Vetsuisse Fac, Clin Zoo Anim Exot Pets & Wildlife, Zurich, Switzerland; [Codron, Daryl] Florisbad Quaternary Res, Natl Museum, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Codron, Daryl] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Codron, Daryl] Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Carbone, Chris] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England","Codron, D (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Vetsuisse Fac, Clin Zoo Anim Exot Pets & Wildlife, Zurich, Switzerland.",d.codron@nasmus.co.za,"Clauss, Marcus/A-4710-2008; Clauss, Marcus/M-8702-2019; Codron, Daryl/B-8867-2008","Clauss, Marcus/0000-0003-3841-6207; Clauss, Marcus/0000-0003-3841-6207; Codron, Daryl/0000-0001-5223-9513",,,,85,16,16,0,46,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,OCT 30,2013,8,10,,,,,,,e77110,10.1371/journal.pone.0077110,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243RL,WOS:000326334500017,24204749,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Little is known, however, about the long-term consequences of generally drier conditions and more frequent extreme droughts. A Holm oak forest was exposed to experimental rainfall manipulation for 13years to study the effect of increasing drought on growth and mortality of the dominant species Quercus ilex, Phillyrea latifolia, and Arbutus unedo. The drought treatment reduced stem growth of A. unedo (-66.5%) and Q. ilex (-17.5%), whereas P. latifolia remained unaffected. Higher stem mortality rates were noticeable in Q. ilex (+42.3%), but not in the other two species. Stem growth was a function of the drought index of early spring in the three species. Stem mortality rates depended on the drought index of winter and spring for Q. ilex and in spring and summer for P. latifolia, but showed no relation to climate in A. unedo. Following a long and intense drought (2005-2006), stem growth of Q. ilex and P. latifolia increased, whereas it decreased in A. unedo. Q. ilex also enhanced its survival after this period. Furthermore, the effect of drought treatment on stem growth in Q. ilex and A. unedo was attenuated as the study progressed. These results highlight the different vulnerabilities of Mediterranean species to more frequent and intense droughts, which may lead to partial species substitution and changes in forest structure and thus in carbon uptake. The response to drought, however, changed over time. Decreased intra- and interspecific competition after extreme events with high mortality, together with probable morphological and physiological acclimation to drought during the study period, may, at least in the short term, buffer forests against drier conditions. The long-term effects of drought consequently deserve more attention, because the ecosystemic responses are unlikely to be stable over time.Nontechnical summaryIn this study, we evaluate the effect of long-term (13years) experimental drought on growth and mortality rates of three forest Mediterranean species, and their response to the different intensities and durations of natural drought. We provide evidence for species-specific responses to drought, what may eventually lead to a partial community shift favoring the more drought-resistant species. However, we also report a dampening of the treatment effect on the two drought-sensitive species, which may indicate a potential adaptation to drier conditions at the ecosystem or population level. These results are thus relevant to account for the stabilizing processes that would alter the initial response of ecosystem to drought through changes in plant physiology, morphology, and demography compensation.","[Barbeta, Adria; Ogaya, Roma; Penuelas, Josep] CSIC, Global Ecol Unit CREAF CEAB CSIC UAB, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain; [Barbeta, Adria; Ogaya, Roma; Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain","Barbeta, A (corresponding author), CSIC, Global Ecol Unit CREAF CEAB CSIC UAB, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain.",a.barbeta@creaf.uab.cat,"Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Barbeta, Adria/AAL-1221-2021; Barbeta, Adria/F-9391-2016","Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Barbeta, Adria/0000-0002-8357-1719; Barbeta, Adria/0000-0002-8357-1719",Spanish GovernmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2010-17172]; Consolider Ingenio Montes [CSD2008-00040]; Catalan Government [SGR 2009-458]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,This research was supported by the Spanish Government projects CGL2010-17172 and Consolider Ingenio Montes (CSD2008-00040) and by the Catalan Government project SGR 2009-458.

Although their general life histories are relatively similar, different species vary markedly in the physiological condition of the hosts they select. Most of,6000 known species colonise dead or stressed trees, a resource they share with a large diversity of insects and other organisms. A small number of bark beetle species kill healthy, live trees. These few are of particular interest as they compete directly with humans for resources. We propose that tree killing evolved when intense interspecific competition in the ephemeral, scarce resource of defence-impaired trees selected for genotypes that allowed them to escape this limitation by attacking relatively healthy trees. These transitions were uncommon, and we suggest they were facilitated by (a) genetically and phenotypically flexible host selection behaviours, (b) biochemical adaptations for detoxifying a wide range of defence compounds, and (c) associations with symbionts, which together aided bark beetles in overcoming formidable constitutive and induced host defences. The ability to detoxify terpenes influenced the evolutionary course of pheromonal communication. Specifically, a mate attraction system, which was exploited by intraspecific competitors in locating poorly defended hosts, became a system of cooperative attack in which emitters benefit from the contributions responders make in overcoming defence. This functional shift in communication was driven in part by linkage of beetle semiochemistry to host defence chemistry. Behavioural and phenological adaptations also improved the beetles' abilities to detect when tree defences are impaired, and, where compatible with life history adaptations to other selective forces, for flight to coincide with seasonally predictable host stress agents. We propose a conceptual model, whereby the above mechanisms enable beetles to concentrate on those trees that offer an optimal trade-off between host defence and interspecific competition, along dynamic gradients of tree vigour and stand-level beetle density. We offer suggestions for future research on testing elements of this model.","[Lindgren, B.

In Fusarium, fumonisin biosynthetic genes (FUM) are clustered, and the cluster is uniform in gene organization. Here, sequence analyses indicated that the cluster exists in five different genomic contexts, defining five cluster types. In FUM gene genealogies, evolutionary relationships between fusaria with different cluster types were largely incongruent with species relationships inferred from primary-metabolism (PM) gene genealogies, and FUM cluster types are not trans-specific. In addition, synonymous site divergence analyses indicated that three FUM cluster types predate diversification of FFSC. The data are not consistent with balancing selection or interspecific hybridization, but they are consistent with two competing hypotheses: (i) multiple horizontal transfers of the cluster from unknown donors to FFSC recipients and (ii) cluster duplication and loss (birth and death). Furthermore, low levels of FUM gene divergence in F.bulbicola, an FFSC species, and F.oxysporum provide evidence for horizontal transfer of the cluster from the former, or a closely related species, to the latter. Thus, uniform gene organization within the FUM cluster belies a complex evolutionary history that has not always paralleled the evolution of Fusarium.","[Proctor, Robert H.; Busman, Mark; Ward, Todd J.] ARS, USDA, Natl Ctr Agr Utilizat Res, Peoria, IL USA; [Van Hove, Francois] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, BCCMTM MUCL, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Susca, Antonia; Stea, Gaetano; Moretti, Antonio] CNR, Inst Sci Food Prod, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [van der Lee, Theo; Waalwijk, Cees] Plant Res Int BV, Wageningen, Netherlands","Proctor, RH (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, Natl Ctr Agr Utilizat Res, Peoria, IL USA.",robert.proctor@ars.usda.gov,"Waalwijk, Cees/X-9439-2019; vanderlee, Theo A.J./J-7296-2013; Susca, Antonia/I-6869-2013","Waalwijk, Cees/0000-0001-5367-2108; Susca, Antonia/0000-0003-0021-8774; Moretti, Antonio/0000-0002-5232-6972; Busman, Mark/0000-0001-9750-064X","Belgian Federal Science Policy OfficeBelgian Federal Science Policy OfficeEuropean Commission [BCCM C2/10/007, C3/10/003]","We thank Celine Bivort, Stephanie Folmar, Stephanie Huret, Marcie Moore, Nathane Orwig and Crystal Probyn for their excellent technical support.

In forestry, it is an important silvicultural concept for maintaining stand health in the face of climate change and biotic stress, but uncertainty exists because traditional self-thinning limits were set subjectively without regard to site quality. We addressed this by analyzing ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) data from 109 research plots measured repeatedly and 59 inventory plots measured once across California. Self-thinning boundaries were fitted to the data with quantile regression and stochastic frontier function (SFF) techniques with and without site index (SI) as a covariate. The models from both methods fitted the data well with either research plots or all plots. Slopes for size-density trajectories were -0.45 with the 0.99 quantile and -0.47 for SFF. Maximum stand density indices (SDI) were 1250 trees per hectare (TPH) with the 0.99 quantile and 1050-1060 TPH with SFF. Mortality occurred when site occupancy from SFF reached 0.75, suggesting a zone of imminent mortality. Curvilinear trends in maximum SDI across SI for both methods indicate that self-thinning varies with site quality. Any management regimes that increase site quality and productivity will increase the self-thinning boundary.","[Zhang, Jianwei; Oliver, William W.; Powers, Robert F.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Redding, CA 96002 USA","Zhang, JW (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, 3644 Avtech Pkwy, Redding, CA 96002 USA.",jianweizhang@fs.fed.us,,,Sierra Cascade Intensive Forest Management Research Cooperative,"We thank all who designed, installed, maintained, and measured these plots during the last 50 years.

In theory, multispecies assemblages can persist if species use shared resources at different times, thereby minimizing interspecific competition. However, there is scant empirical evidence supporting these predictions and, to the best of our knowledge, seasonal variation has never been explored in the context of fluctuation-mediated coexistence. Results: Using an exceptionally well-documented estuarine fish assemblage, sampled monthly for over 30 years, we show that temporal shifts in species abundances underpin species coexistence. Species fall into distinct seasonal groups, within which spatial resource use is more heterogeneous than would be expected by chance at those times when competition for food is most intense. We also detect seasonal variation in the richness and evenness of the community, again linked to shifts in resource availability. Conclusions: These results reveal that spatiotemporal shifts in community composition minimize competitive interactions and help stabilize total abundance.","[Shimadzu, Hideyasu; Dornelas, Maria; Magurran, Anne E.] Univ St Andrews, Ctr Biol Divers, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland; [Shimadzu, Hideyasu; Dornelas, Maria; Magurran, Anne E.] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland; [Shimadzu, Hideyasu] Keio Univ, Dept Math, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan; [Dornelas, Maria] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Dept Biol, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal; [Henderson, Peter A.] Pisces Conservat, Lymington SO41 8GN, Hants, England","Dornelas, M (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Ctr Biol Divers, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland.",maadd@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Shimadzu, Hideyasu/E-5649-2010; Henderson, Peter Alan/Q-5145-2019; Dornelas, Maria/E-3595-2010","Shimadzu, Hideyasu/0000-0003-0919-8829; Henderson, Peter Alan/0000-0002-7461-1758; Dornelas, Maria/0000-0003-2077-7055; Magurran, Anne/0000-0002-0036-2795",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [BioTIME 250189]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission; Marine Alliance for Science and Technology Scotland (MASTS),"We acknowledge support from the European Research Council (project BioTIME 250189) and the Royal Society.

Bat flies are obligate and generally hostspecific blood-feeding parasites of bats. Old-World flies in the family Nycteribiidae are entirely wingless and depend on their hosts for long-distance dispersal; their population genetics has been unstudied to date. Methods: We collected a total of 125 bat flies from three Pteropus species (Pteropus vampyrus, P. hypomelanus, and P. lylei) from eight localities in Malaysia, Cambodia, and Vietnam. We identified specimens morphologically and then sequenced three mitochondrial DNA gene fragments (CoI, CoII, cytB; 1744 basepairs total) from a subset of 45 bat flies. We measured genetic diversity, molecular variance, and population genetic subdivision (F-ST), and used phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses to quantify parasite genetic structure across host species and localities. Results: All flies were identified as Cyclopodia horsfieldi with the exception of two individuals of Eucampsipoda sundaica. Low levels of population genetic structure were detected between populations of Cyclopodia horsfieldi from across a wide geographic range (similar to 1000 km), and tests for isolation by distance were rejected. AMOVA results support a lack of geographic and host-specific population structure, with molecular variance primarily partitioned within populations. Pairwise FST values from flies collected from island populations of Pteropus hypomelanus in East and West Peninsular Malaysia supported predictions based on previous studies of host genetic structure. Conclusions: The lack of population genetic structure and morphological variation observed in Cyclopodia horsfieldi is most likely due to frequent contact between flying fox species and subsequent high levels of parasite gene flow. Specifically, we suggest that Pteropus vampyrus may facilitate movement of bat flies between the three Pteropus species in the region. We demonstrate the utility of parasite genetics as an additional layer of information to measure host movement and interspecific host contact. These approaches may have wide implications for understanding zoonotic, epizootic, and enzootic disease dynamics. Bat flies may play a role as vectors of disease in bats, and their competence as vectors of bacterial and/or viral pathogens is in need of further investigation.","[Olival, Kevin J.; Daszak, Peter] EcoHlth Alliance, New York, NY 10001 USA; [Olival, Kevin J.; Perkins, Susan L.; DeSalle, Rob] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Sackler Inst Comparat Genom, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Olival, Kevin J.; Melnick, Don J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dick, Carl W.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Dick, Carl W.; Dittmar, Katharina] Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Zool, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Simmons, Nancy B.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Mammal, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Morales, Juan Carlos] Global Footprint Network, Oakland, CA 94607 USA; [Dittmar, Katharina] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","Olival, KJ (corresponding author), EcoHlth Alliance, New York, NY 10001 USA.",olival@ecohealthalliance.org,"daszak, peter/U-4588-2017; Perkins, Susan/D-3408-2018","daszak, peter/0000-0002-2046-5695; Perkins, Susan/0000-0002-5400-5662; Olival, Kevin/0000-0003-3211-1875; Simmons, Nancy B./0000-0001-8807-7499","Taxonomic Mammalogy fund at the American Museum of Natural History; EPA STAR FellowshipUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [FP-91638101-0]; Bat Conservation International; Lubee Bat Conservancy; Columbia University's Center for Environmental Research and Conservation; Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology; National Institutes of Health/National Science Foundation 'Ecology of infectious diseases award' [R01-TW05869]; NIAID non-biodefense EID Research Opportunities Award [1 R01 AI079231-01]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01TW005869] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI079231] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank J.H.

The populations of an aquatic invertebrate (Culex pipiens) exposed over several generations to repeated pulses of low concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide (thiadoprid) continuously declined and did not recover in the presence of a less sensitive competing species (Daphnia magna). By contrast, in the absence of a competitor, insecticide effects on the more sensitive species were only observed at concentrations 1 order of magnitude higher, and the species recovered more rapidly after a contamination event. The underlying processes are experimentally identified and reconstructed using a simulation model.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (C-a) has a direct and measurable effect on plant growth. However, it does not affect all plant species equally, which could lead to shifts in competitive dominance of species in ecosystems. 2. We used a dynamic plant carbon-nitrogen model to systematically examine how species traits affect the long-term C-a responsiveness of C-3 plants when growing as established mono-cultures in the field. The model was tested against responses of 7 C-3 herbaceous species growing in a free-air C-a enrichment (FACE) experiment (BioCON) in Minnesota, USA. 3. Model simulations showed that several species traits affected the C-a response strongly, giving rise to a number of testable hypotheses about interspecific differences in responsiveness to C-a. The largest responses to rising C-a were obtained for species with low carbon-use efficiency (net primary production: gross primary production ratio), low foliar carbon allocation, low stomatal conductance, low instantaneous photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and low specific leaf area. 4. In general, our model predicted that, for established plants growing in resource-limited field conditions, species with slow growth rates would be most responsive to elevated C-a. This prediction was supported by data from the BioCON experiment. 5. Our model also predicts that, for young plants growing in non-resource-limited conditions, species with high growth rates will be most responsive to elevated C-a. This difference in species ranking under different resource availabilities is largely explained by the indirect effects of C-a on leaf area. Leaf-area feedbacks favour fast-growing species the most during leaf-area expansion, but following stand maturation they favour slow-growing species the most. 6. These results imply that species that respond strongly to elevated C-a in short-term (nonresource-limited) glasshouse experiments are unlikely to also be the most responsive in resource-limited field conditions, and therefore that we cannot directly extrapolate from glasshouse experiments to predict which species will be most responsive to elevated C-a in the long term.","[Ali, Ashehad A.; Medlyn, Belinda E.] Macquarie Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Sci Biol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Crous, Kristine Y.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Crous, Kristine Y.; Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA","Medlyn, BE (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Sci Biol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",belinda.medlyn@mq.edu.au,"Medlyn, Belinda/O-5038-2019","Medlyn, Belinda/0000-0001-5728-9827; Crous, Kristine/0000-0001-9478-7593; Ali, Ashehad/0000-0002-7328-306X; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X","Macquarie University; U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DOE/DE-FG02-96ER62291, DE-FC02-06ER64158]; National Science Foundation (NSF Biocomplexity)National Science Foundation (NSF) [0322057]; National Science Foundation (NSF LTER DEB) [9411972, 0080382, 0620652]; National Science Foundation (NSF LTREB)National Science Foundation (NSF) [0716587]; University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1234162] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1242531] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","AA was supported by a Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship.

Mytilid collectors were installed at Caleta Punta Arenas and Caleta Errazuriz (250km further south) in November and then extracted in consecutive time periods. The results showed settlements of A. ater along with Choromytilus chorus (Molina) and Semimytilus algosus (Gould). An analysis of the spat size structure from each period revealed different micro-cohorts for each species; the micro-cohorts of C. chorus were predominant. Daily growth rates were estimated using the average sizes of the micro-cohorts on two consecutive dates. Although the daily growth rates did not vary significantly between sites for a given species, these rates were lowest for A. ater and highest for S. algosus. The abundance and greater growth of C. chorus caused interspecific competition with A. ater that was detrimental to the survival of the latter. We hypothesize the existence of a metapopulation of A. ater in northern Chile that would explain the settlement of four micro-cohorts on collectors after 28days at Caleta Punta Arenas, and the settlement recorded after 80days at Caleta Errazuriz.","[Avendano, Miguel; Cantillanez, Marcela] Univ Antofagasta, Lab Cult & Manejo Moluscos, Dpto Acuicultura, Antofagasta, Chile","Avendano, M (corresponding author), Univ Antofagasta, Lab Cult & Manejo Moluscos, Dpto Acuicultura, Av Univ Chile S-N,Casilla 170, Antofagasta, Chile.",mavendano@uantof.cl,,,project INNOVA [07CT91DM-56],This study was carried out within the framework of the project INNOVA 07CT91DM-56.,,55,7,7,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1355-557X,1365-2109,,AQUAC RES,Aquac.

Currently, planted forests in Brazil total about 6.9 million ha, from which 4.9 million ha is planted with eucalypt (around 25% of world plantation), 1.6 million ha with pine, and 0.42 M ha with other species. Roundwood consumption of forest plantations totaled 170.1 million m(3) in 2011, eucalypt plantation accounted for 80.6% of this total. Most eucalypt plantations are managed in short rotations (6-8 years) and are established in regions with water, nutritional and frost stresses of low to high degrees. The mean annual increment is 40 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) roundwood, ranging from 25 to 60 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) depending on the level of environmental stress. Improving natural resources use efficiency by breeding and matching genotypes to sites and using appropriate site management practices is a key challenge to sustain or increase productivity. The wide range of eucalypt species and hybrids with different climatic and edaphic suitability associated with the easy propagation by seeds and cloning allow the adaptation of plantations to various tropical and subtropical regions in Brazil. The possibility of using eucalypt wood in a range of purposes has led large and small enterprises to establish eucalypt forests for multiple uses. The desirable characteristics in association with the accumulated knowledge on eucalypt silviculture encourage the use of this genus in most plantations. The most important factors in the selective process for a genotype are wood characteristics, productivity level, susceptibility to pests and diseases, drought tolerance, especially in tropical regions (frost free), and frost tolerance in subtropical regions (mostly without water deficit). In regions with pronounced seasonality and moderate to long drought periods, the planting of hybrid genotypes predominates, propagated by cloning. Under subtropical conditions, the planting of single species predominates, propagated by seed. Clonal plantations with interspecific hybrids have been fundamental for eucalypt adaptation in regions under water and nutritional stresses. Given the rapid advances in eucalypt breeding, regarding adaptation to water stress and resistance to diseases and pests, and the adoption of clonal propagation techniques, genotypes are rapidly becoming obsolete and are replaced by more productive ones after harvesting. Thus, the replanting of crops has become a common procedure after the second half of the 1990s in Brazil. This paper describes the basic requirements for integrating genetic and silvicultural strategies to minimize abiotic and biotic constraints in eucalypt plantations. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

At the most oxygenated slope sites (827 and 972 m), all of Wieser's nematode feeding groups were represented. In contrast, at the lowest-oxygen site, only selective deposit (bacterial) feeders (1A) were present, indicating a reduction in trophic complexity. A large percentage of nematodes inhabited subsurface sediment layers ( > 1 cm). At deeper, more oxygenated sites (827 and 972 m), nematode individual biomass increased downcore, while within the OMZ, nematode biomass was low and remained relatively uniform through the sediment column. The concentration of nematodes in deeper sediment layers, the vertical distribution of the feeding groups, as well as the high nutritional quality of the deeper layers, suggest a differential resource partitioning of the food available, which may reduce interspecific competition.

Mast seeding is an important resource pulse in deciduous forests; these boom and bust cycles of seed production generate strong lagged population responses by post-dispersal seed predators such as rodents, which then cascade through multiple trophic levels and regulate population dynamics of their predators and prey. However, similar interactions in another major pulsed system, coniferous forests, are inconsistent, and the effects of interannual variation in conifer seed production on many consumer populations are largely unknown. We used large-scale manipulation and intensive monitoring to examine the population dynamics of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in relation to fall seed production by two northern conifers, white spruce (Picea glauca) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Previous studies have shown that spruce seeds are a preferred food source of mice, while fir seeds are generally avoided if other foods are available. Therefore, we expected that there would be a positive relationship between mouse demography and previous spruce seed production, but no effect of fir mast seeding. Supplementation of a mouse population using spruce seeds indicated that increased fall spruce seed availability can enhance overwinter survival and population densities in the following spring, summer, and fall. However, long-term population monitoring indicated that mouse demography was not positively affected by spruce mast seeding, likely due to strong interspecific competition with the North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudoniscus), a dominant pre-dispersal spruce seed predator. Conversely, we observed an unexpected delayed effect of fir mast seeding, where increased fall fir seed production did not influence overwinter or spring mouse demography, but instead enhanced summer survival, body masses and pregnancy rates of overwintered adults. This led to increased summer population densities and may have been mediated by population responses of invertebrate post-dispersal seed predators to increased fir seed availability. Our results indicate that rodent responses to resource pulses in coniferous forests are more complex than in deciduous environments and reveal previously unobserved direct and indirect consumer-resource dynamics that require further examination. This system is ideal for the large-scale, integrative ecosystem studies that ecologists are encouraged to pursue.","[Lobo, Nikhil; Millar, John S.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Lobo, N (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",nlobo3@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We are grateful to the BC Ministry of Forests and Range Tree Seed Centre for donating the white spruce seeds used in this study, the graduate students and research assistants who helped collect data in the field, and L.

To further explore the role of CDI in competition, we determined the target cell range of the CDIEC93 system from Escherichia coli EC93. The CdiA(EC93) effector protein recognizes the widely conserved BamA protein as a receptor, yet E. coli EC93 does not inhibit other enterobacterial species. The predicted membrane topology of BamA indicates that three of its extracellular loops vary considerably between species, suggesting that loop heterogeneity may control CDI specificity. Consistent with this hypothesis, other enterobacteria are sensitized to CDIEC93 upon the expression of E. coli bamA and E. coli cells become CDIEC93 resistant when bamA is replaced with alleles from other species. Our data indicate that BamA loops 6 and 7 form the CdiA(EC93)-binding epitope and their variation between species restricts CDIEC93 target cell selection. Although BamA loops 6 and 7 vary dramatically between species, these regions are identical in hundreds of E. coli strains, suggesting that BamA(Ecoli) and CdiA(EC93) play a role in self-nonself discrimination. IMPORTANCE Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria, enabling them to bind to neighboring bacterial cells and deliver protein toxins that inhibit cell growth. In this study, we tested the role of CDI in interspecies competition using intestinal isolate Escherichia coli EC93 as an inhibitor cell model. Although E. coli EC93 inhibits different E. coli strains, other bacterial species from the intestine are completely resistant to CDI. We show that resistance is due to small variations in the CDI receptor that prevent other species from being recognized as target cells. CDI receptor interactions thus provide a mechanism by which bacteria can distinguish siblings and other close relatives (self) from more distant relatives or other species of bacteria (nonself). Our results provide a possible means by which antimicrobials could be directed to one or only a few related bacterial pathogens by using a specific receptor zip code.","[Ruhe, Zachary C.; Wallace, Adam B.; Low, David A.; Hayes, Christopher S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Low, David A.; Hayes, Christopher S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Biomol Sci & Engn Program, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Hayes, CS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",chayes@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,,Tri-Counties Blood Bank Post-doctoral Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0642052]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM078634]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM078634] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Z.C.R. was supported in part by the Tri-Counties Blood Bank Post-doctoral Fellowship.

Interspecific resource competition and disease spread by the invasive gray squirrel Sciurus carolinensis are the main factors behind the decline. Gray squirrels have adapted to the British landscape so efficiently that they are widely distributed. Knowledge on how gray squirrels are using the landscape matrix and being able to predict their movements will aid management. This study is the first to use global positioning system (GPS) collars on wild gray squirrels to accurately record movements and land cover use within the landscape matrix. This data were used to validate Geographical Information System (GIS) least-cost model predictions of movements and provided much needed information on gray squirrel movement pathways and network use. Buffered least-cost paths and least-cost corridors provide predictions of the most probable movements through the landscape and are seen to perform better than the more expansive least-cost networks which include all possible movements. Applying the knowledge and methodologies gained to current gray squirrel expansion areas, such as Scotland and in Italy, will aid in the prediction of potential movement areas and therefore management of the invasive gray squirrel. The methodologies presented in this study could potentially be used in any landscape and on numerous species.","[Stevenson, Claire D.; Ramsey, Andrew D.] Univ Cumbria, Penrith CA11 0AH, Cumbria, England; [Ferryman, Mark; Watts, Kevin] Forest Res, Farnham, Surrey, England; [Nevin, Owen T.] Cent Queensland Univ, Gladstone, Qld, Australia; [Bailey, Sallie] Forestry Commiss GB, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Stevenson, CD (corresponding author), Univ Cumbria, Penrith CA11 0AH, Cumbria, England.",claire.stevenson@cumbria.ac.uk,"Nevin, Owen/AAW-5220-2020; Nevin, Owen/D-8363-2014","Nevin, Owen/0000-0003-3513-8053; Nevin, Owen/0000-0003-3513-8053; Ramsey, Andrew/0000-0002-6232-5869",Forestry Commission GB; University of Cumbria,This project was funded by the Forestry Commission GB and the University of Cumbria.,,55,20,22,0,116,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Resource quality, however, is rarely manipulated, as this requires a priori knowledge of a relationship between some measurable variation in the resource and individual preference and/or fitness. Recent research on nest-site selection was used to inform the design of custom-built nest-boxes for an endangered hollow-nester, the Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae). By provisioning breeding populations with these high quality' artificial nest sites over 3years, we experimentally investigated the strength and effects of nest-site limitation in this species. Breeding pairs using nest-boxes initiated nesting earlier, produced larger clutches and fledged more offspring per season than those in natural hollows. Total and mean reproductive output also increased in nest-box provisioned sites over the duration of the study. All of these effects were predominantly driven by pairs initiating clutches earlier, potentially because of the reduced intra- and interspecific competition for nest sites at optimal breeding times. Our findings suggest that reproduction in wild Gouldian finch populations may be limited by the availability of high quality nest sites in the landscape, and that nest-boxes could be used as a tool for enhancing reproduction in recovering populations. Furthermore, we conclude that resource quality is equally, if not more important than quantity when supplementing resource-limited habitats.","[Brazill-Boast, James; Pryke, Sarah R.; Griffith, Simon C.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Brazill-Boast, J (corresponding author), NSW Off Environm & Heritage, Landscapes & Ecosyst Conservat Branch, Conservat Strategy Unit, POB A290, Sydney South, NSW 1232, Australia.",james.brazillboast@environment.nsw.gov.au,"Pryke, Sarah/G-7484-2011; Griffith, Simon/AAH-3706-2021; Brazill-Boast, James/R-6195-2019; Griffith, Simon/A-1996-2010","Griffith, Simon/0000-0001-7612-4999; Griffith, Simon/0000-0001-7612-4999",Save the Gouldian Fund; Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council; Macquarie University,"We thank Liam Brunner, Josephine Dessmann, Christophe Dufresnes, Rowena Hamer, Jan Lewis, Dhanya Pearce, Majolein Schoe, Nina Svedin and Hanneke Wiggers for all their help with data collection in the field, Save the Gouldian Fund for providing valuable equipment and support to the project, and the Shire Council and residents of Wyndham for their help and hospitality.

Grasses (Poaceae) occupy among the warmest and coldest environments on earth but the role of cold tolerance evolution in generating this distribution is understudied. We studied cold tolerance of Danthonioideae (c. 280 species), a major constituent of the austral temperate grass flora. We determined differences in cold tolerance among species from different continents grown in a common winter garden and assessed the relationship between measured cold tolerance and that predicted by species ranges. We then used temperatures in current ranges and a phylogeny of 81% of the species to study the timing and mode of cold tolerance evolution across the subfamily. Species ranges generally underestimate cold tolerance but are still a meaningful representation of differences in cold tolerance among species. We infer cold tolerance evolution to have commenced at the onset of danthonioid diversification, subsequently increasing in both pace and extent in certain lineages. Interspecific variation in cold tolerance is better accounted for by spatial than phylogenetic distance. Contrary to expectations, temperature low temperature in particular appears not to limit the distribution of this temperate clade. Competition, time or dispersal limitation could explain its relative absence from northern temperate regions.","[Humphreys, Aelys M.; Linder, H.

This poses a challenge to monitoring, and researchers have been struggling to develop accurate sampling methods for obtaining a better understanding of fish communities. We compare fish community composition, richness, and diversity in 56 Danish lakes using data obtained by gillnetting in different lake zones and near-shore electrofishing, respectively. On average, electrofishing captured more species than offshore gillnets, but not more than littoral gillnets. Overall, the different fish sampling methods showed consistency as to fish community structure, but noticeable differences in community-environment relationships. Lake area was the best predictor for fish species richness in the littoral samplings, while it was poor for offshore samplings. Electrofishing was more efficient than gillnets at catching pike (Esox lucius), eel (Anguilla anguilla), and tench (Tinca tinca), whereas pelagic gillnets were better for catching pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) and perch (Perca fluviatilis). Independently of methods, the total number per unit of effort and weight per unit of effort were generally positively related to summer chlorophyll a, and, for offshore nets, negatively related to average depth. Our results show that sampling restricted to specific habitats within the lakes does not provide a representative of the whole-lake fish community, as all methods miss some important species that other methods capture. However, electrofishing seems to be a fast alternative to gillnets for monitoring fish species richness and composition in littoral habitats of Danish lakes.","[Menezes, Rosemberg Fernandes; Sondergaard, Martin; Lauridsen, Torben L.; Landkildehus, Frank; Jeppesen, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Menezes, Rosemberg Fernandes; Borchsenius, Finn; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Lauridsen, Torben L.; Jeppesen, Erik] Sinodanish Ctr Educ & Res SDC, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Greenland Inst Nat Resources, Greenland Climate Res Ctr, Nuuk, Greenland","Menezes, RF (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25,POB 314, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.",rosembergmenezes@gmail.com,"Lauridsen, Torben L/K-9417-2013; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Svenning, Jens-Christian/Y-3318-2019; Menezes, Rosemberg Fernandes/V-1695-2017; Sondergaard, Martin/J-2478-2013; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019","Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Menezes, Rosemberg Fernandes/0000-0001-9949-8221; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395",WISER (Water bodies in Europe: Integrative Systems to assess Ecological status and Recovery); European Union under the 7th Framework Program; Theme 6 (Environment including Climate Change) [226273]; EUEuropean Commission; CRES; CLEAR,"The authors would like to thank Anne Mette Poulsen for manuscript assistance and three anonymous reviewers for providing valuable comments and suggestions to improve our manuscript.

We assessed the suitability of N. viridula eggs for the development of O. telenomicida as a function of egg age when they were unparasitized, or had been attacked by T. basalis at different times prior to exposure to O. telenomicida females. Ooencyrtus telenomicida can exploit healthy N. viridula host eggs up to 5 days of age, just prior to the emergence of N. viridula.

Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversitystability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversitystability debate to a final resolution.","[Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, F-09200 Moulis, France","Loreau, M (corresponding author), CNRS, Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, F-09200 Moulis, France.",michel.loreau@ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr,,,TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41],"We thank Andy Hector, Mark Emmerson and two anonymous referees for providing helpful comments on the manuscript.

It remains unclear, however, if the predictions of 'universal' scaling models for vascular plants hold across diverse species in variable environments. Phenomena such as competition and disturbance may drive allometric scaling relationships away from theoretical predictions based on an optimized tree. Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to calculate tree-specific, species-specific, and 'global' (i.e. interspecific) scaling exponents for several allometric relationships using tree- and branch-level data harvested from three savanna sites across a rainfall gradient in Mali, West Africa. We use these exponents to provide a rigorous test of three plant scaling models (Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST), Geometric Similarity, and Stress Similarity) in savanna systems. For the allometric relationships we evaluated (diameter vs. length, aboveground mass, stem mass, and leaf mass) the empirically calculated exponents broadly overlapped among species from diverse environments, except for the scaling exponents for length, which increased with tree cover and density. When we compare empirical scaling exponents to the theoretical predictions from the three models we find MST predictions are most consistent with our observed allometries. In those situations where observations are inconsistent with MST we find that departure from theory corresponds with expected tradeoffs related to disturbance and competitive interactions. We hypothesize savanna trees have greater length-scaling exponents than predicted by MST due to an evolutionary tradeoff between fire escape and optimization of mechanical stability and internal resource transport. Future research on the drivers of systematic allometric variation could reconcile the differences between observed scaling relationships in variable ecosystems and those predicted by ideal models such as MST.","[Tredennick, Andrew T.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Tredennick, Andrew T.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Bentley, Lisa Patrick] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Hanan, Niall P.] S Dakota State Univ, Geog Informat Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Tredennick, AT (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Andrew.Tredennick@colostate.edu,,"Tredennick, Andrew/0000-0003-1254-3339; Hanan, Niall/0000-0002-9130-5306",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1139096]; NASA Headquarters under the Earth and Space Science Fellowship ProgramNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX11AL43H]; NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Bioinformatics [DBI-0905868]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1139096] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"A National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov/) award (DEB-1139096) to NPH provided funding for this work.

The species was first observed in North America near Delaware Bay (39 degrees N, 75 degrees W) in 1988, and a variety of evidence suggests initial introduction via ballast water early in that decade. The crab spread rapidly after its discovery, and breeding populations currently extend from North Carolina to Maine (35 degrees-45 degrees N). H. sanguineus is now the dominant crab in rocky intertidal habitat along much of the northeast coast of the USA and has displaced resident crab species throughout this region. The Asian shore crab also occurs on the Atlantic coast of Europe and was first reported from Le Havre, France (49 degrees N, 0 degrees E) in 1999. Invasive populations now extend along 1000 km of coastline from the Cotentin Peninsula in France to Lower Saxony in Germany (48-53 degrees N). Success of the Asian shore crab in alien habitats has been ascribed to factors such as high fecundity, superior competition for space and food, release from parasitism, and direct predation on co-occurring crab species. Laboratory and field observations indicate that H. sanguineus is a generalist predator with potential for substantial effects on sympatric populations of mollusks and crustaceans. However, broad ecosystem effects and actual economic impact are unclear. The literature on H. sanguineus is limited in comparison to better known invasive species like the European green crab (Carcinus maenas) and the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Nevertheless, there are substantial bodies of work on larval biology, trophic ecology, and interspecies competition. This paper presents a review of the biology and ecology of invasive populations of the Asian shore crab H. sanguineus in North American and European habitats. (c), 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Based on an ethnographic study, this paper explores the interactive properties of the relationships between herding dogs and their trainer-users, and how the dogs' behaviors participate in the construction of trainer-users' knowledge. Trainer-users' discourses and practices revealed a common theoretical axis, portraying the herding dog as a social predator descended from the wolf and driving the game towards his pack-leader. The dog's hunting skills are used to turn him/her into a working tool, through minimally constrained education and training. Once trained, the dog should become an autonomous but controllable worker, who helps livestock breeders lead their flock quietly. Two training modes were identified and used simultaneously by the trainers: contextual training (teaching the human-dog-livestock relationship to the dog) and conditioned training (teaching the commands to the dog). Trainer-users all recognized the individual personalities of the dogs and were sensitive to the quality of their relationships with them. They expected the dogs to be more competent than humans in understanding livestock behaviors, thus suggesting that the dog is more a work assistant than a work tool. Indeed, the dog helps the livestock breeder to establish an optimal interrelational distance between the species by managing space, time, and affectivity in the human-dog-livestock relationship. This triangular relationship, defined by the trainers as a leader-predator-prey relation, resembles a misunderstanding maintained by the livestock breeders in order to reach the leader position. Finally, the livestock-handling context appears particularly fruitful for revealing the complexity of interspecific relationships, the evolution of work in the livestock breeding context, and for understanding the human's connection to their social environment, including non-human living beings.","[Savalois, Nathalie] EHESS, Ctr Norbert Elias, Marseille, France; [Lescureux, Nicolas] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Trondheim, Norway; [Lescureux, Nicolas] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ecoanthropol & Ethnobiol USM0104, F-75231 Paris, France; [Brunois, Florence] Coll France, EHESS, Lab Anthropol Sociale, F-75231 Paris, France","Savalois, N (corresponding author), Maison Iraila,Route Etxexuria, F-64990 Lahonce, France.",natali.savalois@gmail.com,"Lescureux, Nicolas/E-3712-2010","Lescureux, Nicolas/0000-0002-0617-3311",,,,70,8,8,0,113,BERG PUBL,LONDON,"BLOOMSBURY PLC, 50 BEDFORD SQ, LONDON, WC1B 3DP, ENGLAND",0892-7936,,,ANTHROZOOS,Anthrozoos,MAR,2013,26,1,,,,,77,91,,10.2752/175303713X13534238631515,,,15,Anthropology; Environmental Studies; Sociology; Veterinary Sciences,Anthropology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Sociology; Veterinary Sciences,099XN,WOS:000315659300006,,,,,2021-09-21,

According to restricted maximum likelihood models, growth rates varied among beaches 925 km scale), but these spatial patterns were not consistent across years. We found no evidence for spatial variation in growth at the scale of subregions 950 km) or regions 9100 km). Growth rate was positively correlated with total length, both within and among beaches and years. In general, YOY plaice in mid-August grew more slowly than estimated ad libitum laboratory rates. Average growth rates by beach and year were inversely related to intraspecific competitor densities, but not interspecific competitor densities (brown shrimp Crangon crangon) or 2 environmental productivity metrics (nearshore chlorophyll a concentration and lugworm Arenicola marina cast density). Physical beach characteristics also explained a significant source of spatial growth variation, with fish growing faster at beaches with larger tidal range and wave fetch. Therefore, the hypothesis of sub-maximum growth due to intraspecific competition (density-dependent growth) was supported, but additional, previously unexplored processes related to physical beach characteristics appear to have important influences on the spatial growth dynamics of YOY plaice.","[Ciotti, Benjamin J.; Targett, Timothy E.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Burrows, Michael T.] Scottish Marine Inst, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland","Ciotti, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Waterfront Campus, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",benjamin.j.ciotti@gmail.com,"Burrows, Michael/ABF-4844-2020","Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899; Ciotti, Benjamin/0000-0001-5769-1437",UK Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Scottish Association for Marine Science; University of Delaware,"We thank staff and students at the Scottish Marine Institute in Oban, particularly R.

For arc-eye hawkfish, the numerically dominant species, recruitment (defined as the contribution of young-of-year to the benthic population within several months after settlement from the water column) varied 7-fold among years averaged over sites. Nonetheless, recruitment also differed spatially, with sites along the Kohala Peninsula comprising a high recruitment group. Spatial differences were persistent (some sites predictably low, others predictably high) and generally lacked demonstrable variation over time. Complementary em pirical data suggested that post-settlement processes (predation, interspecific competition) also affected recruitment. A dispersal model combined with currents from an oceanic circulation model (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, HYCOM) was used to simulate the spatial patterns of settlement by larvae released throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. These simulations generally agreed with observed spatial patterns of recruitment. Greater recruitment was also predicted near geomorphological features (headlands) on Hawaii Island most influenced by the flow of surface eddy currents generated by prevailing E-NE trade winds. Empirical data and simulations together suggest that the headlands of west Hawaii Island likely enhance recruitment by intercepting or concentrating larvae at greater rates, but that post-settlement processes dampen variations in settlement. We suggest that habitat geomorphology should be considered in the criteria used to select sites for no-take Marine Protected Areas at Hawaii Island.","[DeMartini, Edward E.] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Hawaii Res Ctr, Aiea, HI 96701 USA; [Wren, Johanna L.

In the Western Mediterranean, endemic bovids have been recorded during the late Miocene in the Tusco-Sardinian palaeobioprovince (Baccinello-Cinigiano basin, South Tuscany, and Fiume Santo, north-western Sardinia). In the latest Neogene and Quaternary, bovids showing highly endemic features were restricted to the Balearic Islands and Sardinia, while Bovini only slightly reduced in size were present on Pianosa, Malta and Sicily. On Sardinia, the richest bovid sample comes from Monte Tuttavista (Orosei), where at least three species have been identified: Asoletragus genthry, Nesogoral aff. N. melonii, and Nesogoral sp. 2. On Mallorca (Balearic Islands) six chronospecies belonging to the Myotragus endemic phylogenetic lineage have been described, spreading in age from the Early Pliocene to the Holocene. For decades, a close phylogenetic relationship between Nesogoral and Myotragus has been widely accepted by scholars. Morphological and biometrical differences shown by Balearic and Sardinian bovids have generally been regarded as the result of the evolution into two different island ecological systems, characterized by different inter and intra-guild selection pressures. Indeed, the more diversified environment of Sardinia, as well as the presence of other large mammals (similar-sized competitors belonging to the same guild and a running predator), increased the interspecific competition, forcing Sardinian bovids to exploit different resources and to occupy different niches, while Myotragus exploited under a monopoly regime the supply of resources available for large herbivores on the Eastern Balearic Islands. Nonetheless, new data suggest that Nesogoral and Myotragus possibly originated from different taxa. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Hatchery-reared P. olivaceus (ca. 100 mm in total length) released in stock enhancement programs also consume mysids. To examine whether stocking is implemented within the available carrying capacity, we assessed the feeding relationships among fishes, based on the stomach contents of fishes collected off the coast of Fukushima, Japan. Similarity in diet suggested that 10 species, particularly the poacher Occella iburia and nibe croaker Nibea mitsukurii were potential competitors of P. olivaceus juveniles for food. Large inter-annual variability in the abundance of these competitors was observed, suggesting variability in their consumption of mysids. The predominant mysid Orientomysis mitsukurii was abundant every year, and growth rates of wild P. olivaceus, estimated from otolith microstructure, were mostly high (>1 mm d(-1)), even in the year when wild P. olivaceus were highly abundant. In our statistical model, abundance of mysids and consumption of mysids by fishes significantly affected the growth rates of wild P. olivaceus but only accounted for a small proportion (i.e. explained 2.2 and 2.4% of variance, respectively) of the total compared to the body size of juveniles (30.0%) and bottom water temperature (4.5%). These results suggest that the productivity of mysids is usually high enough to support the production of mysid consumers, but exceptionally high abundances of wild P. olivaceus or other competitors can reduce the available carrying capacity. In such a situation, stocking should be restricted so as not to reduce productivity of wild fishes.","[Tomiyama, Takeshi] Fukushima Prefectural Fisheries Expt Stn, Iwaki, Fukushima 9700316, Japan; [Uehara, Shinji; Kurita, Yutaka] Tohoku Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Shiogama 9850001, Japan","Tomiyama, T (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398528, Japan.",ttomi17@yahoo.co.jp,"Tomiyama, Takeshi/J-2861-2012","Tomiyama, Takeshi/0000-0001-5941-6527",,,,52,17,18,0,17,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Island area was a significant predictor of species richness in the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and Lesser Antilles at all time periods, except for the Lesser Antilles during the LGM. Parameters of LGM and current SARs were similar in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles, but not the Lesser Antilles, which had fewer estimated species during the LGM than expected given their size. Estimated postglacial species losses in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles were largely explained by inferred area loss from rising sea level in the Holocene. However, there were more species in the Bahamas at present, and fewer species in the smaller Greater Antilles, than expected given island size and the end-Pleistocene/early Holocene SARs. Poor fossil sampling and ecological factors may explain these departures from the null. Our analyses illustrate the importance of changes in area in explaining patterns of species richness through time and emphasize the role of the SAR as a null hypothesis in explorations of the impact of novel ecological interactions on extinction.","[Davalos, Liliana M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Davalos, Liliana M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Consortium Interdisciplinary Environm Res, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Russell, Amy L.] Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Biol, Allendale, MI 49401 USA","Davalos, LM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",ldavalos@life.bio.sunysb.edu,"Russell, Amy L/B-2222-2010","Davalos, Liliana/0000-0002-4327-7697",Stony Brook University; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0949759]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0949759] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"Stony Brook University provided start-up funds to LMD, research supported in part by the NSF (DEB-0949759).",,34,19,22,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Invasions can impact on parasite communities through both the introduction of exotic parasite species and effects of invading hosts on native parasite dynamics. However, our understanding of the factors that influence the invasive process and mediate impacts on native hosts and parasites is limited. 2. Using models of hostparasite dynamics as a framework, we explore how both the probability of spread for an exotic parasite and impacts of introduced species on native parasite dynamics depend on key parameters related to rates of encounter, transmission, mortality and recovery. We examine how invasions may interact with the diverse range of underlying biological mechanisms that can affect these rates. We specifically highlight the potential role of interactions between parasites, which has largely been ignored. 3. For introduced parasites, high abundance of competent hosts and vectors within native communities can greatly facilitate spread. Introduced host species can cause amplification or dilution effects for native parasite dynamics, with the direction and magnitude of the effect determined by how the invasion influences the competency and abundance or relative abundance of the host community (community capacity). 4. Invasions by exotic parasites and changes to endemic parasite dynamics following invasions may reflect numerical and functional processes in multihost single-parasite systems (e.g. influence of host and vector community structure on encounter rates). However, as co-infection can influence factors such as susceptibility and infection length, effects may also be mediated by within-host interactions between parasites. The ultimate effect of an invasion will depend on the community-wide summed direct and indirect impacts. 5. Future studies should aim to further elucidate the key processes influencing disease dynamics in multihost (and multivector) communities, thereby informing predictions of how invasive host and parasite species and changes in biodiversity will influence disease risk. Theoretical studies should incorporate host interspecific competition and relax assumptions regarding the relationship between intra- and interspecific contact rates and density. Empirical and experimental studies should not only quantify the relative importance of host (and vector) density and diversity, but also consider other community interactions such as those between parasites.","[Telfer, Sandra] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Bown, Kevin] Univ Salford, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England","Telfer, S (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.",s.telfer@abdn.ac.uk,"Bown, Kevin/K-6681-2017","Bown, Kevin/0000-0002-9312-7224; Telfer, Sandra/0000-0002-9596-0711; Dunn, Alison/0000-0002-4855-1077",Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [081705/B/06/Z],This review benefited from comments made by two anonymous reviewers.

Whenever one organism uses metabolites produced by another organism as energy or nutrient sources, it is called cross-feeding. The ecological outcomes of cross-feeding interactions are poorly understood and potentially diverse: mutualism, competition, exploitation, or commensalism. A major reason for this uncertainty is the lack of theoretical approaches linking microbial metabolism to microbial ecology. To address this issue, we explore the dynamics of a one-way interspecific cross-feeding interaction in which food can be traded for a service (detoxification). Our results show that diverse ecological interactions (competition, mutualism, exploitation) can emerge from this simple cross-feeding interaction and can be predicted by the metabolic, demographic, and environmental parameters that govern the balance of the costs and benefits of association. In particular, our model predicts stronger mutualism for intermediate by-product toxicity because the resource-service exchange is constrained to the service being neither too vital (high toxicity impairs resource provision) nor dispensable (low toxicity reduces need for service). These results support the idea that bridging microbial ecology and metabolism is a critical step toward a better understanding of the factors governing the emergence and dynamics of polymicrobial interactions.","[Estrela, Sylvie; Brown, Sam P.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Estrela, Sylvie; Brown, Sam P.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Estrela, S (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",s.estrela@sms.ed.ac.uk,"Brown, Sam/B-5234-2009","Brown, Sam/0000-0003-1892-9275; Estrela, Sylvie/0000-0003-1946-3657","PDBC-IGC / Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Portugal [SFRH/BD/33856/2009]; Rhodes Trust; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [082273/Z/07/Z]","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

In particular, we discuss Bose-Fermi mixtures where the intra- and interspecies interactions induce competing density-induced hopping processes, the so-called bond-charge interactions. Furthermore, higher bands strongly influence tunneling and on-site interactions. We apply a multiorbital interaction-induced dressing of the lowest band, which leads to renormalized hopping processes. These corrections give rise to an extended Hubbard model with intrinsically occupation-dependent parameters. The resulting decrease of the tunneling competes with a decrease of the total on-site interaction energy, both affecting the critical lattice depth of the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition. In contrast to the standard Bose-Fermi Hubbard model, we predict a large shift of the transition to shallower lattice depths with increasing Bose-Fermi attraction. The applied theoretical model allows an accurate prediction of the modified tunneling amplitudes and the critical lattice depth, both being recently observed experimentally.","[Juergensen, Ole; Sengstock, Klaus; Luehmann, Dirk-Soeren] Univ Hamburg, Inst Laser Phys, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany","Jurgensen, O (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Laser Phys, Luruper Chaussee 149, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany.",,,,German Science Foundation DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR801],We thank U.

We tested this prediction by suppressing insects in replicated field populations of a native plant, Oenothera biennis, which reduced seed predation, altered interspecific competitive dynamics, and resulted in rapid evolutionary divergence. Comparative genotyping and phenotyping of nearly 12,000 O. biennis individuals revealed that in plots protected from insects, resistance to herbivores declined through time owing to changes in flowering time and lower defensive ellagitannins in fruits, whereas plant competitive ability increased. This independent real-time evolution of plant resistance and competitive ability in the field resulted from the relaxation of direct selective effects of insects on plant defense and through indirect effects due to reduced herbivory on plant competitors.","[Agrawal, Anurag A.; Hastings, Amy P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Agrawal, Anurag A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Johnson, Marc T.

The mark and recapture method, using pattern and tubercles on the head region for individual animal recognition, was employed, along with general survey methods. Our results show that the population in Khao Wong consisted mainly of adults, with a small percentage of subadults and juveniles. The geckos were found to be active throughout the year, but lower activity was recorded during May-Oct (wet season), probably due to increased predator activity and interspecific competition from amphibians. Microhabitat partitioning among age groups was recorded as the adults preferred areas inside of the cave and the ecotone at the entrance of the cave; the subadults preferred the ecotone area and hill side; and the juveniles were found mostly on the hill side and at the base of the karst along an ephemeral stream. Females were found to be more active than males during the wet season, probably because they required more nutrients for developing eggs. We found the oviposition period to peak at the end of the wet season to the beginning of the dry season (Nov-Dec). Juvenile numbers peaked at the beginning of the dry season (Feb-Mar). Growth rates derived from recaptured individuals showed that females take two years to reach maturity. C. sumonthai females normally lay two eggs, but odd numbers were recorded in some eggs crevices, probably from female individuals that laid a second clutch in the same year. Egg crevices were found mostly inside the cave, with some being unused during the whole survey, evidence that these were not a limiting factor for this population. A low percentage of marked individuals were being re-captured, which is probably evidence for a large population size, high mortality and migration, or a low level of activity of this gecko in general. However, the majority of the re-captured individuals were mostly found in the same general area where they were previously captured, except for a few adult individuals that showed some short migratory behaviour and subadults that moved closer to the cave entrance as they grew.","[Panitvong, Nonn; Lauhachinda, Veerayuth] Kasetsart Univ, Coll Environm, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Saithong, Soomet] Khao Chamao Khao Wong Natl Pk, Amphoe Klaeng 21110, Rayong, Thailand; [Temchai, Thammanoon] 4 Natl Pk Res Ctr Reg, Amphoe Chaam 76120, Phetchaburi, Thailand","Panitvong, N (corresponding author), Kasetsart Univ, Coll Environm, 50 Phaholyothin Rd Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.",npanitvong@gmail.com; v.lauhachinda@hotmail.com; sumet_hamed@hotmail.com; dhamma57@gmail.com,,,,,,37,5,5,0,11,"NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, SCHOOL BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES",SINGAPORE,"DEPT ZOOLOGY, KENT RIDGE, SINGAPORE 0511, SINGAPORE",0217-2445,,,RAFFLES B ZOOL,Raffles Bull.

However, although feeding competition can limit the size of female groups, many other factors affect the costs and the benefits of sociality to females and contribute to differences in group size. Moreover, interspecific differences in social relationships between females, in female philopatry, and in kinship between group members appear to be more closely associated with variation in life-history parameters, reproductive strategies, and phylogeny than with contrasts in food distribution or feeding competition. The mismatch between predictions of socioecological theory and observed variation in primate social behavior has led to protracted arguments about the future of primate socioecology. We argue that future attempts to understand the diversity of primate societies need to be based on an approach that explores separate explanations for different components of social organization, combines ecological and phylogenetic information, and integrates research on primates with similar studies of other groups of mammals.

Phylogenetic relationships of introduced species to the extant community may be predictive of establishment success because of the opposing forces of competition/shared enemies (which should limit invasions by close relatives) versus environmental filtering (which should allow invasions by close relatives). We examine here the association between establishment success of introduced birds and their phylogenetic relatedness to the extant avifauna within three highly invaded regions (Florida, New Zealand, and Hawaii). Published information on both successful and failed introductions, as well as native species, was compiled for all three regions. We created a phylogeny for each avifauna including all native and introduced bird species. From the estimated branch lengths on these phylogenies, we calculated multiple measurements of relatedness between each introduced species and the extant avifauna. We used generalized linear models to test for an association between relatedness and establishment success. We found that close relatedness to the extant avifauna was significantly associated with increased establishment success for exotic birds both at the regional (Florida, Hawaii, New Zealand) and sub-regional (islands within Hawaii) levels. Our results suggest that habitat filtering may be more important than interspecific competition in avian communities assembled under high rates of anthropogenic species introductions. This work also supports the utility of community phylogenetic methods in the study of vertebrate invasions.","[Maitner, Brian S.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Dunham, Amy E.; Whitney, Kenneth D.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Maitner, BS (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",bsm2@rice.edu,"Dunham, Amy E./B-6161-2009; Whitney, Kenneth D/B-2971-2011","Dunham, Amy E./0000-0002-5184-3652; Whitney, Kenneth D/0000-0002-2523-5469","Rice Univ.

Additionally, germination and germ tube growth of the pathogens were studied on attached and detached wheat leaves at 10 degrees C and 22 degrees C. Two-species interactions between Fusarium isolates during germination and germ tube growth were assessed after 8 hours of incubation. All species except F. tricinctum germinated and grew faster at higher than lower temperature. All species were able to germinate with more than one germ tube per conidium cell; and germination and germ tube growth were faster on leaves than on glass surface. Interactions among Fusarium species during germination and germ tube growth were predominantly competitive with macroconidia-producing species being more competitive.

Little is known about hydrological influences on tropical waterbird communities. We used a 16-year data set (19912007) of waterbird censuses, together with a classification of observed species into foraging guilds, to explore the relationships between natural variations in flow regime, foraging guild and the community composition of waterbirds at the Okavango River in the Caprivi Strip of north-eastern Namibia, southern Africa. 2. We addressed three hypotheses to explain variation in waterbird community composition: (i) exploitation (birds move towards resource-rich patches to exploit periods of high food abundance); (ii) escapism (declines in regional habitat quality force birds to aggregate in perennial waterbodies); and (iii) interaction (bird assemblages are dominated by intra- and interspecific interactions, such as flock formation for breeding or moulting, that can be explained better by life history demands or competition than by resource availability). 3. Waterbirds in different foraging guilds responded strongly but at different periods to changes in the hydrological environment, creating a complex but predictable successional pattern in community composition through time. Deep-water feeders responded fastest (abundance peaking 2 months post-flood), followed by shallow-water feeders (4 months) and emergent vegetation feeders (7 months). Species that forage on short vegetation or in mud showed a bimodal response with peaks in abundance at 3 and 8 months post-flood. 4. Our results indicated a strong effect of the local flow regime and hence supported the exploitation hypothesis. The foraging guild approach allowed us to identify clear patterns in a highly complex ecosystem and shows considerable promise as an analytical tool for similar data sets. Our results further suggest that while the entire bird community will be affected by hydrological alterations such as impoundments, water extraction and climate change, deep-water feeders may be one of the most vulnerable groups.","[Cumming, Graeme S.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Paxton, Mark] Shamvura Camp, Rundu, Namibia; [King, Jackie] Univ Western Cape, Inst Water Studies, Cape Town, South Africa; [Beuster, Hans] Beuster Clarke & Associates, Noordhoek, South Africa","Cumming, GS (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",graeme.cumming@uct.ac.za,"Cumming, Graeme/B-6551-2008","Cumming, Graeme/0000-0002-3678-1326",DST/NRF Centre of Excellence at the Percy FitzPatrick InstituteDepartment of Science & Technology (India),"We are grateful to Linda Sheehan for indispensable field assistance; to Charlene Paxton for help with logistics and support; and to numerous other observers who gave generously of their private time and expenses to assist with the counts.

In addition to direct predator-prey relations, many other interactions (competition, facilitation, inhibition, etc.) may be key to the structure and functioning of communities. Such interactions often occur between species belonging to the same trophic level, and have already been demonstrated between species of bacterial-feeding nematodes, but the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Hence, iris difficult to predict their outcome under changing environmental conditions like pollution. Scientists and policy makers have come up with standardized tests to establish environmentally acceptable levels of pollution. In this experiment, we demonstrate how sublethal levels of contaminants can affect not only the fitness of two nematode species but also the way in which these species interact. We performed monospecific and combined culture experiments with two species of soil bacterivorous nematodes, Acrobeloides nanus and Plectus parvus, under optimal conditions and compared the outcome with trials in which the nematodes were exposed to a series of sublethal cadmium concentrations. By evaluating fitness and outcome of interspecific interactions based on their abundance, our results (a) confirm the considerably higher tolerance of A. nanus than that of P. parvus to Cd: (b) demonstrate mutual facilitation between both species: (c) highlight that differential tolerance to pollution between bacterivorous species may affect the balance and outcome of their interactions leading to counterintuitive results such as a higher population fitness of one species (A. nanus) under increased pollution.

Cattails (Typha spp.) have increased their abundance in the Great Lakes region of North America over the past 150 years. This increase in the distribution of cattails is associated with hybridization between broad-leaved (Typha latifolia) and narrow-leaved cattails (T. angustifolia). The resulting hybrids occur predominantly as F(1)s, which are known as T. x glauca, although later-generation hybrids have also been documented. It has been proposed that in sympatric populations, the parental species and hybrids are often spatially segregated according to growth in contrasting water depths, and that this should promote the maintenance of parental species. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the two species and their hybrids segregate along a water-depth gradient at sites where they are sympatric. We identified the two parental species and their hybrids using molecular genetic markers (SSR), and measured shoot elevations (a proxy for water depth) at 18 sites in Southern Ontario, Canada. We found no evidence for niche segregation among species based on elevation. Our data indicate that all three lineages compete for similar habitat where they co-occur suggesting that there is potential for an overall loss of biodiversity in the species complex, particularly if the hybrid lineage is more vigorous compared to the parental species, as has been suggested by other authors.","[McKenzie-Gopsill, Andrew; Kirk, Heather; Van Drunen, Wendy; Freeland, Joanna R.; Dorken, Marcel E.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada","Dorken, ME (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Dept Biol, 1600 W Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.",marceldorken@trentu.ca,"Wilson, Chris C/J-4851-2012; Van Drunen, Wendy/AAD-7528-2019; Freeland, Joanna/AAY-3881-2021","Wilson, Chris C/0000-0002-9528-0652; Van Drunen, Wendy/0000-0003-1093-6665; Freeland, Joanna/0000-0002-5251-7680",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Trent University; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"Funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada).; The authors thank J.

PSF is a good example of bidirectional interactions between biomes and the non-living environments, acting as a major driving force of community structure and ecosystem function. Among the major types of PSF mediated by various soil components, there are many holes in our knowledge of the interactions between PSF mediated by plant species-specific litter and PSF mediated by soil microbes. Here I discuss the role of the functional diversity of microbial decomposers in litter-mediated PSF and also propose new hypotheses on the role of microbial diversity in PSF mediated by pathogenic and mutualistic soil microbes. I also review how PSF interacts with human-induced environmental change, i.e., direct drivers of change in the ecosystem (e.g. climate change and the invasion of alien species). Many authors have suggested that the impact of alien plant species on ecosystems is mediated by PSF, which also interacts with other direct drivers, such as climate change. Using a simple model of litter-mediated PSF with microbial decomposers, I confirm that the interactions between PSF and other direct drivers affect the invasion process of alien species. The model also demonstrates that the functional diversity of microbial decomposers accelerates or decelerates the speed of the invasion depending on the environmental change scenarios. Further theoretical and empirical studies are needed to derive general predictions on how exogenous environmental change induced by human activities alters communities and ecosystems through disturbance or modification of endogenous community-ecosystem interactions, such as the functioning of PSF.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10617, Taiwan","Miki, T (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",tksmiki@ntu.edu.tw,"Miki, Takeshi/F-8189-2010","Miki, Takeshi/0000-0002-2452-8681","National Taiwan UniversityNational Taiwan University [97R0034-29]; National Science Council (NSC), TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [97-2611-M-002-011-MY3]","The anonymous reviewers are thanked for their valuable suggestions on the earlier versions of the manuscript.

This model determines the biomass by estimating the average weight and the number of mussels per meter of seeded rope, using real data. The average weight is estimated using the von Bertalanffy model modified to incorporate the availability of food in the environment and the reproductive cycle given by the Meat Yield Index, which is the quotient between the meat weight and the total weight. Therefore, the average weight is determined by the availability of food and the biological growth of the species. The model assumes that the number of mussel individuals per meter in the rope is the result of both the species intraspecific competition among M. chilensis individuals and the interspecific competition with individuals of the mytilid Aulacomya atra for the available space in the same seeded rope. The growth rate, the occupied surface and the presence percentage of M. chilensis and A. atra were used to model the competition for the available space. The study was performed at the Rilan basin in the Chiloe Island, southern Chile, during an 18-month period. The results obtained were an R-2 adjusted = 0.98, 0.93, and 0.94 for the variation in size, lineal density and biomass, respectively, which indicate that the proposed dynamic model can be used to predict the biomass over time.","[Marambio, Jose; Maturana, Sergio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ingn Civil Ind, Santiago, Chile; [Campos, Bernardita] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias Mar & Recursos Nat, Renaca, Vina Del Mar, Chile","Marambio, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ingn Civil Ind, Casilla 306,Correo 22, Santiago, Chile.",jmaramb1@uc.cl,"Maturana, Sergio/C-3342-2008; Maturana, Sergio/M-2206-2013","Maturana, Sergio/0000-0002-9998-7225; Maturana, Sergio/0000-0002-9998-7225",,,,30,5,5,0,23,UNIV VALPARAISO,VINA DEL MAR,"FACULTAD CIENCIAS MAR RECURSOS NATURALES, CASILLA 5080 - RENACA, VINA DEL MAR, 00000, CHILE",0717-3326,0718-1957,,REV BIOL MAR OCEANOG,Rev.

However, the learning mechanisms behind such information use can allow animals to be flexible in the cues that are used. This raises the question of whether conspecific cues are inherently more influential than cues provided by heterospecifics, or whether animals can simply use any cue that predicts fitness enhancing conditions, including those provided by heterospecifics. To determine how freely social information travels across species boundaries, we trained bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to learn to use cues provided by conspecifics and heterospecific honey bees (Apis mellifera) to locate valuable floral resources. We found that heterospecific demonstrators did not differ from conspecifics in the extent to which they guided observers' choices, whereas various types of inorganic visual cues were consistently less effective than conspecifics. This was also true in a transfer test where bees were confronted with a novel flower type. However, in the transfer test, conspecifics were slightly more effective than heterospecific demonstrators. We then repeated the experiment with entirely naive bees that had never foraged alongside conspecifics before. In this case, heterospecific demonstrators were equally efficient as conspecifics both in the initial learning task and the transfer test. Our findings demonstrate that social learning is not a unique process limited to conspecifics and that through associative learning, interspecifically sourced information can be just as valuable as that provided by conspecific individuals. Furthermore the results of this study highlight potential implications for understanding competition within natural pollinator communities.","[Dawson, Erika H.; Chittka, Lars] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Biol & Expt Psychol Grp, London, England","Dawson, EH (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Biol & Expt Psychol Grp, London, England.",l.chittka@qmul.ac.uk,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012; Dawson, Erika H/D-9734-2017","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732; Dawson, Erika H/0000-0002-1445-3575",,,,22,50,51,0,56,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"185 BERRY ST, STE 1300, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,FEB 8,2012,7,2,,,,,,,e31444,10.1371/journal.pone.0031444,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,924ZP,WOS:000302730100072,22347479,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

We evaluated whether fire injury increased susceptibility of lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta) to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), how it influenced beetle reproductive success, and whether beetle population phase altered this interaction. Eight sites that experienced wildfire and eight unburned sites were examined in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (USA). Half were in areas where D. ponderosae was undergoing outbreaks, and half were in areas with low populations. We examined 2056 trees one year after fire for burn injury and beetle attack. We quantified beetle reproductive success in a random sample of 106 trees, and measured gallery areas of D. ponderosae and competing subcortical herbivores in 79 additional trees. Baited flight traps sampled stand-level populations of Subcortical herbivores and predators. Wildfire predisposed trees to D. ponderosae attack, but nonlinearly, with moderately injured trees being most preferred. This tree-level interaction was influenced by stand-level beetle population size, in that both healthy and fire-injured trees of all classes were attacked where populations were high, but no healthy trees, and only low and moderately injured trees were killed where populations were low. The number of adult brood produced per female was likewise curvilinear, being highest in moderately injured trees. This reflected an apparent trade-off, with high intraspecific competition arising from the large number of beetles needed to overcome defenses in healthy trees, vs. high interspecific competition and low substrate quality in more injured trees. These results suggest that fire-injured trees can provide a reservoir for D. ponderosae during periods when populations are too low to overcome defenses of healthy trees, and might otherwise face localized extinction. However, the likelihood of populations increasing from endemic to outbreak levels in response to increased susceptibility is offset by the opposing constraints of lower substrate quality and higher competitor load in severely injured hosts, and the relative scarcity of moderately injured trees. Wildfire may confer some reproductive increases to populations already outbreaking. We present a conceptual model of how these disturbances and inherent feedbacks interact to affect beetle population dynamics.","[Powell, Erinn N.; Raffa, Kenneth F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Powell, Erinn N.; Townsend, Philip A.; Raffa, Kenneth F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raffa, KF (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",raffa@entomology.wisc.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0816541]; McIntire Stennis [WIS0469]; Joint Fire Sciences Program [06-2-1-20]; University of Wisconsin College of Agricultural and Life Sciences,"We thank the National Science Foundation DEB-0816541, McIntire Stennis WIS0469, Joint Fire Sciences Program 06-2-1-20, and University of Wisconsin College of Agricultural and Life Sciences for support.

Barbastelle bat feeds predominantly on moths and has the narrowest trophic niche within the entire studied bat community. A comparison of the food supply and the diet composition showed selectivity for larger species of moths. An increasing of absolute abundance of preferred larger moths within summer is accompanied with narrowing of bat's trophic niche. This pattern corresponds well with the conclusions of optimal foraging theory. Larger moths are preferred even in a period of their low relative abundance within a peak of abundance of smaller species. There are no abrupt seasonal changes in the bat's diet within season, but the narrow pool of available food supply seems to determine the trophic niche breadth within low prey diversity periods in early spring and late autumn. The exception is a late autumn period; most probably due to a change in food supply are preferred larger moths replaced in the diet by smaller individuals. Most of the moths' species cease to fly and chiefly only smaller moth species are flying and attracted by UV light. Larger moths still occur at studied area at that time, but they display minimal flying activities and they are detected using vegetation beating and sweeping. Furthermore, syntopic moth-eating foliage gleaner (Plecotus auritus) still feeds on larger moths at that time. This may indicate that the change in the diet of B. barbastellus is a consequence of poor or absent gleaning abilities of this species, which is not able to pick up the prey from the surface as P auritus. Different hunting strategies are probably efficient trophic niche partitioning mechanisms reducing interspecific competition between these syntopic moth eating bats.","[Andreas, Michal] Silva Tarouca Res Inst Landscape & Ornamental Gar, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Reiter, Antonin] S Moravian Museum Znojmo, CZ-66945 Znojmo, Czech Republic; [Benda, Petr] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Zool, CZ-11579 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Reiter, Antonin; Benda, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic","Andreas, M (corresponding author), Silva Tarouca Res Inst Landscape & Ornamental Gar, Kvetnove Namesti 391, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.",michal.andreas@seznam.cz,"Benda, Petr/B-5437-2011; Andreas, Michal/A-6461-2009","Andreas, Michal/0000-0001-5813-8983","Czech Ministry of Environment [MSM6293359101]; Czech Ministry of Culture [DE07P04OMG006, MK00002327201]","The authors wish to thank everyone that helped with data collection, namely: Lenka Barciova, Eva Cepakova, Katerina Capounova, Vladimir Hanak, Anna Hoffmannova, Josef Hotovy, Ivan Horacek, Martin Pokorny, Zdenek Rehak, Karolina Sulova, Dita Weinfurtova and Jan Zukal.

We studied social and foraging behaviour of algae-grazing fish Plecoglossus altivelis ryukyuensis (Ryukyu-ayu) inhabiting Japanese subtropical island streams. Ryukyu-ayu exhibited four behavioural modes: territorial, schooling, solitary and floating. Their body sizes differed among these modes. Territorial fish predominantly foraged on benthic algae, whereas schooling and solitary individuals frequently consumed drifting materials as well. Schooling fish were smaller than territorial fish, but, unlike some other algae-grazing fish species, did not use schooling to gain access to food within territories. Territorial fish attacked smaller conspecifics but exhibited lateral display towards larger fish and schooling fish while occasionally attacking grazing gobies. Larger fish maintained larger feeding territories and occupied territories for longer periods than smaller fish did. This suggests that, in Ryukyu-ayu, intra- and interspecific food competitions and relative body size can influence diverse behavioural modes and duration of territory occupation. We also found that Ryukyu-ayu foraged more often and had larger feeding territories than ayu P.a.altivelis inhabiting temperate streams. We conclude that foraging strategies of Ryukyu-ayu may have adapted to subtropical island streams, where algal productivity is much lower than that in temperate regions.","[Awata, Satoshi; Tsuruta, Tetsuya; Abe, Shin-ichiro; Iguchi, Kei'ichiro] Fisheries Res Agcy, Ueda Stn, Freshwater Fisheries Res Div, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Ueda, Nagano 3860031, Japan; [Tamaki, Yasuji] Fisheries Res Agcy, Fisheries Econ Div, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan","Awata, S (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Agcy, Ueda Stn, Freshwater Fisheries Res Div, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, 1088 Komaki, Ueda, Nagano 3860031, Japan.",sa-awata@cc.niigata-u.ac.jp,"Awata, Satoshi/AAK-1233-2020; Awata, Satoshi/ABB-1769-2020","Awata, Satoshi/0000-0003-3254-7943","Foundation of River and Watershed Environment Management (FOREM), Japan [22-1215-022]","We are grateful to Toshihiko Yonezawa for assistance in the fieldwork.

In spite of both species being common and widespread in the island state of Tasmania, no quantified studies on the trophic ecology of these two snakes from the main island has been published. During a two-year period we collected field data from 127 adult A. superbus and 74 adult N. scutatus from throughout eastern Tasmania. For both species, males were larger than females with respect to all measured parameters, including mass and head size. Reproduction in females was strongly seasonal and clutch size was not related to maternal body size. N. scutatus has a larger head than A. superbus and consequently ingests both small and large prey. N. scutatus in our study displayed the most catholic diet of any Australian elapid studied to date and consumed mammals (possum, bandicoot, antechinus, rats, mice), birds (fairy wrens), fish (eel, trout) and frogs. A. superbus shows a more specialist diet of large volumes of predominately ectothermic prey (frogs, lizards, snakes) even at maximal sizes and was more likely to contain ingested prey than specimens of N. scutatus. Distinctive rodent bite scars were common on N. scutatus but rare on A. superbus. The high frequency of rodent bite scars on N. scutatus further supports our findings of a primarily endothermic diet for mature specimens. We suggest that significant differences in head size, and hence diet, as well as a taxonomically diverse suite of potential prey in Tasmania allow both these large snakes to coexist in sympatry and avoid interspecific competitive exclusion.","[Trembath, D.

Field growth of 0-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa, flounder Platichthys flesus and sole Solea solea, from both published and unpublished studies, was compared with maximum growth predicted by a bioenergetics model based on the dynamic energy budget theory. In plaice and flounder, realized growth ratio decreased consistently during the growing season in most of the nurseries analyzed, indicating a widespread pattern of declining conditions. In sole, growth performance was not maximal, but as opposed to the other species, no clear temporal trend in realized growth ratio was observed. A latitudinal comparison of realized growth ratio over the various nurseries indicated clear positive trends for plaice and flounder, with better growth conditions at northern latitudes. In sole, despite some variability, the same trend was found during part of the summer. In the absence of clear gradients in benthic prey biomass, we hypothesize that increased food limitation in southern locations is most likely caused by interspecific competition reducing maximum individual intake rates. These results suggest that, in the context of global warming, habitat quality of southern European nurseries for juvenile growth may be particularly affected by the combined interaction of food and thermal constraints.","[Freitas, Vania; van der Veer, Henk W.] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Freitas, Vania] Univ Porto, Ctr Interdisciplinar Invest Marinha & Ambiental C, P-4050123 Oporto, Portugal; [Kooijman, Sebastiaan A.

The validation of these mechanism models should be the focus of ongoing research.","[Bourdot, G. W.] AgRes Lincoln, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Leathwick, D.

However, recent studies describe negative temperature responses and drought stress of Alaskan treeline trees in recent decades. In this study, we have analyzed the responses of treeline white spruce to temperature and precipitation according to different climatic regimes in Alaska, described as negative (cool) and positive (warm) phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We found that in three consecutive phases (positive from 1925-46, negative from 1947-76, and positive again from 1977-98), the growth responses to temperature and precipitation differed markedly. Before 1947, in a phase of warm winters and with summer temperatures being close to the century mean, the trees at most sites responded positively to summer temperature, as one would expect from treeline trees at northern high latitudes. Between 1947 and 1976, a phase of cold winters and average summers, the trees showed similar responses, but a new pattern of negative responses to the summer temperature of the year prior to growth coupled with positive responses to the precipitation in the same year emerged at some sites. As the precipitation was relatively low at those sites, we assume that drought stress might have played a role. However, the climate responses were not uniform but were modified by regional gradients (trees at northern sites responded more often to temperature than trees at southern sites) and local site conditions (forest trees responded more often to precipitation than treeline trees), possibly reflecting differences in energy and water balance across regions and sites, respectively. However, since the shift in the PDO in 1976 from a negative to a positive phase, the trees' climate-growth responses are much less pronounced and climate seems to have lost its importance as a limiting factor for the growth of treeline white spruce. If predictions of continued warming and precipitation increase at northern high latitudes hold true, the growth of Alaskan treeline trees will likely depend on the ratio of temperature and precipitation increase more than on their absolute values, as well as on the interaction of periodic regime shifts with the global warming trend. Once a climatic limitation is lifted, other factors, such as insect outbreaks or interspecific competition, might become limiting to tree growth.","[Ohse, B.; Jansen, F.; Wilmking, M.] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany","Ohse, B (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Nat Conservat & Landscape Management, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Busgenweg 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",bohse@gwdg.de,"Wilmking, Martin/AAV-9310-2020; Jansen, Florian/W-3309-2019","Wilmking, Martin/0000-0003-4964-2402; Jansen, Florian/0000-0002-0331-5185; Ohse, Bettina/0000-0001-8715-494X",Ev.

A classic case is the grassfire cycle in which grass invasion increases the frequency, scale and/or intensity of wildfires and promotes the continued invasion of invasive grasses. Despite wide acceptance of the grassfire cycle, questions linger about the relative roles that interspecific plant competition and fire play in ecosystem transformations. Location Sonoran Desert Arizona Upland of the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, USA. Methods We measured species cover, density and saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) size structure along gradients of Pennisetum ciliare invasion at 10 unburned/ungrazed P. ciliare patches. Regression models quantified differences in diversity, cover and density with respect to P. ciliare cover, and residence time and a Fisher's exact test detected demographic changes in saguaro populations. Because P. ciliare may have initially invaded locations that were both more invasible and less diverse, we ran analyses with and without the plots in which initial infestations were located. Results Richness and diversity decreased with P. ciliare cover as did cover and density of most dominant species. Richness and diversity declined with increasing time since invasion, suggesting an ongoing transformation. The proportion of old-to-young Carnegiea gigantea was significantly lower in plots with dominant P. ciliare cover. Main conclusions Rich desert scrub (15-25 species per plot) was transformed into depauperate grassland (2-5 species per plot) within 20 years following P. ciliare invasion without changes to the fire regime. While the onset of a grass-fire cycle may drive ecosystem change in the later stages and larger scales of grass invasions of arid lands, competition by P. ciliare can drive small-scale transformations earlier in the invasion. Linking competition-induced transformation rates with spatially explicit models of spread may be necessary for predicting landscape-level impacts on ecosystem processes in advance of a grass-fire cycle.","[Olsson, Aaryn D.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Olsson, Aaryn D.; McClaran, Mitchel P.; Marsh, Stuart E.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Betancourt, Julio] US Geol Survey, Tucson, AZ USA","Olsson, AD (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Sustainabil, POB 5694, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",aaryno@gmail.com,,,USDA-ERSUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [58-7000-6-0083]; Pima County; DS-CESU [AZDS-223],"ADO thanks the numerous friends, family and colleagues who assisted with fieldwork, including PJD, EKD, LJK, JFO, DLL, JNL, JDM, CH, TC, and CH.

Scorpaena loppei Cadenat, 1943 is a small benthic scorpion fish, distributed in the eastern Atlantic from the Bay of Biscay to Mauritania and the Mediterranean Sea. This work constitutes the first complex attempt to study aspects of biology, feeding, bathymetric distribution, and habitat preferences of S. loppei. Materials and methods. The biological samples of S. loppei, as well as the data on its abundance and distribution, were collected during the annual bottom trawl survey series BALAR-MEDITS carried out from 2005 through 2010. The biological sampling included: weighing and measuring the fish, gonad weighing, determination of sex and maturity stage, age estimation through otolith readings, and stomach content analysis. Results. The sampled individuals ranged from 5.5 to 12.8 cm in total length (TL). The females predominated in the smaller size classes, and males being more abundant in the larger ones. All females sampled were mature (or approaching maturity). The age determined ranged from 0 to 5 years and from 1 to 5 years, for females and males, respectively. The estimated values of the von Bertalanffy asymptotic length L-infinity (cm) and growth coefficient k(year(-1)) for females and males were 10.9 and 0.53 and 12.4 and 0.49, respectively. According to the age-length key, all females of S. loppei should be attaining their first maturity during their first year of life. The diet of S. loppei consisted predominantly of crustaceans (mysids and decapods) followed by teleosts fishes. A specialized feeding behaviour was indicated by the Levin's index for numerical composition and frequency of occurrence assuming values of 0.18 and 0.28, respectively. The presence of S. loppei was restricted to sandy-mud deep continental shelf bottoms from 90 to 180 m depth. This distribution did not overlap with that of other small scorpion fish species inhabiting the area. Conclusion. Unlike its congeners, S. loppei demonstrated specialised feeding habits and habitat requirements. Being the only small scorpion fish inhabiting this benthic habitat in the study area might have reduced the interspecific competition, facilitating feeding and growth and allowing an early achievement of sexual maturity.","[Ordines, Francesc; Valls, Maria; Gouraguine, Adam] IEO Ctr Oceanog Balears, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain; [Gouraguine, Adam] Univ Glasgow, Div Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Ordines, F (corresponding author), IEO Ctr Oceanog Balears, Moll Ponent S-N, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain.",xisco.ordinas@ba.ieo.es,"Ordinas, Francesc/AAG-7079-2021; Valls, Maria/L-5641-2014","Valls, Maria/0000-0001-9070-8181; Gouraguine, Adam/0000-0001-8670-2676; Ordines, F.

Understanding the relative importance of environmental factors and historical processes in determining species' geographic ranges is crucial for predicting the impacts of climate change. Here, we experimentally assessed the survival and performance of four understorey forest plants (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum, Scilla bifolia, Iris foetidissima and Symphytum tuberosum) transplanted beyond their natural range limit over a 7-year period. Since the survival probability of plants transplanted beyond their natural geographic range is expected to decrease with the home-away distance, the species represent a gradient in the distance between the transplant site and their natural geographic range limit (from 50 to 500 km). Three of the four species still survived seven years after introduction. Appreciable survival outside their natural geographic range partly suggests that the ranges of these plant species may be controlled by dispersal limitation. Importantly, an interspecific trend towards decreasing survival with increasing distance from the range limit was apparent. Initial competition from other understorey plants generally limited the survival and performance of the transplanted species. In conclusion, the good survival and performance of the most 'nearby' species emphasizes the importance of dispersal limitation in determining range limits, while the poor survival of the 'farther' species suggests that their occurrence is (co-)controlled by environmental factors such as the local climate. Finally, we briefly discuss our results within the context of human-mediated assisted migration in the face of climate change.","[De Frenne, Pieter; Baeten, Lander; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Lab Forestry, B-9090 Melle Gontrode, Belgium; [Van der Veken, Sebastiaan; Van Beek, Eric; Hermy, Martin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [De Frenne, Pieter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England","De Frenne, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Lab Forestry, Geraardbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Melle Gontrode, Belgium.",Pieter.DeFrenne@UGent.be,"De Frenne, Pieter/N-4969-2014; Hermy, Martin/A-3769-2009","De Frenne, Pieter/0000-0002-8613-0943; Van der Veken, Sebastiaan/0000-0001-8897-4464; Hermy, Martin/0000-0002-5403-0139; Baeten, Lander/0000-0003-4262-9221",Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT),"We thank Hans Van Calster for assistance during fieldwork, Keith Kirby and Simon Leach for useful information on the distribution of the species, and two anonymous reviewers and the editor for comments on the manuscript.

Ants' wide diversity of nesting habits and relationships with plants and prey types implies that these chemicals are also very diverse. Using the African myrmicine ant Crematogaster striatula as our focal species, we adopted a three-pronged research approach. We studied the aggressive and predatory behaviors of the ant workers, conducted bioassays on the effect of their Dufour gland contents on termites, and analyzed these contents. (1) The workers defend themselves or eliminate termites by orienting their abdominal tip toward the opponent, stinger protruded. The chemicals emitted, apparently volatile, trigger the recruitment of nestmates situated in the vicinity and act without the stinger having to come into direct contact with the opponent. Whereas alien ants competing with C. striatula for sugary food sources are repelled by this behavior and retreat further and further away, termites defend their nest whatever the danger. They face down C. striatula workers and end up by rolling onto their backs, their legs batting the air. (2) The bioassays showed that the toxicity of the Dufour gland contents acts in a time-dependent manner, leading to the irreversible paralysis, and, ultimately, death of the termites. (3) Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses showed that the Dufour gland contains a mixture of mono-or polyunsaturated long-chain derivatives, bearing functional groups like oxo-alcohols or oxo-acetates. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry showed the presence of a molecule of 1584 Da that might be a large, acetylated alkaloid capable of splitting into smaller molecules that could be responsible for the final degree of venom toxicity.","[Rifflet, Aline; Tene, Nathan; Treilhou, Michel; Vetillard, Angelique] PRES Univ Toulouse, Jean Francois Champoll Univ Ctr, EA 4357, Venoms & Biol Act Lab, Albi, France; [Orivel, Jerome; Dejean, Alain] CNRS, UMR 8172, Kourou, France; [Dejean, Alain] Univ Toulouse 3, Univ Toulouse, F-31062 Toulouse, France","Rifflet, A (corresponding author), PRES Univ Toulouse, Jean Francois Champoll Univ Ctr, EA 4357, Venoms & Biol Act Lab, Albi, France.",avetilla@univ-jfc.fr,,"Dejean, Alain/0000-0002-3561-2248; Orivel, Jerome/0000-0002-5636-3228",CUFR JFC; UPS; CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission; Communaute d'Agglomeration de l'Albigeois; Region Midi-PyreneesRegion Provence-Alpes-Cote d'AzurRegion Occitanie,"Financial support for this study was provided by CUFR JFC, UPS, CNRS and the Communaute d'Agglomeration de l'Albigeois.

We investigated nesting behavior, food habits, and interspecific interactions of Short-eared Owls (Asio flammeus) within an arctic tundra raptor community on Herschel Island and Komakuk Beach, northern Yukon, Canada. Short-eared Owls were the least common nesting raptor. We found only three nests, all on Herschel Island. All nests were on relatively elevated sites with fairly substantial vegetative cover. All nests failed in the egg stage, from a combination of human disturbance and possible predation by Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus) or Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes). Short-eared Owls nested only in years when small rodent densities were at least 4 to 5 individuals per hectare in the spring. Short-eared Owls ate Northern Collared Lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), Brown Lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus), and Tundra Voles (Microtus oeconomus) almost exclusively, without clear selectivity. Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) killed two adult Short-eared Owls. In northern Yukon, the Short-eared Owl remains an uncommon summer resident and uses the region as a migration route. Spring rodent densities and interspecific predation are prominent limiting factors, and human disturbance also limits nesting success. We recommend restricting access to most tundra areas during periods when the birds are mating, initiating nesting, and incubating eggs. We recommend that human infrastructure be designed so that it cannot support novel nesting (and therefore local range expansion) by other nesting raptors that compete with and prey on Short-earned Owls.","[Reid, Donald G.] Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5T2, Canada; [Doyle, Frank I.] Wildlife Dynam Consulting Ltd, Smithers, BC V0J 2N0, Canada; [Kenney, Alice J.; Krebs, Charles J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Reid, DG (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5T2, Canada.",,,,Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada; Inuvialuit Final Agreement Wildlife Implementation Fund; Wildlife Conservation Society Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service (Environment Canada); Western Arctic Field Unit of the Parks Canada Agency,"This research was funded under the International Polar Year Program (Arctic Wildlife Observatories Linking Vulnerable Ecosystems) by Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada (now Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada), the Inuvialuit Final Agreement Wildlife Implementation Fund, and Wildlife Conservation Society Canada.

Genes (or transgenes) conferring adaptive advantages persist in introgressed populations, enhancing competitiveness of wild or weedy plants. This represents an ecological risk that could increase problems of weed control. Introgression of cultivar alleles into wild plant populations via crop-wild hybridisations is primarily governed by their fitness effect. To evaluate this, we studied the second generation of seven wild-crop interspecific hybrids between weedy Helianthus petiolaris and cultivated sunflower, H. annuus var. macrocarpus. The second generation comprised open-pollinated progeny and backcrosses to the wild parent, mimicking crosses that occur in natural situations. We compared a number of morphological, life history and fitness traits. Multivariate analysis showed that the parental species H. annuus and H. petiolaris differed in a number of morphological traits, while the second hybrid generation between them was intermediate. Sunflower crop introgression lowered fitness of interspecific hybrids, but fitness parameters tended to recover in the following generation. Relative frequency of wild/weedy and introgressed plants was estimated through four generations, based on male and female parent fitness. In spite of several negative selection coefficients observed in the second generation, introgressed plants could be detected in stands of <100 weedy H. petiolaris populations. The rapid recovery of fecundity parameters leads to prediction that any trait conferring an ecological advantage will diffuse into the wild or weedy population, even if F1 hybrids have low fitness.","[Gutierrez, A.; Poverene, M.] Ctr Recursos Nat Zona Semiarida CERZOS CONICET, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Cantamutto, M.; Poverene, M.] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Agron, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Gutierrez, A (corresponding author), Ctr Recursos Nat Zona Semiarida CERZOS CONICET, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",aguti@criba.edu.ar,,,National Research Council of Argentina (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); ANPCYTANPCyT [PICT 2286]; UNS [PGI 24A160],"Authors thank two anonymous reviewers and Ricardo Rodriguez Iglesias for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript; to Silvia Luis and Alicia Hernandez for assistance with the beta analyses; to National Research Council of Argentina (CONICET) for a fellowship to AG.

The Vogelwarte Helgoland was founded in 1910, and since 1909 more than 800,000 birds have been ringed. Most of these are nocturnally migrating songbirds that cross the German Bight in a broad front on their way to or from their Scandinavian breeding grounds. In good weather conditions (tail winds, clear sky), the majority of the migrants does not land on Helgoland, but deteriorating weather strongly increases their attraction to this island. Wind can cause rare birds such as raptors and continental landbirds to be blown offshore or pelagic seabirds to be blown into the German Bight, where they can drift to Helgoland. Migrants stay for hours to weeks, depending on species, age, sex, body condition, season, weather, food availability, intra- and interspecific competition, and predation pressure. The direction of departure also appears to be influenced by body and weather conditions. The reported circumstances for the almost 7,000 recoveries have changed substantially over the last 100 years, and show definite regional differences. Indices from constant-effort trapping reveal decreased numbers of long-distance migrants, while numbers of short/medium-distance migrants have not changed much. In all true migrants, the mean spring passage time has become earlier since 1960 (by up to 18 days). Whereas changes in autumn are less uniform, the time between both periods has increased in most species. This earliness in spring is best explained by local temperatures in short/medium-distance migrants, and by the winter NAO index in long-distance migrants.","[Hueppop, Ommo; Hueppop, Kathrin] Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, Isl Stn, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany","Huppop, O (corresponding author), Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, Isl Stn, Sapskuhle 511, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany.",ommo.hueppop@ifv-vogelwarte.de,,,,,,119,19,23,0,44,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

About 210 mature trees were monitored for leaf fall, leaf flush, flowering and fruiting. The different phenophase events were correlated with climate variables and circular statistics was employed to test for seasonality. Leaf fall and leaf flush peaked during the long dry season. Leaf fall significantly correlated with mean monthly temperatures. Flowering was predominantly annual and seasonal. Most species flowered during the dry season between November and May. Flowering was temporally discordant among the species, which is interpreted as a kind of adaptation avoiding interspecific overlap and thus competition for pollinators. Unlike flowering, fruiting was less seasonal and trees bore fruits over extended periods of the year. Following flowering, fruiting peaked later in the dry season or the beginning of the rainy season. Both flowering and fruiting phenology of the study species were strongly influenced by temperature and rainfall. However, leaf phenology was influenced by temperature.","[Tesfaye, Getachew] Inst Biodivers Conservat, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Tesfaye, Getachew] Univ Bergen, Nile Basin Res Program, UNIFOB Global, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Teketay, Demel] Univ Botswana, HOORC, Maun, Botswana; [Fetene, Masresha] Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Biol, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Beck, Erwin] Univ Bayreuth, Inst Plant Physiol, Bayreuth, Germany","Tesfaye, G (corresponding author), Inst Biodivers Conservat, POB 25680-1000, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",getachewtesfaye@yahoo.com,"Teketay, Demel/AAG-4814-2021",,German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); African Forest Research Network (AFORNET); International Foundation for Science (IFS)International Foundation for Science [D/4601-1],"The study was partly funded by The German Research Foundation (DFG), the African Forest Research Network (AFORNET) and the International Foundation for Science (IFS) grant # D/4601-1.

Molecular markers have recently revealed the existence of a new cryptic species of long-eared bat, Plecotus macrobullaris, in the European Alps. We studied trophic niches as well as seasonal and regional variations of diet in eight colonies of the three Plecotus species occurring in Switzerland. Faeces were collected monthly from individuals returning to roost after foraging. Twenty-one arthropod categories were recognized from the faeces. All three species fed predominantly on Lepidoptera, which made up 41%, 87% and 88% (means across colonies) of the diet composition of P. auritus, P. macrobullaris and P. austriacus, respectively. The occurrence of numerous fragments of both diurnal and flightless insects in the diet of P. auritus (but rarely in the diet of the other two species) indicates that this species mostly gleans prey from substrates. P. austriacus and P. macrobullaris are more typical aerial feeders. The latter two species have narrow trophic niches, whilst P. auritus has a much broader diet. Comparison of intraspecific and interspecific niche overlaps in P. auritus and P. macrobullaris in sympatry suggests dietary niche partitioning between these two species. In contrast, the high similarity of the trophic niches of P. austriacus and P. macrobullaris, associated with a typical parapatric distribution, indicates competitive exclusion. The best conservation measures are preservation and restoration of habitats offering a high abundance of moths, the major prey of the three Plecotus species.","[Ashrafi, Sohrab] Univ Tehran, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Nat Resources, Karaj, Iran; [Ashrafi, Sohrab; Rutishauser, Marianne; Arlettaz, Raphael; Bontadina, Fabio] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Beck, Andres; Bontadina, Fabio] SWILD Urban Ecol & Wildlife Res, CH-8003 Zurich, Switzerland","Ashrafi, S (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Nat Resources, POB 31585-4314, Karaj, Iran.",Soh_ashrafi@yahoo.com,"Arlettaz, Raphael/O-2182-2016","Arlettaz, Raphael/0000-0001-6360-5339",,,,46,22,28,0,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

These data provide evidence to support adapting harvest regulations when necessary. Setting appropriate harvest regulations for fishers (Martes pennanti) and American martens (Martes americana) is critical, as these species often exist at low densities, are sensitive to timber-management practices and trapper-harvest, and experience some level of interspecific predation and competition in sympatric populations. We estimated effects of management (e.g., number of fishers or martens harvested per trapper per season [harvest limit], season length) and extrinsic (e.g., weather, pelt prices) factors on regulated harvests of fishers and martens in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan during 1996-2007. We used generalized linear mixed models in an information-theoretic approach (quasi-likelihood adjusted Akaike Information Criterion [QAIC]) to discern which factors most strongly influenced fisher and marten harvests. For harvest of fishers, the 3 QAIC-best models included harvest limit, season length, and number of trappers, suggesting that regulatory changes within the ranges tested may be implemented to influence harvest. The QAIC-best model (harvest limit) contained 26% of the weight of evidence, and using an independent subset of data, showed no difference between model predictions and harvest data. In contrast, harvest of martens was not strongly influenced by any factors we tested. Possible reasons for a lack of measurable effects while modeling harvest of martens include a low harvest limit (i.e., 1 marten) or incidental harvest of martens by fisher or bobcat (Lynx rufus) trappers. Knowledge of influences on harvest will lead to informed decision-making when managers are setting harvest regulations, particularly for low-density furbearers.

The pool closest to the inner fringe of the reef had lower salinity and higher temperature due to inflow of groundwater. The other pools varied only with respect to their morphometric characteristics, algal cover, and bottom composition. Species with a strong affinity for estuarine-like waters characterized the pool closest to the beach and distinguished its fish community from that of the other pools. Instead of being strongly structured by the physicochemical setting and position in the reef, fish communities of the other pools were determined by behavioral preferences and intra- and interspecific interactions. Differences in community structure were related to pool size (the larger sizes permitting the permanency of schooling species), to algal cover (which allowed camouflage for large predatory species), to bottom composition (which provided substrate for turf flora available to territorial herbivores), and to ecological effects (e.g., competition, territoriality, and predation). Although distribution patterns of tidepool fishes have previously been related to the availability of niches, independent of pool position in the reef, our results show synergistic interactions between water properties, presence or absence of niches, and ecological relationships in structuring tidepool fish communities.","[Macieira, Raphael M.; Joyeux, Jean-Christophe] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Lab Ictiol, Dept Oceanog & Ecol, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil","Macieira, RM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Lab Ictiol, Dept Oceanog & Ecol, Av Fernando Ferrari,514 Goiabeiras, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil.",raphaelmacieira@hotmail.com,"Macieira, Raphael/G-2808-2011","Macieira, Raphael/0000-0002-8871-8724",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Espirito Santo (FAPES); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"The authors thank C.

Although many types of assembly rules have been described, including Diamond's assembly rules, constant body-size ratios, favoured states, and nestedness, few studies have tested multiple assembly rule models simultaneously. Therefore, little is known about the relative importance of potential underlying factors such as interspecific competition, inter-guild competition, selective extinction and habitat nestedness in structuring community composition. Here, we test the above four assembly rule models and examine the causal basis for the observed patterns using bird data collected on islands of an inundated lake. Location Thousand Island Lake, China. Methods We collected data on presence-absence matrices, body size and functional groups for bird assemblages on 42 islands from 2007 to 2009. To test the above four assembly rule models, we used null model analyses to compare observed species co-occurrence patterns, body-size distributions and functional group distributions with randomly generated assemblages. To ensure that the results were not biased by the inclusion of species with extremely different ecologies, we conducted separate analyses for the entire assemblage and for various subset matrices classified according to foraging guilds. Results The bird assemblages did not support predictions by several competitively structured assembly rule models, including Diamond's assembly rules, constant body-size ratios, and favoured states. In contrast, bird assemblages were highly significantly nested and were apparently shaped by extinction processes mediated through area effects and habitat nestedness. The nestedness of bird assemblages was not a result of passive sampling or selective colonization. These results were very consistent, regardless of whether the entire assemblage or the subset matrices were analysed. Main conclusions Our results suggest that bird assemblages were shaped by extinction processes mediated through area effects and habitat nestedness, rather than by interspecific or inter-guild competition. From a conservation point of view, our results indicate that we should protect both the largest islands with the most species-rich communities and habitat-rich islands in order to maximize the number of species preserved.","[Wang, Yanping; Ding, Ping] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Conservat Biol Endangered Wildlife, Minist Educ, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shuihua] Zhejiang Museum Nat Hist, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Ding, P (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Conservat Biol Endangered Wildlife, Minist Educ, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",dingping@zju.edu.cn,"Wang, Yanping/AAN-4402-2021; Ding, Ping/H-1817-2015","Wang, Yanping/0000-0003-3743-3937; ","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30670344, 30870315]; Zhejiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [R506054, Y507080]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","We thank Edward F.

On the local scale of interacting species, the response of diversity to warming will depend much on the change in interspecific interactions such as competition or predation. Using a phytoplankton model community, we conducted a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial long-term microcosm experiment (16 months) with an underlying seasonal temperature profile. We manipulated the mean temperature (T-mean), the temperature variance (T-var), and the presence of consumers (ciliates) and monitored treatment effects on algal biomass, species composition and species richness. Temperature effects on algal biomass depended on the seasonal development and consumer presence. Algal biomass decreased with increasing T-mean at consumer absence, but increased at consumer presence. Overall, algal biomass decreased with increasing T-var. Consumer presence reduced algal biomass from summer to winter, but then ciliates and the consumer effect disappeared. Almost all treatment combinations collapsed to monocultures after 16 months, but extinction occurred faster at higher T-mean (especially at consumer absence) and slower at consumer presence (especially at higher T-mean). Contrasting our predictions, increasing T-var reduced richness and increased extinction rate. The treatment effects on biomass and richness were not independent, as algal species richness and biomass were positively correlated. Moreover, accelerated loss of species was consistently correlated to higher temporal variability in biomass. In conclusion, altered temperature regimes strongly affected algal biomass and diversity by interdependently altering competitive and consumer interactions.","[Burgmer, Tanja; Hillebrand, Helmut] Univ Cologne, Inst Bot, DE-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Hillebrand, Helmut] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, DE-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany","Burgmer, T (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Bot, Gyrhofstr 15, DE-50931 Cologne, Germany.",hillebrand@icbm.de,"Hillebrand, Helmut/I-1717-2014","Hillebrand, Helmut/0000-0001-7449-1613",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [Hi 848/3-1],"We thank Helga Tiebel, Sabine Floder and Leo Leson for help during the experiment.

To explore the adaptive significance of seedling emergence timing, it should be studied under realistic conditions and in the context of other traits that influence fitness. Methods: In a common garden, we monitored maternal families from seed to flowering ( including over winter) with intra- and interspecific competition. We assessed the effects of emergence timing and plant size on survival to anthesis in different genetic backgrounds and under varying competition. Key Results: We found genetic variation for emergence (probability and timing), size, and survival to anthesis. We also found negative selection, both phenotypic and genetic, on emergence time, such that early emergers (day 8) had almost twice as great a predicted probability of surviving as later emergers (day 28). Size had strong positive effects on survival and, furthermore, the beneficial effects of early emergence may be mediated through size. Maternal family and competitive environment can also affect selection on emergence timing. Conclusions: Our results indicate that early emergence is related to greater survival in wild sunflower, although there may be little direct selection on this trait; rather, its importance may be mediated by its effects on highly adaptive traits associated with size. Also, the effects of early emergence may vary across genetic backgrounds and competitive conditions, facilitating the maintenance of variation for this trait across a diverse landscape.","[Mercer, Kristin L.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Alexander, Helen M.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Snow, Allison A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Mercer, KL (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, 202 Kottman Hall,2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",mercer.97@osu.edu,"Mercer, Kristin/K-2000-2012",,"University of Kansas Field Station, a research unit of the Kansas Biological Survey; University of Kansas; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [CSREES 2006-03681]","We thank K.

The dietary composition of this small shark species was compared to the prey communities within Hervey Bay to test whether prey availability was driving this observation. Dietary analysis of prey groups revealed that teleosts dominated the diet, per cent index of relative importance, % I(RI) (79.5%) and per cent geometric index of importance, % G(II) (52.7%), with shrimp-like invertebrates and cephalopods identified as the most important invertebrate prey groups. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) used to sample prey communities at each site, demonstrated a highly diverse and significantly different community composition among the sites. There was no significant overlap between the diet of L. macrorhinus and any of the prey communities detected by BRUVs according to one-way analysis of similarities and the simplified Morisita index. Habitat electivity analysis revealed affinity of L. macrorhinus for the site with the highest water clarity (Secchi disc depth), opposing that of three other shark species. Overall, the results suggest that the distribution of L. macrorhinus is not driven by prey availability but other factors such as water clarity, predator avoidance or a reduction in interspecies competition.

In animals, this process of specialization includes the behaviour of the organisms concerned, honed by locally-induced adaptations to specific host food plants (in herbivores) or prey items (in predators and parasitoids), and possibly reinforced by kairomones, including sex pheromones. The major thrust of evolution is towards ecological specialization as a result of the direct effects of intra- and interspecific competition. Adaptation to new resources lowers such competition and allows survival in new habitats/niches. Other benefits of food resource/habitat switching include 'enemy free space'. If specialism is the norm for the vast majority of species, what of so-called generalists and generalism, which are widely used terms, but perhaps wrongly so? Does generalism exist or is it a mirage that disappears the closer that it is inspected? We review some of the aspects of specialism and generalism and argue that even apparent generalists are filling distinct ecological niches. Often, generalists are rather specific in terms of food preferences, although they may nevertheless remain opportunistic with an overall broad niche/resource width. When apparent 'good' species are examined using molecular (DNA) markers, they are often found to comprise cryptic species. Many generalists may be of this kind. If so, generalism warrants additional investigation to establish its scope and credentials.

Woody species browsed, browsing heights, plant-parts browsed and browsing versus grazing were recorded over 2 y by direct observation. We obtained 3068 browse records. Niche breadth (Levins' measure) and overlap (Schoener's index) in species browsed and browsing heights were calculated. Annual and seasonal differences in these measurements, plant-part use and browsing versus grazing were assessed. Elephant utilized the largest number (n = 78) of different woody plant species. Overlap in species browsed was lower between elephant and other browsers than amongst the latter. Seasonal rainfall influenced the range of woody plants utilized, niche breadth in terms of species browsed and browsing versus grazing. Marked resource depletion caused elephant, contrary to theoretical predictions, to narrow niche breadth in terms of species browsed. However, resource depletion rarely had a significant effect on interspecific overlap in species browsed or overlap in browsing heights, on actual browsing heights or plant-parts utilized. A small suite (n = 8) of woody species formed the core diet of all guild members, implying the potential for synergistic impacts by guild members on these species and for competition between populations of different guild members.","[O'Kane, Christopher A.

Specificity may be expected, as carrion-frequenting flies often exploit different niches, which has been interpreted as avoidance of interspecific competition. Interactions between the orchid Satyrium pumilum and a local assemblage of carrion flies were investigated, and the functional significance of floral traits, especially scent, tested. Pollination success and the incidence of pollinator-mediated self-pollination were measured and these were compared with values for orchids with sexual- and food-deceptive pollination systems. Methods and Key Results Observations of insect visitation to animal carcasses and to flowers showed that the local assemblage of carrion flies was dominated by blow flies (Calliphoridae), house flies (Muscidae) and flesh flies (Sarcophagidae), but flowers of the orchid were pollinated exclusively by flesh flies, with a strong bias towards females that sometimes deposited live larvae on flowers. A trend towards similar partitioning of fly taxa was found in an experiment that tested the effect of large versus small carrion quantities on fly attraction. GC-MS analysis showed that floral scent is dominated by oligosulfides, 2-heptanone, p-cresol and indole, compounds that also dominate carrion scent. Flesh flies did not distinguish between floral and carrion scent in a choice experiment using olfactory cues only, which also showed that scent alone is responsible for fly attraction. Pollination success was relatively high (31.5% of flowers), but tracking of stained pollinia also revealed that a relatively high percentage (46 %) of pollen deposited on stigmas originates from the same plant. Conclusions Satyrium pumilum selectively attracts flesh flies, probably because its relatively weak scent resembles that of the small carrion on which these flies predominate. In this way, the plants exploit a specific subset of the insect assemblage associated with carrion. Pollination rates and levels of self-pollination were high compared with those in other deceptive orchids and it is therefore unlikely that this mimicry system evolved to promote outcrossing.","[van der Niet, Timotheues; Hansen, Dennis M.; Johnson, Steven D.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","van der Niet, T (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, P Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",vdniet@gmail.com,"Johnson, Steven/P-2104-2019; van der Niet, Timotheus/B-8660-2019; Hansen, Dennis/A-3307-2008","Johnson, Steven/0000-0002-5114-5862; van der Niet, Timotheus/0000-0002-5250-8995; Hansen, Dennis/0000-0002-9584-2766",,,,78,61,63,0,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

The dynamic relationship between interspecies competition and species-specific tolerances to abiotic factors, such as temperature and salinity, appears to have facilitated the success but has also imposed limits on the spread of this biological invasion. Here, we review the literature and present new data that document physiological differences between M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. In all comparisons, M. galloprovincialis is more warm-adapted than M. trossulus. Higher activities of enzymes involved in ATP generation show that the native M. trossulus is better adapted to colder conditions than M. galloprovincialis. Higher metabolic capacity (temperature compensation) in the native species may, however, lead to higher metabolic costs at sites where the two species co-occur. In addition, M. trossulus has a lower thermal tolerance of cardiac function and substrate binding by enzymes than M. galloprovincialis. The higher thermal tolerance of the invasive species is likely due in part to its enhanced ability to induce changes in the expression of particular genes and proteins in response to acute heat stress. Taken together, these data predict that M. galloprovincialis will continue to be the dominant blue mussel species along the warmer range of the California Current. Because the northern biogeographic limit of M. galloprovincialis is not stable, but rather shifts to lower or higher latitudes in concert with oceanographic variability, it is important to further characterize the physiological constraints of M. galloprovincialis, related to its sensitivity to cold temperatures and low salinities.

Montane Neotropical hummingbirds are expected to shift altitudinally upwards in response to climate change to track their ancestral climatic regime, which is predicted to influence their flight performance. In this study, we use the climate envelope approach to estimate upward elevational shifts for five Andean hummingbird species under two climate change scenarios. We then use field-based data on hummingbird flight mechanics to estimate the resulting impact of climate change on aerodynamic performance in hovering flight. Our results show that in addition to significant habitat loss and fragmentation, projected upwards elevational shifts vary between 300 and 700 m, depending on climate change scenario and original mean elevation of the target species. Biomechanical analysis indicates that such upwards elevational shifts would yield a similar to 2-5 degrees increase in wing stroke amplitude with no substantial effect on wingbeat frequency. Overall, the physiological impact of elevational shifts of < 1000 m in response to climate change is likely to be small relative to other factors such as habitat loss, changes in floristic composition, and increased interspecific competition.","[Buermann, Wolfgang; Chaves, Jaime A.; Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Chaves, Jaime A.; Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dudley, Robert; McGuire, Jimmy A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dudley, Robert] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [McGuire, Jimmy A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Altshuler, Douglas L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Altshuler, DL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",douga@ucr.edu,"Altshuler, Douglas L./E-5786-2011; McGuire, Jimmy/N-7357-2019","Altshuler, Douglas L./0000-0002-1364-3617; Chaves, Jaime/0000-0003-0679-2603","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0543556, IOS 0923849]","We thank Chris Barber, Richard Gibbons, Wily Palomino, Marianne van Vlaardingen, Patiacolla Tours, and the many Earthcorps volunteers for assistance and support in the field, and also thank Peter Baik, Jeremy Goldbogen, and Sylvia Heredia for help with data acquisition and analysis.

To analyze the life cycle of these two species, I used the horizontal life-table method and considered the number and proportion of viable of eggs per oviposition. Although both species suffered a high degree of mortality during the first weeks after oviposition, both the rate and the force of mortality was much greater during the reproductive period, so that the survival curve was not as markedly concave as with other gastropods. Physa acuta survived longer than S. marmorata, began its reproductive period earlier, and had a longer and more continuous reproductive stage. The number of ovipositions per snail was not different between the two species; but since the mean number of eggs per oviposition was higher in P. acuta, fecundity was likewise higher. The increase in fecundity was accompanied by an enhancement of the mortality rate in S. marmorata. The percentage of viable eggs was higher in P. acuta than in S. marmorata, but fecundity increased with age in both species. Life expectancy, reproductive value, and net reproductive rate were higher in P. acuta. The success of the exotic species P. acuta in the native habitat of S. marmorata could be explained in part by the former's earlier sexual maturation, higher reproductive potential, and greater longevity. Further field and laboratory studies are needed to demonstrate the existence of interspecific competition between these two gastropods.","Univ Nacl La Plata, Div Zool Invertebrados, Museo La Plata, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina","Nunez, V (corresponding author), Univ Nacl La Plata, Div Zool Invertebrados, Museo La Plata, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, Paseo Bosque S-N, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina.",nmariaveronik@yahoo.com.ar,,,,,,19,5,6,0,6,"AMER MALACOLOGICAL SOC, INC",WILMINGTON,"DELAWARE MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, BOX 3937, WILMINGTON, DE 19807-0937 USA",0740-2783,2162-2698,,AM MALACOL BULL,Am.

I conducted a series of enclosure experiments to: (1) determine if salamanders use earthworm burrows, and (2) examine the potential influence of earthworm burrow use and indirect effects on salamander intra- and interspecific competition, predator avoidance, and seasonal performance. I found that one species of woodland salamander, Plethodon cinereus, used earthworm burrows 50% of the time when burrows were present. Neither adults nor juveniles of the congeneric P. glutinosus used earthworm burrows. Intraspecific, but not interspecific, competition by P. cinereus affected salamander behavior when earthworms were absent, with P. cinereus found under cover objects > 70% of the time when alone or with a P. glutinosus, but only 40% of the time when with another P. cinereus. When earthworms were present, the behavior of P. cinereus was similar across salamander treatments. Earthworms decreased the amount of leaf litter and microinvertebrates, although this did not affect salamander mass. In subsequent experiments using only P. cinereus, the refuge provided by earthworm burrows increased the survival of P. cinereus over the winter and allowed P. cinereus to avoid being consumed by the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis). Because earthworm burrows provide a refuge for P. cinereus during intraspecific encounters, in the presence of a predator and over the winter, they may serve as an important belowground-aboveground linkage in eastern forests where salamanders are common.","Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Ransom, TS (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",tsr6a@virginia.edu,,,MLBS Station; Runk Fellowship,"I thank H.

Ecological theory predicts that co-occurring species may be: randomly selected from a regional pool; ecologically sorted so that they are functionally different hence resulting in reduced competition (overdispersion); or functionally similar as an adaptation to specific ecological conditions (clustering). Location Braulio Carrillo National Park and Cerro de la Muerte, Costa Rica, Central America. Methods We used an empirical dataset of the quantitative pattern of species occurrences and individual numbers of ferns within 156 plots along a tropical elevational gradient to test whether directed ecological sorting might cause deviations in patterns of trait and phylogenetic diversity. Mean pairwise distances of species based on phylogenetic and trait properties were compared with two different sets of null assemblages, one maintaining species frequency distributions (constrained) and one not (unconstrained). Results Applying different null models resulted in varying degrees of overdispersion and clustering, but overall patterns of deviation from random expectations remained the same. Contrary to theoretical predictions, phylogenetic and trait diversity were relatively independent from one another. Phylogenetic diversity showed no patterns along the elevational gradient, whereas trait diversity showed significant trends for epiphytes. Main conclusions Under stressful environmental conditions (drought at low elevations and frost at high elevations), epiphytic fern assemblages tended to be clustered with respect to trait characteristics, which suggests environmental filtering. Conversely, under less extreme environmental conditions (middle of the transect), the sorting was biased towards high differentiation (overdispersion), presumably because of interspecific competition and trait shifts among closely related species (character displacement).","[Kluge, Juergen] Univ Marburg, Fac Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Kluge, Juergen; Kessler, Michael] Univ Zurich, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland","Kluge, J (corresponding author), Univ Marburg, Fac Geog, Deutschhausstr 10, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",klugejuergen@gmx.de,"Kessler, Michael/A-3605-2009; Kluge, Jurgen/D-6200-2011",,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"This study was supported financially by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD).

The present study determined the daily and seasonal foraging patterns, the spatial distribution, the feeding sources and the associations with honeydew-producing Hemiptera of three ant species that forage in citrus canopies. The dominant ants Pheidole pallidula (Nylander) (Myrmicinae) and Lasius grandis Forel (Formicinae) foraged in mutually exclusive territories within the field, although they both shared their territory with the subordinate Plagiolepis schmitzii Forel (Formicinae), a distribution pattern known as 'ant mosaic'. The observed mean overlap for the spatial distribution was significantly lower than the generated by null models, providing strong evidence of spatial interspecific competition, especially between the two dominants. Ants ascended to the canopies from April until November. Colony nutritional requirements and temperature probably shape their seasonal foraging patterns. The daily activity pattern of P. schmitzii was strictly diurnal, whereas L. grandis and P. pallidula were active during the entire day. The ants' diet in the canopies consisted principally of hemipteran honeydew, whereas citrus nectar and predation/scavenging did not represent important food sources. More than 60% of the total honeydew sources and 100% of the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri colonies were tended by ants during spring and summer.","[Pekas, Apostolos; Tena, Alejandro; Aguilar, Amparo; Garcia-Mari, Ferran] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Valencia 46022, Spain","Garcia-Mari, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Cami Vera 14, Valencia 46022, Spain.",fgarciam@eaf.upv.es,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Garcia-Mari, Ferran/K-6982-2012; Pekas, Apostolos/J-8823-2017","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Garcia-Mari, Ferran/0000-0001-5798-1805; Pekas, Apostolos/0000-0002-8209-3882",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of SpainSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [AGL2005-07155-C03-03],We are very grateful to N.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the future re-colonisation of such acidified systems, taking as case-study a tropical pond (Lagoa das Dunas, Camacari, BA, Brazil) and four species of cladocerans occurring in nearby water bodies (Ceriodaphnia cornuta, Ceriodaphnia silvestrii, Latonopsis australis and Macrothrix elegans), by comparing the two above mentioned approaches. The second approach included two sets of in situ microcosms experiments, one simulating the re-colonisation by immigrating ephippia, thus using neonates of each species as colonisers, and another simulating the immigration of adults. Both these simulations followed nearly the same trends. The integration of the effects of a higher temperature, a different photoperiod and species competition determined differences in the species densities ranking between the two approaches: life history versus microcosms. The densities of C. cornuta in the microcosms matched the biphasic concentration/response hormetic model, in the simultaneous presence of two increasingly intense stressors (interspecific competition and acidity), with a low-dose stimulation and a high-dose inhibition. The present study provided, thus, a further support to the acceptance of hormesis in ecotoxicology, also at the population level in multispecies experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The reserves each contained multiple vegetation types (coastal sage scrub, chaparral, woodland, and grassland) and spanned from 250 m to 1078 m in elevation. Multivariate analyses revealed a more simplified rodent community structure in all burned habitats in comparison to unburned habitats. Reduction in shrub and tree cover was highly predictive of changes in post-fire rodent community structure in the burned coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. Reduction in cover was not predictive for the less substantially burned woodlands and grasslands, for which we hypothesized that interspecific competition played a greater role in post-fire community structure. Across vegetation types, generalists and open habitat specialists typically increased in relative abundance, whereas closed habitat specialists decreased. We documented significant increases in relative abundance of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus Wagner) and Dulzura kangaroo rat (Dipodomys simulans Merriam). In contrast, we found significant decreases in relative abundance for the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus Gambel), San Diego pocket mouse (Chaetodipus fallax Merriam), desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida Thomas), and brush mouse (Peromyscus boylii Baird). Currently, our research program involves assessment of whether habitat conservation plans (HCPs) in southern California provide long-term protection to HCP covered species, as well as preserve ecosystem function. The scenario of increased wildfires needs to be incorporated into this assessment.

An important structural property of animal communities is the distribution of individual home ranges. Home range formation is controlled by resource heterogeneity, the physiology and behaviour of individual animals, and their intra- and interspecific interactions. However, a quantitative mechanistic understanding of how home range formation influences community composition is still lacking. To explore the link between home range formation and community composition in heterogeneous landscapes we combine allometric relationships for physiological properties with an algorithm that selects optimal home ranges given locomotion costs, resource depletion and competition in a spatially-explicit individual-based modelling framework. From a spatial distribution of resources and an input distribution of animal body mass, our model predicts the size and location of individual home ranges as well as the individual size distribution (ISD) in an animal community. For a broad range of body mass input distributions, including empirical body mass distributions of North American and Australian mammals, our model predictions agree with independent data on the body mass scaling of home range size and individual abundance in terrestrial mammals. Model predictions are also robust against variation in habitat productivity and landscape heterogeneity. The combination of allometric relationships for locomotion costs and resource needs with resource competition in an optimal foraging framework enables us to scale from individual properties to the structure of animal communities in heterogeneous landscapes. The proposed spatially-explicit modelling concept not only allows for detailed investigation of landscape effects on animal communities, but also provides novel insights into the mechanisms by which resource competition in space shapes animal communities.","[Buchmann, Carsten M.; Schurr, Frank M.; Jeltsch, Florian] Univ Potsdam, Dept Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Inst Biochem & Biol, DE-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Nathan, Ran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Movement Ecol Lab, Dept Evolut Systemat & Ecol, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Buchmann, CM (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Inst Biochem & Biol, Maulbeerallee 2, DE-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",buchmann@uni-potsdam.de,"Schurr, Frank M./O-6575-2016; Nathan, Ran/A-9380-2008","Schurr, Frank M./0000-0002-4518-0602; Jeltsch, Florian/0000-0002-4670-6469; Buchmann, Carsten/0000-0002-9926-051X",Graduate Initiative on Ecological Modelling of the Univ. of Potsdam; European UnionEuropean Commission [MTKD-CT-2006-042261]; Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [ISF-FIRST 1316/05]; US-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF 124/2004]; Inst. for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem,"We thank J.

Although the basic causes are clearing, fragmentation and degradation of these woodlands, several ecological processes are involved. These include: difficulties in dispersing among remnants, interspecific competition, increased nest predation, and decline in key resources, including food. Many bird species declined during the recent long drought in south-eastern Australia. Research over the last decade has strongly emphasised effects at the landscape level. It is now clear that more native vegetation in the landscape leads to more bird species. There is stronger evidence that aggressive and nest-predatory birds contribute to the decline of many woodland birds. Several studies have linked the presence of individual bird species to key habitat features, such as high or low density of trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris. The main priorities for the conservation of woodland birds to reverse these declines are: (1) detailed studies on the population dynamics of a variety of declining woodland birds under different management regimes; (2) experiments that closely monitor the response of woodland birds to manipulation of competitors, predators and habitat features; and (3) broad-scale implementation of management based on science to aim to reverse the fortunes of woodland birds on regional and national scales.","Univ New England, Zool & Res Ctr Behav & Physiol Ecol, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia","Ford, HA (corresponding author), Univ New England, Zool & Res Ctr Behav & Physiol Ecol, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",hford@une.edu.au,,,,,,92,70,89,0,45,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0158-4197,1448-5540,,EMU,Emu,,2011,111,1,,,,,1,9,,10.1071/MU09115,,,9,Ornithology,Zoology,723TI,WOS:000287529500002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Individual populations evolved distinct life history characteristics in response to the diverse environments in which they were isolated after the last glaciation. Anthropogenic activities have resulted in a substantial decline (42% of the historical range is currently occupied; 28% is occupied by core [genetically unaltered] populations), but the number of extant populations, especially in headwater streams, has precluded listing of this taxon under the Endangered Species Act. Primary threats to persistence of Yellowstone cutthroat trout include (1) invasive species, resulting in hybridization, predation, disease, and interspecific competition; (2) habitat degradation from human activities such as agricultural practices, water diversions, grazing, dam construction, mineral extraction, grazing, timber harvest, and road construction; and (3) climate change, including an escalating risk of drought, wildfire, winter flooding, and rising temperatures. Extirpation of individual populations or assemblages has led to increasing isolation and fragmentation of remaining groups, which in turn raises susceptibility to the demographic influences of disturbance (both human and stochastic) and genetic factors. Primary conservation strategies include (1) preventing risks associated with invasive species by isolating populations of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and (2) connecting occupied habitats (where possible) to preserve metapopulation function and the expression of multiple life histories. Because persistence of isolated populations may be greater in the short term, current management is focused on isolating individual populations and restoring habitats; however, this approach implies that humans will act as dispersal agents if a population is extirpated because of stochastic events.","US Geol Survey, No Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA","Gresswell, RE (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, No Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, 2327 Univ Way,Suite 2, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA.",bgresswell@usgs.gov,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Gresswell, Robert E./ABH-8944-2020","Gresswell, Robert/0000-0003-0063-855X",,,,239,58,58,2,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0275-5947,1548-8675,,N AM J FISH MANAGE,North Am.

Observations on gut content data revealed a variety of feeding habits, with some potential diet overlap between European whitefish (Coregonous lavaretus), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) during the winter and spring. However, food resources seemed to be partitioned among the Lake Annecy fish community during summer growth period, possibly limiting competitive interactions. Ten years of SIA data were used to evaluate food web dynamics. Values of 15N indicated very low interspecies variability, whereas 13C revealed the differences between fish species; pelagic species were 13C depleted, while littoral species were 13C enriched. The results demonstrated that Arctic char have a separate sustainable dietary niche and lower predation mortality. Stocking Arctic char to enhance populations might not have an impact on other fish populations. We found that the natural dietary variability can be misinterpreted when using GCA only. Our findings highlight the importance of combining both GCA and SIA to explore the trophic relationships between predators and prey, especially in Lake Annecy having spatial and seasonal variations in prey isotopic signatures. Results from these studies on food web dynamics could have implications in fisheries management decisions and development of trophic models.","[Janjua, Muhammad Yamin; Gerdeaux, Daniel] INRA Stn Hydrobiol Lacustre, F-74203 Thonon Les Bains, France","Janjua, MY (corresponding author), INRA Stn Hydrobiol Lacustre, 75 Ave Corzent,BP 511, F-74203 Thonon Les Bains, France.",yaminjanjua@hotmail.com,,,Syndicat Mixte du Lac d'Annecy (SILA); l'Association des Pecheurs Professionnels du Lac d'Annecy; Office National de l'Eau et des Milieux Aquatiques (ONEMA),"We are grateful to the Syndicat Mixte du Lac d'Annecy (SILA), l'Association des Pecheurs Professionnels du Lac d'Annecy, especially Mr. Bernard Curt, the Office National de l'Eau et des Milieux Aquatiques (ONEMA), and to l'Association Annecy Lac Peche (ALP) for providing funding and helping to collect samples from 1998 to 2008.",,63,9,9,1,59,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1040-2381,2151-5530,,LAKE RESERV MANAGE,Lake Reserv.

With respect to these goals, however, community ecology, in general, and ectomycorrhizal fungal community ecology, in particular, have been rather disappointing. Discussion Indeed, some feel that community ecology is, at best, an esoteric discipline and, at worst, an inane one. But there is hope. As we apply what has been learned about other organisms concerning the relationships between functional traits and success (abundance), it may be possible to elucidate general principles that govern much of the structuring of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. Conclusion A hierarchical model of ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure is presented that involves abiotic filtering of immigrant propagules based on functional traits, followed by interspecific competition as ameliorated by disturbance and habitat partitioning, the outcomes of which are dependent on functional traits.","[Koide, Roger T.; Fernandez, Christopher; Petprakob, Krittika] Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Koide, Roger T.; Fernandez, Christopher; Petprakob, Krittika] Penn State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Koide, RT (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",rxk13@psu.edu,"Koide, Roger/AAE-7763-2020; Fernandez, Christopher/B-7608-2013; Koide, Roger T/I-4033-2012","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422; Koide, Roger T/0000-0002-5209-5422; Fernandez, Christopher/0000-0002-6310-6027",,,,91,42,47,1,73,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Site-specific potentially affected fractions (PAFs) of the regional fish species pool were derived using species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for water temperature. The number of fish species in the river distributaries has changed remarkably over the last century. The number of native rheophilous species declined up until 1980 due to anthropogenic disturbances such as commercial fishing, river regulation, migration barriers, habitat deterioration and water pollution. In spite of progress in river rehabilitation, the native rheophilous fish fauna has only partially recovered thus far. The total number of species has strongly increased due to the appearance of more exotic species. After the opening of the Rhine-Main-Danube waterway in 1992, many fish species originating from the Ponto-Caspian area colonized the Rhine basin. The yearly minimum and maximum river temperatures at Lobith have increased by circa 4 degrees C over the period 1908-2010. Exotic species show lower PAFs than native species at both ends of the temperature range. The interspecific variation in the temperature tolerance of exotic fish species was found to be large. Using temporal trends in river temperature allowed past predictions of PAFs to demonstrate that the increase in maximum river temperature negatively affected a higher percentage of native fish species than exotic species. Our results support the hypothesis that alterations of the river Rhine's temperature regime caused by thermal pollution and global warming limit the full recovery of native fish fauna and facilitate the establishment of exotic species which thereby increases competition between native and exotic species. Thermal refuges are important for the survival of native fish species under extreme summer or winter temperature conditions [Current Zoology 57 (6): 852-862, 2011].","[Leuven, R. S. E.

Isotopic signatures indicate food partitioning among the 5 species of cave-dwelling mysids from the northwest Mediterranean Sea we studied. Hemimysis speluncola feeds mainly on phytoplankton and zooplankton from outside the caves, Siriella gracilipes on sedimentary organic matter and zooplankton from outside, Harmelinella mariannae on small cave-dwelling crustaceans, and Hemimysis margalefi and Hemimysis lamornae mediterranea on sedimentary particulate organic matter. These differences in diet could promote coexistence of such diverse and abundant mysid faunas in marine caves by reducing interspecific competition for scarce resources. The analysis of both seston and cave sediments revealed that the quantity and quality of organic matter are strongly reduced in marine caves, suggesting that cave-dwelling mysids find most of their food elsewhere. This inference agrees with documented distributions of some of these mysids outside of caves at night where they can feed in the rich littoral zone. These migrations of some species make cave-dwelling mysids important vectors of organic matter transfer from the outside euphotic littoral zone to various locations inside caves. Outside organic matter is then made available to other cave dwellers through mysid fecal pellet production and predation, as suggested by the isotopic compositions of predators like teleost fishes, decapod crustaceans, and carnivorous cladorhizid sponges.","[Rastorgueff, Pierre-Alexandre; Harmelin-Vivien, Mireille; Chevaldonne, Pierre] Univ Mediterranee, DIMAR, CNRS, Ctr Oceanol Marseille,Stn Marine Endoume,UMR 6540, F-13007 Marseille, France; [Richard, Pierre] Univ La Rochelle, LIENSs, CNRS, UMR 6250, F-17000 La Rochelle, France","Rastorgueff, PA (corresponding author), Univ Mediterranee, DIMAR, CNRS, Ctr Oceanol Marseille,Stn Marine Endoume,UMR 6540, Rue Batterie Lions, F-13007 Marseille, France.",pierre-alexandre.rastorgueff@univmed.fr,"Richard, Pierre J/N-6482-2014","Richard, Pierre J/0000-0002-0393-9967",,,,58,21,21,1,14,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

This tissue comprises thin cortical surface biopsies that contain predominantly primordial follicles, and currently the only option to restore fertility is by transplantation. However, this is not a viable option for all patients. The potential of this tissue could be realized by the development of in vitro systems to support complete growth from the early primordial stages through to maturity. This technology would have many therapeutic applications including the production of competent oocytes for assisted reproduction technologies, determination of toxicological effects on germ cell development, assessment of cryopreserved ovarian tissue before transplantation for fertility preservation as well as providing an experimental model to address basic scientific questions concerning human oocyte development. Complete oocyte development in vitro from the primordial stage has been achieved in mice, but the larger size and longer growth period of human follicles has made the interspecies translation of these techniques difficult. Recently progress has been made in defining conditions that support different stages of follicle development in vitro that make a complete in vitro system from primordial to maturation a possible reality. This article deals with our current understanding of in vitro development.","[Telfer, Evelyn E.; McLaughlin, Marie] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Integrat Physiol, Edinburgh EH8 9XD, Midlothian, Scotland","Telfer, EE (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Integrat Physiol, Hugh Robson Bldg, Edinburgh EH8 9XD, Midlothian, Scotland.",evelyn.telfer@ed.ac.uk,,"Telfer, Evelyn/0000-0003-1468-4610",Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G0901839] Funding Source: Medline,,,91,67,71,0,7,THIEME MEDICAL PUBL INC,NEW YORK,"333 SEVENTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10001 USA",1526-8004,1526-4564,,SEMIN REPROD MED,Semin.

Here, we appraise interannual variation between 2 sympatric planarians (Crenobia alpina and Phagocata vitta) in upland Welsh streams over 25 y during which 1 of this pair (C. alpina) disappeared. We tested 3 nonexclusive hypotheses involving: 1) long-term changes in stream chemistry, 2) interspecific competition, and 3) climatic variation or directional change to explain this apparent local extinction. Several lines of evidence revealed potential exploitation competition between C. alpina and P. vitta. Coexistence was confined to conditions with high prey abundance (recorded as the abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and summer temperatures <12.5 degrees C, whereas P. vitta dominated at sites with higher temperature, greater discharge, and lower prey abundance. The loss of C. alpina in the Llyn Brianne experimental catchments coincided with the largest-ever positive amplification of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in 1989 to 1994, accompanied by increased stream temperature, increased winter discharge, 2 summer droughts, and markedly reduced prey abundance. We suggest that interspecific competition and this prolonged climatic event acted in concert to favor P. vitta over C. alpina. Since its local loss, summer stream temperatures have generally exceeded the favorable range for C. alpina and, coupled with weak dispersal ability, probably explain its continued absence. Our data are consistent with the prediction that extreme climatic events will affect small, fluctuating populations. Nevertheless, this case study demonstrates clear difficulties in identifying unequivocally the exact climatic processes causing extinction where: 1) evidence is confined to weak inference, 2) responses to complex climatic events are nonlinear, 3) interactions occur among species or between climate and ecological processes, and 4) assessments are made retrospectively following extinctions.","[Durance, Isabelle; Ormerod, S.

Quantitative analysis of body size data from Permian-Triassic brachiopods has demonstrated significant, directional changes in body size before, during and after the Late Permian mass extinction event. Brachiopod size significantly reduced before and during the extinction interval, increased for a short time in more extinction-resistant taxa in the latter stages of extinction and then dramatically reduced again across the Permian/Triassic boundary. Relative abundances of trace elements and acritarchs demonstrate that the body size reductions which happened before, during and after extinction were driven by primary productivity collapse, whereas declining oxygen levels had less effect. An episode of size increase in two of the more extinction-resistant brachiopod species is unrelated to environmental change and possibly was the result of reduced interspecific competition for resources following the extinction of competitors. Based on the results of this study, predictions can be made for the possible responses of modern benthos to present-day environmental changes.","[He, W. -H.; Zhang, Y.; Feng, Q. -L.; Yu, J. -X.; Wu, S. -B.; Peng, X. -F.] China Univ Geosci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Twitchett, R.

In particular, we aim to determine whether there are clear intervals of homogenization/differentiation and to ascertain the potential driving factors. Location Romania. Methods Qualitative (pollen diagrams) and numerical methods including principal components analysis and Bray-Curtis similarity analyses were used. Results We found strong variability in the past vegetation dynamics during the Holocene. Bray-Curtis similarity analyses show large fluctuations in vegetation similarity and distinct periods of homogenization and differentiation throughout the Holocene. The magnitude and length of these periods appear quite variable in time, but the significant ones can be delimited as follows: (1) differentiation between 11,250 and 11,000 cal. yr bp, 10,000 and 9750 cal. yr bp, 6000 and 5750 cal. yr bp, 2500 and 2250 cal. yr bp, and especially over the last 200 years; and (2) homogenization between 9750 and 9500 cal. yr bp, and 2750 and 2500 cal. yr bp, with more stable periods between 9000 and 7750 cal. yr bp, 4750 and 3500 cal. yr bp, and 2000 and 1000 cal. yr bp. Main conclusions First, periods of biotic homogenization that occurred before significant anthropogenic impact on vegetation demonstrate that not all homogenization is a product of anthropogenic change: it can also be driven by natural causes. In fact, recent human impact (over the last 200 years) appears to have resulted in increased regional differentiation and not in homogenization - a result that contradicts most studies based on more modern, short-term records. Second, both abiotic (climate and disturbance) and biotic factors are likely drivers of intervals of differentiation and homogenization. We suggest that differentiation may be triggered primarily by climate changes and disturbances (mostly natural pre-2500 cal. yr bp and human-induced thereafter), whereas homogenization may be driven predominantly by biotic interactions (e.g. immigration and interspecific competition). Third, this long-term study raises awareness that assessments of pattern in vegetation homogenization/differentiation may depend on the specific time period and length of investigation. Long-term investigations through multiple generations are likely to yield particularly useful information on the mechanisms and effects of biotic homogenization.","[Feurdean, Angelica; Willis, Katherine J.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Longterm Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Willis, Katherine J.] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Parr, Catherine L.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Tantau, Ioan] Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Geol, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Farcas, Sorina] Inst Biol Res, Cluj Napoca 400015, Romania","Feurdean, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Longterm Ecol Lab, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",angelica.feurdean@gmail.com,"Farcas, Sorina/D-9699-2016; Tantau, Ioan/B-8788-2011; Parr, Catherine L/G-2831-2011","Tantau, Ioan/0000-0002-7197-916X; Willis, Katherine/0000-0002-6763-2489; Parr, Catherine/0000-0003-1627-763X; Feurdean, Angelica/0000-0002-2497-3005",EUEuropean Commission [MEIF-2006-024296]; Oxford University; Trapnell Fund; I.T.; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G010730/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"A.F. and K.J.W. acknowledge a Marie Curie EU grant (MEIF-2006-024296) and the Fell Fund, Oxford University, for financial support while carrying out this work.

Population changes in the constituent organisms were observed over 160 days after irradiation. Prokaryotic community structure was also examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 165 rDNA. Principle response curve analysis revealed that the populations of the microcosm as a whole were not significantly affected at 100 Gy while they were adversely affected at 500-5000 Gy in a dose-dependent manner. However, some effects on each population, including each bacterial population detected by DGGE, did not depend on radiation doses, and some populations in the irradiated microcosm were larger than those of the control. These unexpected results are regarded as indirect effects through interspecies interactions, and possible mechanisms are proposed originating from population changes in other organisms co-existing in the microcosm. For example, some indirect effects on consumers and decomposers likely arose from interspecies competition within each trophic level. It is also likely that prey predator relationships between producers and consumers caused some indirect effects on producers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The diets of 2064 ling and 913 hake from Chatham Rise, New Zealand, were determined from examination of stomach contents. Ling was a benthic generalist, and hake a demersal piscivore. The diet of ling was characterised by benthic crustaceans, mainly Munida gracilis and Metanephrops challengeri, and demersal fishes, mainly Macrourids and scavenged offal from fishing vessels. The diet of hake was characterised by teleost fishes, mainly macrourids and merlucciids. Multivariate analyses using distance-based linear models found the most important predictors of diet variability were depth, fish length, and vessel type (whether the sample was collected from a commercial or research vessel) for ling, and fish length and vessel type for hake. There was no interspecific predation between ling and hake, and resource competition was largely restricted to macrourid prey, although the dominant macrourid species predated by ling and hake were different. Cluster analysis of average diet of intraspecific groups of ling and hake confirmed the persistent diet separation. Although size is a central factor in determining ecological processes, similar sized ling and hake had distinctly different foraging ecology, and therefore could influence the ecosystem in different ways, and be unequally affected by ecosystem fluctuations.","[Dunn, Matthew R.; Connell, Amelia M.; Forman, Jeff; Stevens, Darren W.; Horn, Peter L.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand","Dunn, MR (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand.",m.dunn@niwa.co.nz,,"Horn, Peter/0000-0003-4163-5064","New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries [ZBD2004-02, ENV2007-06]; New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [C01X0501]","This work was part-funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries (http://www.mfish.govt.nz) projects ZBD2004-02 and ENV2007-06, and the New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (http://www.frst.govt.nz/) project C01X0501 (Coasts & Oceans OBI, IO2).

However, community ecology studies have mainly focused on simple competition and predation systems, and the relative impact of positive interspecific interactions in shaping communities in a spatial context is not well understood. Here we employ a spatially explicit metacommunity model to investigate the effect of local dispersal on the structure and function of communities in which species are linked through an interaction web comprising mutualism, competition and exploitation. Our results show that function, diversity and interspecific interactions of locally linked communities undergo a phase transition with changes in the rate of species dispersal. We find that low spatial interconnectedness favors the spontaneous emergence of strongly mutualistic communities which are more stable but less productive and diverse. On the other hand, high spatial interconnectedness promotes local biodiversity at the expense of local stability and supports communities with a wide range of interspecific interactions. We argue that investigations of the relationship between spatial processes and the self-organization of complex interaction webs are critical to understanding the geographic structure of interactions in real landscapes.

Growth rate is a fundamental property of organisms. In trees, growth is indeterminate and varies in space and time depending on resource availability, genetic constraints, competition and stress from biotic and abiotic environmental factors. 2. The ratio between the abundance of RNA and DNA in the tissue has been used to indicate recent growth rates in many systems, but not for trees. We assessed the applicability of using RNA : DNA ratios for assessing intraspecific and interspecific differences in growth rates in two species of mangrove trees under field conditions. We manipulated growth by fertilizing mangrove trees over a period of 4 years and measured tree growth as increments in linear extension of tagged shoots. The C, N and P contents per unit biomass were measured to test the hypothesis that faster growing organisms require more P per unit biomass (the Growth Rate Hypothesis). 3. We found that interspecific differences in the RNA : DNA ratio clearly reflected the difference in shoot elongation rates between the species. Intraspecific differences in RNA : DNA were significantly correlated with growth rates only for Avicennia marina and not for Ceriops australis. C : N and C : P ratios were lower in trees with higher growth rates and exhibited a negative correlation with RNA : DNA ratios. 4. Our results indicate that RNA : DNA ratios can reliably predict interspecific differences in growth rates between the two mangrove species and that RNA : DNA ratios can be used as an indication of variation in growth rate for Avicennia marina. The interaction between C : N : P ratios, RNA : DNA ratios and growth rates supported the Growth Rate Hypothesis on an interspecific level, but not on an intraspecific level.","[Reef, Ruth; Lovelock, Catherine E.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Reef, Ruth; Lovelock, Catherine E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Ball, Marilyn C.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Feller, Ilka C.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Reef, R (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.reef@uq.edu.au,"Ball, Marilyn/D-1180-2009; Lovelock, Catherine E/G-7370-2012; Lovelock, Catherine E./AAF-7294-2020","Ball, Marilyn/0000-0001-9170-940X; Lovelock, Catherine E/0000-0002-2219-6855; Lovelock, Catherine E./0000-0002-2219-6855; Reef, Ruth/0000-0001-6639-520X; Feller, Ilka/0000-0002-6391-1608","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0774491, DP0986170]; Smithsonian Marine Science NetworkSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network","We thank N.

Fouling epifauna are generally believed to reduce the settlement of interspecific larvae through competitive exclusion and predation. Studies of these interactions, however, often utilize artificial settlement panels, which can exhibit different recruitment patterns to those observed on natural substrates. Native (Crassostrea virginica) and non-native (Crassostrea ariakensis) oyster larvae were exposed to reef-collected shells, each supporting a single species of reef-associated fauna, over a series of laboratory microcosm studies. The presence of adult bryozoans (Membranipora tenuis) had little effect on rates of larval settlement or mortality. The boring sponge (Cliona sp.) significantly decreased oyster larval settlement, and generally increased oyster mortality. Barnacles (Balanus improvisus) typically facilitated settlement. Barnacle molds and empty barnacle tests, intended to mimic the surface area and rugosity of live barnacles, did not significantly affect settlement. In some trials, adult barnacle bathwater enhanced settlement of oyster larvae, highlighting the importance of waterborne cues. Barnacle bathwaters, adult clam worm (Neanthes succinea) bathwaters and bathwaters created using adult oysters were all found to cause oyster larval mortality. Predation by clam worms, which were observed at very high densities on field-collected oyster shells, caused significant oyster larval mortality in these experiments. The combined effects of positive and negative interactions between oyster larvae and resident invertebrate reef fauna require enumeration under field conditions. The results from this study highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of settlement behavior and mortality sources of recruiting oyster larvae. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, removal of grazers has been predicted to disfavour small species. In addition to this indirect beneficial effect, the population dynamics of plants is strongly influenced by variation in external conditions such as temperature and precipitation. However, few studies have examined the interaction between large herbivores and inter-annual variation in climate for the population dynamics of small plant species not preferred by herbivores. We studied three populations of the perennial herb Viola biflora exposed to different sheep densities (high, low and zero) for 6 years in a field experiment. Plants were also impacted by invertebrate and small vertebrate herbivores (rodents). Rates of growth were marginally higher at high sheep densities, and during warm summers both survival and growth were higher when sheep were present. Thus, while the height of tall herbs was positively related to July temperature, it was less so in the treatments with sheep, suggesting that sheep reduce the negative effects of interspecific competition for this small herb. Life table response experiment analyses revealed that the population growth rate (lambda) was slightly lower in the absence of sheep, but between-year variation in lambda was larger than variation among sheep density treatments. lambda was negatively related to July temperature, with an additional negative effect of vertebrate grazing frequency (sheep or rodent grazing). The evidence from this 6-year study suggests that the population dynamics of Viola biflora is determined by a complex interplay between climate and grazing by both large and small herbivores.","[Evju, Marianne; Halvorsen, Rune] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Dept Bot, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Rydgren, Knut] Sogn Fjordane Univ Coll, Fac Sci, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway; [Austrheim, Gunnar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Museum Nat Hist & Archaeol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Mysterud, Atle] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Evju, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",marianne.evju@nina.no,"Mysterud, Atle/AAQ-2864-2020","Mysterud, Atle/0000-0001-8993-7382","Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [153601/432, 134361/720]","This study was funded by the Research Council of Norway (project 153601/432 and 134361/720).

Newly settled individuals were first observed in the end of May to early June and settlement lasted until mid-July. Densities peaked in early July and were comparable to those reported in temperate nursery grounds. Mortality estimates after settlement differed between 0.062 d(-1) in 2005 and 0.025 d(-1) in 2006. Potential predators appeared to be rather similar as those reported in other areas: the brown shrimp Crangon crangon, the shore crab Carcinus maenas and demersal fish species (gadoids). Population mean growth indicated linear growth until August leveling-off afterwards. 0-group plaice reached a lower mean size (5-6 cm) at the end of the growing season than in temperate areas probably due to later settlement timing in combination with lower summer-autumn water temperatures. The comparison of observed growth rates with predictions of maximum growth models indicated a similar pattern as observed in temperate nursery grounds: Growth appeared to be maximal except for the period after summer. Whether or not this was related to changes in food quality throughout the season, to interspecies competition or to emigration remains to be elucidated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Because interspecific competition is believed to be reduced on islands, such theories predict that insular animals should be closer to the optimal size than mainland animals. We test the resulting prediction that insular clade members should therefore have narrower body size ranges than their mainland relatives. Location World-wide. Methods We used body sizes and a phylogenetic tree of 4004 mammal species, including more than 200 species that went extinct since the last ice age. We tested, in a phylogenetically explicit framework, whether insular taxa converge on an optimal size and whether insular clades have narrow size ranges. Results We found no support for any of the predictions of the optimal size theory. No specific size serves as an evolutionary attractor. We did find consistent evidence that large (> 10 kg) mammals grow smaller on islands. Smaller species, however, show no consistent tendency to either dwarf or grow larger on islands. Size ranges of insular taxa are not narrower than expected by chance given the number of species in their clades, nor are they narrower than the size ranges of their mainland sister clades - despite insular clade members showing strong phylogenetic clustering. Main conclusions The concept of a single optimal body size is not supported by the data that were thought most likely to show it. We reject the notion that inclusive clades evolve towards a body-plan-specific optimum.","[Raia, Pasquale; Carotenuto, Francesco] Univ Naples Federico 2, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-80138 Naples, Italy; [Raia, Pasquale] Ctr Evolutionary Ecol, I-00146 Rome, Italy; [Meiri, Shai] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Raia, P (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico 2, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Largo San Marcellino 10, I-80138 Naples, Italy.",pasquale.raia@libero.it,"Raia, Pasquale/I-8632-2014; Raia, Pasquale/I-8600-2012; Meiri, Shai/D-2403-2010","Raia, Pasquale/0000-0002-4593-8006; Raia, Pasquale/0000-0002-4593-8006; Meiri, Shai/0000-0003-3839-6330; Carotenuto, Francesco/0000-0001-8343-723X",,,,50,39,41,1,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1466-822X,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Orconectes placidus and O. durelli are potential threats to O. shoupi through competitive or aggressive interactions. Understanding such interactions could help explain species distributions, provide insight on additional threats, and guide management decisions regarding Nashville Crayfish translocations. Aggressive interactions were examined with 30-min videotaped trials between body-size-matched hetero- and conspecific pairs. The predicted influence of chela size on outcomes of aggressive interactions was also analyzed. Our results demonstrated that O. shoupi males and females were significantly more aggressive than O. placidus. However, O. durelli females won more encounters and were slightly more aggressive than O. shoupi females. Significant differences in chela size were detected in some body-size-matched species and gender pairings: O. shoupi males had narrower chelae than O. durelli males; and O. shoupi females had longer and wider chelae than O. placidus females, and longer but narrower chelae than O. durelli females. Although chela size appeared to play a role in dominance, it was not the only factor influencing outcomes of aggressive interactions. Our laboratory results did not identify displacement threats to O. shoupi from O. placidus, and therefore do not preclude introduction of O. shoupi into habitat occupied by O. placidus to meet recovery plan objectives. However, interspecific aggression in the presence of a vital resource (e.g., food or shelter) was not tested here and should be investigated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of possible threats to O. shoupi.","[Bizwell, Emily A.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Atlanta, GA 30345 USA; [Mattingly, Hayden T.] Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Biol, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA","Bizwell, EA (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, 1875 Century Blvd,Suite 200, Atlanta, GA 30345 USA.",emily_bizwell@fws.gov,,,Tennessee Technological University (TTU); Department of Biology at TTU; US Fish and Wildlife Service Cookeville Field Office,"A Faculty Research Grant from Tennessee Technological University (TTU) supplied primary funding for this research.

Plants were grown in flooded soil for approximately 5 weeks, and then subjected to different drought periods after which pots were re-flooded. Chlorophyll fluorescence assays revealed that rice and S. mucronatus Fv/Fm first became <0.8 after leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)) had decreased to approximately -4 MPa and -2 MPa, respectively. Thus, by suffering less photosynthetic damage from drought, rice had better recovery after re-flooding than S. mucronatus. When drought reduced Psi(leaf) to -3 MPa, S. mucronatus re-growth was nearly suppressed but that of rice was unaffected. Rice plants depleted soil moisture 1.6 faster than S. mucronatus due to larger and deeper roots and a high water-spending strategy (when Psi(leaf) decreased from approximately -0.5 MPa to -2.5 MPa, (13)delta increased from -27.8 to -27.4 and from -28.1 to -26.0 for rice and S. mucronatus, respectively). Rice under interspecific competition sustained its Psi(leaf) by extracting more water from greater depths, while causing severe moisture stress and photosynthetic damage to S. mucronatus. Thus temporary drought enhanced rice competitiveness over S. mucronatus, supporting the concept of using brief drought as a tool for S. mucronatus suppression in rice. The Psi(leaf) developed by the end of the drought period predicted rice yields (R(2) = 0.77, P < 0.0001) and the capacity of S. mucronatus to recover from drought upon irrigation resumption (R(2) = 0.62, P < 0.001). Brief (8-10 d) drought imposed on 5-week-old rice did not significantly depress late-season rice biomass growth or grain yields, while S. mucronatus never fully recovered from drought. Rice yields were only reduced after Psi(leaf) reached values below approximately -2.5 MPa. Longer drought (similar to 20 d) delayed maturity and reduced rice yields by approximately 60-80%. The dry-down approach could help suppress weeds similar to S. mucronatus in organic rice where premium prices can compensate for lower grain yield. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Such intraspecific aggregation increases the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition which may slow down competitive exclusion and promote species coexistence. To examine how spatial aggregation impacts the functioning of experimental assemblages of varying species richness, eight perennial grassland species of different growth form were grown in random and aggregated patterns in monocultures, two-, four-, and eight-species mixtures. In mixtures with an aggregated pattern, monospecific clumps were interspecifically segregated. Mixed model ANOVA was used to test (i) how the total productivity and productivity of individual species is affected by the number of species in a mixture, and (ii) how these relationships are affected by spatial pattern of sown plants. The main patterns of productivity response to species richness conform to other studies: non-transgressive overyielding is omnipresent (the productivity of mixtures is higher than the average of its constituent species so that the net diversity, selection and complementarity effects are positive), whereas transgressive overyielding is found only in a minority of cases (average of log(overyielding) being close to zero or negative). The theoretical prediction that plants in a random pattern should produce more than in an aggregated pattern (the distances to neighbours are smaller and consequently the competition among neighbours stronger) was confirmed in monocultures of all the eight species. The situation is more complicated in mixtures, probably as a consequence of complicated interplay between interspecific and intraspecific competition. The most productive species (Achillea, Holcus, Plantago) were competitively superior and increased their relative productivity with mixture richness. The intraspecific competition of these species is stronger than that of most other species. The aggregated pattern in the full mixture increased the survival of subordinate species, and consequently, we conclude that an aggregated pattern can promote species coexistence (or at least postpone competitive exclusion), particularly in comparison with homogeneously sown mixtures.

Insular populations usually face different feeding conditions, predation pressure, intraspecific and interspecific competition than continental populations. This so-called island syndrome can promote the evolution of specific phenotypes like a small (or large) body size and a light (or dark) colouration as well as influence the evolution of sexual dimorphism. To examine whether insularity leads to phenotypic differentiation in a consistent way in a worldwide-distributed nonmigratory species, we compared body size, body shape and colouration between insular and continental barn owl (Tyto alba) populations by controlling indirectly for phylogeny. This species is suitable because it varies in pheomelanin-based colouration from reddish-brown to white, and it displays eumelanic black spots for which the number and size vary between individuals, populations and species. Females are on average darker pheomelanic and display more and larger eumelanic spots than males. Our results show that on islands barn owls exhibited smaller and fewer eumelanic spots and lighter pheomelanic colouration, and shorter wings than on continents. Sexual dimorphism in pheomelanin-based colouration was less pronounced on islands than continents (i.e. on islands males tended to be as pheomelanic as females), and on small islands owls were redder pheomelanic and smaller in size than owls living on larger islands. Sexual dimorphism in the size of eumelanic spots was more pronounced (i.e. females displayed much larger spots than males) in barn owls living on islands located further away from a continent. Our study indicates that insular conditions drive the evolution towards a lower degree of eumelanism, smaller body size and affects the evolution of sexual dichromatism in melanin-based colour traits. The effect of insularity was more pronounced on body size and shape than on melanic traits.","[Roulin, A.; Salamin, N.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Salamin, N.] Univ Lausanne, Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Roulin, A (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Alexandre.Roulin@unil.ch,,"Salamin, Nicolas/0000-0002-3963-4954","Swiss Academy of Sciences; American Natural History Museum in New York; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PPOOA-102913, 3100A0-116412]","We are grateful to the Swiss Academy of Sciences, the American Natural History Museum in New York and the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant n degrees PPOOA-102913 to A.

A positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship is one of the most robust patterns in macroecology. Yet, the mechanisms driving this pattern are poorly understood. Here, we use biological traits of freshwater macroinvertebrates to gain a mechanistic understanding and disentangle the various explanations. We ask whether mechanisms underlying the abundance-occupancy relationship differ between species, and whether information on individual species can be used to explain their contribution to the interspecific relationship. 2. We test the hypothesis that the importance of metapopulation dynamics or niche differences in explaining the relationship differs between species, varying in relation to their habitat breadth. In addition, we analyse how a species' biological traits shape its habitat breadth and its abundance and occupancy. 3. The abundance and occupancy of the 234 different aquatic macroinvertebrate species were strongly and positively related. Marked differences were found between habitat specialists and habitat generalists in the goodness-of-fit of abundance-occupancy relationships. The occupancy-frequency distribution was bimodal for habitat generalists, allowing 'satellite species' to be distinguished from 'core species'. 4. Habitat generalists appeared to be more widespread but less abundant than habitat specialists, suggesting that the jack-of-all-trades may be master-of-none. Species traits (trophic position and other life-history traits) explained a significant part of the variation around the general relationship. Among habitat specialists, more species showed synchronized life cycles, a low dispersal capacity or clustered oviposition, being better adapted to predictable habitats. Among habitat generalists, more species had long-lived adults, spreading reproductive effort in time and space, and were strong dispersers, being better adapted to unpredictable habitats. 5. Interspecific abundance-occupancy relationships can be best understood by examining the contribution of individual species. For habitat specialists, the interplay between niche differences (diet and habitat use) and the underlying spatial distribution of environmental conditions result in competitive displacement and differences in species' success. For habitat generalists, differences in colonization and extinction rates between species are more important. Therefore, both metapopulation dynamics and niche differences can operate simultaneously but apply to different species, thus constituting different endpoints of the same continuum.","[Verberk, Wilco C.

We then compared climate niche overlap of pairs of species, selected on the basis of phylogenetic information. In contrast to expectations, related species were not similar in their climate niche. Rather, even species pairs that had a common ancestor less than 1 Ma already display very high climate niche distances. We interpret our finding as a strong interspecific competitive constraint on the realized niche, rather than a rapid evolution of the fundamental niche.

This leads to a trade-off in investment between defense and growth, and it is likely that tree species specialized to particular habitats tailor this balance to correspond with local resource availability. It has also been suggested that differential herbivore impacts among tree species may drive habitat segregation, favoring species adapted to particular resource conditions. In order to test these predictions, a reciprocal transplant experiment in Sabah, Malaysia, was established with seedlings of five species of Dipterocarpaceae. These were specialized to either alluvial (Hopea nervosa, Parashorea tomentella) or sandstone soils (Shorea multi:flora, H. beccariana), or were locally absent (S. fallax). A total of 3000 seedlings were planted in paired gap and understory plots in five sites on alluvial and sandstone soils. Half of all seedlings were fertilized. Seedling growth and mortality were recorded in regular samples over 3.5 years, and rates of insect herbivore damage were estimated from censuses of foliar tissue loss on marked mature leaves and available young leaves. Greater herbivory rates on mature leaves had no measurable effects on seedling growth but were associated with a significantly increased likelihood of mortality during the following year. In contrast, new-leaf herbivory rates correlated with neither growth nor mortality. There were no indications of differential impacts of herbivory among the five species, nor between experimental treatments. Herbivory was not shown to influence segregation of species between soil types, although it may contribute toward differential survival among light habitats. Natural rates of damage were substantially lower than have been shown to influence tree seedling growth and mortality in previous manipulative studies.","[Eichhorn, Markus P.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Nilus, Reuben] Forest Res Ctr, Sandakan 90715, Sabah, Malaysia; [Compton, Stephen G.] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hartley, Sue E.] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England; [Burslem, David F.

These data were then used to ascertain statistically the extent to which body size, season and habitat influence the diets of these species and the degree to which food resources were partitioned among and within those species, and thus reduced the potential of interspecific and intraspecific competition. On the west coast, Bodianus frenchii (Labridae) and Epinephelides armatus (Serranidae) spent their whole life over prominent limestone reefs, as did Glaucosoma hebraicum (Glaucosomatidae) in all but juvenile life, when it lived over low-relief, limestone substrata. The dietary composition of each species changed with increasing body size, which, in G. hebraicum, was particularly pronounced at c. 300 mm total length (L-T) and therefore at the size when this species shifts habitat. When the three species co-occurred over the same reefs, their dietary compositions were significantly different, with that of B. frenchii being by far the most discrete, reflecting a far greater contribution by sedentary taxa. Thus, the diet of B. frenchii was distinguished from those of the other two species in containing substantial volumes of bivalve and gastropod molluscs and echinoid echinoderms and essentially no teleosts. Although the diets of G. hebraicum and particularly E. armatus were dominated by teleosts, and especially for larger individuals, the former species ingested greater volumes of cephalopods and small crustaceans. The pointed jaws of B. frenchii, with their forwardly directed and interlocking anterior incisors, are ideally adapted for biting and retaining their invertebrate prey, which are attached to or reside within reef crevices. In contrast, the mouths of G. hebraicum and E. armatus are broader and rounder and contain numerous small, slender and inward-pointing teeth. These teeth, in conjunction with prominent backward-curved canines in E. armatus, facilitate the capture and retention of fish prey. Observations in situ indicate that G. hebraicum is a suction feeder, while E. armatus is predominantly a ram feeder. Although reef environments on the west and south coasts differ, the diet of B. frenchii on these coasts differed only slightly. Interspecific differences in diet, combined with size-related changes in dietary compositions and the occupation of different habitats by juvenile and adult G. hebraicum, reduce the potential for competition for food resources among and within B. frenchii, G. hebraicum and E. armatus and thus helps facilitate the coexistence of these species which historically have been abundant over reefs in south-western Australia.","[Platell, M.

Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the degu, Octodon degas. Although we detected small transitory effects of predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of principal small mammal species such as O. degas and the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Nino events) which trigger ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment. in 1997-2000 verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts to other important community components including birds and insects in order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and that more frequent El Ninos in conjunction with global climatic change may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident.","[Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile; [Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas, La Serena, Chile; [Meserve, Peter L.; Previtali, M.

Datura species, especially Datura stramonium (e.g., jimsonweed), are the focus of scores of case reports that chronicle the toxidrome of anticholinergic toxicity. Mechanisms of toxicity. Toxicity occurs because of the presence of up to 28 belladonna alkaloids, predominated by atropine and scopolamine. There are significant interspecies differences in the ratio of the belladonna alkaloids, atropine to scopolamine, and the presence of at least 26 other related alkaloids will vary, even between and among specimens of the same species. The differences may account for unexpected dose-response effects that are observed in some patients and even different profiles of toxicity. All parts of the Datura species contain belladonna alkaloids; in decreasing order, the belladonna alkaloid content is generally the greatest in the petioles (flowers), stem, fruit (seeds), leaves, and roots. Features. The most prominent symptoms are due to the blockade of peripheral muscarinic receptors that innervate exocrine glands, smooth muscle, and cardiac tissue. Therefore, the primary toxic manifestations include mydriasis, which is due to the blockade of papillary sphincter muscle and iris muscle; dry mouth, secondary to parasympathetic blockade of salivary secretion; tachycardia, caused by competition at muscarinic receptors in postganglionic parasympathetic neurons and blockade of receptors in the SA node; and fever and erythema, because of vasodilation and inhibition of sweating. Direct ocular exposure. Well known to produce mydriasis after ingestion, Datura is also notorious for producing maladies such as gardeners eye and cornpickers eye, which is a testament to the high concentrations of belladonna alkaloids in the entire plant. When the sap or dried plant material from a member of the Datura species enters the eye directly, the papillary sphincter and ciliary muscles are affected resulting in mydriasis and cycloplegia. Pupil dilation is sudden in onset and often profound. In a dose-response fashion, the mydriasis and its persistence will be dependent on the alkaloidal content and quantity of the sap. The mydriasis can be bilateral, but most commonly it is unilateral, which is frightening to the victim and to the clinician and suggestive of significant cerebral pathology. Management. As with any toxic exposure, the foundation of patient management is supportive care and patient reassurance. Because of the central nervous system effects of the belladonna alkaloids, the patient may be agitated, combative, confused, and disoriented. Initial intervention focuses on addressing those issues that protect the patient and their caregivers. In severe cases, physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, should be used to reverse anticholinergic toxicity. Physostigmine should be given intravenously to an adult in a dose of 0.5-2.0 mg at a rate of no more than 1 mg/min; a second dose may be administered if necessary. Children should receive 0.02 mg/kg intravenously and the rate should not exceed 0.5 mg/min. Extracorporeal elimination and forced diuresis of the belladonna alkaloids are not viable options. Conclusions. Members of the Datura species contain abundant amounts of belladonna alkaloids that can produce both local and systemic anticholinergic toxicity. Fatalities because of Datura species exposure are rare, but adverse effects are very common. Treatment is supportive with the use of physostigmine in more severe cases of poisoning.</.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Pharm & Therapeut, Pittsburgh Poison & Drug Informat Ctr, Sch Pharm, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Krenzelok, EP (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Pharm & Therapeut, Pittsburgh Poison & Drug Informat Ctr, Sch Pharm, 200 Lothrop St,BIR 01 07 01, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",krenzelokep@upmc.edu,,,,,,54,43,45,1,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1556-3650,1556-9519,,CLIN TOXICOL,Clin.

Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either (1) niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or (2) impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host-parasitoid or plant-animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as 'specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that 'dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species 'depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised. Distinguishing niche-based and impact-based interpretations may help to bridge terminological and conceptual gaps between network pattern analyses and traditional community ecology.

Young R. brachyura specimens (Bi=0.27; H'=1.05) feed mainly on Crustacea (% IRI=74) (mainly Mysidiacea and Amphipoda Gammaridea), which were replaced in the diet of medium-large specimens principally by Osteichthyes (mainly Gymnammodytes cicerelus).

In R. miraletus, Crustacea represented the main prey in all size groups (% IRI=99.5, 99.6, and 88, respectively). Amphipoda Gammaridea were the predominant prey for small individuals, and were replaced in medium and large specimens by decapods.

As trees in a given cohort progress through ontogeny, many individuals die. This risk of mortality is unevenly distributed across species because of many processes such as habitat filtering, interspecific competition and negative density dependence. Here, we predict and test the patterns that such ecological processes should inscribe on both species and phylogenetic diversity as plants recruit from saplings to the canopy. 2. We compared species and phylogenetic diversity of sapling and tree communities at two sites in French Guiana. We surveyed 2084 adult trees in four 1-ha tree plots and 943 saplings in sixteen 16-m2 subplots nested within the tree plots. Species diversity was measured using Fisher's alpha (species richness) and Simpson's index (species evenness). Phylogenetic diversity was measured using Faith's phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic richness) and Rao's quadratic entropy index (phylogenetic evenness). The phylogenetic diversity indices were inferred using four phylogenetic hypotheses: two based on rbcLa plastid DNA sequences obtained from the inventoried individuals with different branch lengths, a global phylogeny available from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, and a combination of both. 3. Taxonomic identification of the saplings was performed by combining morphological and DNA barcoding techniques using three plant DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, rpoC1 and rbcLa). DNA barcoding enabled us to increase species assignment and to assign unidentified saplings to molecular operational taxonomic units. 4. Species richness was similar between saplings and trees, but in about half of our comparisons, species evenness was higher in trees than in saplings. This suggests that negative density dependence plays an important role during the sapling-to-tree transition. 5. Phylogenetic richness increased between saplings and trees in about half of the comparisons. Phylogenetic evenness increased significantly between saplings and trees in a few cases (4 out of 16) and only with the most resolved phylogeny. These results suggest that negative density dependence operates largely independently of the phylogenetic structure of communities. 6. Synthesis. By contrasting species richness and evenness across size classes, we suggest that negative density dependence drives shifts in composition during the sapling-to-tree transition. In addition, we found little evidence for a change in phylogenetic diversity across age classes, suggesting that the observed patterns are not phylogenetically constrained.","[Gonzalez, Mailyn A.; Roger, Aurelien; Courtois, Elodie A.; Jabot, Franck; Norden, Natalia; Thebaud, Christophe; Chave, Jerome] Univ Toulouse 3, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, UMR 5174, CNRS, Batiment 4R3, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Roger, Aurelien] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Courtois, Elodie A.] Univ Antilles Guyane, CNRS, UMR Ecofog, F-97387 Kourou, France; [Jabot, Franck] AgroParisTech ENGREF, F-75732 Paris, France; [Norden, Natalia] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Paine, C.

Nest construction, however, has only rarely been observed and detailed descriptions of this process are lacking so far. We aim to determine the relative importance of leaf nests as shelters for the golden-brown mouse lemur, and to test predictions concerning the role of thermoregulation, safety (i.e., protection of infants), and of interspecific competition with the sympatric gray mouse lemurs in regulating nest use. Finally, we intend to clarify whether and how Microcebus ravelobensis constructs the nests, and we provide physical descriptions of seven leaf nests. Nocturnal focal observations were carried out from May 2007 to January 2008 on 18 females, and sleeping sites were regularly monitored during a six-month period. Data were collected from two study sites, one with exclusive presence of M. ravelobensis, and one with co-existence of the two mouse lemur species. Sixty-five out of 379 identified daily sleeping sites were leaf nests. These represented a total of 35 different leaf nests, used by 15 out of 18 females. The relative leaf nest use differed between sites during five out of six months, but without a consistent pattern. Interspecific competition can therefore not explain leaf nest use. Leaf nest use differed seasonally and may be partly explained by thermoregulatory advantages in the site with lower minimum temperatures. Nest use was furthermore higher than expected in both sites during the rearing season that indicates the role of nests in infant protection. For the first time, we could confirm that golden-brown mouse lemurs build leaf nests themselves. Nest building lasted between 46 and 68 min, which shows that this task is time consuming and therefore probably costly. Am. J. Primatol. 72:48-55, 2010.

Especially in summer, extremely high numbers of individuals occur. This study analyses whether these high densities in summer lead to food limitation using 0-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. as a model species. Between 1975 and 2007, this species was quantitatively monitored during 20 yr. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) a statistical analysis of field growth in relation to density, whereby negative density-dependent growth is considered as an indication of intraspecific competition, and (2) a comparison of observed field growth with predicted maximum growth according to the dynamic energy budget (DEB) model, to detect whether growth reduction occurs during the growing season as an indication of interspecies competition. The statistical analysis indicated no negative density-dependent growth during the whole growing season, suggesting the absence of intraspecies competition for food. The comparison of observed growth with DEB-predicted maximum growth showed that field growth was lower than the possible maximum, and that the difference increased over time until about the end of July, suggesting interspecies competition for food in summer. The stabilization in growth rate from July onwards might be related to a change in food quality: a shift from small bivalve siphons as main food items to larger tail tips of the lugworm Arenicola marina. These findings illustrate that not only food quantity but also food quality affects growth rates, at least in 0-group plaice.","[van der Veer, Henk W.; Freitas, Vania; Koot, Joris; Witte, Johannes I.

The exact number of re-introduced individuals is unknown, but it oscillated around 400. The likely preference of marmots for the southern sunny slopes rapidly facilitated their expansion to the southern Pyrenees, where the lack of both natural predators and of important interspecific competitors also likely facilitated an important expansion of this species. There is only one attempt to broadly calculate the population of marmots in the southern Pyrennes, estimating a population of around 10,000 individuals. However, there exist no reliable data to calculate the potential distribution of this new colonizing species in the southern Pyrenees, and a map of. the potential distribution of the species is necessary to see whether alpine marmots can potentially establish in sites where it might be necessary to manage its populations for various reasons. We developed a map of potential distribution based on census carried out in summer of 2007 in an area of more than 600 km. We censused more around 300 colonies together with around 300 random points to characterized habitat selection variables.

Many stress types acting on the intensity of intracellular protein can induce expression of heat shock proteins. Here, we studied changes in expression level of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), one of the best investigated stress proteins, in response to five potential stress factors in the planarian flatworm Schmidtea polychroa: (1) homogenized planarian tissue, which releases an alarm substance that signals predation injury, (2) physical damage by puncturing, (3) a simulation of ecological competition by adding a mixture of naturally co-occurring species: one Dendrocoelum and two Polycelis flatworms, one Asellus water louse and one leech, and (4) magnesium chloride, which inhibits regeneration ability. We found that alarm substance (1), physical harm (2), and magnesium chloride (4) led to increased expression of Hsp70, while interspecific competition (3) did not result in elevated Hsp70 expression. There was no difference between the experimental negative control and two temporal controls immediately after collection and just before the experiment. Results show that Schmidtea polychroa is not sensitive to sampling and lab maintenance. However, planarian homogenate, magnesium chloride and physical harm all caused Hsp70-inducing stress. We conclude that Hsp70 quantification is appropriate to study the current stress level in planaria in response to specific conditions.","[Navarro, Beatriz Sanchez; Michiels, Nico K.; D'Souza, Thomas G.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Fac Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Koehler, Heinz-R.] Univ Tubingen, Fac Biol, Inst Evolut & Ecol, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany","Navarro, BS (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Fac Biol, Morgenstelle 28, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",beatriz.sanchez-navarro@uni-tuebingen.de,"Michiels, Nico K/A-2045-2009; D'Souza, Thomas/A-2284-2009; Kohler, Heinz-R./AAL-1350-2021","Michiels, Nico K/0000-0001-9873-3111; ",German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [MI 482/11]; Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen,"We thank Milosz Olczak and Gregor Schulte for collecting flatworms and Nadine Timmermeyer for the assistance during the experiment.

Infrared heaters were used for warming the ground surface by 1-2 degrees C above the ambient condition and periodic irrigations were applied to simulate a 50% increase in annual precipitation. We found that warming advanced the timing for egg hatching and grasshopper eclosion in each of the three species. However, grasshopper diapause and increased precipitation appeared to offset the effect of warming on egg development. Hatching and development were more strongly affected by warming in the mid-season O. asiaticus and the late-season C. fallax relative to the early-season D. barbipes. Warming by similar to 1.5 degrees C advanced the occurrence of the mid-season O. asiaticus by an average of 4.96 days; while warming and increased precipitation interactively affected the occurrence of the late-season C. fallax, which advanced by 5.53 days. Our data and those of others suggest that most grasshopper species in the Inner Mongolian grassland are likely to extend their distribution northward with climate change. However, because of the differential response to warming we demonstrate for these species, the different grasshopper species are predicted to aggregate toward the middle period of the growing season, potentially increasing interspecific competition and grazing pressure on grasslands.","[Guo, Kun; Hao, Shu-Guang; Kang, Le] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Insect Pests, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Sun, Osbert Jianxin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Sci, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Kang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Insect Pests, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lkang@ioz.ac.cn,,"Sun, Osbert/0000-0002-8815-5984; Kang, Le/0000-0003-4262-2329","Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30670328]","This study was conducted as part of a comprehensive research project (Global Change Multifactor Experiment-Duolun) sponsored by the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The combination of in situ feeding observations, examination of gut contents and stable-isotope analyses was expected to identify previously unresolved prey items that contribute to dietary separation. In situ feeding observations identified five species that feed predominantly on anthozoans (Chaetodon baronessa, Chaetodon bennetti, Chaetodon lunulatus, Chaetodon punctatofasciatus and Chaetodon speculum). Stable-isotope ratios for these species, as well as for Chaetodon ornatissimus (for which no feeding observations were completed), were very similar and consistent with diets comprising mostly anthozoans. Feeding observations, however, showed that they mostly fed on different coral species, while the identifiable portion of their gut contents showed clear separation based on cryptic dietary components. For example, C. baronessa and C. bennetti appeared to ingest annelid worms during the course of coral feeding, whereas gut contents of C. punctatofasciatus and C. speculum were dominated by crustaceans. In situ feeding observations further identified the following groups: coral-bottom feeders, bottom feeders, sponge feeders and pelagic feeders, feeding on a wide variety of prey items such as Annelida, Crustacea, Cnidaria, Mollusca and macroalgae. Overall, many chaetodontid species had similar reliance on major prey items (e.g. anthozoans or polychaetes) but differed greatly in the minor prey items that they utilized. Partitioning of minor prey items may be important in reducing interspecific competition and facilitating coexistence of chaetodontids on coral reefs.","[Nagelkerken, I.; van der Velde, G.; Wartenbergh, S.

In microbial communities, the predominant focus has been on the well-touted ability of microbes to disperse and the environment acting as a selective filter to determine which species are present. In this study, we investigated the role of biotic interactions (e.g., competition, facilitation) in fungal endophyte community assembly by examining endophyte species co-occurrences within communities using null models. We used recombinant inbred lines (genotypes) of maize (Zea mays) to examine community assembly at multiple habitat levels, at the individual plant and host genotype levels. Both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were used to assess endophyte communities. Communities were analyzed using the complete fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) dataset or only the dominant (most abundant) OTUs in order to ascertain whether species co-occurrences were different for dominant members compared to when all members were included. In the culture-dependent approach, we found that for both datasets, OTUs co-occurred on maize genotypes more frequently than expected under the null model of random species co-occurrences. In the culture-independent approach, we found that OTUs negatively co-occurred at the individual plant level but were not significantly different from random at the genotype level for either the dominant or complete datasets. Our results showed that interspecific interactions can affect endophyte community assembly, but the effects can be complex and depend on host habitat level. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine endophyte community assembly in the same host species at multiple habitat levels. Understanding the processes and mechanisms that shape microbial communities will provide important insights into microbial community structure and the maintenance of microbial biodiversity.","[Pan, Jean J.] Univ Akron, Dept Biol, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [Pan, Jean J.; May, Georgiana] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Pan, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Akron, Dept Biol, 302 Buchtel Common, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",jepan@uakron.edu,,,NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology; NSF BiocomplexityNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-0083468],"We thank members of the May lab (A.

Though castrators are loosely known to be large relative to their hosts (compared to typical parasites), their mass has rarely been quantified and little is known about size variation, even if such variation exists. By cross-sectioning snails, we examined intra- and inter-specific variation in the parasite/host mass of 15 trematode species that castrate the California horn snail, Cerithidea californica. Trematode species occupied 14-39% (mean = 20.3%) of an infected snail's soft tissue mass. Intraspecific variation in castrator mass fluctuated with variables that covary with energy available for host reproduction. Specifically, trematode mass was 24% higher in summer than in winter, 15% greater in snails from intertidal flats than from tidal channels, and increased with host mass to the 1.37 power (a finding contrary to that previously documented for other types of parasites). Relative body mass differed across trematode species, varying interspecifically with: (1) taxonomic family, (2) host tissue use (larger species used more types of host-tissue), (3) position in the trematode interspecific competitive dominance hierarchy (the two most subordinate species were the largest, otherwise size tended to increase with dominance), and (4) type of host used by offspring (species whose offspring infect relatively predictably occurring benthic invertebrates were larger than those infecting transient vertebrates). Our findings suggest that ecological constraints and life history trade-offs between reproduction and survival influence the mass of these very large parasites.","[Hechinger, Ryan F.; Warner, Robert R.; Kuris, Armand M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Hechinger, Ryan F.; Lafferty, Kevin D.; Mancini, Frank T., III; Kuris, Armand M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Hechinger, RF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",hechinger@lifesci.ucsb.edu; lafferty@lifesci.ucsb.edu; mancini@lifesci.ucsb.edu; warner@lifesci.ucsb.edu; kuris@lifesci.ucsb.edu,"Hechinger, Ryan/F-6754-2010; Warner, Robert R./M-5342-2013; Lafferty, Kevin D./B-3888-2009","Warner, Robert R./0000-0002-3299-5685; Hechinger, Ryan/0000-0002-6633-253X",US NIH/NSF EIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DEB0224565],"We thank the University of California NRS for allowing access to field sites.

Here we compare the similarity of community composition, from different community assembly models run under identical environmental conditions, where interspecific competition is assumed to be either neutral or niche-based. In both cases, species colonize a focal patch from a network of neighbouring patches in a metacommunity. We highlight the circumstances (rate and spatial scale of dispersal, and the relative importance of ecological drift) where commonly used community similarity metrics or species rank-abundance relationships are likely to give similar results, regardless of the underlying processes (neutral or non-neural) driving species' dynamics. As drift becomes more important in driving species abundances, deterministic niche structure has a smaller influence.

The ant genus Pheidole has dimorphic worker subcastes in which major workers appear limited due to their morphology to performing defensive or trophic functions, thus providing an ideal model to investigate specialization and plasticity. We examined worker morphology, brood-care flexibility, and subcaste ratio in 17 species of tropical twig-nesting Pheidole by quantifying nursing by major workers in natural colonies and in subcolonies lacking minors, in which we also measured brood survival and growth. Across species, majors performed significantly less brood care than minors in intact colonies, but increased rates of brood care 20-fold in subcolonies lacking minors. Brood nursed by majors had lower survival than brood tended by minors, although rates of brood growth did not vary between subcastes. Significant interspecific variation in rates of brood care by major workers did not lead to significant differences in brood growth or survival. Additionally, we did not find a significant association between the degree of major worker morphometric specialization and rates of nursing, growth, or survival of brood among species. Therefore, major workers showed reduced efficacy of brood care, but the degree of morphological specialization among species did not directly compromise task plasticity. The compact nests and all-or-nothing consequences of predation or disturbance on colony fitness may have influenced the evolution of major worker brood-care competency in twig-nesting Pheidole.","[Mertl, Amy L.; Traniello, James F.

EBNA-LP localizes predominantly in the nucleus through the action of nuclear localization signals in the repeated regions of the protein. EBNA-LP has also been detected in the cytoplasm, and a previous study suggested that some of the EBNA-LP coactivation function is mediated by relocalizing histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Although EBNA-LP can be found in the cytoplasm, it has no obvious nuclear export signal, and there is no direct evidence for active shuttling between these cellular compartments. Whether active shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm is required for coactivation remains to be clarified. To address these issues, we tested a variety of EBNA-LP isoforms and mutants for nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling activity in an interspecies heterokaryon assay and for the ability to associate with HDAC4. EBNA-LP isoforms smaller than 42 kDa shuttle efficiently in the heterokaryon assay via a crm-1-independent mechanism. In addition, no specific EBNA-LP domain that mediates nuclear export could be identified. In contrast, an EBNA-LP 62-kDa isoform does not demonstrate detectable shuttling in the heterokaryon assay yet still coactivates EBNA2 similarly to the smaller EBNA-LP isoforms. All of the EBNA-LP mutants tested, including the coactivation-deficient Delta CR3 mutant and the nonshuttling 62-kDa isoform, were capable of associating with HDAC4. Taken together, our results suggest that simple diffusion may account for the nuclear export observed with smaller isoforms of EBNA-LP, that nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling is not required for efficient EBNA-LP coactivation function, and that competence for HDAC4 association is not sufficient to mediate nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling or EBNA-LP coactivation in the absence of a functional interaction with Sp100A.","[Ling, Paul D.; Tan, Jie; Peng, RongSheng] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol Virol & Microbiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Ling, PD (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol Virol & Microbiol, Mail Stop BCM 385,1 Bayor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",pling@bcm.tmc.edu,,,NIH RO1United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [CA124309]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R01CA124309] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This study was supported by NIH RO1 grant CA124309 (P.D.L.).,,43,6,6,0,1,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0022-538X,,,J VIROL,J.

However, these relationships might themselves be altered by environmental factors, complicating prediction of the effects of species loss in ecosystems subjected to abiotic stress. In boreal streams, we investigated effects of biodiversity and two abiotic perturbations on three related indices of ecosystem functioning: leaf decomposition, detritivore leaf processing efficiency (LPE) and detritivore growth. Replicate field enclosures containing leaves and detritivore assemblages were exposed to liming and nutrient enrichment, raising pH and nutrient levels. Both treatments constitute perturbations for our naturally acidic and nutrient-poor streams. We also varied detritivore species richness and density. The effects of the abiotic and diversity manipulations were similar in magnitude, but whereas leaf decomposition increased by 18% and 8% following liming and nutrient enrichment, respectively, increased detritivore richness reduced leaf decomposition (6%), detritivore LPE (19%) and detritivore growth (12%). The detritivore richness effect on growth was associated with negative trait-independent complementarity, indicating interspecific interference competition. These interactions were apparently alleviated in both enriched and limed enclosures, as trait-independent complementarity became less negative. LPE increased with detritivore density in the monocultures, indicating benefits of intra-specific aggregation that outweighed the costs of intra-specific competition, and dilution of these benefits probably contributed to lowered leaf decomposition in the species mixtures. Finally, the effects of liming were reduced in most species mixtures relative to the monocultures. These results demonstrate how environmental changes might regulate the consequences of species loss for functioning in anthropogenically perturbed ecosystems, and highlight potential influences of biodiversity on functional stability. Additionally, the negative effects of richness and positive effects of density in our field study were opposite to previous laboratory observations, further illustrating the importance of environmental context for biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.","[McKie, Brendan G.; Malmqvist, Bjorn] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Schindler, Markus; Gessner, Mark O.] ETH, Dept Aquat Ecol, EAWAG, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Schindler, Markus; Gessner, Mark O.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, IBZ, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland","Mckie, BG (corresponding author), SLU, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, POB 7050, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",brendan.mckie@vatten.slu.se,"McKie, Brendan G/C-9376-2013","McKie, Brendan/0000-0002-1796-9497",EU CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [EVK1-CT-2001-00088]; Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research [01.0087]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [VR 2003-2495],"We thank Johan Baudou for assisting with animal collection, and Richard Illi and the AUA lab for nutrient analyses.

Habitat destruction and the resulting fragmentation increase the probability of local extirpation of plants but the process of community disassembly may take many years. There are very little direct data on the rate of this process. Revisitation studies using historical data offer the potential to quantify the rate and direction of change in remnant vegetation and can contribute to an improved understanding of the long-term species responses to habitat fragmentation. This study examined the changes that occurred in 12 grassy woodland remnants in rural southern Australia over three decades by comparing comprehensive site-level species lists collected in 1975 and 2006. 2. The probability of local population extirpation was assessed in relation to functional- and abundance-based mechanisms (i.e. plant functional traits, initial population abundance) and extrinsic threats (i.e. remnant area, remnant shape) using chi-square analysis and Bayesian logistic regression modelling. 3. Of the 775 populations of 177 perennial native species present in 1975, 199 populations (26%) of 98 species were not relocated in 2006 and are presumed to be locally extinct. 4. Extrinsic factors such as habitat area and shape provided little predictive power to understanding local population extirpation. Intrinsic factors (i.e. initial population abundance, seed dispersal and plant height, but not the plant traits clonality and life form) were better predictors. Populations of short species at low abundance in 1975 were most likely to become locally extinct due to interspecific competition in the absence of disturbance whereas tall, abundant species have the least likelihood of population extinction. 5. Synthesis. The sensitivity of populations to local extirpation in fragmented landscapes is likely driven by a number of factors. The lack of substantial influence of site area and shape and some plant life-history traits suggest that simple predictions about population extinction are unlikely. Although population size was an important determinant of population loss, it is likely that other factors will interact to determine such outcomes (e.g. disturbance regimes, non-native plant invasions, edge effects) by affecting habitat quality, and put populations at greater risk of extinction than the life-history traits of plants alone.","[Sutton, Fiona M.; Morgan, John W.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Bot, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia","Morgan, JW (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Bot, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",j.morgan@latrobe.edu.au,,,,,,86,30,32,0,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Although terrestrial animals are generally thought to be well protected from damage because of UV radiation, insect herbivory frequently increases when solar UV-B (280-315 mn) radiation is attenuated. As UV transmission through leaves is generally low because of the accumulation of compounds that act as selective sunscreens (e.g., phenolics), we hypothesized that T. urticae avoids solar UV-B radiation by staying on lower leaf surfaces. We examined whether artificial UV irradiation and solar UV affected the survival and reproduction of T urticae and whether staying on lower leaf surfaces was beneficial to their performance under ambient UV radiation. We found that T. urticae was not well protected from UV-B radiation, because artificial UV-B irradiation strongly decreased survivorship and egg production. More importantly; compulsory solar UV irradiation treatments also had lethal effects on T. urticae, whereas the mites could avoid them if they remained on the lower leaf surfaces of their host plants. These results showed that access to habitats protected from sunlight, such as lower leaf surfaces, is likely essential for T urticae survival under ambient UV-B radiation. The lethal effects of solar UV radiation may also affect the population dynamics of spider mites, and habitat (resource) limitation may increase the probability of interspecific interactions, Such as competition and predation. In turn, the occurrence of these interactions in sheltered areas may be associated with observed increases in herbivory under conditions of solar UV-B-attenuation.","[Ohtsuka, Keiko; Osakabe, Masahiro (MH.)] Kyoto Univ, Lab Ecol Informat, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Osakabe, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Lab Ecol Informat, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",mhosaka@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Osakabe, Masahiro/H-8587-2019","Osakabe, Masahiro/0000-0002-2246-3431","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [18580053]","We thank N.

In combination with other ecosystem and species characteristics, species-specific N preferences may influence species coexistence and dominance. If species N preferences follow dominance patterns in California oak woodlands, then the more dominant exotic grasses should prefer the most abundant inorganic soil N form (NH4+, while the subordinate native grasses should prefer the less available inorganic (NO3-) or organic (glycine) soil N forms. To investigate this prediction, we applied N-15-labeled NH4+, NO3-, and glycine to soil and measured % N-15 recovery by two dominant annual grasses (Bromus diandrus and Bromus hordeaceus) and two subordinate perennial grasses (Elymus glaucus and Nassella pulchra). As expected, shoots of B. diandrus recovered more N-15-NH4+ (74%) than either N-15-NO3- (51%) or N-15-glycine (39%). B. diandrus also captured at least 3.2 times more N-15-NH4+ than subordinate grasses. Dominant B. hordeaceus, however, demonstrated no N form preferences. As hypothesized, shoots of subordinate E. glaucus and N. pulchra recovered 2.1-2.3 times more N-15-NO3 than N-15-NH4+ and increased %N by 4.8-5.7% in response to the application of N-15-NO3-. Both subordinate grasses did not prefer N-15-glycine over N-15-NH4+, suggesting that the importance of this N form in structuring species coexistence in California oak woodlands is minimal. These results support our theory that species N preferences follow dominance patterns in California oak woodlands. To further understand the role of these species-specific N preferences in structuring dominance, the importance of N form versus such characteristics as rooting distribution and species phenologies needs to be explored in the presence of interspecific competition.

Yet, the lack of quantitative information about morphologically similar native congeners, namely Codium tomentosum Stackhouse and C. vermilara (Olivi) Delle Chiaje, has hindered interspecific comparisons and ecological predictions. From September 2002 to 2005, we made extensive intertidal surveys on 12 northern and 26 southern rocky shores of the English Channel, specifically documenting the abundance, distribution and identity of Codium assemblages. On the north side of the English Channel, the native C. tomentosum and alien C. fragile were both sparsely distributed in intertidal pools in Devon. In contrast, the natives were absent from and the alien was locally abundant in shallow lagoons and rocky reefs around Bembridge and Whitecliff on the Isle of Wight. Finally, in the Channel Islands off the Atlantic coast of France, Codium spp. were abundant in pools and on low-shore emergent substrata with native species predominating. Patterns Of distribution varied substantially among Guernsey, Jersey and Alderney, despite their close proximity.

The niche variation hypothesis predicts that populations with few interspecific competitors and hence broader niches are expected to contain greater genetic diversity.

Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to measure the genetic diversity of populations of Anthoxanthum odoratum growing in 10 plots of differing species richness that lie along resource and soil pH gradients. Genetic diversity in A. odoratum was positively correlated with the number of resources added to a plot, but not correlated with species richness. However, separate analyses have shown a negative correlation between resource addition and species richness at Park Grass and elsewhere, so genetic and species diversity appear to respond in opposite directions.","[Silvertown, Jonathan; Biss, Pamela M.; Freeland, Joanna] Open Univ, Dept Life Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England","Silvertown, J (corresponding author), Open Univ, Dept Life Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",j.silvertown@open.ac.uk,"Freeland, Joanna/AAY-3881-2021","Freeland, Joanna/0000-0002-5251-7680",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NBAF010001] Funding Source: researchfish,,,32,46,48,0,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Examples are in the establishment and maintenance of dominance hierarchies, or in infanticide, where (usually) incoming males attempt to kill existing infants in a group. Such violence can seem paradoxical, but in fact is often perfectly logical for the individual perpetrating the violence, as distinct from the group as a whole.

Yet it is much less heeded that S. P. Hubbell's definition of neutrality allows species to differ in their birth and death rates as long as they have an equal per capita fitness. Using the lottery model of competition we find that fitness equalization through birth-death trade-offs can make species coexist longer than expected for demographically identical species, whereas the probability of monodominance for a species under zero-sum neutral dynamics is equal to its initial relative abundance. Furthermore, if newly arising species in a community survive preferentially they are more likely to slip through the quagmire of rareness, thus creating a strong selective bias favoring their community membership. On the other hand, high-mortality species, once having gained a footing in the community, are more likely to become abundant due to their compensatory high birth rates. This unexpected result explains why a positive association between species abundance and per capita death rate can be seen in tropical-forest communities. An explicit incorporation of interspecific trade-offs between birth and death into the neutral theory increases the theory's realism as well as its predictive power.","[Lin, Kui; Zhang, Da-Yong; He, Fangliang] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lin, Kui; Zhang, Da-Yong; He, Fangliang] Beijing Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [He, Fangliang] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Zhang, DY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhangdy@bnu.edu.cn,"Lin, Kui/P-4492-2015; Zhang, Da-Yong/B-3078-2011","Lin, Kui/0000-0002-5993-1972; Zhang, Da-Yong/0000-0003-1056-8735",State Key Basic Research and Development Plan [2007CB106800]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30628005]; NSERC ( Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank Peter Chesson and an anonymous reviewer for their constructive criticisms.

A number of recent studies incorporating phylogenetics into community ecology have upheld the paradigm that competition drives ecological divergence among species of the same guild. However, the role of other interspecific interactions, in particular positive interactions such as mutualism, remains poorly explored. We characterized the ecological niche and inferred phylogenetic relationships among members of a diverse community of neotropical Mullerian mimetic butterflies. Mullerian mimicry is one of the best studied examples of mutualism, in which unpalatable species converge in wing pattern locally to advertize their toxicity to predators. We provide evidence that mutualistic interactions can drive convergence along multiple ecological axes, outweighing both phylogeny and competition in shaping community structure. Our findings imply that ecological communities are adaptively assembled to a much greater degree than commonly suspected. In addition, our results show that phenotype and ecology are strongly linked and support the idea that mimicry can cause ecological speciation through multiple cascading effects on species' biology.","[Elias, Marianne] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Elias, Marianne; Jiggins, Chris] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England; [Gompert, Zachariah] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Willmott, Keith] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, McGuire Ctr Lepidoptera & Biodivers, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Elias, M (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",melias2008@gmail.com,"Jiggins, Chris D/B-9960-2008; Elias, Marianne/S-6359-2016; Jiggins, Chris/T-4296-2019","Jiggins, Chris D/0000-0002-7809-062X; Jiggins, Chris/0000-0002-7809-062X; Gompert, Zachariah/0000-0003-2248-2488","Royal Society (UK)Royal Society of London; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [F/00158/AK, F/09 364F]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0103746]","This work was funded by the Royal Society (UK), the Leverhulme Trust F/00158/AK, F/09 364F(UK), and the National Science Foundation DEB 0103746 (USA).",,74,93,97,0,83,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1544-9173,1545-7885,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

The authors found that for all meal size averages and standard deviations self-controlled mice out-competed impulsive mice and that this advantage was most marked under conditions of deprivation. Conversely, increasing collection risk or maximum delay promoted the dominance of impulsive strategies.

To determine how allocation to putative defense compounds is affected by N deposition and increased temperature. we analyzed the composition of CBSCs ill leaves Of three arctic-alpine plant species: Bistorta vivipara, Dryas octopetala, and Salix reticulata after 5 years of warming (by open-top chambers) and experimental nutrient addition in an alpine Dryas heath ill Southern Norway. The dry weight of leaves increased increased after nutrient addition and warming combined With nutrient addition in all three species. while the weight of 1). octopetala leaves also increased with warming alone. Individual chemical Compounds or compound groups reacted to the treatments to different degrees and in different directions in the three species. The total concentration of CBSCs changed significantly only in S. reticulata, where it decreased in plots with nutrient addition combined with warming. Shading caused by taller vegetation in these plots might have bigger effects on the CBSC concentration than the direct changes in nutrient availability and temperature. Dryas octopetela had the highest concentration of CBSCs among the three species and was least affected by the treatments. Our results show that increased N availability and temperature influenced the level of carbon-based defense in some alpine plants but not Others, indicating species-specific C-allocation responses to environmental change. Consequently, environemental changes may differentially affect defense abilities of alpine plant species, which could possibly contribute to future changes ill interspecific competitive relationships mid Subsequently species composition of alpine plant communities.","[Nybakken, Line; Klanderud, Kari; Totland, Orjan] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway","Nybakken, L (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, Box 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",line.nybakken@umb.no,,,,,,50,9,9,3,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-0430,1938-4246,,ARCT ANTARCT ALP RES,Arct.

As small populations of cooperative breeders may be particularly prone to Allee effects, this extensive data set was used to test the prediction that, if Allee effects occur, aspects of reproductive success, individual survival and population growth should increase with pack and population size. The results suggest that behavioural aspects of wild dogs rather than ecological factors (i.e. competitors, prey and rainfall) primarily have been limiting the HiP wild dog population, particularly a low probability of finding suitable mates upon dispersal at low pack number (i.e. a mate-finding Allee effect). Wild dogs in HiP were not subject to component Allee effects at the pack level, most likely due to low interspecific competition and high prey availability. This suggests that aspects of the environment can mediate the strength of Allee effects. There was also no demographic Allee effect in the HiP wild dog population, as the population growth rate was significantly negatively related to population size, despite no apparent ecological resource limitation. Such negative density dependence at low numbers indicates that behavioural studies of the causal mechanisms potentially generating Allee effects in small populations can provide a key to understanding their dynamics. This study demonstrates how aspects of a species' social behaviour can influence the vulnerability of small populations to extinction and illustrates the profound implications of sociality for endangered species' recovery.","[Somers, Michael J.; Gusset, Markus] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Somers, Michael J.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Excellence Invas Biol, Natl Res Fdn, Dept Sci & Technol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Graf, Jan A.; Slotow, Rob; Gusset, Markus] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa; [Szykman, Micaela] Smithsonian Natl Zool Pk, Conservat & Res Ctr, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA; [Szykman, Micaela] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","Somers, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",michael.somers@up.ac.za,"Slotow, Rob/AAM-9053-2020; Gusset, Markus/AAA-3497-2019; /A-1523-2008","Gusset, Markus/0000-0003-1186-3218; Szykman Gunther, Micaela/0000-0002-7822-8094; /0000-0002-5836-8823; Slotow, Rob/0000-0001-9469-1508",The Green Trust (WWF-South Africa); The Endangered Wildlife Trust; Smithsonian National Zoological ParkSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Shirley Sichel and Abbott Endowment Funds; Friends of the National ZooSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Smithsonian Institution (Office of the Undersecretary for Science)Smithsonian Institution; British Airways; Third World Academy of Science; The Wild Dog Foundation; The Sally Club; The Wildlands Conservation Trust; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion BiologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife; National Research Foundation; University of KwaZulu-Natal,"We thank The Green Trust (WWF-South Africa), The Endangered Wildlife Trust, Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Shirley Sichel and Abbott Endowment Funds, Friends of the National Zoo, Smithsonian Institution ( Office of the Undersecretary for Science), British Airways, Third World Academy of Science, The Wild Dog Foundation, The Sally Club, The Wildlands Conservation Trust, DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, National Research Foundation and the University of KwaZulu-Natal for funding.

However, the potential mechanisms behind the positive interspecific correlation between T and latitude remain unexplored. In a comparative study of more than 100 bird species, we examined whether social constraints during male-male competition arising from migration and breeding synchrony are responsible for the latitude effects. Species that breed at higher latitudes are more likely to migrate and experience more intense intrasexual competition upon spring arrival than nonmigrant species from lower latitudes. Additionally, species from higher latitudes cope with shorter breeding seasons and thus with more synchronous breeding, which selects for high T titers via increased male-male conflicts. Accordingly, peak T levels were associated with migration and the duration of the egg laying period that reflects breeding synchrony. Because migration and breeding synchrony were related to latitudinal distribution, they appear to be important components of the latitude effects on T. A multivariate model controlling for covariation of predictor variables revealed that latitude remained the strongest predictor of peak T. Therefore, selection due to migration and breeding synchrony may partially cause the latitude effect, but other geographically varying factors may also play a role in mediating peak T levels at different latitudes.","[Garamszegi, L.

This is the case in Leptopilina sp. (Hymenoptera, Figitidae), a Drosophila parasitoid searching for larvae by ovipositor probes. This a behaviour can be conditioned to fruit odours. In a previous study, the latency of probing to a fruit odour is reported to have a genetic variability within a laboratory strain. This suggests a link between rapidity of host discovery and fitness. In the present study, this hypothesis is tested by comparing responses to host-habitat odours between two genotypes of Leptopilina heterotoma Thomson, from the Mediterranean coast (Antibes) and from Burgundy (Tailly). The two genotypes present contrasting rhythms and levels, of locomotor activity linked to contrasting interspecific competition in their area of origin. The high activity observed in the Mediterranean genotype is interpreted as an adaptive response to it limited time-window to win against a competitor species absent in Burgundy. The present study finds differentiation in innate but not learnt responses to host-habitat odours. The more active genotype (Antibes) has a higher probability and a shorter latency of innate probing to the odours than the less active genotype (Tailly); Antibes females also find larvae and complete infestations more rapidly. Learning equalizes the probability and the latency of probing, to the odours in both strains, and increases the probing duration. Innate responses to host-habitat odours would allow time-limited insects to increase their reproductive rate, when host predictability is high in the habitat. Selection of faster innate responses to host and habitat cues without evolution of learnt responses indicates that the initial host discovery is more crucial to fitness than subsequent ones.","[Perez-Maluf, Raquel; Rafalimanana, Halitiana; Campan, Erick; Kaiser, Laure] Ctr Versailles Grignon, INRA, PISC, Lab Neurobiol Comparee Invertebres,UR UMR 271, Versailles, France; [Perez-Maluf, Raquel] Univ Estadual Sudoeste Bahia, Zool Lab, DCN, Vitoria da Conquista, BA, Brazil; [Rafalimanana, Halitiana] Ecole Super Sci Agron, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Campan, Erick] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Lab Ecol Fonctionnelle, UMR 5245, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Fleury, Frederic] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Kaiser, L (corresponding author), CNRS, IRD, Lab Evolut Genomes & Speciat, UR 072,UPR 9034, Bat 13,1 Ave Terrasse, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",kaiser@legs.cnrs-gif.fr,,,CAPES (Brazil)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); COFECUB; INRA,"We thank Minh-Ha Pham-Delegue and Yves Carton for their support during this research and David Laloi for fruitful discussions; Evelyne Genecque, Donlinique Huet and Francoise Frey for their technical assistance Laurence Guibouret from Haarmann and Reimer for providing the food flavourings: and George Ong'Amo for linguistic advice.

Prevailing theories of recruitment after disturbance center on the role of pioneer species; predictions of forest biodiversity focus almost exclusively on dispersal and shade tolerance while vegetative reproduction is virtually omitted from models and serious discussions of the topic. However, the persistence of live damaged trees increases understory shade, generates. ne- scale environmental heterogeneity, and moderates ecosystem responses to damage, while the sprouting of damaged trees offers a shortcut to reestablishment of the canopy. While a number of studies document snapshots of post- disturbance vegetative reproduction, we lack an understanding of the underlying demographic processes needed in order to both comprehend and predict observed patterns. In this study we quantify the abundance, competitive ability, and interspeci. c variability of vegetative reproduction in 18 replicated experimental gaps in the southern Appalachians and Carolina Piedmont, USA, in order to assess the potential role of sprouting in driving gap dynamics. Annual rates of damaged adult survival, sprout initiation, growth, and mortality were monitored over four years and compared to the performance of gap- regenerating saplings. Recruitment from sprouts was found to constitute 26 - 87% of early gap regeneration and forms the dominant pathway of regeneration for some species. Sprouts from recently damaged trees also grow signi. cantly faster than the saplings with which they compete. For all measured demographic rates ( damaged tree survival, sprout initiation, number, growth, and survival) differences among species are large and consistent across sites, suggesting that vegetative reproduction is an important and non- neutral process in shaping community composition. Sprouting ability does not correlate strongly with other life- history trade- offs, thus sprouting potentially provides an alternate trait axis in promoting diversity.","[Dietze, Michael C.; Clark, James S.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Dietze, Michael C.; Clark, James S.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Clark, James S.] Duke Univ, Inst Stat & Decis Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Dietze, MC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, 22 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mdietze@oeb.harvard.edu,"Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009; Clark, James S./G-6331-2011","Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518; ",,,,64,110,112,2,93,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

We compared classification tree analysis and logistic regression analysis to explore their relative abilities to model whitebark pine presence and absence with medium-spatial-resolution satellite and topographic variables across a complex study site in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta. Both techniques were found to be effective, generating map products of roughly equal thematic quality (91% overall accuracy; kappa = 0.76). However, the logistic model was valuable in its ability to predict ratio-level probability surfaces, whereas the classification tree approach was simpler, faster, and found to generate a slightly more balanced model from an individual class accuracy perspective. End users selecting between the two techniques should make choices that balance flexibility with simplicity while always taking care to exercise sound modeling practices.","[McDermid, G.

The model accounts for the prey's interspecies competition and therefore is asymptotically stable, whereas its oscillatory behavior is induced by temporal variations in environmental conditions simulated by those in the prey's reproduction rate. Two models of the variations are considered, each of them combining randomness with hidden periodicity. The stationary joint probability density function (PDF) of the number of predators and prey is calculated numerically by the path integration (PI) method based on the use of characteristic functions and the fast Fourier transform. The numerical results match those for the asymptotic case of white-noise variations for which an analytical solution is available. Several examples are studied, with calculations of important characteristics of oscillations, for example the expected rate of up-crossings given the level of the predator number. The calculated PDFs may be of predominantly random (unimodal) or predominantly periodic nature (bimodal). Thus, the PI method has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for studies of the dynamics of predator-prey pairs. The method captures the random oscillations as observed in nature, taking into account potential periodicity in the environmental conditions.","[Naess, Arvid] NTNU, Dept Math Sci, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Dimentberg, Michael F.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Mech Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA; [Naess, Arvid; Gaidai, Oleg] NTNU, Ctr Ships & Ocean Struct, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Naess, A (corresponding author), NTNU, Dept Math Sci, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",arvidn@math.ntnu.no; diment@wpi.edu; oleg.gaidai@ntnu.no,,,Research Council of Norway (NFR)Research Council of Norway,This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway (NFR).

This work has revealed some surprising results related to colonisation success and maintenance of populations. Dispersal from the mainland and between islands appears to be relatively easy because inter-island distances are small (tens or hundreds of metres) and the salinity of the Baltic is low, which allows survival during drift. This is reflected in the higher than expected proportion of brachypterous species on small islands. A lack of energetically expensive wings, flight muscles and flight fuel may give brachypterous species an advantage - in terms of resource allocation for survival and fecundity - over macropterous species in the colonisation of an island. Once an island is reached, successful colonisation mainly depends on the presence of suitable habitat. The most abundantly collected carabids on these islands are habitat generalists, but some degree of habitat association exists. Yet, the composition of carabid assemblages differs substantially among islands, possibly a result of chance effects. There is evidence that species on smaller islands occur in a wider variety of vegetation types than species on larger islands. Both habitat diversity and area per se are implicated in the positive species-area relationships found, but the small island effect has been identified as being significant in most of the archipelagoes investigated. Pterostichus melanarius, a eurytopic, wing-polymorphic species abundantly collected on the mainland is, unexpectedly, absent from small islands. Possible reasons for this include; (1) interspecific predation and competition for food by the closely related but slightly larger P. niger, which is dominant on small islands, (2) the apparent inability of P. melanarius to reproduce on small islands, (3) its reduced dispersal power as compared to P. niger and (4) the possible absence of some essential resources from small islands. In conclusion, the conservation value of highly threatened cultural landscapes on Baltic Sea islands, such as species rich wooded meadows, is discussed as well as the possible negative effects of climate change on carabid beetles.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65,Bioctr 3,Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Kotze, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65,Bioctr 3,Viikinkaari 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",johan.kotze@helsinki.fi,"Kotze, David J/A-2834-2008",,,,,90,14,15,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1366-638X,1572-9753,,J INSECT CONSERV,J.

Research on a key component of biodiversity, genetic diversity, has traditionally focused on its importance in evolutionary processes, but classical studies in evolutionary biology, agronomy and conservation biology indicate that genetic diversity might also have important ecological effects. Our review of the literature reveals significant effects of genetic diversity on ecological processes such as primary productivity, population recovery from disturbance, interspecific competition, community structure, and fluxes of energy and nutrients. Thus, genetic diversity can have important ecological consequences at the population, community and ecosystem levels, and in some cases the effects are comparable in magnitude to the effects of species diversity. However, it is not clear how widely these results apply in nature, as studies to date have been biased towards manipulations of plant clonal diversity, and little is known about the relative importance of genetic diversity vs. other factors that influence ecological processes of interest. Future studies should focus not only on documenting the presence of genetic diversity effects but also on identifying underlying mechanisms and predicting when such effects are likely to occur in nature.","[Hughes, A.

That is, asymmetric games where the payoffs for pairwise interactions are influenced by the ambient frequencies of the pertinent strategies of both types of players. While this paper is motivated by my interest in inter- and intra-gender conflicts of interest in sexual reproduction, BNL games also arise just as naturally in most two-species interactions. Thus, the methodology may provide a novel approach to investigating such classical ecological phenomena as prey-predator/host-parasite interactions and interspecies competition for resources. Finally, given the growing tendency to utilize evolutionary games in economic modeling, a case can be made for the current paper being of interest to traditional game-theoretic modelers in connection with situations such as buyer/seller or employer/employee interaction.

These important modifications allow the hypothesis that, under altered conditions in predator free insular environments, functional demands on neural performance are reduced, allowing a reduction in brain structures and associated sense organs. This is suggested, for example, by the small orbits and reduced visual brain structures of Myotragus balearicus Bate, 1909. These changes, which parallel those shown by domesticated animals, have been interpreted as an adaptive response to insular environmental conditions, in particular to a lack of interspecific competitors and predators. Results obtained from analysis of the smallest Cretan deer (Candiacervus ropalophorus de Vos, 1984, and Candiacervits spp. II) are not as outstanding as it is in Myotragus, and apparently run counter to the fact that dwarfed insular artiodactyls living in environments without any predation pressure would be characterised by a proportional decrease in brain volume as a rule. Brain/body mass proportion of the smallest Candiacervus species provides evidence that this endemic deer underwent only minor changes in the relative size of brain after its geographic isolation. On the other hand, orbit and foramen magnum size are proportionally reduced. Accordingly, different evolutionary process likely affected brain and sense organs changes of these endemic artiodactyls. Other factors, nature of available niches, interspecific competition, maybe island size and time from isolation, would have played a role in the possible differential evolution of insular ruminants in addition to the change in adaptive strategy for a more efficient energy use under the free-predators environmental conditions of the insular ecosystem.

This study is the first to test if the stress-gradient hypothesis is supported for a location in the climatically extreme and species-poor sub-Antarctic. To do so, we investigate the fine-scale spatial distribution of plant species across altitude- and aspect-related abiotic severity gradients on a scoria cone on Marion Island. A clear altitudinal severity gradient was observed across the scoria cone, with lower temperatures, stronger winds and greater soil movement at higher altitudes. The altitudinal severity gradient was matched by stronger interspecific spatial association between the four dominant species at higher altitudes and in areas of lower vegetation cover. This suggests that, relative to the intensity of competition, the intensity of facilitation is greater under more severe conditions, supporting the stress-gradient hypothesis at the community level (i.e. for multiple pairs of species) and corroborating its usefulness for predicting variation in plant interactions at high latitudes and altitudes. Furthermore, the directional intraspecific aggregation and interspecific association plant cover patterns found within the gradient suggest that protection from the prevailing wind and from burial by loose substrate are the dominant facilitative mechanisms. Thus, plants benefit from the presence of neighbours when they provide shelter and substrate stability, and the relative intensity of this positive interaction is greatest at higher altitudes, and varies between species pairs. This study, therefore, not only provides support for the stress-gradient hypothesis in the sub-Antarctic, but also demonstrates fine-scale directional spatial patterns between multiple species nested within the severity gradient.","[le Roux, Peter C.; McGeoch, Melodie A.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","le Roux, PC (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",pleroux@sun.ac.za,"le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011; McGeoch, Melodie A/F-8353-2011","le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; McGeoch, Melodie A/0000-0003-3388-2241",,,,57,37,39,0,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2008,155,4,,,,,831,844,,10.1007/s00442-007-0954-1,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,277TX,WOS:000254238700016,18253754,,,,2021-09-21,

The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.","[Aitken, Sally N.; Holliday, Jason A.; Wang, Tongli; Curtis-McLane, Sierra] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Forest Conservat Genet, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Aitken, Sally N.; Holliday, Jason A.; Wang, Tongli; Curtis-McLane, Sierra] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Yeaman, Sam] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Aitken, SN (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Ctr Forest Conservat Genet, 3041-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",sally.aitken@ubc.ca,"Yeaman, Sam/C-7778-2011; Wang, Tongli/AAC-8644-2020; Wang, Tongli/AAW-4427-2020","Yeaman, Sam/0000-0002-1706-8699; Wang, Tongli/0000-0002-9967-6769",NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); British Columbia Forestry Investment Account; Genome Canada and Genome BC; Treenomix Conifer Forest Health,"We thank Andreas Hamann, Pia Smets, Makiko Mimura and Andy Bower for access to unpublished data and helpful insights, Sarah P.

The size and demography of swamp antechinus (Antechinus minimus) populations located in a coastal mainland habitat and on a small offshore island in south-eastern Australia were investigated. Large demographic differences occurred between the two ecosystems, with the island population density often 100 times greater than that on the mainland. The swamp antechinus in the mainland habitat was influenced by extrinsic climatic forces, with juvenile recruitment, individual body mass and overall population size being affected by rainfall, a factor likely to influence food availability for the species. However, the island population did not appear to be affected by drought to the same degree where allochthonous marine nutrient inputs may have offset any drought-induced reduction in primary production. Significantly greater juvenile recruitment in the island habitats combined with restricted emigration and potentially reduced predation and interspecific competition are likely to be responsible for the high population densities on the island. Although island populations appear robust, future conservation efforts should focus on mainland populations given the genetic deficiencies in the island populations.","[Sale, Michael G.; Arnould, John P.

This activity pattern is quite widely observed among major mammal taxa, although the number of species involved is relatively low. Among primates, cathemerality is seen principally, though not uniquely, in the strepsirhine (lower primate) family Lemuridae; it is ubiquitous in the genus Eulemur, among species of which it seems to be a stable activity pattern with a history going back at least 8-12 million years. Nocturnal primates have visual systems that accentuate sensitivity to light over visual acuity, showing large cornea size, high rod:cone ratios and large numbers of photoreceptors relative to ganglion cells. Diurnal forms do the reverse, while Eulemur species are intermediate in these respects, suggesting substantial accommodation of the visual system to the cathemeral lifestyle. Studies of one Eulemur species have revealed that its cathemerality is underpinned by a robust endogenous circadian timing mechanism with a free-running periodicity of over 25 hours. The lemurs appear to be entrained to the 24-hour day by the light/dark cycle, plausibly with dusk as the primary zeitgeber. The causes of cathemerality have been sought in such environmental influences as predator avoidance, energy conservation, dietary quality, and interspecies feeding competition. All of these factors seem to be relevant to the cathemeral lifestyle, but none appears to be a crucial determinant. Nothing is known of the underlying neural mechanisms that facilitate the lemurs' accommodation to the extremes to which 24-hour activity exposes them.","Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Anthropol, New York, NY 10024 USA","Tattersall, I (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Anthropol, New York, NY 10024 USA.",iant@amnh.org,,,,,,77,9,9,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0929-1016,1744-4179,,BIOL RHYTHM RES,Biol.

We assessed species-specific habitat suitability based upon nutrient characteristics using larval survival rates (SR) and wing lengths (WL) from floating habitat enclosures. Anopheles albimanus showed a high SR (81%) in all three habitats, while An. vestitipennis had a similarly high SR in its own habitat (82%) and An. darlingi's habitat (8 1 %). Anopheles darlingi only showed high SR (85%) in its own habitat. Both An. vestitipennis and An. darlingi showed very low SR in the An. albimanus habitat. There were no significant WL differences among field-caught, laboratory-reared, and experimental populations of An. vestitipennis and An. albimanus, with the exception of An. vestitipennis experimental populations and An. vestitipennis field populations placed in the An. albimanus habitat. Habitat quality indicators, particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic nitrogen (PON), were consistently higher in An. vestitipennis habitats than in the habitats of the other two species. Correspondingly, An. vestitipennis adults were larger when measured both as dry mass and from WL. There were no differences in dry mass, lipids, or protein content among the same species reared at different locations. We compared SR and WL among mosquitoes from shaded and unshaded containers to test whether the high mortality rates for An. vestitipennis and An. darlingi in the An. albimanus habitat were due to intense sun exposure. There were no significant differences among developmental times, survivorship, or adult size for shaded versus sun-exposed populations. This indicates that other factors such as larval toxins, predator avoidance, interspecific species competition, etc. may be responsible for the higher mortality rates in those species not adapted to this particular habitat.","[Grieco, John P.; Achee, Nicole L.; Klein, Corinne N.; Andre, Richard; Roberts, Donald] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biometr, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Rejmankova, Eliska] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Grieco, JP (corresponding author), Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biometr, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",,,"Grieco, John/0000-0002-2080-8598",,,,38,16,17,0,21,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,CORONA,"1966 COMPTON AVE, CORONA, CA 92881 USA",1081-1710,1948-7134,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

We present a model of parental investment in which offspring unrelated to the parent have a competitive advantage over the parent's own offspring and take a larger share of investment. We show that this can weaken or, if the competitive advantage is great, reverse the predicted relationship between perceived parentage and parental investment. A moderate competitive advantage of extra-pair young over within-pair young could partly explain the lack of any clear relationship between paternal care and paternity in many studies, and could easily arise if females choose extra-pair partners for good genes. Our results are also relevant to interspecific avian brood parasitism. As parasites reared together with host offspring are often superior competitors, their hosts could benefit from increasing investment in response to suspected parasitism.","Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, Dept Biol, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England","Holen, OH (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, Dept Biol, PO Box 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",o.h.holen@bio.uio.no,,,,,,41,9,9,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Discussions about the use of biomolecular tools indicate that gene expression analysis with rotifers should be available in the next few years. Such analyses will be a great asset as they enable ecotoxicologists to study molecular mechanisms of toxicity. Rotifers also appear as useful tools in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites that find their way into aquatic ecosystems because their sensitivity to some of these substances is higher than that of cladocerans and algae. The nature and extent of the impact of potential endocrine disruptors on aquatic invertebrates is another poorly resolved issue for which rotifers are a promising tool. Indeed, rotifers seem to be particularly sensitive to androgenic and anti-antiandrogenic substances, whereas copepods and cladocerans are typically more affected by estrogens and juvenile hormone-like compounds. Besides their usefulness in these emerging fields of aquatic ecotoxicology, it was emphasized that research with rotifers on basic issues like, e.g., toxicant interference with predation, competition, or interspecific and interclonal variation in ecotoxicological tests is still needed.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Univ Liege, Lab Anim Ecol & Ecotoxicol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium","Snell, TW (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",terry.snell@biology.gatech.edu,,,,,,33,56,68,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,NOV,2007,593,,,,,,227,232,,10.1007/s10750-007-9045-x,,,6,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,206TF,WOS:000249205100025,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Evolutionary theories of senescence predict that the durability of somatic structures should relate to the length of reproductive life span. This prediction has recently been tested for red deer (Cervus elaphus): molariform teeth of males are smaller and less durable than those of females, which corresponds with sex differences in reproductive life span. However, general evidence that male teeth are smaller than expected by allometric rules as a consequence of sexual selection for increasing male body mass requires an interspecific comparison between dimorphic and nondimorphic ungulates. Here we investigate the relationship between cheek-teeth size ( occlusal surface area; OSA) and body mass in 123 species of extant ungulates. We found lower slopes for dimorphic species compared with nondimorphic ones and smaller OSA, relative to body mass, in males of dimorphic species compared with females of dimorphic species. Rates of evolution of OSA relative to rates of evolution of body mass were greater in females than in males and also greater in nondimorphic than in dimorphic species. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that sexual selection in polygynous male ungulates favors body size more than tooth size, with possible consequences in male senescence via early depletion of male teeth compared to females.","Univ Extremadura, Biol & Ethol Unit, Caceres 10071, Spain; Macaulay Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland","Carranza, J (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Biol & Ethol Unit, Caceres 10071, Spain.",,"Perez-Barberia, Javier/M-9847-2017; Carranza, Juan/E-4472-2010","Perez-Barberia, Javier/0000-0001-7513-5418; Carranza, Juan/0000-0002-0368-7173",,,,82,28,28,0,23,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

We studied whether the abundance of red wood ants Formica rufa -group is related to the breeding habitat selection, fecundity and offspring quality in the Eurasian treecreeper Certhia familiaris, an old-growth forest passerine. The nest-box occupancy data were gathered over a five-year study period, whereas the breeding performance analyses were based on a two-year data set. The abundance of wood ants, measured within 50 m around the nest-boxes, was not related to nest-box occupancy rate, fecundity or the physiological stress of nestlings. In contrast, the abundance of wood ants was negatively related to the offspring quality and life-history traits, such as lowered body mass, subcutaneous fat reserves, and tarsus length at fledging. Our results suggest that exploitative competition between distantly related taxa may have considerable and adverse influences on nestling quality as measured by body mass, subcutaneous, fat and tarsus length. Red wood ants may decrease the fitness of treecreepers as the lower body condition of nestlings has the potential to impair recruitment into the breeding population and, additionally, impair the future reproductive effort.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Finnish Fprest Res Inst, Kolari Res Stn, FIN-95900 Kolari, Finland","Jantti, A (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",markku.kuitunen@jyu.fi,"Sorvari, Jouni/I-5375-2014","Sorvari, Jouni/0000-0003-2668-7771",,,,38,18,18,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0908-8857,1600-048X,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

We examined the relative roles of seed availability and different biotic and abiotic factors for the diversity of an alpine plant community in southern Norway. Furthermore, because climate warming is predicted to be an important driver of alpine species diversity, we assessed how the relative impacts of dispersal and local interactions on diversity might change under experimental warming (open top chambers, OTCs). Addition of seeds from 27 regional species increased community diversity. The establishment of the species was negatively related both to the diversity of the existing system and the cover of the abundant dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala. These results show that both species dispersal limitation and local biotic interactions are important factors for alpine plant community diversity. Despite relatively harsh environmental conditions and low productivity, competition from the resident vegetation appeared to have a greater role for species establishment and diversity than facilitation and experimental warming. Higher temperature appeared to increase the negative relationship between resident species diversity and species establishment. This may suggest that climate warming can increase the role of interspecific competition for alpine plant community structure, and thus alter the long-term effects of biotic interactions on diversity.","Norwegian Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway","Klanderud, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, PO Box 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",kari.klanderud@umb.no,,,,,,50,46,49,3,47,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2007,116,8,,,,,1279,1288,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15906.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,199FH,WOS:000248681100003,,,,,2021-09-21,

One of the most inclusive and yet debatable hypotheses is the one that associates BMR with food habits, including habitat productivity. These effects have been widely investigated at the interspecific level under the assumption that for any given species all traits are fixed. Consequently, the variation among individuals is largely ignored. Intraspecific analysis of physiological traits has the potential to compensate for many of the pitfalls associated with interspecific analyses and, thus, to be a useful approach for evaluating hypotheses regarding metabolic adaptation. In this study, we investigated the effects of food quality, availability, and predictability on the BMR of the leaf-eared mouse Phyllotis darwini. BMR was measured on freshly caught animals from the field, since they experience natural seasonal variations in environmental factors ( and, hence, variations in habitat productivity) and diet quality. BMR was significantly correlated with the proportion of dietary plants and seeds. In addition, BMR was significantly correlated with monthly habitat productivity.

Transect sampling was carried out with pitfall, Corner, Winkler, and Malaise traps as well as manual capture. The material was identified to family level. A total of 3,691 individuals was captured, corresponding to 32 families. The families most abundant in numbers of individuals were Scolytidae (31.7%), Scarabaeidae (22.2%), and Staphylinidae (18.1%). The xilomycetophages (32.1%) were the dominant group, followed by the copro-necrophages (22.3%), predators (21.7%) and herbivores (11%). A comparison among years and habitats revealed differences in the abundance and composition of the families, as well as in the contribution of the trophic roles. The dry season shows a tendency to impoverishment. The marked spatial and temporal variation among seasons and years is associated with high diversity and would support the hypothesis that seasonality plays an important role in diluting interspecific competition for resources.","[Noriega, Jorge Ari; Fagua, Giovanny] Pontifica Univ Javeriana, Entomol Lab, Unidad Ecol & Sistemat, Bogota, Colombia; [Botero, Juan Pablo; Viola, Marcelo] Pontifica Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia","Noriega, JA (corresponding author), Pontifica Univ Javeriana, Entomol Lab, Unidad Ecol & Sistemat, Carrera 7a 4062, Bogota, Colombia.",jnorieg@hotmail.com,"Botero, Juan Pablo/M-6774-2017; Noriega, Jorge Ari/H-3662-2019","Botero, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-5547-7987; Noriega, Jorge Ari/0000-0003-1760-7020",,,,90,10,14,1,10,SOC COLOMBIANA ENTOMOLOGIA-SOCOLEN,SANTAFE DE BOGOTA,"APARTADO AEREO 11366, SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, D.C. 00000, COLOMBIA",0120-0488,,,REV COLOMB ENTOMOL,Rev.

It was found that only the vertical diameter of Great Spotted Woodpecker nest-hole openings and the entrance-hole area (49.2 mm, 17.8 cm(2) respectively) were significantly larger than the corresponding parameters in Middle Spotted Woodpeckers (44.9 mm, 16.2 cm(2)). The average tree diameter at nest-height was 42.7 cm in Great Spotted Woodpeckers and 38.2 cm in Middle Spotted Woodpeckers, and did not differ between the two species. There were no correlations between the tree diameter at nest height and nest height in either species. The small variation in hole-entrance diameters (CV <= 10%) and the distance that a predator had to reach to plunder the nest (>= 19 cm) are most likely to protect woodpeckers' broods against arboreal predators - mainly Pine Martens. It is concluded that the tree diameter at nest-height probably makes little or no difference with respect to avoidance by Middle Spotted Woodpeckers of competition with Great Spotted Woodpeckers.

Ontogeny involved partitioning of available food resources. The food choice of turbot < 30 mm standard length (L-S) included both planktonic-hyperbenthic prey (calanoid copepods and mysids) and epibenthic-endobenthic prey (chironomids and amphipods), whereas turbot >= 30 mm L-S fed mainly on hyperbenthic species (mysids and fishes). Conversely, for flounder, epibenthic-endobenthic prey were the most abundant prey items throughout development (harpactocoid copepods, oligochaetes and chironomids for fish < 40 mm L-S and oligochaetes, chironomids and amphipods for flounder >= 40 mm L-S). Thus, the highest degree of dietary overlap occurred between turbot < 30 mm and flounder >= 40 mm. Food composition for both turbot and flounder varied, however, according to exposure and predominant wind direction in the nursery area. For example, expressed as the ratio between the biomass of mysids and fishes consumed, the relative importance of mysids v. fishes as food source for turbot, varied from < 1 in the most sheltered area to 16 and 27 in the more open areas. Considerable differences in feeding incidence were recorded; mean +/- S.D. 58 +/- 20% for turbot < 30 mm L-S and 83 +/- 8% for turbot >= 30 mm L-S, as opposed to >= 85-90% for flounder irrespective of size. The lower feeding success of turbot < 30 mm L-S was related to mysid abundance, shown to vary spatially and temporally, and to density of flounder, indicating that food availability, and potentially interspecific competition, influence feeding of early juvenile turbot with implications for survival following settlement. Regarding variability in abundance, hyperbenthic prey, as mysids, are considered more variable than epi- and endobenthic organisms. Hence, in addition to the 'nursery size hypothesis', i.e. the positive relationship between abundance of recruits and extension of nursery areas, variability in food availability may explain the average lower recruitment of turbot as compared to other flatfishes, e.g. flounder.

Although our basic understanding of how top-down and bottom-up processes interact to determine food-web dynamics has advanced, we still lack insights into how complex interactions and feedbacks affect the dynamics and structure of food webs. It is now becoming increasingly clear that, in addition to energy transfer from one trophic level to the other, there is exchange of information between these levels facilitated by the release of infochemicals by the organisms. There is evidence from recent studies that the exchange of chemical information in freshwater ecosystems is likely to play a decisive role in shaping structure and functioning of these systems. Chemical communication among freshwater organisms mediates many aspects of both predation and interspecific competition, which play key roles in determining community structure and ecosystem functioning. For example, consumer-induced 7 defences in phytoplankton and zooplankton include modifications in the characteristics relating to life history, behaviour, morphology and biochemistry. These inducible defences affect trophic interactions by altering predator feeding rates through changes in attack rate or handling time, or both. Also host-specific fungal parasitism in phytoplankton is probably controlled by infochemicals. The motile fungi recognise their host by host-secreted compounds. Until now models describing the functioning of ecosystems mainly considered flows of biomass and energy. Integration of new knowledge about the role of chemical communication in these models may be one of the aims of ecological informatics. in this chapter I discuss how infochemicals may affect the dynamics and structure of planktonic food webs.","NIOO KNAW Ctr Limnol, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands","Van Donk, E (corresponding author), NIOO KNAW Ctr Limnol, Rijksstraatweg 6, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands.",e.vandonk@nioo.knaw.nl,"van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008","van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936",,,,101,56,57,0,53,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

Finding character displacement in a signalling trait suggests that the trait has diverged as a result of interspecific interactions such as competition, aggression, predation, or reproductive interference. We tested for character displacement of male nuptial coloration between sympatric species of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus spp.). The sympatric pairs consist of a large 'benthic' species, which feeds on benthic invertebrates, and a smaller planktivorous 'limnetic' species. Breeding males of both species develop red throats and blue bodies, although limnetic males appear brighter. To test for character displacement, we compared the nuptial colour of benthics and limnetics from two species-pair lakes (sympatric) with that of males from three similar allopatric lakes (only one species present). We measured the intensity of blue and red coloration using reflectance spectra taken from live fish. We found that allopatric males were intermediate between limnetic and benthic males in the intensity of red colour, indicating character displacement in that trait in sympatry. By contrast, we found no evidence for character displacement in blue intensity, although it differed sharply between the species pairs in one lake (Priest).

A recurrent question in ecology is the influence of environmental factors, particularly nutrients and climatic variables, on community structure and functioning, and their interaction with internal community processes (e.g. competition). 2. Perialpine lakes have been subject to two main kinds of human-induced changes over the last 50 years: eutrophication-reoligotrophication, represented by lake-specific changes in total phosphorus concentration (TP), and long-term global climatic change, captured by average winter temperature (AWT). 3. Changes in fish communities (abundance of seven species from fishery data) in 11 Perialpine lakes during 31 years (1970-2000) were investigated in relation to variation in TP and AWT using models incorporating the effects of fish maturation age, and potentially discriminating effects on adult survival and recruitment. 4. We show that phosphorus concentration affects fish abundance in species-specific ways. These effects are mediated by recruitment rather than by adult survival. Phosphorus effects are probably modulated by interspecific interactions, as increasing TP enhances total community biomass, which in turn is either positively or negatively associated with species abundance depending on species position in trophic chains. 5. Climatic change has very little effect on fish abundances, which is not consistent with the prediction of larger changes in species near their southern distribution boundary. 6. We propose several hypotheses to account for those findings, and place our study in the wider framework of community ecology.","CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; INRA, Ctr Alpin Rech Reseaux Troph Ecosyst Limniques, F-74203 Thonon Les Bains, France","Massol, F (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919,Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",francois.massol@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Massol, Francois/D-9872-2013","Massol, Francois/0000-0002-4098-955X",,,,50,28,29,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

To determine the function of one such root-colonizing fungus, Chaetomium elatum, the infectivity and composition of inoculum containing C. elatum were varied independently of and in association with the known mutualist Glomus intraradices under two light intensities. Maximum plant benefit occurred with mixtures of both G. intraradices and C. elatum and under high light intensity. Under low light intensity and in monoculture, C. elatum functioned as a weak pathogen that was able to kill host plants. Here, maximum plant mortality was associated with the highest levels of C. elatum infectivity. When G. intraradices was present, no negative impact of C. elatum was detected. Intraspecific interactions were important in predicting sporulation rates for both fungi, whereas no interspecific fungal interactions were detected. In the presence of G. intraradices. C. elatum appears to function as a commensalistic associate, neither impacting plant growth nor sporulation bv G. intraradices. Overall, C. elatum appears to be multifunctional, serving as both a rhizoplane and rhizophere fungus, opportunistically colonizing plant roots and only becoming pathogenic when resources are severely limited and intraspecific competition is high. This multifunctional strategy may be shared with other fungi that form similar structures in roots.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Plant Pathol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Stat, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Violi, HA (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Plant Pathol, 18905 SW 280 St, Homestead, FL 33031 USA.",hvioli@ifas.ufl.edu,,,,,,64,20,22,1,16,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,ST LOUIS,"PO BOX 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166-0299 USA",0002-9122,,,AM J BOT,Am.

Many of these studies have shown that the effects of richness on biomass change through time, but we have limited understanding of the mechanisms that produce these dynamic trends. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we manipulated the richness of freshwater algae in laboratory microcosms. We used two experimental designs ( additive and substitutive) that make different assumptions about how patches are initially colonized, and then tracked the development of community biomass from the point of initial colonization through a period of 6 - 12 generations of the focal species. We found that the effect of initial species richness on biomass production qualitatively shifted twice over the course of the experiment. The first shift occurred as species transitioned from density-independent to dependent phases of population growth. At this time, intraspecific competition caused monocultures to approach their respective carrying capacities more slowly than polycultures. As a consequence, species tended to over-yield for a brief time, generating a positive, but transient effect of diversity on community biomass. The second shift occurred as communities approached carrying capacity. At this time, strong interspecific interactions caused biomass to be dominated by the competitively superior species in polycultures. As this species had the lowest carrying capacity, a negative effect of diversity on biomass resulted in late succession. Although these two shifts produced dynamics that appeared complex, we show that the patterns can be fit to a simple Lotka-Volterra model of competition. Our results suggest that the effects of algal diversity on primary production change in a predictable sequence through successional time.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Cardinale, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",cardinale@lifesci.ucsb.edu,"Forshay, Ken/N-4068-2014; Forshay, Kenneth/P-3649-2015; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Forshay, Ken/0000-0002-2867-8492; Forshay, Kenneth/0000-0002-2867-8492; Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523",,,,48,76,78,2,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2007,88,4,,,,,929,939,,10.1890/06-0943,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,162QV,WOS:000246104600013,17536709,,,,2021-09-21,

This integrated study on the ecophysiological and individual morphological scale investigated the response, acclimation and adaptation of two desert shrubs, with different water-use strategies, to variations in water conditions. The experiments were carried out on two native dominant desert shrubs, Tamarix ramosissima and Haloxylon ammodendron, under three precipitation treatments (natural, double and no precipitation, respectively), in their original habitats on the southern periphery of Gurbantonggut Desert, Central Asia, during the growing season in 2005. Changes in photosynthesis, transpiration, leaf water potential, water-use efficiency, above-ground biomass accumulation and root distribution of the two species were examined and compared under the contrasting precipitation treatments. There were significant interspecific differences in water-use strategy and maintenance of photosynthesis under variation in precipitation. For the phreatophyte T. ramosissima, physiological activity and biomass accumulation rely on the stable groundwater, which shields it from fluctuation in the water status of the upper soil layers caused by precipitation. For the non-phreatophyte H. ammodendron, efficient morphological adjustment, combined with strong stomatal control, contributes to its acclimation to variation in precipitation. On account of its positive responses to increased precipitation, H. ammodendron is predicted to succeed in interspecific competition in a future, moister habitat.","Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Fukang Stn Desert Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Li, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Fukang Stn Desert Ecol, 40-3 S Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",liyan@ms.xjb.ac.cn,"Xu, Hao/Q-3590-2016","Xu, Hao/0000-0003-2976-5667",,,,33,129,178,5,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,,PLANT CELL ENVIRON,Plant Cell Environ.,APR,2007,30,4,,,,,399,409,,10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.001626.x,,,11,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,139GG,WOS:000244419700003,17324227,,,,2021-09-21,

Current reliance on bioclimatic envelope approaches ignores important biological processes such as interactions and dispersal. Although much debated, it is unclear how such processes might influence range shifting. Using individual-based modelling we show that interspecific interactions and dispersal ability interact with the rate of climate change to determine range-shifting dynamics in a simulated community with two growth forms-mutualists and competitors. Interactions determine spatial arrangements of species prior to the onset of rapid climate change. These lead to space-occupancy effects that limit the rate of expansion of the fast-growing competitors but which can be overcome by increased long-distance dispersal.

This approach currently assumes that the effects of water chemistry on acute Cu toxicity can be described with one single set of identical BLM parameters for all organisms. An important water characteristic is the concentration of Na, which protects aquatic organisms against Cu toxicity. Based on physiological considerations related to the mechanism of Cu toxicity and the possible role of Na therein, we hypothesized that an interspecies variability of the protective effect of sodium on Cu toxicity might exist among freshwater organisms. To test this hypothesis, acute 48-h toxicity assays with Cu were conducted with 16 field-collected cladoceran populations and a laboratory-reared clone of Ceriodaphnia dubia at Na concentrations of between 0.077 and 10 mM. Increased Na protected all but one population. Contrary to what the BLM predicts, however, an upper limit to this protective effect was observed for some populations at Na concentrations of greater than 4 mM. This may suggest that processes other than just Cu-Na competition at a single unidentate biotic ligand site may be involved in Cu toxicity. Between populations, conditional stability constants for binding of Na to the biotic ligand (log K-NaBL(*)), which quantify the protective effect of Na, varied between 2.2 and 4.4. Higher log K values generally were associated with more sensitive populations. Although a full mechanistic explanation for our observations is lacking, our data may potentially be used to refine the U.S. EPA procedure to establish site-specific water-quality criteria for Cu.","Univ Ghent, Lab Environm Toxicol & Aquat Ecol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","de Schamphelaere, KAC (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Lab Environm Toxicol & Aquat Ecol, J Plateaustr 22, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",karel.deschamphelaere@ugent.be,"Janssen, Colin R./H-3122-2015; De Schamphelaere, Karel AC/A-1600-2008","De Schamphelaere, Karel AC/0000-0002-5063-922X; Janssen, Colin/0000-0002-7781-6679",,,,43,17,17,1,21,SOCIETY ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY & CHEMISTRY-SETAC,PENSACOLA,"1010 NORTH 12TH AVE, PENSACOLA, FL 32501-3367 USA",0730-7268,,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

We studied the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) on chloroplast pigment traits of a red spruce (RS) (Picea rubens Sarg.)-black spruce (BS) (P. mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) genetic complex in two experiments: (1) a comparative species' provenance experiment from across the near-northern part of the RS range; and (2) an intra- and interspecific controlled-cross experiment. Results from the provenance experiment showed that total chlorophyll (a + b) concentration was, on average, 15% higher in ambient [CO2] than in elevated [CO2] (P < 0.001). In ambient [CO2], BS populations averaged 11% higher total chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations than RS populations (P < 0.001). There were significant species, CO2, and species x CO2 interaction effects, with chlorophyll concentration decreasing about 7 and 26% for BS and RS, respectively, in response to elevated [CO2]. Results from the controlled-cross experiment showed that families with a hybrid index of 25 (25% RS) had the highest total chlorophyll concentrations, and families with hybrid indices of 75 and 100 had among the lowest amounts. Initial analysis of the controlled-cross experiment supported a more additive model of inheritance; however, parental analysis showed a significant and predominant male effect for chlorophyll concentration. In ambient and elevated [CO2] environments, crosses with BS males had 10.6 and 17.6% higher total chlorophyll concentrations than crosses with hybrid and RS males, respectively. Our results show that chlorophyll concentration is under strong genetic control, and that these traits are positively correlated with productivity within and across species. A significant positive correlation between chlorophyll concentration and the ratio of total plant N to root dry mass was also found (r = 0.872). The almost fourfold decrease in chlorophyll concentration in RS suggests that it would be at a competitive disadvantage compared with BS in a high [CO2] environment.","Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada","Major, JE (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Atlantic Forestry Ctr, POB 4000, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada.",jmajor@nrcan.gc.ca,,,,,,59,22,23,0,17,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2007,27,3,,,,,353,364,,10.1093/treephys/27.3.353,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,148HX,WOS:000245066500004,17241977,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

A test with cacti and cactus-tending ants,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,OPTIMAL DEFENSE THEORY; EXTRAFLORAL NECTAR; PLANT-PROTECTION; POLLINATION; CACTACEAE; HERBIVORY; DYNAMICS; MYRMECOPHYTES; ALLOCATION; RESPONSES,"Interspecific facultative mutualisms typically involve guilds of interacting species, and species within a guild can vary in the quality of services they provide. For plants that secrete extrafloral nectar (EFN), visitation by multiple ant species that vary in anti-herbivore abilities may result in reduced benefits, relative to an exclusive association with a high-quality mutualist. This raises the intriguing problem of how facultative ant-plant mutualisms persist, given that EFN is costly to produce, yet may confer diminishing returns as partner diversity increases. I tested the prediction that association with two ant partners (Crematogaster opuntiae and Liometopum apiculatum) weakens benefits to the EFN-producing tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata). I found that only one ant (L. apiculatum) provided protection against herbivores and seed predators. However, this species associated with cacti more frequently than Crematogaster across multiple temporal scales. Within years, Liometopum showed greater constancy on plants they occupied, more frequently colonized vacant plants, and replaced but were never replaced by Crematogaster. Across years of plant development, Liometopum was more abundant on reproductive plants and showed greater overlap with cactus enemies. Simulations of cactus lifetime reproductive output indicated that associating with high- and low-quality mutualists did not significantly reduce plant benefits relative to an exclusive L. apiculatum-O. imbricata association. The results suggest that non-random interaction frequencies, possibly driven by competition, may contribute to the maintenance of facultative mutualisms involving multiple, qualitatively different partners.","Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Miller, TEX (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, 348 Manter Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",tmiller2@unl.edu,,,,,,51,63,67,2,30,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2007,116,3,,,,,500,512,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15317.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,143SD,WOS:000244743800015,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Elsewhere, it represents a high-value commodity crop. Change in the method of crop establishment from traditional manual transplanting of seedlings to direct-seeding has occurred in many Asian countries in the last two decades in response to rising production costs, especially for labor and water. Direct-seeding of rice (DSR) may involve sowing pregerminated seed onto a paddled soil surface (wet-seeding) or into shallow standing water (water-seeding), or dry seed into a prepared seedbed (dry-seeding). In Europe, Australia, and the United States, direct-seeding is highly mechanized. The risk of crop yield loss due to competition from weeds by all seeding methods is higher than for transplanted rice because of the absence of the size differential between the crop and weeds and the suppressive effect of standing water on weed growth at crop establishment. Of 1800 species reported as weeds of rice, those of the Cyperaceae and Poaceae are predominant. The adoption of direct-seeding has resulted in a change in the relative abundance of weed species in rice crops. In particular, Echinochloa spp., Ischaemum rugosum, Cyperus difformis, and Fimbristylis miliacea are widely adapted to conditions of DSR. Species exhibit variability in germination and establishment response to the water regime postsowing, which is a major factor in interspecifically selecting constituents of the weed flora. The relatively rapid emergence of weedy (red) rice, rice phenotypically similar to cultivars but exhibiting undesirable agronomic traits, has been observed in several Asian countries practicing DSR, and this poses a severe threat to the sustainability of the production system. Stale seedbeds, tillage practices for land leveling, choice of competitive rice cultivars, mechanical weeders, herbicides, and associated water management are component technologies essential to the control of weeds in DSR. Herbicides in particular are an important tool of weed management, but hand weeding is either partially or extensively practiced in countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Though yet to be globally commercialized, transgenic rice varieties engineered for herbicide resistance are a potential means of weed control. The release of herbicide-resistant rice for red rice control in the United States has indicated the need to critically examine mitigation methods for the control of gene flow. Integrating preventive and interventional methods of weed control remains essential in managing weed communities in DSR, both to prohibit the evolution of herbicide resistance and to maximize the relative contributions of individual components where herbicides are not widely used. There remains a need to further develop understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of rice weed competition and of the community dynamics of weed populations in DSR to underpin sustainable weed management practices.

Many studies have examined patches of remnant vegetation. but few have considered changes over many years. In our study, bird data were collected 22 years apart (survey period A (SPA), 1980-1983; survey period B (SPB), 2002-2005) in 20 forest remnants in a rural landscape in southeastern Australia. Initial modelling (SPA) predicted a decline of nine species per patch in the 100 years following fragmentation. Our data showed that average species richness declined by nine species per patch in just 22 years between SPA and SPB, perhaps representing an example of faunal relaxation. Observer variation, changes in climate, changes in land use, and interspecific competition from an aggressive edge-adapted native bird (the noisy miner, Manorina inelanocephala (Latham, 1802)) did not appear to be the main drivers of this decline. However, noisy miners were strongly associated with high turnover of forest species where they occurred above a threshold of six birds per count. Revisiting sites after an interval of many years has shed new light on the dynamics of a fragmented ecosystem, and indicates that further bird declines are likely as a result of past habitat loss.","Monash Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Clayton, Vic 3842, Australia; Monash Univ, Sch Appl Sci & Engn, Churchill, Vic 3842, Australia; Monash Univ, Inst Reg Studies, Churchill, Vic 3842, Australia; Monash Univ, Sch Appl Sci & Engn, Churchill, Vic 3842, Australia; Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia","MacHunter, J (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Northways Rd, Clayton, Vic 3842, Australia.",Josephie.MacHunter@sci.monash.edu.au,"Wright, Wendy/AAM-8059-2021","Wright, Wendy/0000-0003-3388-1273; Loyn, Richard/0000-0002-7337-0518",,,,45,27,29,0,16,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Three crucial issues that remain unresolved are: (1) the biotic and abiotic factors promoting evolution of migratory behavior, (2) the geographic origin of ancestral sedentary populations, and (3) the time scale over which migration evolves. We test the role of postglacial population expansions during the Quaternary in driving the evolution of songbird migration against prevailing views favoring the role of intraspecific competition. In contrast to previous attempts to investigate these questions using interspecific phylogenies, we adopt an intraspecific approach and examine the phylogeography of a North American songbird, the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina), which exhibits both long-distance migratory behavior in temperate North America and sedentary behavior in Mexico and Central America. We show that migratory populations descend from sedentary populations in southern Mexico and that migration has evolved as a result of a northward population expansion into temperate North America since the last glacial maximum 18,000 years ago. Migration appears to have evolved rapidly in some species as populations colonized areas of high seasonality in the temperate zone. The phylogeography of the yellow-eyed junco (Junco phaeonotus), a strictly sedentary species, provides a null model supporting the view that northward range expansions were driven solely by environmental factors and not by a predisposition to evolve migratory behavior. These results provide the strongest evidence to date that historical climate patterns can drive the rapid evolution of avian migration in natural populations, and they suggest I general mechanism for the repeated evolution of migration within and across bird lineages.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Trop Res, Inst Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Mila, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",bmila@ucla.edu,"Mila, Borja/L-4867-2014","Mila, Borja/0000-0002-6446-0079",,,,47,78,78,0,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,NOV,2006,60,11,,,,,2403,2409,,,,,7,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,119RO,WOS:000243031000019,17236431,,,,2021-09-21,

For each species, each generation is represented by one cohort. Cohorts of the same species form a chain representing the developmental stages of nematodes. A logistic function describes population growth in relation with: (i) an environmental carrying capacity (K) that depends on available banana root biomass, (ii) an intrinsic growth rate (c) and (iii) competition between nematode species. Soil water content and the quantity of nematicides used are considered to be the main variables influencing the intrinsic population growth rate of each species. SIMBA-NEM was calibrated and validated using datasets from banana cropping systems in Guadeloupe (French West Indies). By analysing the sensitivity of the model to the main parameters and performing simulations of validation for various cropping systems (banana monoculture with or without nematicide applications use and a banana/sugarcane rotation) we were able to test the ability of the model to predict nematode population dynamics under a range of conditions. SIMBA-NEM is able to predict long-term nematode population size, while taking interspecific competition into account. It also helped to define knowledge gaps in nematology and modelling. SIMBA-NEM was used to optimise the effect of nematicide applications. SIMBA-NEM can already be a very helpful tool for designing sustainable and more environment-friendly banana cropping systems. In the SIMBA global crop-modelling environment, SIMBA-NEM is a key sub-model which provides essential information concerning the sustainability of the simulated system and thus permits planning environmentally friendly cropping systems.

Annual mortality rates were calculated after estimating the number of individuals of each cohort remaining 1-18 mos after fish were stocked. Lighted larval fish traps were deployed at seven reintroduction sites and the Type Locale to determine whether topminnows could reproduce in the presence of the introduced-transplanted Western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis. At stocking sites harboring mosquitofish (n = 12), their density ranged from 0.4 to 66.3 mosquitofish per m(2). Annual mortality of stocked Barrens topminnows ranged from 45 to 100% and 24 cohorts experienced annual mortality greater than 95%. Mortality was not related to mosquitofish density or the mean size at stocking. The robustness of Barrens topminnows did not differ in the presence or absence of mosquitofish, suggesting that interspecific competition for food was not occurring. Larval Barrens topminnows were collected at two reintroduction sites and the Type Locale, but juvenile recruits were produced only at sites lacking mosquitofish. The findings of this study, and concurrent laboratory studies, support the hypothesis that mosquitofish predation on larval Barrens topminnows was the primary mechanism in failed reintroductions and is the greatest threat to wild and reintroduced populations of this imperiled species.","Tennessee Technol Univ, US Geol Survey, Tennessee Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; Tennessee Technol Univ, Tennessee Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA","Bettoli, PW (corresponding author), Tennessee Technol Univ, US Geol Survey, Tennessee Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA.",pbettoli@tntech.edu,,"Goldsworthy, Cory/0000-0003-0920-2840",,,,27,16,19,0,14,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

Animals were monitored for > 7 days to examine spatial and temporal variation in their behaviour as the tides transited from a semi-diurnal to an almost diurnal pattern. Movement was synchronised with the tides, irrespective of the day-night cycles. Limpets rested low on the shore and were stimulated to move by the rising tide. Individuals moved up shore with the flooding tide, maintaining themselves in the awash zone, and then down shore on the ebbing tide, until they reached a resting height when the tide then fell beneath them, exhibiting 'zonal shuttling'. A tight coupling of limpet position to tide height persisted through the changing tidal pattern, and almost all animals displayed the same organisation of activity over all tides. Initiation of activity and maximum height reached were probably controlled by the tides, but the cessation of activity may have been controlled by an internal clock. The pattern observed is consistent with the threat of attack from aquatic predators coupled with the need to minimise physical stresses while exposed. It is also consistent with the avoidance of grazing lower on the shore where interspecific competition may be more intense. Limpets showed two peaks of activity per tide, corresponding to when the rate of change of tide height was the greatest, except when tides became much reduced during the transit to a diurnal pattern. Movement was triphasic: an initial rapid phase, followed by a slower phase in the high shore and then a rapid phase before the limpets stopped moving. This structure is common in limpets and in this case is likely to be a consequence of animals maintaining themselves within the awash zone.

Six cestode species were found: Tetraphyllideans Calliobothrium barbarae, C. australis, C lunae and Orygmatobothrium schmittii, diphyllidean Echinobothrium notoguidoi and trypanorhynch Eutetrarhynchus vooremi. The most common number of parasite species per host was 3. Brillouin's diversity index ranged from 0.1 to 1.2. Berger-Parker dominance index indicated that C barbarae was the dominant species, followed by O. schmittii and C. australis. Calliobothrium barbarae, C australis and O. schmittii presented a broad distribution along the spiral intestine, whereas C. lunae, E. notoguidoi and E. vooremi showed a more restricted niche breadth. In general, the Renkonen's index showed no evidence of niche overlap in the range of distribution of the different species. In most of the infracommunities, intraspecific aggregation was stronger than interspecific aggregation, indicating that competition may play a little role. The distribution patterns of the Calliobothrium specimens concurs with the predictions of attachment sites for Calliobothrium species made by previous authors.","Univ Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biol, Parasitol Lab, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Expt, Lab Helmintol, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Alarcos, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biol, Parasitol Lab, Funes 3350, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina.",jalarcos@mdp.edu.ar,,,,,,35,9,9,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1230-2821,1896-1851,,ACTA PARASITOL,Acta Parasitolog.,JUN,2006,51,2,,,,,100,106,,10.2478/s11686-006-0015-7,,,7,Parasitology; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,Parasitology; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,056VN,WOS:000238553300004,,Green Published,,,2021-09-21,

Collecting, handling, sorting, holding, and transporting are routine practices that can have significant effects on fish physiology and survival. Nevertheless, an understanding of the stressors affecting fish holding can lead to practices that reduce stress and its detrimental effects. The stress-related effects of short-term holding are influenced by water quality, confinement density, holding container design, and agonistic and predation-associated behaviors. Physiological demands (e.g., resulting from confinement-related stresses) exceeding a threshold level where the fish can no longer compensate may lead to debilitating effects. These effects can be manifested as suppressed immune systems; decreased growth, swimming performance, or reproductive capacity; even death. Furthermore, holding tolerance may depend upon the species, life stage, previous exposure to stress, and behavior of the held fish. Water quality is one of the most important contributors to fish health and stress level. Fish may be able to tolerate adverse water quality conditions; however, when combined with other stressors, fish may be quickly overcome by the resulting physiological challenges. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, salinity, pH, carbon dioxide, alkalinity, and hardness are the most common water quality parameters affecting physiological stress. Secondly, high fish densities in holding containers are the most common problem throughout aquaculture facilities, live-fish transfers, and fish salvage operations. Furthermore, the holding container design may also compromise the survival and immune function by affecting water quality, density and confinement, and aggressive interactions. Lastly, fishes held for relatively short durations are also influenced by negative interactions, associated with intraspecific and interspecific competition, cannibalism, predation, and determining nascent hierarchies. These interactions can be lethal (i.e., predation) or may act as a vector for pathogens to enter (i.e., bites and wounds). Predation may be a significant source of mortality for fisheries practices that do not sort by size or species while holding. Stress associated with short-term holding of fishes can have negative effects on overall health and well-being. These four aspects are major factors contributing to the physiology, behavior, and survival of fishes held for a relatively short time period.","US Bur Reclamat, Fisheries & Wildlife Resources Grp, Denver, CO 80225 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Portz, DE (corresponding author), US Bur Reclamat, Fisheries & Wildlife Resources Grp, 86-68290 Tech Serv Ctr, Denver, CO 80225 USA.",deportz@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,319,221,235,4,130,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,1573-5184,,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

The study took place at three locations in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, and examined bird behaviour, intensity of feeding, and the consequences for seedling emergence. The coincidence between the bird breeding season and fruit ripening of R. alaternus in the absence of other ripe fruit, generates a monospecific interaction. The extant frugivorous species were mainly legitimate seed dispersers and their abundance was low. Sylvia melanocephala and S. undata were the most important at one site whereas S. atricapilla, Erithacus rubecula and Turdus merula predominated at the other two sites. Fruit handling took place directly on the branches. Bird species used microhabitats differently as first post-feeding perch, which usually was a short distance away. The low density of frugivorous birds in all localities, among others factors, resulted in satiation of the disperser community and many mature fruits unconsumed. Both adults and juveniles feed upon the plants and their foraging patterns are similar. Adults of S. melanocephala were observed to feed fruit to nestlings and consequently a second phase of dispersal potentially arises from the transport of fecal sacs. Pulp removal and passage through the digestive tract increased the probability of seedling emergence. This plant-dispersal interaction has important consequences, both positive and negative for the plant. Positively, the fruiting of R. alaternus at a time when other ripe fruits are not available avoids interspecific competition for seed dispersers. In addition, a low density of seed rain may reduce intraspecific competition. Negatively, the low density and small size of the breeding frugivorous bird community limit fruit handling and removal away from the parent plants, while the territorial behaviour of birds at that time of the year reduces the potential distances of seed dispersal.","Univ Girona, Dept Ciencies Ambientals, Girona 17071, Spain","Bas, JM (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Dept Ciencies Ambientals, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",josep.bas@udg.es,"Gomez, Crisanto/AAA-3501-2019; Pons, Pere/B-9472-2008; Bas Lay, Josep Maria/K-7626-2014","Gomez, Crisanto/0000-0002-5430-2253; Pons, Pere/0000-0002-2196-5544; Bas Lay, Josep Maria/0000-0001-5567-5214",,,,46,17,19,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAR,2006,183,1,,,,,77,89,,10.1007/s11258-005-9008-0,,,13,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,051JS,WOS:000238158000009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Accordingly, changes in potential feeding time may predict the direction and magnitude of differences between elevations in individual growth rates of sessile marine invertebrates. Oysters (triploid Crassostrea ariakensis) experimentally introduced at intertidal (MLW+0.05 m) and subtidal (MLW-0.25 m) elevations in racks provided a test of the ability to use duration of water coverage to predict changes in growth. During early-to-mid winter, a depression of 38-47% in shell growth of intertidal oysters matched the 36% reduction in available feeding time relative to subtidal oysters. In late winter as solar heating of exposed oysters increased, growth differences of 52-55% departed only slightly from the predicted 39%. In spring, however, duration of water coverage failed to predict even the correct direction of growth change with elevation as intertidal oysters grew 34% faster despite 39% less feeding time. Intense seasonal development of shell fouling by other suspension feeders like ascidians, mussels, and barnacles on subtidal (94% incidence) but not on aerially exposed intertidal (21-38% incidence) oysters may explain why duration of water cover failed to predict spring growth differences. Less intense fouling develops on intertidal oysters due to the physiological stress of aerial exposure on settlers, especially during higher temperatures and longer solar exposures of spring. Fouling by suspension feeders is known to reduce growth of the host through localized competition for food and added energetic costs. Thus, in springtime, indirect effects of aerial exposure providing a partial refuge from biological enemies overwhelmed direct effects of reduced duration of water coverage to reverse the expected pattern of slower intertidal growth of a marine invertebrate.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Bishop, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Gore Hill, NSW 2065, Australia.",Melanie.Bishop-1@uts.edu.au,,"Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500",,,,34,30,31,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2006,147,3,,,,,426,433,,10.1007/s00442-005-0273-3,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,017PT,WOS:000235706200005,16249896,,,,2021-09-21,

However, most studies do not test whether both participants benefit. Myrmecochory, or seed dispersal by ants, is characterized by a lipid-rich appendage, or elaiosome, on a seed. Typically, ants gather the diaspores (i.e., seeds with elaiosomes), carry them to the nest, consume the elaiosome, and discard the seed unharmed either inside the nest or on a refuse pile. The benefit to the ants is presumably the nutritional content of the elaiosome, whereas benefits to the plant include dispersal from the parent plant, protection from predators, reduced seedling competition, protection from fire, or transportation to nutrient-rich microsites. Most studies of myrmecochory focus on potential benefits to the plants and simply assume that ants receive a benefit from consuming elaiosomes. I tested whether Pogonomyrmex californicus benefits from consuming Datura wrightii and D. discolor elaiosomes by raising newly-mated queens (i.e., foundresses) on different diets and measuring their survival and brood production. Foundresses reared solely on D. wrightii or D. discolor had similar probabilities of surviving and producing brood as foundresses fed a standard diet, but the number and developmental stage of the brood produced was severely reduced. Because the initial number of brood produced is critical for successful colony establishment, the future fitness of foundresses consuming only Datura is likely reduced. In addition, adding Datura to a standard diet did not increase queen survival or brood production. Although it is possible that Datura may help sustain a colony through periods of scarcity, P californicus do not appear to receive nutritional benefits from myrmecochorous interactions with Datura in the northern Sonoran Desert.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Marussich, WA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 210088, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",wmarussi@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,73,13,14,0,16,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0020-1812,1420-9098,,INSECT SOC,Insect.

Understanding why seals in Glacier Bay are declining may clarify their minimal habitat needs. We estimated population trends using models that controlled for environmental and observer-related factors. In 1992, 6,200 seals were Counted on icebergs in a tidewater glacial fjord and at terrestrial sites; by 2002 only 2,550 seals were counted at these same haul-outs. Numbers of non-pups in the glacial fjord declined by 6.6% /yr (-39%6/8 yr) in June and by 9.6%/yr (-63%/11 yr) in August and at all other haul-outs by 14.5%/yr (-75%/ 10 yr) during August. In the glacial fjord the number of pups remained steady from 1994 to 1999 and made up an increasing proportion of seals Counted (5.4%/yr), and the proportion Of pups peaked at 34%-36%. The rapid declines do not appear to be due to changes in seal behavior or redistribution. The declines reinforce genetic evidence that harbor seals in Glacier Bay are demographically isolated from other populations and indicate that Current management stocks need to be redefined. Changes in Glacier Bay's ecosystem and population demographic data from the glacial Fjord Suggest that interspecific competition and predation are likely factors in the declines.","Univ Alaska SE, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Wildlife Conservat, Douglas, AK 99824 USA","Mathews, EA (corresponding author), Univ Alaska SE, 11120 Glacier Highway, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.",beth.mathews@uas.alaska.edu,,,,,,61,63,66,0,18,SOC MARINE MAMMALOGY,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMPSHIRE ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0824-0469,,,MAR MAMMAL SCI,Mar.

Additionally, changes associated with feeding and swimming were taken into account while considering the origin of the morphological reductions described for adult G. bergi that sets the species apart from the rest of the Characidae. During the ontogeny of G. bergi, pre-metamorphic larvae have a subventral mouth, allowing benthivorous feeding. During metamorphosis, the mouth shifts to a terminal position, teeth change to multicuspidate, and the short, simple gut develops a loop and pyloric caecae. Juveniles shift their diet to feed on periphytic algae. Scale disappearance in juveniles and adults involves the cessation of scale growth and a rapid re-absorption process. Several situations differ from the other species of this family: (a) the rhinosfenoides and the uroneural 2 never appear, even not as cartilaginous pieces, (b) the fourth basibranchial never undergoes ossification, (c) pseudourostyle, uroneural 1 and extrascapulae are reduced in adults, (d) infraorbitals are also reduced in size and number in adults, (e) scales form during metamorphosis but disappear during the juvenile and adult period. These differences are considered to be a consequence of low interspecific competition, low predation and small population size, allowing regression phenomena.","Univ Nacl Comahue, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Univ Nacl Comahue, Delegac Reg Patagonia, Adm Parques Nacl, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Cussac, V (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Quintral 1250, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",vcussac@crub.uncoma.edu.ar,,"Cussac, Victor/0000-0001-6406-1855",,,,41,13,15,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0175-8659,1439-0426,,J APPL ICHTHYOL,J.

Its unifying role is built on two assumptions, imported from terrestrial habitat science and not always stated explicitly: that competition is present interspecifically and intraspecifically under at least some conditions, and that habitat features have some persistence and predictability in space and time. Consistent with its central conceptual position in ecology, habitat science has contributed importantly to scientific advice on pollution, coastal zone management and many other areas of environmental quality, although it has been largely divorced from developments in fish populations dynamics done in support of fisheries management. Commitments by most management agencies to apply an integrated, ecosystem approach to management of human activities in marine systems, poses new challenges to marine science advisors to management. Integrated management and ecosystem approaches both inherently require spatial thinking and spatial tools, making habitat science a particularly relevant advisory framework, particularly because of the unifying role of habitat in ecology. The basic mechanisms behind ocean biological dynamics, productivity, concentration and retention, however, present much weaker opportunities for competition and less persistence and predictability, weakening the foundations of theory and concepts behind current habitat science. The paper highlights the new types of thinking about 'habitat' that will be required, if habitat science is to meet the advisory needs of the new approaches to management.

We tested whether metabolic rates change on islands. Using a closed circuit respirometer, we investigated resting metabolic rate (RMR) of three species of Crocidurinae shrews: Suncus etruscus, Crocidura russula, and C. suaveolens. For the latter, we compared energy expenditure of mainland and island populations. Our measurements agree with those previously reported for others Crocidurinae: the interspecific comparison (ANCOVA) demonstrated an allometric relation between energy requirements and body mass. Energy expenditure also scaled with temperature. Island populations (Corsica and Porquerolles) of C suaveolens differed in size from mainland (gigantism). A GLM showed a significant relationship between energy expenditure, temperature, body mass and locality. Mass specific RMR allometrically scales body mass, but total RMR does not significantly differ between mainland and island, although island shrews are giant. Our results are consistent with other studies: that demonstrated that the evolution of mammalian metabolism on islands is partially independent of body mass. In relation to the insular syndrome, we discuss how island selective forces (changes in resource availability, decrease in competition and predation pressures) can operate in size and physiological adjustments.

The following was investigated: whether (a) the altitudinal distribution and abundance of each psyllid species was determined by summer heat budgets, acting directly on rates of insect development and/or through their host plant and (b) whether parasitism, predation, and interspecific competition played any role in restricting the distribution of the two species. 3. Craspedolepta nebulosa extended to higher elevations than C. subpunctata but within their ranges neither species showed a clear altitudinal trend in abundance per plant. However, the former species grew to a smaller size with increasing elevation. 4. There was little evidence for interspecific competitive effects and observed levels of parasitism and predation were negligible across the transect. 5. Development and distribution of both species mirrored significant differences in the phenology, size, leaf number, and reproductive output of E. angustifolium with increasing altitude. 6. Distributions were related to available heat budgets acting on psyllid/plant development rates, with C. nebulosa developing more efficiently at lower heat availability. 7. Population transplant experiments supported the overall conclusions, with neither psyllid species able to establish viable populations above their current upper altitudinal range limit, despite the presence of their host plant.","Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Biol & Earth Sci, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England","Hodkinson, ID (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Biol & Earth Sci, Byrom St, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",i.d.hodkinson@livjm.ac.uk,,,,,,51,19,21,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability. 2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature. 3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change. 4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.","NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland","Hulme, PE (corresponding author), NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Kincardine, Scotland.",pehu@ceh.ac.uk,"Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011","Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474",,,,92,254,271,2,237,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The winter fattening model suggests that birds increase their minimum (morning) mass in cold weather, build up their mass during the day, and then rely on the energy reserves so accumulated until the morning. While data from mid and high latitudes support this model, little is known about the strategies of birds inhabiting lower latitudes (< 40 degrees N). We use an 18-year data set to investigate whether the winter fattening model holds in a mid-latitude (32 degrees N) population of the Clamorous Reed Warbler Acrocephalus stentoreus. We show that morning mass and fat score vary as predicted by the winter fattening model. In addition, adults appear to be better adapted to long and cold winter nights than first-year birds.

Roost-site selection by these species was investigated, with respect to roost-site supply and interspecific competition. Bats selected tree-hollows that had certain specific features; older tree-hollows, rotted in their roofs, often originally woodpecker holes. Different roost-site characteristics were found between the studied bat species;M. daubentonii and N. noctula occupied narrow but high-in-dimensions tree-hollows; M. nattereri and N. noctula preferred hollows located higher up, N. noctula avoided hollows with an entrance diameter less than 5 cm. and preferred trees with a greater trunk diameter, M. nattereri and M. daubentonii also occupied hollows in thinner trunks (branches); all bat species preferred ashes for roosts. A high recapture rate, especially of adult females, indicated that this bat community was stable and had strong fidelity to the site. However, the density of these tree-dwelling bat species was several times higher than in typical forest conditions. Bat competitors and predators and the presence of other bat species living in the same parkland were also recorded. Because it has a large number of tree-hollows, this parkland is an important habitat for tree-dwelling bats, thus significantly contributing to the biodiversity of the landscape.","Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, SK-96053 Zvolen, Slovakia","Kanuch, P (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Sturova 2, SK-96053 Zvolen, Slovakia.",kanuch@savzv.sk,"Kanuch, Peter/A-5416-2011","Kanuch, Peter/0000-0003-2001-4541",,,,43,7,9,2,27,VERSITA,WARSAW,"SOLIPSKA 14A-1, 02-482 WARSAW, POLAND",0006-3088,,,BIOLOGIA,Biologia,SEP,2005,60,5,,,,,579,587,,,,,9,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,993VM,WOS:000233983500024,,,,,2021-09-21,

Its underlying mechanism is reduced intraspecific aggression while keeping interspecific competitiveness. To that effect, we present here a comparative behavioural and chemical study of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata in parts of its native and introduced ranges. We tested the hypothesis that introduced populations (New Caledonia archipelago) have reduced intraspecific aggression relative to native populations (e.g., Ilheus area, Brazil) and that this correlates with reduced variability in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). As predicted, there was high intraspecific aggression in the Brazilian populations, but no intraspecific aggression among the New Caledonian populations. However, New Caledonian worker W. auropunctata remained highly aggressive towards ants of other invasive species. The chemical data corresponded with the behaviour. While CHCs of ants from the regions of Brazil diverged, the profiles of ants from various localities in New Caledonia showed high uniformity. We suggest that in New Caledonia W. auropunctata appears to behave as a single supercolony, whereas in its native range it acts as a multicolonial species. The uniformity of recognition cues in the New Caledonia ants may reflect a process whereby recognition alleles became fixed in the population, but may also be the consequence of a single introduction event and subsequent aggressive invasion of the ecosystem. Chemical uniformity coupled with low intraspecific but high interspecific aggression, lend credence to the latter hypothesis.","Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, Inst Rech Biol Insecte, CNRS,UMR 6035, F-37200 Tours, France; UESC, Convenio CEPLAC, UPA Lab Mirmecol, BR-45600000 Itabuna, BA, Brazil; IRD, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel","Errard, C (corresponding author), Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, Inst Rech Biol Insecte, CNRS,UMR 6035, Parc Grandmont, F-37200 Tours, France.",christine.errard@univ-tours.fr,"Hefetz, Abraham/I-3853-2015; Jourdan, Herve/D-1452-2011","Jourdan, Herve/0000-0002-3756-4008; Delabie, Jacques Hubert Charles/0000-0002-2695-1061",,,,24,47,51,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-1042,,,NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,Naturwissenschaften,JUL,2005,92,7,,,,,319,323,,10.1007/s00114-005-0628-y,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,952QK,WOS:000231020400004,15973547,,,,2021-09-21,

In environments with fish, however, the higher losses of the large bodied species due to size-selective predation may shift the balance in favor of the small bodied species. Here we present a theoretical framework for the analysis of the competitive abilities of zooplankton species that takes both competition and predation into account in one coherent analysis. By applying the conceptually well-understood framework of physiologically structured population models we were able to predict the relative difference in predation rates necessary to cause a shift in dominance of the large-bodied species (Daphnia pulicaria) to the small-bodied species (D. galeata). These predictions depend only on seven easily interpretable parameters per species: size at birth, size at maturity and maximum size, age at maturity, maximal clutch size, egg development time and finally the half-saturation constant for food. The critical equilibrium mortality of D. pulicaria was 0.16 d(-1) at food concentrations close to the critical food concentration of D. galeata, i.e. D. pulicaria will win the competition as long as its mortality rate is below 0.16 d(-1). At higher food concentrations the differential mortality curve (plotting equilibrium mortalities of both species against each other) approached a linear function with a slope of one and an intercept equal to the difference in maximal population birth rates. The prediction of critical predation rates was independent of the ingestion rate of the cladocerans and the algal carrying capacity and food regeneration rate of the environment although the mechanism works through competition for a shared algal food resource. We interpret these findings in terms of the relative predation risk large and small-bodied cladocerans will face in various freshwater ecosystems.","Ctr Limnol, Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO, KNAW, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands; Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrobiol, DE-01062 Dresden, Germany","Hulsmann, S (corresponding author), Ctr Limnol, Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO, KNAW, Rijksstraatweg 6, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands.",stephan.huelsmann@mailbox.tu-dresden.de,"Hulsmann, Stephan/N-3889-2018; Hulsmann, Stephan/K-9146-2015; Mooij, Wolf M/C-2677-2008; Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016","Hulsmann, Stephan/0000-0002-9569-7626; Hulsmann, Stephan/0000-0002-9569-7626; Mooij, Wolf M/0000-0001-5586-8200; Rinke, Karsten/0000-0003-0864-6722",,,,70,18,21,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2005,110,1,,,,,43,54,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13341.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,925RD,WOS:000229069700004,,,,,2021-09-21,

Natural enemies (e.g., predators, parasites, and herbivores) are ubiquitous in food webs and are predicted to have significant impacts on phenotypic diversity and on speciation, and extinction rates of their prey. Spurred by the development of a theoretical framework beginning in the late 1970s, there is now a growing body of literature that addresses the effects of enemy-prey interactions on the evolution of prey. A number of theoretical models predict that enemies can produce phenotypic divergence between closely related species, even in the absence of interspecific competition for resources. Effects on diversification of prey are more variable, and enemies may either enhance or depress speciation and extinction rates of their prey. Empirical evidences from a number of study systems, notably those involving predators and prey in aquatic environments and interactions between insects and flowering plants, confirm both predictions. There is now considerable evidence for the role of enemies, especially those that are size-selective or use visual cues when identifying suitable prey, on phenotypic divergence of sympatric and allopatric taxa. Enemies may spur diversification rates in certain groups under some circumstances, and hinder diversification rates in other cases. I suggest that further research should focus on the role of enemies in diversification of prey, with significant insights likely to be the product of applying traditional experimental approaches and emerging comparative phylogenetic methods.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Vamosi, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",smvamosi@ucalgary.ca,"Vamosi, Steven/C-8126-2009","Vamosi, Steven/0000-0003-3903-5000",,,,175,107,111,0,69,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

In contrast, stochastic models propose that simulation algorithms can replicate the macroecological patterns, if not the mechanisms, of community assembly. Despite fundamental differences in assumptions, both categories of models assume that species are drawn from regional source pools. We explored the implications of source pool geometry on the assembly of avian communities with an analysis of assemblage dispersion fields, which can be visualized by overlaying the geographic ranges of all species that occur in an assemblage. Contours of species richness surrounding focal quadrats illustrate the decay rate of assemblage similarity with distance and the probable geometry of assemblage source pools. We used a geographic database for 2,891 species of South American birds to characterize dispersion fields for assemblages sampled by 1 degrees latitude-longitude quadrats (n = 1,676). We show that the median range size of dispersion fields varies by an order of magnitude across the continent. Because abundance generally correlates with geographic range size within taxonomic groups, the number of individuals per species in avifaunal source pools must also vary by an order of magnitude. Most significantly, dispersion field geometry was surprisingly asymmetrical and exhibited complex geographical patterns that were associated with the distribution of biomes. These results are broadly consistent with the predictions of niche-assembly models but offer little support for stochastic assembly models.","Smithsonian Inst, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20013 USA; Univ Copenhagen, Inst Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Graves, GR (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Vertebrate Zool, MRC-116,POB 37012, Washington, DC 20013 USA.",gravesg@si.edu,"Rahbek, Carsten/D-9372-2013; White, Ethan P/A-2936-2008; Rahbek, Carsten/L-1129-2013; Allen, Andrew/B-8045-2011; Graves, Gary R/P-1003-2017","Rahbek, Carsten/0000-0003-4585-0300; Allen, Andrew/0000-0003-0304-7544; Graves, Gary R/0000-0003-1406-5246",,,,70,94,94,0,24,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

It is a semi-continuous breeder and despite producing small numbers of large eggs, infestation by this animal has reached epidemic proportions on local abalone farms. The present study compared the morphometrics and reproductive characteristics of worms from farmed and wild abalone, in the Walker Bay area of the south Western Cape Province of South Africa, to gain insights into why this animal has become so successful under aquaculture conditions. The farms designated farm A and farm B each had one on-farm site, and two wild sites, while farm C had two on-farm sites and two wild sites. The wild sites were natural abalone habitats located within 2.5 km of the farms. Our results conclusively showed that environmental conditions prevalent on the farms enhanced the reproductive success of these worms relative to that observed in its natural environment. At farms B and C, worms occurred in significantly higher densities at the on-farm sites than in the corresponding wild samples, but at farm A, density was equally low at the three sites. At all three farms, a greater proportion of the population was reproductively active in the on-farm samples than in the wild samples. Worms on farmed abalone had a higher instantaneous fecundity, brooded more clutches simultaneously and were larger than their conspecifics from the wild. There was a positive correlation between adult size and brood size and the number of clutches brooded simultaneously. Within the three on-farm sites there was a negative correlation between egg volume and brood size, indicating a trade-off between these traits. However, such a trade-off was not apparent between sites, with brood size being higher at the on-farm sites than at the wild sites, irrespective of egg size. This suggests that the stable nutrient-enriched environment on the farm led to an increase in fecundity without compromising the size (and implicitly the quality) of the eggs. Worm density did not have a significant effect on body size or any other reproductive traits at most sites, and the density of T. heterouncinata was unaffected by the density of other shell-infesting polychaetes. The results suggest that the farm environment has selected for larger, more fecund worms that breed rapidly with high recruitment success as a consequence of abundant nutrients, high host density, habitat stability and a possible lack of predation and interspecific competition.","Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","Simon, CA (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",c.simon@ru.ac.za,,"Simon, Carol/0000-0001-9613-5222; Britz, Peter/0000-0002-4436-0425",,,,42,15,16,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

In the Northwest Atlantic, 30- to 40-year declines of more than 90% of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) have been associated with significant reductions in age and length at maturity, changes most parsimoniously explained as genetic responses to fishing. Increased survival costs of reproduction associated with earlier maturity, resulting in higher natural mortality and shorter life span, negatively affect population growth rate and rate of recovery. Coupled with lower hatching rate among first-time spawners and smaller size at maturity, a modest reduction in age from 6 to 4 years can reduce annual population growth in Atlantic cod by 25%-30%, based on the output of a stochastic, age-structured life history model. Earlier maturity more than doubles the probability of negative population growth every generation. These results underscore the potential for fishing-induced changes to life history traits alone to generate slow or negligible recovery in marine fishes, exacerbating negative impacts on population growth resulting from ecosystem-level alterations to interspecific competition and predation.","Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","Hutchings, JA (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",Jeff.Hutchings@Dal.ca,"Hutchings, Jeffrey/ABA-1098-2020","Hutchings, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1572-5429",,,,52,190,196,1,67,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

On the one hand, males typically compete intensely for mates, thus sexual selection theory predicts higher cost of reproduction for males in species with intense male-male competition. On the other hand, care provisioning such as incubating the eggs and raising young may also be costly, thus parental care theory predicts higher mortality for the care-giving sex, which is often the female. We tested both hypotheses of reproductive costs using phylogenetic comparative analyses of sex-specific adult mortality rates of 194 bird species across 41 families. First, we show that evolutionary increases in male-male competition were associated with male-biased mortalities. This relationship is consistent between two measures of mating competition: social mating system and testis size. Second, as predicted by the parental cost hypothesis, females have significantly higher adult mortalities (mean +/- SE, 0.364 +/- 0.01) than males (0.328 +/- 0.01). However, the mortality cost of parental care was only detectable in males, when the influence of mating competition was statistically controlled. Taken together, our results challenge the traditional explanation of female-biased avian mortalities, because evolutionary changes in female care were unrelated to changes in mortality bias. The interspecific variation in avian mortality bias, as we show here, is driven by males, specifically via the costs of both mating competition and parental care. We also discuss alternative hypotheses for why most birds exhibit female-biased mortalities, whereas in mammals male-biased mortalities predominate.","Univ Veszprem, Dept Zool, H-8201 Veszprem, Hungary; Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Liker, A (corresponding author), Univ Veszprem, Dept Zool, Pf 158, H-8201 Veszprem, Hungary.",aliker@almos.vein.hu; T.Szekely@bath.ac.uk,"Szekely, Tamas/I-7089-2016","Szekely, Tamas/0000-0003-2093-0056",,,,48,168,171,0,92,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,2005,59,4,,,,,890,897,,10.1554/04-560,,,8,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,920ZP,WOS:000228734300016,15926698,,,,2021-09-21,

Mustached tamarin groups were spread over larger areas than those of saddleback tamarins. Group size and behavior affected group spread and interspecific proximity: larger groups of both species were dispersed over greater areas, and the larger troop had the lowest degree of interspecific proximity. Behavior also affected group spread and interspecific proximity: when traveling individuals were spread over a larger area, and the distance between heterospecifics was greater than when stationary. We examined spatial proximity using data on the distance from nearest neighbor. Overall, distance to nearest neighbor was not affected by group size. Based on specific behaviors, foraging saddleback tamarins were significantly nearer conspecifics than to mustached tamarins. Tamarins have polymorphic color vision, and trichromats-having 3 types of visual pigment-versus dichromatic individuals' with two types of pigment-may be better at perceiving yellow or russet colored predators and conspecifics than their dichromatic counterparts are. Color vision status affected spatial positioning, with vigilant trichromats being further from their neighbors than their dichromatic conspecifics were. We discuss the findings with respect to the ecology of the species. Specifically, interspecific differences in group spread and spatial proximity are related to differences in the supports used, and the effect of troop size on interspecific proximity is related to increased resource competition. The finding that trichromats are further from their neighbors represents the first example of a behavioral correlate of color vision ability in a wild species with polymorphic color vision, and is explained through the perception of predation risk.","Univ Stirling, Dept Psychol, Scottish Primate Res Grp, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England","Smith, AC (corresponding author), Anglia Polytech Univ, Dept Life Sci, East Rd, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England.",a.smith@apu.ac.uk,"Buchanan-Smith, Hannah M/A-5350-2009","Buchanan-Smith, Hannah M/0000-0002-2516-7734; Smith, Andrew/0000-0002-8521-5558",,,,86,24,24,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0164-0291,1573-8604,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

An ability to predict the onset and termination of growth of component species would facilitate timing of management interventions to minimize harmful competition in mixed pastures. Experiments were undertaken in controlled environment to assess the use of accumulated temperature values to indicate development stages in three cool-season grass species, and to evaluate the consistency of this relation under a range of temperature regimes that included variable exposure to below-freezing, temperatures. When grown under light and dark temperature regimes of 22.5 and 7.5, 17.5 and 12.5, 15.0 and 0.0, or 10.0 and 5.0 degrees C, respectively, leaf appearance in Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb), and tall wheatgrass [Elytrigia elongata (Host) Nevski] showed a close linear relationship with accumulated temperature, within each temperature regime. The interval between appearance of successive leaves on seedling mainstem (phyllochron) was increased by increased average daily temperature. In seedlings grown under a 15.0 and 0.0 degrees C temperature regime, phyllochron was increased linearly by up to four 15-h exposures to -5.0 or -7.5 degrees C dark-cycle temperatures in successive 24-h periods. The effects of variation in mean daily temperature and of plant exposure to below-freezing temperature on phyllochron should be considered if accumulated temperature is used to predict development stage of cool-season grasses in the field.","Langston Univ, USDA ARS, Langston, OK 73050 USA","Bartholomew, PW (corresponding author), Langston Univ, USDA ARS, POB 1730, Langston, OK 73050 USA.",PBarthol@luresext.edu,,,,,,23,28,33,0,24,CROP SCIENCE SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 S SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0011-183X,1435-0653,,CROP SCI,Crop Sci.,MAR-APR,2005,45,2,,,,,529,534,,10.2135/cropsci2005.0529,,,6,Agronomy,Agriculture,905WV,WOS:000227602700015,,,,,2021-09-21,

First, a field survey was carried out where different habitat variables and the densities of both species were quantified and subjected to principal components analysis. Then the abundance of stone loach was related to the scores of the retained axes (eigenvalues >1). The abundance of stone loach was positively correlated to substrate particle size, amount of shade, temperature, discharge and current velocity, but negatively correlated to brown trout abundance. Secondly, a month-long field enclosure experiment in a stream was performed to test for any negative effects of brown trout on stone loach growth. Four treatments were used: intraspecific competition (stone loach at double density), interspecific competition (stone loach + small trout), predation (stone loach + large trout) and a control (stone loach alone). The results showed that large trout tended to have negative effects on final stone loach biomass. The absence of a negative effect of large trout on resource density suggests that nonlethal effects rather than resource competition caused this trend.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limnol.lu.se,,,,,,37,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity. 2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico. 3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes. 4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments. 5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. 6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship. 7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation.","Inst Ecol, AC Dept Ecol Func, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Ctr, Washington, DC 20008 USA","Cruz-Angon, A (corresponding author), Inst Ecol, AC Dept Ecol Func, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera Coatepec,315, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",angon@ecologia.edu.mx,,,,,,65,79,86,0,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

To examine interspecific habitat associations on coral reefs, tube- and vase-shaped sponges were surveyed for associated brittlestars at six sites on the coral reefs off Key Largo, Florida. Of 179 sponges encountered, Callyspongia vaginalis was the most abundant (43.0%), followed by Niphates digitalis (39.7%), and Callyspongia plicifera (4.5%). Three of eight sponge species surveyed did not differ from C. vaginalis in two physical refuge characteristics: oscular diameter and inner tube surface area. Brittlestars (416 total), all of the genus Ophiothrix, were only found in C. vaginalis, N. digitalis, and C. plicifera. The most abundant brittlestar, O. lineata (326), occurred on C. vaginalis (99.0%) and N. digitalis (1.0%), while O. suensonii (67) occurred on C. vaginalis (79.1%), N. digitalis (19.4%), and C. plicifera (1.5%). There was no pattern of co-occurrence of O. lineata and O. suensonii on C. vaginalis. The abundance of O. lineata increased with surface area of C. vaginalis. Differential habitat use was observed in O. lineata, with small individuals (<5 mm disk diameter) located inside and on the surface of sponge tubes and large individuals (greater than or equal to5 mm) solely inside tubes. The number of large O. lineata in C. vaginalis never exceeded the number of tubes per sponge, and tagged O. lineata remained in the same sponge for at least 3 weeks. In density manipulations, no pattern of intraspecific competition among large O. lineata was observed; however, there was evidence for interaction between size-classes. Brittlestars selected live sponge habitat over a non-living refuge, suggesting a mechanism for sponge habitat recognition. Sponge-dwelling brittle stars prefer some tube- and vase-shaped sponge species despite similar oscular diameters and surface areas. Surprisingly, these preferred sponge species are known from previous studies to be chemically undefended against generalist fish predators; therefore, brittlestars that inhabit these sponges do not gain an associational chemical defense. Sponge habitat use by O. lineata may be governed by intraspecific interactions to maintain habitat and access to food. While past studies have suggested that O. lineata is an obligate sponge commensal, the present study suggests that O. lineata has a species-specific association with the tube-sponge C. vaginalis.","Univ N Carolina, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA","Pawlik, JR (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Ctr Marine Sci, 5600 Masonboro Loop Rd, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA.",pawlikj@uncw.edu,"Pawlik, Joseph R/I-5718-2012","Henkel, Timothy/0000-0002-2790-9535; Pawlik, Joseph/0000-0002-8559-8456",,,,49,61,66,2,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Previous research principally focused on examining interspecific patterns of RSD, rarely testing predictions of various hypotheses within populations. To redress this, we used data from both sexes of a large brown falcon, Falco berigora, population to evaluate the importance of size and body condition indices on the hunting prowess of males and the reproductive success, recruitment, and survival probabilities of both sexes. Female-female competition for territorial vacancies was likely to be intense as the floating population was female-biased and intrasexual agonistic interactions were frequently observed. In this competitive population, larger adult females were more likely to be recruited, indicating directional selection favoring increased female body size. Furthermore, after recruitment larger females were more likely to successfully fledge offspring, providing a mechanism by which RSD is maintained in the population. In contrast, male recruitment was unrelated to either body size or condition indices. Smaller immature males more often held their territories (survived) over two breeding seasons than did their larger counterparts; however, they also took small prey more frequently, a diet related to poor reproductive success. We argue that, together, these results are indicative of selection favoring an increase in female body size and a reduction or maintenance in male body size. Of all the hypotheses proposed to account for the maintenance and evolution of RSD in raptors, this scenario is consistent only with the predictions of the intrasexual competition hypothesis.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","McDonald, PG (corresponding author), Univ Wales, Sch Biol Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",paul.mcdonald@bangor.ac.uk,"McDonald, Paul G/A-5928-2010","McDonald, Paul/0000-0002-9541-3304",,,,66,25,25,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The data sets comprised 5-15 sample plots and 51-114 (average 85) species. The species were classified using an eight-class system reflecting their mean seed mass (MSM) records (class 1 being the lowest, MSM l 0.2 mg; class 8 being the highest, MSM > 50 mg). Seed mass class distributions derived from slopes of contrasting aspect showed strong significant differences in chi-square tests for trend for all the four case studies.

Species with intermediate seed mass (classes 3 and 4) were not distinctive between the slopes. These results represent strong evidence of increased seed mass in the vegetation of north-facing grasslands, when compared to their south-facing counterparts.

Parasitism was significantly higher in the release years compared to the control years, but was below 25% averaged over the fly season for each farm. A statistical model based on a functional relationship between the innate capacity of increase of the two fly species and three explanatory variables (air temperature, fly density and parasitism) provided a fairly good fit to data with the abundances of house flies and stable flies explained mostly by temperature, but intra- and interspecific competition, and parasitism had a significant effect as well. Overall, the model was capable of explaining 14% and 6.6% of the total variation in data for house fly and stable fly, respectively. Spalangia cameroni was the predominant parasitoid to emerge from exposed house fly pupae, but from mid summer onwards Muscidifurax raptor Girault & Sanders (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) was also quite common. The study indicated that biological control of house flies can be an efficient alternative to chemical control.","Danish Inst Agr Sci, Res Ctr Sorgenfri, Pest Infestat Lab, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen, Inst Zool, Dept Populat Ecol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Skovgard, H (corresponding author), Danish Inst Agr Sci, Res Ctr Sorgenfri, Pest Infestat Lab, Skovbrynet 14, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",Henrik.Skovgaard@agrsci.dk,,,,,,50,58,59,0,30,C A B I PUBLISHING,WALLINGFORD,"C/O PUBLISHING DIVISION, WALLINGFORD OX10 8DE, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4853,,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

In the marine tropics such studies have mostly been of fish and reef-associated organisms, usually with high dispersal. In contrast, snails of the genus Echinolittorina (Littorinidae) are restricted to rocky shores, have a four-week pelagic development (and recorded dispersal up to 1400 km), and show different evolutionary patterns. We present a complete molecular phylogeny of Echinolittorina, derived from Bayesian analysis of sequences from nuclear 28S rRNA and mitochondrial 12S rRNA and COI genes (nodal support indicated by posterior probabilities, maximum likelihood, and neighbor-joining bootstrap). This consists of 59 evolutionarily significant Units (ESUs), including all 50 known taxonomic species. The 26 ESUs found in the Indo-West Pacific region form a single clade, whereas the eastern Pacific and Atlantic species are basal. The earliest fossil occurred in the Tethys during the middle Eocene and we suggest that the Indo-West Pacific clade has been isolated since closure of the Tethyan seaway in the early Miocene. The geographical distributions of all species (based on more than 3700 locality records) appear to be circumscribed by barriers of low temperature, unsuitable sedimentary habitat, stretches of open water exceeding about 1400 kin, and differences in oceanographic conditions on the continuum between oceanic and continental. The geographical ranges of sister species show little or no overlap, indicating that the speciation mode is predominantly allopatric. Furthermore, range expansion following speciation appears to have been limited, because a high degree of allopatry is maintained through three to five branching points of the phylogeny. This may be explained by infrequent long-distance colonization, habitat specialization on the oceanic/continental gradient, and perhaps by interspecific competition. In the eastern Pacific plus Atlantic we identify five cases of divergence on either side of the Isthmus of Panama, but our estimates of their ages pre-date the emergence of the Isthmus. There are three examples of sister relationships between species in the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic, all resulting from dispersal to the east. Within the Indo-West Pacific, we find no geographical pattern of speciation events; narrowly endemic species of recent origin are present in both peripheral and central parts of the region. Evidence from estimated divergence times of sister species, and from a plot of the number of lineages over time, suggest that there has been no acceleration of diversification during the glacio-eustatic cycles of the Plio-Pleistocene. In comparison with reefal organisms, species of Echinolittorina on rocky shores may be less susceptible to extinction or isolation during sea-level fluctuations. The species richness of Echinolittorina in the classical biogeographic provinces conforms to the common pattern of highest diversity (11 species) in the central East Indies Triangle of the Indo-West Pacific, with a subsidiary focus in the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic, and lowest diversity in the eastern Atlantic. The diversity focus in the East Indies Triangle is produced by a mosaic of restricted allopatric species and overlap of a few widespread ones, and is the result of habitat specialization rather than historical vicariance.

Comparisons of leaf chemistry were made among leaves that experienced variable levels of crab damage. Because R. mangle is the crab's preferred food source based on damage patterns in the field, comparisons of R. mangle leaf chemistry were made in relation to that of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans and the white mangrove Laguncularia racemosa. We observed a negative relationship between level of leaf damage and percent dry weight of nitrogen, carbohydrates, condensed tannins, and sclerophvlly. In contrast, a positive relationship was found between leaf damage and the carbon:nitrogen ratio. The chemical constituents that provided the best explanation for differences in damage among the three mangrove species include condensed tannins, nitrogen, carbon: nitrogen ratio, carbohydrates, phenolics, water content, and ash. The results from this study suggest that chemistry only partially explains food preference by A. pisonii. It appears that A. pisonii feeding behavior and preference may be influenced by a more complex series of factors and interactions, which may include reproduction by, predation on, and interspecific competition with A. pisonii.","Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Erickson, AA (corresponding author), Smithsonian Marine Stn Ft Pierce, 701 Seaway Dr, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA.",erickson@sms.si.edu,,,,,,49,28,29,0,48,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0006-3606,,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,SEP,2004,36,3,,,,,333,343,,,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,852GG,WOS:000223742800006,,,,,2021-09-21,

This is an ideal place for studying resource limitations because it avoids various complicating factors that are difficult to quantify but might affect animal densities, such as predation, interspecific competition, and past catastrophes. The relative group density was high in the coastal forest (0-400 m), while it did not differ among the higher zones (400-800, 800-1200 and 1200-1886 m). To examine this variation, three habitat variables were analyzed: total basal area of food trees per unit area, seasonal variations in fruit abundance, and total annual fleshy fruit production. All of these variables indicate that fruit and seeds are most available in the coastal forest. Thus, altitudinal variations in the density of Japanese macaques on Yakushima are determined by the total annual food abundance.","Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; Ryukoku Univ, Kyoto 6120021, Japan; Tonoji Terada, Inuyama, Aichi 4840094, Japan; Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Hikone 5228533, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Takaoka, Tomakomai 0530035, Japan; Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Gakuen, Sanda 6691337, Japan","Hanya, G (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Aichi 4848506, Japan.",hanya@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Agetsuma, Naoki/A-4329-2012","Agetsuma, Naoki/0000-0003-4093-5276",,,,45,39,40,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

By contrast, coexistence models from community ecology suggest that for species with dormancy, environmental fluctuations may be essential for persistence in competitive communities. We used models based on California grasslands to examine the influence of interannual fluctuations in the environment on the persistence of rare forbs competing with exotic grasses. Despite grasses and forbs independently possessing high fecundity in the same types of years, interspecific differences in germination biology and dormancy caused the rare forb to benefit from variation in the environment. Owing to the buildup of grass competitors, consecutive favorable years proved highly detrimental to forb persistence. Consequently, negative temporal autocorrelation, a low probability of a favorable year, and high variation in year quality all benefited the forb. In addition, the litter produced by grasses in a previously favorable year benefited forb persistence by inhibiting its germination into highly competitive grass environments. We conclude that contrary to conventional predictions of conservation and population biology, yearly fluctuations in climate may be essential for the persistence of rare species in invaded habitats.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Levine, JM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",levine@lifesci.ucsb.edu; m.rees@imperial.ac.uk,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",,,,64,111,112,5,68,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

Given the importance of shell refuge to their post-settlement ontogeny, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began constructing intertidal plots of oyster shell in the Grays Harbor estuary, Washington, to enhance recruitment and mitigate losses of subtidal C. magister entrained and killed during extensive dredging efforts. When shell habitat was newly constructed, settlement and survival of C. magister were high, and expectations for the mitigation project were met. During the first several years (1992-1997), plots greater than 1 yr postconstruction were colonized by yellow shore crabs, Hemigrapsus oregonensis (often greater than or equal to 75 crabs m(-2)), and abundance of EBP C. magister was reduced to nearly zero. While some predation of settling megalopae by H. oregonensis does occur, the relationship between these species is characterized by density-dependent competitive interactions. Laboratory observations of competition for shell habitat indicate that H. oregonensis are dominant over EBP C. magister and can evict C. magister from refuge spaces. Field experiments show that high densities of the former cause the latter to emigrate from shell, and suggest detection and avoidance of areas with high densities of H. oregonensis by settling C. magister megalopae. More recently (1998-2001), abundance of H. oregonensis has declined dramatically within plots of oyster shell, apparently due to recruitment failure, and patterns of C. magister abundance and production have returned to levels consistent with original expectations of the mitigation project. Both intraspecific and interspecific competition for space are significant factors effecting population regulation of C. magister when they are strongly dependent on refuge from predation. Efficacy of constructed oyster shell plots as a mitigation tool may hinge on the population dynamics of a species previously considered of little consequence to the target species.","Clarkson Univ, Ctr Environm, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Visser, EP (corresponding author), Clarkson Univ, Ctr Environm, Box 5717, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.",emmajoan@northnet.org,,,,,,98,8,8,1,31,ESTUARINE RESEARCH FEDERATION,PORT REPUBLIC,"2018 DAFFODIL, PO BOX 510, PORT REPUBLIC, MD 20676 USA",0160-8347,,,ESTUARIES,Estuaries,AUG,2004,27,4,,,,,699,715,,10.1007/BF02907654,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,849HC,WOS:000223528300011,,,,,2021-09-21,

It turned out that a second jump has some quantitative effects on diffusive instability even when it occurs in the absence of density-dependent mechanisms. When a second jump happens as a natural interspecific response of individuals, and such a response is sufficiently strong. it has crucial effects on diffusive instability: it leads to diffusive instability in the case of competitive interactions, whereas it annihilates diffusive instability in the case of prey-predator interactions.

Roots experiencing nutrient-rich patches can also enhance their physiological ion-uptake capacities compared with roots of the same plant outside the patch zone. These plastic responses by the root system have been proposed as the major mechanism by which plants cope with the naturally occurring heterogeneous supplies of nutrients in soil. Various attempts to predict how contrasting species will respond to patches have been made based on specific root length (SRL), root demography and biomass allocation within the patch zone. No one criterion has proved definitive. Actually demonstrating that root proliferation is beneficial to the plant, especially in terms of nitrogen capture from patches, has also proved troublesome. Yet by growing plants under more realistic conditions, such as in interspecific plant competition, and with a complex organic patch, a direct benefit can be demonstrated. Thus, as highlighted in this review, the environmental context in which the root response is expressed is as important as the magnitude of the response itself.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Hodge, A (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Biol, Area 2,POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",ah29@york.ac.uk,,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [JF13140] Funding Source: researchfish,,,154,987,1146,37,628,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,APR,2004,162,1,,,,,9,24,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01015.x,,,16,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,802PL,WOS:000220175300003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Reproductive success was estimated using the Mayfield method and compared among years. Totals of monitored nests per year ranged from 68 in 2001 to 341 in 1996, with a trend of declining numbers since 1996. An increase in numbers of the Western Gull (Larus occidentalis), the Black-crowned Night Heron's primary competitor, occurred during the same period. Overall reproductive success of the Black-crowned Night Heron at Alcatraz Island was below the 13-year average of 56.4% since 1996. During the study, the average number of chicks fledged per nest each year ranged from 0.46 to 1.27, which is less than the two chicks per nest suggested as a requirement for a sustained population. Embryos in five of 187 failed Black-crowned Night Heron eggs were deformed. In 1990 and 1991, eggs were analyzed for a wide range of contaminants, but none appeared to be sufficiently elevated to have caused the observed deformities. Based on these relatively low levels of contaminants, a high hatchability rate (94.5%), and relatively low levels of embryotoxicity, contaminants did not appear to significantly affect Black-crowned Night Heron reproduction at Alcatraz Island. However, predation by the Common Raven (Corvus corax) and Western Gull, interspecific competition with the Western Gull, habitat deterioration, and possible human disturbance are likely factors contributing to the decline in Black-crowned Night Heron reproductive success on Alcatraz Island in recent years.","USGS, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Dixon, CA 95620 USA; Natl Pk Serv, Golden Gate Natl Recreat Area, San Francisco, CA 94123 USA","Hothem, RL (corresponding author), USGS, Western Ecol Res Ctr, 6924 Tremont Rd, Dixon, CA 95620 USA.",roger_hothem@usgs.gov,,,,,,36,14,15,1,19,WATERBIRD SOC,WASHINGTON,"NATL MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY SMITHSONIAN INST, WASHINGTON, DC 20560 USA",1524-4695,,,WATERBIRDS,Waterbirds,MAR,2004,27,1,,,,,112,125,,10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0112:RSOTBN]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ornithology,Zoology,803NU,WOS:000220238600017,,,,,2021-09-21,

Our objective was to define and to compare the stomatal strategies of both species for drought resistance and to identify the possible differences between growth stages in selected drought adaptation attributes. Among the mature trees, Q. rotundifolia exhibited a water-use behaviour that was more conservative than that of Q. faginea: lower maximum stomatal conductances and greater sensitivity to VPD than the deciduous species. As a result, the leaf water potential of the evergreen species never decreased along the day and along the growth season as much as in the deciduous species; this may help to guarantee longer leaf longevity by avoiding irreversible damage during the summer drought. The seedlings of the two species showed a less conservative water-use strategy in comparison with adult trees: a relatively high stomatal conductance and lower stomatal sensitivity to soil and atmospheric drought. As a consequence, leaf water potential decreased more in the seedlings along the day than in the adults. Q. rotundifolia was the species for which the most pronounced differences between growth stages were obtained. Thus, interspecific differences in response to drought disappeared in the first stages of the life of the trees, and the seedlings of the two species showed a common strategy, probably as a response to the competition from the herbaceous layer. A low stomatal sensitivity in benefit of an increase in growth would probably be a more successful strategy under the competitive conditions that seedlings experience during their establishment.

In this review, I have synthesized the study of horizontal distribution, seasonal and annual variations of zooplankton biomass, and ecological characteristics of major component species in the southern Japan Sea, which area is influenced by the warm Tsushima Current. The zooplankton biomass (annual mean) in the southern Japan Sea was lower than in the subarctic Pacific, including the northern Japan Sea, and similar to biomass levels in Kuroshio waters. Temporal variations in zooplankton biomass showed both seasonal and year-to-year components. Seasonal biomass increases to a maximum in spring with a weak secondary peak in autumn. As for long-term changes, 3-6 year cycles were identified, with the dynamics of the surface warm Tsushima Current and the subsurface cold water playing important roles in determining the yearly zooplankton community structure and biomass. Cold water species in the southern Japan Sea had extensive diel vertical migrations whose range is restricted in summer by the development of a thermocline. Among these species, the herbivores Euphausia pacifica and Metridia pacifica encounter a lower food supply, resulting in lower growth rates. The vertical dispersal of epipelagic carnivorous zooplankton such as Sagitta elegans and Themisto japonica to the deep-sea is probably facilitated by reduced interspecific competition.

We propose a conceptual model Of Multiple demographic strategies for long-lived plants in stable habitats, shifting from regeneration by seeding to persistence by longevity and/or vegetative reproduction, along gradients of abiotic stress or interspecific competition. Regeneration by seeding would be promoted under low abiotic stress or under low competition, whereas persistence by longevity and/or vegetative reproduction Would predominate at high levels of abiotic stress or competition. We test this model with two threatened species of the Mediterranean region, the shrub Juniperus communis, a widely distributed species which maintains relict Populations in the Mediterranean mountains thanks to great adult longevity and Pinguicula vallisneriifolia, a palaeo-endemic herb relying on a perennial habit and vegetative reproduction under drought imposed stress or high competition at late successional phases. As a main consequence, multiple demographic strategies enhance a plant's ability to exploit environmental heterogeneity at different spatial (patches, localities, regions within the species' distribution area) and temporal (individual life span, glacial-interglacial cycles) scales. The potential of multiple demographic dynamics based on persistence and regeneration must be considered as a major ecological trait determining the long-term viability of peripheral populations of relict species as well as the inertia against extinction of many threatened endemisms, thereby contributing to the maintenance of the high plant diversity characterizing the Mediterranean region.","Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organism & Sistemas, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain; Univ Granada, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Garcia, D (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organism & Sistemas, C Rodrigo Uria S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain.",dgarcia@correo.uniovi.es,"Zamora, Renato/ABE-6898-2020; Zamora, Regino/B-3179-2010; Garcia, Daniel/A-1236-2011","Zamora, Renato/0000-0002-2223-3361; Zamora, Regino/0000-0002-5049-9968; Garcia, Daniel/0000-0002-7334-7836",,,,43,113,115,2,27,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,GRANGARDE,"GAMLA VAGEN 40, S-770 13 GRANGARDE, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Nested quadrat sampling was used to estimate the relative importance values of vascular plant species in the tree, shrub, and herb strata. The successional status of each site was estimated using two dendrochronological indices: oldest tree index and abandonment index. Four indices of species diversity were calculated for each site and stratum: species richness, the Shannon index, Hurlbert's probability of interspecific association, and Pielou's evenness. Within the quadrats of all 22 sites, total richness was 168 species of vascular plants. Richness decreased linearly over the 200-year chronosequence in all strata for both successional indices, from a maximum of 74 species at 14 years to a low of 13 species at 209 years. Evenness showed no evidence of a successional pattern, so the combined indices of diversity (Shannon and Hurlbert) displayed only weak trends. Multiple regression showed that successional age was always a significant predictor of species richness in every stratum (except the shrub stratum when using the abandonment index), and that stem density (i.e., the sample size effect) was not significant in the tree stratum when using the oldest tree index. Age indices held comparable or lower P-values than stem density in most strata. It is likely that richness increased from a low value immediately following farm abandonment to a peak around the age of the youngest sites sampled (over a span of 15-30 years), the rate of increase being governed by the availability of dispersing seeds. The observed decline in richness over the rest of succession was probably caused in part by a decrease in available light. The rate of decline was apparently determined by the rate of competitive elimination of shade-intolerant species. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the comparison of diets, the following six feeding groups were recognized: generalized benthic carnivore (Dichistius capensis, Diplodus sargus capensis), carnivorous benthic 'browser'(Gymnocrotaphus curvidens, Pachymetopon aeneum), herbivorous benthic 'grazer' (Sarpa salpa), midwater-small-invertebrate predator (Parascorpis typus), benthic macro-predator (Chrysoblephus laticeps, Haploblepharus edwardsii H. pictus, Poroderma africanum, R pantherinum), and small-benthic-invertebrate predator (Boopsoidea inornata, Cheilodactylus fasciatus, Chirodactylus brachydactylus, Diplodus cervinus hottentotus, Pachymetopon blochii, Spondyliosoma emarginatum). Diplodus sargus capensis was the only species to have fed in water less than or equal to13degreesC. Reef-dwelling prey dominated the diets, with the few consumed sand-dwelling prey probably having been taken close to the reef. Although there was some degree of dietary overlap among species, most had some important food items consumed predominantly by them. Each species thus appears to have its own 'dietary niche' within the assemblage, reducing interspecific competition for food.","Univ Cape Town, Dept Zool, Marine Biol Res Inst, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa","Griffiths, CL (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Zool, Marine Biol Res Inst, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",clgriff@pop.uct.ac.za,,,,,,28,6,7,1,8,ZOOLOGICAL SOC SOUTHERN AFRICA,SCOTTSVILLE,"AFRICAN ZOOLOGY CIRCULATION OFFICE, UNIV KWAZULU-NATAL, SCHOOL BIOL & CONSERVATION SCI, P B X01, SCOTTSVILLE 3209, SOUTH AFRICA",1562-7020,2224-073X,,AFR ZOOL,Afr.

In this paper, I describe how the competitive interaction between two species of gall forming fly, Lipara lucens and L. rufitarsis, is modified as a consequence of interactions with a host plant and natural enemies. The results of field experiments and observations of wild populations show that the two species compete strongly for stems of the common reed, Phragmites australis. L. lucens is competitively inferior, having significantly increased mortality in the presence of heterospecifics. No lasting negative effects of interspecific competition on L. rufitarsis could be found. In fact, the results show that L. rufitarsis can benefit from the presence of heterospecifics. It can usurp the galls of L. lucens, and experiences reduced mortality and increased fecundity as a result. Thus, L. rufitarsis can be described as a kleptoparasite. Kleptoparasitism in this system is mediated by the host plant and by the principal parasitoid of L. rufitarsis. L. rufitarsis can only benefit from the presence of its competitor because L. lucens induces P. australis to form a large, robust gall that repels the attacks of the ichneumonid wasp Endromopoda phragmitidis. These results show how facultative kleptoparasitism can modify the ecological consequences of interspecific competition for both individuals and populations.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England","Reader, T (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",,"Reader, Tom/B-5518-2008","Reader, Tom/0000-0001-7586-8814",,,,50,15,16,0,16,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2003,103,1,,,,,101,112,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12575.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,735LZ,WOS:000186118000011,,,,,2021-09-21,

In this study, we describe variation in morphology and mating system across six populations of the endemic Galapagos Hawk (Buteo galapagoensis). Galapagos Hawks exhibit cooperative polyandry, a mating system in which long-term social groups contain a single female and multiple males. Comparisons among islands revealed significant differences in overall body size for both adults and immatures. Populations ranged from completely monogamous to completely polyandrous, with varying mean group sizes. Data did not support our prediction that sexual size dimorphism would increase with the degree of polyandry (number of males per group) or with body size; there was no correlation between mating system and sexual dimorphism.

We documented important top-down predation effects on some small-mammal species, and small-mammal effects on some plant species resulting from experimental exclusions. However, periodic El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events caused several high rainfall episodes during this interval, resulting in large bottom-up increases in both plants and animals. Therefore, we suggest that instead of exclusive top-down or bottom-up control, this system undergoes shifting control, with relatively greater importance of biotic interactions in wet years and of resource limitation in dry ones.

This is certainly true in those cooperative breeders where one sex is both philopatric and helps raise future offspring of its parents. We examined the primary sex ratio variation in the cooperatively breeding bell miner (Manorina melanophrys) in southeastern Australia over six breeding seasons. Male offspring are the philopatric and helping sex in this system and can increase the reproductive output of their parents. Bell miners aggressively defend their territory from all interspecific competitors and by doing so allow food resources to dramatically increase. The increase in phytophagous Psyllidae insects (which secrete a carbohydrate-rich coating that constitutes the major component of bell miner diet) leads to a decrease in tree health, often culminating in death of the tree. Bell miners then move as groups to new areas with low psyllid abundance, and the cycle repeats. Using this predictable temporal variation in food availability, we aimed to determine whether female breeders adjusted the, sex ratio of broods to produce more of the philopatric sex when food resources were high and more of the dispersing sex when food resources were low. Our results-provide clear evidence for such facultative control of sex ratio by female bell miners. Newly founded colonies are characterized by low food availability and a female-biased primary sex ratio, whereas colonies more than 1 year old have an increased food availability and a male-biased primary sex ratio. We suggest treating forces associated with resource enhancement and competition as opposing sides of a single general principle and suggest that it is necessary to view both the costs and benefits of philopatric individuals within a variable environment.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Ecole Normale Super, Ecol Lab, F-75230 Paris 05, France; Dept Conservat, Napier, New Zealand; La Trobe Univ, Dept Genet & Human Variat, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Ewen, JG (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7103, Lab Ecol Evolut Parasitaire, Bat A,7eme Etage,1 Quai St Bernard,Case 237, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",john.ewen@snv.jussieu.fr,"Crozier, Ross H/C-6773-2009; Painter, Jodie N/AAC-6332-2019","Painter, Jodie N/0000-0002-4992-2458",,,,52,29,31,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Diet of the two jackal species was flexible and opportunistic and dietary overlap between the jackal species was high. However, C. mesomelas ate more springhares Pedetes capensis, and C. adustus ate more safari camp refuse. To a large extent, differences in diet reflect availability within home ranges. Although interspecific home ranges overlapped by up to an average of 26%, the two species did not intensively use the same areas, and favoured different habitats. Canis mesomelas defended territories in the grassland habitat, which was also the favoured habitat of springhares, the predominant vertebrate prey species in the area. Canis adustus centred their home ranges on centres of human activity, benefiting from the regular, but low quality, anthropogenic food resources. In this study, C. adustus, with the more generalist dentition, had a broader niche than C. mesomelas (dietary diversity C. adustus = 4.14; C. mesomelas = 3.45). Within sympatric areas, differing activity times may further operate to decrease competition, allowing these canids to co-exist. The activity times of the two species differed, with C. adustus being almost entirely nocturnal. Canis mesomelas, while mostly nocturnal, was also active during the morning and in the late afternoon. The jackals in this study did not have clear-cut niches and it is probable that the extreme flexibility of canids in both diet and behaviour allows these species to co-exist sympatrically over part of their range.","Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Macdonald, DW (corresponding author), Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",david.macdonald@zoology.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,92,87,91,1,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Larvae of cased caddisflies (Limnephilidae and Phryganeidae) are among the most abundant and conspicuous invertebrates in northern wetlands. Although species replacements are often observed along permanence gradients, the underlying causal mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper, we report on the distributional patterns of caddisflies in permanent and temporary high-altitude ponds, and how those patterns reflect differences in life history characteristics that affect desiccation tolerance (fundamental niches) versus constraints related to biotic interactions (realised niches). 2. Species (Hesperophylax occidentalis and Agrypnia deflata ) that were encountered only in permanent ponds are restricted in distribution by life history (no ovarian diapause, aquatic oviposition, and/or inability to tolerate desiccation). Although the egg masses of H. occidentalis tolerate desiccation, the larvae leave the protective gelatinous matrix of the egg mass because adults oviposit in water. 3. Three species (Asynarchus nigriculus, Limnephilus externus and L. picturatus ) have life history characteristics (rapid larval growth, ovarian diapause and terrestrial oviposition of desiccation-tolerant eggs) that should facilitate the use of both permanent and temporary habitats. However, A. nigriculus is rare or absent in most permanent ponds, and L. externus and L . picturatus are rare or absent in most temporary ponds. Experimental data from a previous study on the combined effects of salamander predation and interspecific interactions among caddisflies (e.g. intraguild predation) suggest that biotic interactions limit each species to a subset of potentially exploitable habitats. 4. Many wetland invertebrates exhibit species replacements along permanence gradients, but few studies have separated the relative importance of the effects of drying per se from the effects of biotic interactions. Our results emphasise the complementary roles of comparative data on life histories and experimental data on competition and predation for understanding invertebrate distributions along permanence gradients.","Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Wissinger, SA (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",swissing@allegheny.edu,"Jannot, Jason/ABD-5400-2020","Brown, Wendy/0000-0002-7237-1797; Jannot, Jason/0000-0002-9231-1337",,,,58,56,60,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Each plot was assumed to be homogeneous as to its environmental conditions and spatial distribution of dominant species, and was divided into 25 sub-plots of 100 cm(2) size arranged in a regular grid. Presence-absence data of rooted vascular plants were recorded for each sub-plot. Significant positive or negative associations were observed in all plots. The number of significant interactions was positively related to the within-plot variation in soil depth. In seven and nine cases, respectively, there were more positive or negative associations than expected on the basis of a random distribution of species over the sub-plots. The ratio of the number of positive associations to the potential number of positive associations increased with increasing species richness. There was a significant spatial autocorrelation in species composition in most plots, but the coefficients of determination were on average very low, indicating a minor importance of spatial dependence in the data set. Correspondingly, the ratio of observed to potential species associations was unrelated to the extent of spatial autocorrelation. About 2/3 of all species encountered were at least once involved in a significant interaction. We found differences in the proportion of positive to negative associations between species with different habitat requirements and attributes. In general, species with predominantly negative associations were mostly relatively tall and competitive, long-lived hemicryptophytes characteristic of Festuco-Brometea and more mesotrophic grasslands, for example Filipendula vulgaris and Achillea millefolium. In contrast, species with largely positive associations were mostly smaller and short-lived stress-tolerators and stress-tolerant ruderals, preferring more shallow and exposed soils, such as Cerastium semidecandrum and Trifolium arvense. While the negative associations prevailing among the dominant species in the alvar grasslands are likely to be the outcome of interspecific competition for space and resources, the positive associations may be the result of facilitative relations between the dominant and sub-ordinate species.","Univ Bremen, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, D-28359 Bremerhaven, Germany; Univ Groningen, Dept Community & Conservat Ecol, CEES, NL-9700 AA Haren, Netherlands","Diekmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, FB 2,Leobener Str, D-28359 Bremerhaven, Germany.",mdiekman@uni-bremen.de,"Diekmann, Martin/L-8854-2019",,,,,33,2,2,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0107-055X,1756-1051,,NORD J BOT,Nord.

Adaptive phenotypic plasticity will enhance the chance of survival and reproduction in changing or novel environments. For rock-dwelling cichlids it may contribute to the success of settlement after migration between rocky outcrops or islands, since newly colonized patches of rock may offer different food regimes and different competitors. In our experiments, we simulated such situations by raising fry on different diets and with different competitors. We chose diet treatments in such a way that we could predict the direction of anatomical changes from functional demands. We expected an indirect effect of interspecific competition: selectively removing one prey-type by the competing species would leave N. greenwoodi with the other. We found the predicted phenotypic responses to food in trophic traits of N. greenwoodi. However, in the current experimental set-up we did not find a differentiating effect of species of competitor.

Predictive models of species' distributions are used increasingly in ecological studies investigating features as varied as biodiversity, habitat selection and interspecific competition. In a pilot study, we based a successful model for the great bustard Otis tarda on advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data, which offer attractive predictor variables because of the global coverage, high temporal frequency of overpasses and low cost. We wished to assess whether the approach could be applied at very large spatial scales, and whether the coarse resolution of the imagery (1 km(2)) would limit application to those bird species with large home ranges or to simple recognition of broad habitat types. 2. We modelled the distributions of three agricultural steppe birds over the whole of Spain using a common set of predictor variables, including AVHRR imagery. The species, great bustard, little bustard Tetrax tetrax and calandra lark Melanocorhypha calandra, have similar habitat requirements but differently sized home ranges, and are all species of conservation concern. Good models would reveal differences in distribution between the species and have high predictive power despite the large geographical extent covered. 3. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were built with the presence-absence of the species as the response variable. Individual species' responses to the habitat variables were identified using partial fits and compared with each other. We found that this modelling framework could successfully distinguish the habitats selected by the three species, while the response curves indicated how the habitats differed. Model fits and cross-validations assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots showed the models to be successful and robust. 4. We overlaid the predictive maps to identify key areas for agricultural steppe birds in Spain and compared these with the present network of protected sites in two sample regions. In Castilla Leon the provision of protected sites appears appropriate, but in Castilla La Mancha large areas of apparently suitable habitat have no protection. 5. These results confirm that large-scale models are able to increase our understanding of species' ecology and provide data for conservation planning. AVHRR imagery, in combination with other variables, has sufficient resolution to model a range of bird species, and GAMs have the flexibility to model subtle species-habitat responses.","Univ Stirling, Dept Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; CSIC, Museo Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Suarez-Seoane, S (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Inst Recursos Nat & Ordenac Terr, C Independencia 13, Oviedo 33004, Spain.",seoane@indurot.uniovi.es,"Alonso, Juan Carlos/C-9974-2012; Suarez-Seoane, Susana/D-8246-2015","Alonso, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-0450-7434; Suarez-Seoane, Susana/0000-0001-7656-4214; Osborne, Patrick E./0000-0001-8919-5710",,,,49,141,144,3,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We investigated diets and digestive organ morphology of sympatrically breeding female Buffleheads and Barrow's Goldeneyes in central British Columbia. Because those congeners exhibit interspecific aggression in defense of breeding territories, we predicted that competition for food could be a principal factor in evolution of that behavior. We also hypothesized that breeding Buffieheads would show greater variation in digestive organ morphology than Barrow's Goldeneyes because of their smaller body size and consequently greater reliance on their diet to meet nutritional requirements for egg production. Both species fed predominantly on aquatic insects during all reproductive periods, particularly larvae of damselflies (Zygoptera), midges (Chironomidae), and phantom midges (Chaoborinae). Plant foods, primarily seeds of submergent and emergent vegetation, generally represented <15% of diets in both species. Diets of breeding female Buffleheads and Barrow's Goldeneyes were similar throughout reproduction, hence competition for food has likely been a factor in evolution of territorial aggression between those species. The digestive tract morphology of Buffieheads was more variable than that of Barrow's Goldeneyes suggesting that the former relied more on dietary nutrients during reproduction than did their larger congener.","Univ Western Ontario, Ecol & Evolut Grp, Dept Zool, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Thompson, JE (corresponding author), Ducks Unlimited Canada, 200,10720-178 St, Edmonton, AB T5S 1J3, Canada.",,,,,,,46,5,6,0,26,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,,,AUK,AUK,OCT,2002,119,4,,,,,1075,1090,,10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[1075:ROFITA]2.0.CO;2,,,16,Ornithology,Zoology,639VC,WOS:000180649200015,,,,,2021-09-21,

The streams begin as very dilute springs but exhibit a downstream gradient of increasing dissolved ions and pH. Amphipods displaced upstream of their distribution limit in fine-mesh cages experienced rapid mortality compared to those maintained downstream of the limit, suggesting that neither interspecific competition nor predation explains the observed limit. General osmoregulatory failure during intermolt was not limiting; percent body-water content, a general gauge of osmotic stress, was not greater in amphipods closer to the distribution limit, nor did it increase in amphipods displaced above the limit. However, newly molted amphipods in water from above the distribution limit died more rapidly than those in water from below the limit.

Cleaner fish reduce their clients' ectoparasite loads and, therefore, proximity to cleaning stations should be advantageous for territorial fish. We focused on five damselfish species which hold permanent territories and cleaning stations occupied by cleaning gobies (Elacatinus spp.) on a Caribbean reef. Contrary to our predictions of higher densities near cleaning stations, we found that bicolor damselfish were less abundant near cleaning stations than at ecologically similar points without cleaning gobies whereas no effects were seen for longfin, dusky, yellowtail, and threespot damselfish. In addition, although damselfish densities were higher in the immediate vicinity of cleaning stations than 1.5-3 in away for most species, this was also the case at points without cleaners. Because cleaning stations are usually located on prominent coral heads or sponges, the overall significant attraction of damselfish to such structures, whether occupied by cleaning gobies or not, could reflect attraction to past or potential cleaning stations. However, it is more likely that interspecific competition and/or the low benefits of being cleaned at our study site prevent aggregation around cleaners. Cleaning stations may play only a minor rote in determining the distribution of territorial reef fishes.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Cote, IM (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"Reynolds, John D/L-6345-2015","Reynolds, John D/0000-0002-0459-0074",,,,27,8,9,0,11,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0722-4028,,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,SEP,2002,21,3,,,,,245,251,,10.1007/s00338-002-0241-x,,,7,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,602LJ,WOS:000178506500003,,,,,2021-09-21,

We performed an extensive statistical modelling study on the population fluctuations and population growth rates of 15 raptor species in the Kalahari desert in South Africa. 2. The correlation pattern between rainfall and population abundance changed systematically with raptor body weight and diet type. The abundance of heavier raptors feeding on larger prey-items had lower correlations with rainfall than lighter raptors feeding on small prey-items. Whereas raptor species feeding on small prey-items were more affected by immediate rainfall, species feeding on large prey-items were more affected by rainfall in the previous year. 3. Population abundances were explained most parsimoniously by direct and delayed density dependence and rainfall during the current and previous breeding season. Interspecific competition was never a predictor variable. Population abundances of species best described by rainfall fed on larger prey-items than population abundances of species best described by density dependence. 4. Population growth rates were always best described by direct density dependence. The strength of density dependence was positively correlated with reproduction rate, due mainly to Falconiform species having higher reproduction rates than Accipitrid species. 5. Shifting from the species to the guild level, we found that abundance and biomass shares of feeding guilds did not vary significantly over time, supporting the hypothesis of guild constancy.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Kruger, O (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",ok212@cam.ac.uk,"Lindstrom, Jan/A-8890-2008","Lindstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5630-6680",,,,67,21,22,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Inhibition experiments were carried out with the quinolones norfloxacin and pefloxacin and the substrate, caffeine. Additionally, in vivo pharmacokinetics of paraxanthine was determined in CYP1A2-null and wild-type mice. All LM produced the primary metabolites of caffeine and paraxanthine. In human LM, the main metabolite of caffeine was paraxanthine (K-M 0.4 and 0.5 mmol L-1). In wild-type and CYP1A2-null mice LM, the main caffeine metabolite was 1,3,7-trimethylurate, but formation was not saturable. Apparent K-M for paraxanthine formation from caffeine in wild-type and CYP1A2-null murine LM were 0.2 and 4.9 mmol L-1, respectively. The main metabolite of paraxanthine was 1-methylxanthine in human (K-M 0.13 and 0.2 mmol L-1) and in wild-type mice LM (K-M 0.53 mmol L-1). In CYP1A2-null murine LM, the main paraxanthine metabolite was 7-methylxanthine. The quinolones competitively inhibited caffeine metabolism in human but not in wild-type or CYP1A2-null murine LM. No obvious differences were seen for blood pharmacokinetics and urinary metabolite excretion of paraxanthine between CYP1A2-null and wild-type mice. Thus, for paraxanthine, norfloxacin and pefloxacin interaction with CYP1A2 there were clear differences between mice and man. Our results suggest that an interspecies comparison is required for the metabolism of individual xenobiotics interacting with CYP1A2 prior to the use of mice models to predict its toxicity and/or pharmacological activity in man.

This may imply unrealistically high sensitivity of the system's behavior to environmental variations. Thus, a generalized LV model is considered with the equation for preys' reproduction containing the following additional terms: quadratic damping'' term that accounts for interspecies competition, and term with white-noise random variations of the preys' reproduction factor that simulates the environmental variations. An exact solution is obtained for the corresponding Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation for stationary probability densities (PDF's) of the population sizes. It shows that both population sizes are independent gamma-distributed stationary random processes. Increasing level of the environmental variations does not lead to extinction of the populations. However it may lead to an intermittent behavior, whereby one or both population sizes experience very rare and violent short pulses or outbreaks while remaining on a very low level most of the time. This intermittency is described analytically by direct use of the solutions for the PDF's as well as by applying theory of excursions of random functions and by predicting PDF of peaks in the predators' population size.","Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Mech Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA","Dimentberg, MF (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Mech Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.",,,,,,,22,27,27,0,7,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",1539-3755,1550-2376,,PHYS REV E,Phys.

Three zooarchaeological trends reflect important shifts in hominid adaptations over this great time span: (1) increasing predation on large, hoofed animals that culminated in prime-adult-biased hunting, a predator-prey relationship that distinguishes humans from all other large predators and is a product of coevolution with them; (2) greater diet breadth and range of foraging substrates exploited in response to increasing human population densities, as revealed by small-game use; and (3) increased efficiency in food capture, processing, and energy retention through technology, and the eventual expansion of technology into social (symbolic) realms of behavior. Niche boundary shifts, examined here in eight dimensions, tend to cluster at 500 thousand years ago (KYA), at 250 KYA, and several in rapid succession between 50 and 10 KYA. Most of these shifts appear to be consequences of competitive interaction, because high-quality, protein-rich resources were involved. Many of the boundary shifts precede major radiations in the equipment devoted to animal exploitation. With a decline in trophic level after 45 KYA, demographic increase irreversibly altered the conditions of natural selection on human societies, form a largely interspecific competitive forum to one increasingly defined by intraspecific pressures.

However, some anglers complained of declining catches of native gamefish species. Anglers targeting species other than striped bass postulated that predation by striped bass contributed to the declines of native species. To a lesser extent, interspecific competition for food or space was also considered a factor and anglers complained that their concerns were not being adequately addressed by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA). Although no data were available to suggest that striped bass were culpable, opponents of the state's striped bass stocking program sought recourse via legislation. In 1995 and 1996, five bills were introduced in the Tennessee state legislature that would have banned the stocking of striped bass into Norris Reservoir and restricted TWRA's ability to propagate or manage all non-native species. Although the bills were defeated, attempts by TWRA to seek reconciliation with anglers opposed to the striped bass program met with little success. In addition to scientifically defensible biological data, human dimensions data are needed to effectively diffuse fishery management disputes between stakeholder groups and management agencies before they escalate to unmanageable levels. Alternative methods of conflict resolution should be carefully considered when polarized stakeholder groups are involved. Effective communication by management agencies of social, economic, and biological impacts of a fishery are essential to stemming future conflicts.","Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agcy, Fisheries Management Div, Nashville, TN 37204 USA","Churchill, TN (corresponding author), Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agcy, Fisheries Management Div, POB 40747, Nashville, TN 37204 USA.",tchurchill@mail.state.tn.us; pbettoli@tntech.edu; dpeterson@mail.state.tn.us; breeves@mail.state.tn.us; hodge@knews.com,"Churchill, Timothy/Z-2811-2019",,,,,24,35,35,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0363-2415,,,FISHERIES,Fisheries,FEB,2002,27,2,,,,,10,19,,10.1577/1548-8446(2002)027<0010:ACIFM>2.0.CO;2,,,10,Fisheries,Fisheries,542BK,WOS:000175023500009,,,,,2021-09-21,

We review available information on Australia's Procellariiformes, with respect to their conservation biology and management in the region. Procellariiformes face a range of threats in the marine environment and on land. At sea, threatening factors include direct interactions with fishing operations; ingestion of, and entanglement in, marine debris; contamination from pollutants; and over-fishing of prey species. At breeding colonies, increased mortality and decreased breeding success due to predation by feral pests; degradation of nesting habitat by introduced herbivores; interspecific competition for nest space; and transmission of parasites and disease occurs. Of these threats, increased mortality resulting from interactions with fishing operations and predation by feral pests are particularly important. The first mainly affects larger species (body mass >600 g), whereas the second predominantly affects smaller species (body mass <600 g). This results because the larger species are able to swallow baited hooks and habitually follow ships, whereas smaller species have difficulty swallowing baited hooks but are vulnerable to predation by virtue of their size. Ensuring the long-term survival of Australia's albatross and petrel populations depends on domestic research and conservation management programs, combined with international action that will secure the protection of these seabirds when they are foraging in waters of other jurisdictions or on the high seas.","Environm Australia, Wildlife Management & Sci Sect, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Dept Primary Ind Water & Environm, Nat Conservat Branch, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Baker, GB (corresponding author), Environm Australia, Wildlife Management & Sci Sect, POB 787, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",,"Bond, Alexander L/A-3786-2010",,,,,228,65,76,2,60,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AUSTRALIA,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 2, 11 QUEENS RD, MELBOURNE, VIC 3004, AUSTRALIA",0158-4197,1448-5540,,EMU,Emu,,2002,102,1,,,,,71,97,UNSP 0158-4197/02/010071,10.1071/MU01036,,,27,Ornithology,Zoology,551VA,WOS:000175581800007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Further evidence is needed to better understand these patterns, and perhaps contribute to a useful predictive theory of invasions. We reviewed the case of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) invasions in the western United States and their impacts on native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). Unlike many biological invasions, a considerable body of empirical research on brook trout and cutthroat trout is available. We reviewed life histories of each species, brook trout invasions, their impacts on cutthroat trout, and patterns and causes of segregation between brook trout and cutthroat trout. We considered four stages of the invasion process: transport, establishment, spread, and impacts to native species. Most of the research we found focused on impacts. Interspecific interactions, especially competition, were commonly investigated and cited as impacts of brook trout. In many cases it is not clear if brook trout invasions have a measurable impact. Studies of species distributions in the field and a variety of experiments suggest invasion success of brook trout is associated with environmental factors, including temperature, landscape structure, habitat size, stream flow, and human influences. Research on earlier stages of brook trout invasions (transport, establishment, and spread) is relatively limited, but has provided promising insights. Management alternatives for controlling brook trout invasions are limited, and actions to control brook trout focus on direct removal, which is variably successful and can have adverse effects on native species. The management applicability of research has been confounded by the complexity of the problem and by a focus on understanding processes at smaller scales, but not on predicting patterns at larger scales. In the short-term, an improved predictive understanding of brook trout invasions could prove to be most useful, even if processes are incompletely understood. A stronger connection between research and management is needed to identify more effective alternatives for controlling brook trout invasions and for identifying management priorities.","US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Boise, ID 83702 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, So Res Stn, Oxford, MS 38655 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95615 USA; Missouri Dept Conservat, Conservat Res Ctr, Columbia, MO 65201 USA","Dunham, JB (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, 316 E Myrtle St, Boise, ID 83702 USA.",,"Adams, Susan B./C-3559-2008",,,,,114,157,161,2,76,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,,,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

Different copepod species were the most common prey of the birds from the two colonies. Neocalanus plumchrus s.l. CV predominated in birds at Tolstoi Point (85.0% of food mass) while N. cristatus CV predominated in birds at Zapadni Point (90.0% of food mass). Comparisons with the results obtained from zooplankton sampling in the vicinity of Saint Paul Island suggest that Least Auklets from the two neighboring colonies used different foraging sites. The birds from Tolstoi Point performed shorter foraging flights to the outer shelf domain where they collected smaller copepods (5.3 mg of wet weight) in larger numbers (556 copepods per bird). Least Auklets from Zapadni Point flew a longer distance to the shelf break area. These birds preyed on copepods, which have a body mass three times bigger (18.5 mg of wet weight), and collected smaller amounts of prey (168 copepods per bird) to obtain a full food load. The differences in the feeding behavior of Least Auklets from the neighboring colonies allow spatial partitioning in the use of different food resources and must result in the reduction of local intraspecific and interspecific competition for food.","Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Oceanol Inst, Moscow 117851, Russia; Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA","Flint, MV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Oceanol Inst, Moscow 117851, Russia.",,,,,,,31,7,7,0,5,PLEIADES PUBLISHING INC,NEW YORK,"PLEIADES HOUSE, 7 W 54 ST, NEW YORK,  NY, UNITED STATES",0001-4370,1531-8508,,OCEANOLOGY+,Oceanology,,2002,42,,,1,,,S114,S121,,,,,8,Oceanography,Oceanography,631QY,WOS:000180179500008,,,,,2021-09-21,

Actual 5- year height increment is predicted by using: (1) the competition of the remaining overstorey, (2) the intra- and interspecies competition among the regeneration itself and (3) a modifier for the edge effect on incident light. For situations where no regeneration information is available, predictions were made of the occurrence of regeneration during the last 5 years using artificial neural networks. The results indicate that the probability of juvenile trees and the probability of a tree species per unit area are predictable with neural networks. The juvenile tree height growth analyses demonstrate that overstorey and inter- or intraspecific competition among the regeneration as well as the modifier for the edge effect on incident light were important to ensure accurate model predictions.","Univ Agr Sci, Inst Forest Growth Res, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Hasenauer, H (corresponding author), Univ Agr Sci, Inst Forest Growth Res, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",,,"Kindermann, Georg Erich/0000-0003-4297-1318",,,,21,18,22,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,,2002,75,4,,,,,385,394,,10.1093/forestry/75.4.385,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,613EN,WOS:000179119300008,,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Every Conus species has its own distinct repertoire of 100-200 venom peptides, with each peptide presumably having a physiologically relevant target in prey or potential predators/competitors. There is a remarkable interspecific divergence observed in venom peptide genes, which can be rationalized because of biotic interactions that are species specific. The peptide families/subfamilies characteristic of clades of related Conus species are potentially useful clade markers and can be used to indicate common biological mechanisms characterizing that clade.

In contrast, we found a linear increase in species richness with increasing logarithm of the pooled density of shrews, which we use as a measure of habitat productivity for shrews. The model of Hanski and Kaikusalo (1989) assumes a trade-off between exploitative and interference competitive abilities, and it predicts that the size structure of small mammal communities should shift from the dominance of small species (superior in exploitative competition) in unproductive habitats to the dominance of large species (superior in interference competition) in productive habitats. Shrew assemblages show such a shift. Though it is not possible to draw definite conclusions about the role of interspecific competition from our observational data, the changing size structure of local shrew assemblages with increasing habitat productivity is a predictable feature of their community structure.","Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtzov Inst Eol & Evolut, 33 Leninsky Prospect, Moscow 117071, Russia; Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Systemat, Metapopulat Res Grp, SF-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Sheftel, BI (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtzov Inst Eol & Evolut, 33 Leninsky Prospect, Moscow 117071, Russia.",shefale@orc.ru,,"Sheftel, Boris/0000-0003-3808-8389",,,,60,8,10,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0001-7051,2190-3743,,ACTA THERIOL,Acta Theriol.,,2002,47,,,1,,,69,79,,10.1007/BF03192480,,,11,Zoology,Zoology,583QY,WOS:000177420600005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Secondary succession of soil nematodes was examined by using the chronosequence of meadow sites (period I: 1978-1983) and also by analysing the same. sites 15-17 years later (period II: 1994-1997). The analysis was focused on the taxa (genera) of nematodes and on 19 to 29 parameters describing the community as total density, density of trophic groups, diversity indices and maturity indices, The pattern of successional changes was obtained for periods from. 2 to 117 years after drainage. Natural not-drained fens were used for comparison. Soil structure and soil processes occurring over the time considered can be characterized as follows: soil moisture (by weight) 80-52%, total soil porosity 90-77%, bulk density 0.16-0.44 (to 0.92) g cm(-3), total C content in soil 47-7%, total N content in soil 4.4-0.5%, ranges in the sequence from Mt I (poorly moorshified soils) to Mt III (strongly moorshified soils). In natural fens, soil moisture was 80%, soil porosity 90%, bulk density 0.15-0.35 g cm(-3), and peat-forming processes (Pt) were continued. As compared with natural fens, drainage and management of fens was associated with increasing density of total nematodes and their components such as bacterivores, fungivores, facultative plant feeders, obligate plant feeders, omnivores, and predators. In drained fens the density of nematodes declined with succession with the exception of omnivores. The increase in the density of omnivores was positively correlated with the number of years after drainage (r = 0.48, P<0.01). The indices of taxa diversity and maturity indices were positively correlated with years after drainage (P<0.001-0.05). In natural fens, ranges of density of all trophic groups were lower, and maturity indices higher than in drained peat meadows. The mechanisms driving the first stage of succession in nematode communities (until about 30 years after the drainage of fens) seem to be tolerance to the droughts and to the excess of nitrogen what was accompanied with higher density of herbivores (mainly Paratylenchus). In later stages, interspecific competition is likely to play a more important,role. Also a statistically significant relation was found of some taxa and parameters to peat type.","Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland","Wasilewska, L (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, Dziekanow Lesny, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland.",ekolog@warman.com.pl,,,,,,99,8,9,0,11,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

For unexploited lakes combined, mortality and condition were not different from exploited lakes. However, one unexploited lake, Marsh Lake, had the fastest growth, highest proportion of older fish and highest condition of all populations sampled. This lake had low interspecific competition and high invertebrate abundance, which likely resulted in fast growth and high condition.

An amazing variety of mammals produce seismic vibrations by drumming a part of their body on a substrate. The drumming can communicate multiple messages to conspecifics about territorial ownership, competitive superiority, submission. readiness to mate, or presence of predators. Drumming also functions in interspecific communication when prey animals drum to communicate to predators that they are too alert for a successful ambush. The diversity of mammals that drum in varied contexts suggest independent evolution in different lineages. Footdrumming, as with other signals, probably originated by ritualization of older forms of behavior not associated with communication such as running and digging. Footdrumming patterns are species specific and range from single thumps to individual footdrum signatures. Although mammals communicate above ground with airborne drumming signals, they can also transmit sound seismically into the burrow where the signals become airborne and are received with ears especially adapted to hear low-frequency sound. Footdrumming has been studied the most extensively in kangaroo rats, Dipodomys. A comparison of species of different body mass shows that smaller sized, non-territorial species have no ritualized footdrumming; medium-sized species drum a simple pattern in limited contexts; while larger-sized species communicate territorial ownership with complex patterns. Future studies should examine the mechanics and energy requirements of drumming to test hypotheses about body size limitations on the evolution of footdrumming. Our understanding of drumming as communication is limited until investigators conduct field tests of responses to drumming signals in the contexts in which the signals are generated.","San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA","Randall, JA (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",jrandall@sfsu.edu,,,,,,107,70,71,1,26,SOC INTEGRATIVE COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,MCLEAN,"1313 DOLLEY MADISON BLVD, NO 402, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA",0003-1569,,,AM ZOOL,Am.

Contrary to previous studies, a positive relationship was found between endophyte infection frequency and diversity (N = 23, F = 5.23 R(2) = 0.19, P < 0.03). A strong interaction was found between the mowing treatment and endophyte infection frequency in predicting diversity (N = 22, F = 36.1, R(2) = 0.84, P < 0.0001), where the maximum species richness was present in plots that were both mowed and highly endophyte infected. The relationship between endophytes and diversity varied through the successional continuum (the mowing treatments) but was generally positive. The soil in mowed plots was drier than in unmowed plots (t = 2.1, df = 28, P < 0.05). We suggest that heavy mowing decreases soil moisture levels enough to reduce the interspecific competitive ability of infected F. arundinacea, thereby promoting local diversity. Endophyte presence is important, but the previously reported negative relationship between endophyte infection and community diversity is probably overly simplistic in complex ecological settings.","Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; So Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA","Spyreas, G (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, 607 E Peabody Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",spyreas@inhs.uiuc.edu,"Middleton, Beth/D-1778-2014","Middleton, Beth/0000-0002-1220-2326",,,,72,30,32,0,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1058-5893,,,INT J PLANT SCI,Int.

These measurements are used to quantify elements of 'community matrices', which are coefficients summarizing dynamics. In many cases, experimental manipulations are used to estimate certain interactions that are deemed to be likely to be of most dynamic significance (most 'intense'), while other relationships within the community are estimated by using correlative means. These data are then linked by using statistical methods such as path analysis. The two forms of data are gathered by using very different methods: (1) experiments, usually involving confinement (or exclosure); and (2) quadrat- or transect-based information. A major issue is whether information from these two different sources are 'compatible', especially in relation to whether they have similar scalar responses. Can they be reliably mixed? Here, quadrat- and enclosure-based information are derived for the same model systems to evaluate whether scalar responses are consistent between the two forms of information. Interactions between pairs of three forms of forager are considered. For two of these forms, biases are generally consistent between enclosure and quadrat data indicating that they have similar scalar responses. However, for a third foraging form that has more 'intelligent' foraging and decision-making behaviour, major inconsistencies in deductions and biases arise. These latter results are discussed in terms of the implications for construction of community matrices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Included were a primary forest and three disturbed forests which had been cut for crop planting and abandoned 5, 15, and 40 yr after agricultural use for natural regeneration. Ant communities of at least 10 individuals of one tree species were sampled from each forest type by fogging. Diversity and community structure differed clearly among forest types. During the course of forest regeneration ant communities became more and more similar to those of the primary forest. A surrogate analysis shows that ant communities of the primary forest cannot be distinguished from randomly composed communities. This is in contrast to the theoretical expectations according to which ant communities should be structured by interspecific competition that lead to a large degree of predictability. However, a deterministic pattern of ant communities is found in the disturbed forest. This indicates that human disturbance not only changes the faunistic composition of ant communities but could also change the dynamics of the whole system. The transition from stochastic to deterministic communities might be of general importance for understanding the mechanisms structuring communities in disturbed habitats.","Biozentrum, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; Inst Theoret Phys, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany","Floren, A (corresponding author), Biozentrum, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",floren@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Biehl, Michael/B-5105-2009","Biehl, Michael/0000-0001-5148-4568",,,,29,51,54,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,OCT,2001,24,5,,,,,547,554,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.d01-210.x,,,8,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,495HH,WOS:000172333900006,,,,,2021-09-21,

In the present study, the influence of bacteriophages on the diversity and population dynamics of four marine bacterial phage-host systems was studied experimentally in continuous cultures and theoretically by a mathematical model. By use of whole genome DNA hybridization toward community DNA, we analyzed the dynamics of individual bacterial host populations in response to the addition of their specific phage in continuous cultures of mixed bacterial assemblages. In these experiments, viral lysis had only temporary effects on the dynamics and diversity of the individual bacterial host species. Following the initial lysis of sensitive host cells, growth of phage-resistant clones of the added bacteria resulted in a distribution of bacterial strains in the phage-enriched culture that was similar to that in the control culture without phages after about 50-60 h incubation. Consequently, after a time frame of 5-10 generations after lysis, it was the interspecies competition rather than viral lysis of specific bacterial strains that was the driving force in the regulation of bacterial species composition in these experiments. The clonal diversity, on the other hand, was strongly influenced by viral activity, since the clonal composition of the four species in the phage-enriched culture changed completely from phage-sensitive to phage-resistant clones. The model simulation predicted that viral lysis had a strong impact on the population dynamics, the species composition, and the clonal composition of the bacterial community over longer time scales (weeks). However, according to the model, the overall density of bacteria in the system was not affected by phages, since resistant clones complemented the fluctuations caused by viral lysis. Based on the model analysis, we therefore suggest that viral lysis can have a strong influence on the dynamics of bacterial populations in planktonic marine systems.","Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Lab, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark; Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Marine Ecol, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; Zentrum Umweltforsch & Umwelttechnol, Fachbereich Biol Chem 2, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Middelboe, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Lab, Strandpromenaden 5, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark.",,"Middelboe, Mathias/B-9995-2009; Hagstrom, Ake/Q-9257-2019","Middelboe, Mathias/0000-0002-9587-9171; ",,,,25,93,97,0,27,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROBIAL ECOL,Microb.

Very little is known about leaf life spans of evergreen trees in the temperate forests of South America. Leaf life spans were estimated by static demographic methods, and associated leaf traits measured, for four conifers of this region. It was expected that leaf life span variation would correlate negatively with soil fertility of habitats normally occupied by each species. This prediction was upheld by the data. The mean leaf life span determined for Araucaria araucana (24 years) is among the highest figures reported for any plant species. This extreme leaf longevity was associated with very robust construction (high leaf mass per unit area) and very low nitrogen content. These aspects of the ecology of A. araucana may affect its fitness in two ways. Firstly, slow foliage turnover will reduce its annual nutrient requirements for crown maintenance, a trait that is thought to be crucial for survival on nutrient-poor sites. Secondly, the low decomposability of A. araucana leaf litter is likely to cause nutrient immobilisation, possibly favouring site retention by A, araucana in the face of competition from faster-growing but more nutrient-demanding species. Interspecific variation in leaf life span appeared to be systematically related to variation in leaf mass per unit area ALMA) and leaf nitrogen, in agreement with a large body of evidence that leaf evolution is constrained by a trade-off between trait combinations which optimise carbon gain and growth in resource-rich habitats, and those which favour persistence in chronically adverse environments.","Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile","Lusk, CH (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",clusk@udec.cl,,,,,,32,23,26,1,15,SOC BIOLGIA CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 16164, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

It has also been suggested that such biotic resistance has a negligible influence on the outcome of an invasion, but that the abiotic characteristics of the environment being invaded are more important. The latter has been claimed to be especially important on the islands of the Southern Ocean. In order to test these competing hypotheses we examined the distribution and abundance of indigenous and introduced springtails across 13 habitats, which differ considerably in the properties of their soils, and soil temperature, on the eastern quarter of sub-Antarctic Marion Island. There was no evidence of negative abundance covariation or species associations within habitats, nor were there significant relationships between species richness or abundance of the indigenous as opposed to the introduced collembolans across habitats. Interspecific interactions thus seem to have played no readily identifiable role in the outcome of invasions by Collembola on Marion Island. In contrast, the indigenous and introduced species responded very differently to abiotic variables. The indigenous Collembola prefer drier, more mineral soils with a low organic carbon content, and species richness tends to be highest in cold, fellfield areas. On the other hand, the introduced springtails prefer moist, warm sites, with organically enriched soils. Introduced species richness was negligible in cold, fellfield areas. Disturbance also appeared to influence positively the species richness and abundance of introduced species at a site. These results provide independent support for the idea that abiotic factors, especially temperature, significantly influence the likelihood of biological invasions on Southern Ocean islands. They also suggest that predicting the outcome of climate change on community structure in this region is likely to be problematic, especially in the case of the Collembola.","Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Environm Sci, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot, ZA-7601 Matieland, South Africa","Chown, SL (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",slchown@zoology.up.ac.za,"Chown, Steven L/H-3347-2011; Barendse, Jaco/F-7064-2012","Chown, Steven L/0000-0001-6069-5105; Barendse, Jaco/0000-0003-2859-4501; Marshall, David/0000-0003-3771-5950",,,,54,56,59,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,AUG,2001,24,4,,,,,421,430,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.d01-198.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,485KJ,WOS:000171753300006,,,,,2021-09-21,

Available evidence suggests that the NAO influences ecological dynamics in both marine and terrestrial systems, and its effects may be seen in variation at the individual, population and community levels. The ecological responses to the NAO encompass changes in timing of reproduction, population dynamics, abundance, spatial distribution and interspecific relationships such as competition and predator-prey relationships. This indicates that local responses to large-scale changes may be more subtle than previously suggested. We propose that the NAO effects may be classified as three types: direct, indirect and integrated. Such a classification will help the design and interpretation of analyses attempting to relate ecological changes to the NAO and, possibly, to climate in general.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Inst Marine Res, N-5024 Bergen, Norway; IFREMER, Lab Ecol Halieut, F-44311 Nantes 03, France; Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Kristineberg Marine Res Stn, S-45034 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Sir Alister Hardy Fdn Ocean Sci, Plymouth PL1 3BN, Devon, England; Inst Marine Res, Flodevigen Marine Res Stn, N-4817 His, Norway","Stenseth, NC (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Div Zool, POB 1050 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",n.c.stenseth@bio.uio.no,"Ottersen, Geir/AAS-3046-2020; Planque, Benjamin/D-2729-2013; Ottersen, Geir/F-4393-2014; Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; Ottersen, Geir/B-2069-2008; Ottersen, Geir/M-9676-2019","Planque, Benjamin/0000-0002-0557-7410; Ottersen, Geir/0000-0002-9453-6679; Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; Ottersen, Geir/0000-0002-9453-6679",,,,122,550,573,3,176,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,2001,128,1,,,,,1,14,,10.1007/s004420100655,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,447VE,WOS:000169592500001,28547079,,,,2021-09-21,

To describe the relationship between local and regional species richness, the ground-dwelling ant fauna of 10 forest remnants was sampled, using 10 l m(2) quadrats in each remnant. The ants were extracted from the litter by using Winkler sacs. Using regression analyses, an asymptotic pattern between local and regional species richness was detected. This saturated pattern may be related to three processes: (i) high interspecific competition; (ii) habitat species specialization; or (iii) stochastic equilibrium. It is concluded that non-interactive processes, such as stochastic equilibrium and habitat specialization may act as factors regulating species richness in this community. The predominance of locally restricted species, in all sampled remnants, seems to indicate the occurrence of a high degree of habitat specialization by the ant species. This result is evidence for the hypothesis that community saturation has been generated by non-interactive processes. Although ants are frequently described as highly interactive, it is possible that interspecific competition is not important in the structuring of ground-dwelling ant communities.","Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Geral, BR-36571000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Anim, BR-36571000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Schoereder, JH (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Geral, BR-36571000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",jschoere@mail.ufv.br,"Schoereder, Jose/A-4932-2013; Schoereder, Jose/A-8540-2008; DeSouza, Og/A-7140-2008","DeSouza, Og/0000-0002-7108-0242; Schoereder, Jose/0000-0002-7680-1555",,,,35,20,21,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,APR,2001,26,2,,,,,187,192,,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2001.01101.x,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,418KF,WOS:000167888900009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Qualitative and semi-quantitative investigations of gut contents and faeces showed that all four species use detritus as the main food source. Detrital lumps from the underside of sea ice had the same item composition as amphipod gut contents and faeces. Crustacean remains and ice algae were additional food items, but overall they were quantitatively less important. All species are omnivorous; however, differences in gut contents, behavioural observations and functional-morphological studies of the mandibles suggest a differentiation within this feeding strategy. G. wilkitzkii is a detritivorous-carnivorous-necrophagous-suspension-feeding species and shows the most complex feeding strategy. O. nanseni and O. glacialis are predominantly detritivorous-necrophagous, whereas A. glacialis is characterised as a more herbivorous-detritivorous species. By using a variety of the available food sources under Arctic sea ice, the amphipods are well adapted to the under-ice habitat and are less influenced by temporal and spatial variations. Furthermore, the wide food spectrum of all four species reduces the intra- and interspecific competition in a habitat where certain food sources are limited or only seasonally available.","Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany","Poltermann, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Polar Inst, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.",,,,,,,57,69,73,0,12,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0722-4060,,,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,FEB,2001,24,2,,,,,89,96,,10.1007/s003000000177,,,8,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,395KP,WOS:000166579800003,,,,,2021-09-21,

There was a high degree of overlap in temporal periods of activity between these two whiptails (D = 0.71, spring; 0.78, summer). Most lizards were observed basking between 0700 - 0830 hr CST, with peak activity to 1059 hr. Activity decreased markedly after 1300 hr. With respect to microhabitat preferences, C. marmoratus was most frequently associated with open sandy areas, whereas C. tesselatus preferred foraging near rocks exposed to the sun or within shaded areas of rock cover. Tongue-flicking rates when foraging and when in close proximity to conspecifics were significantly higher in C. marmoratus.

The COG1193 family of MutS-like proteins is made up of polypeptides that have been predicted from genomic sequencing data from various prokaryotes, but their biological role has not yet been analysed. The functional study of yshD revealed that the gene is constitutively transcribed during the life cycle of B. subtilis, and in minimal medium expression remains at appreciable levels until very late in stationary phase. Fluctuation tests with yshD knock-out mutants did not indicate any role for the protein in preventing the accumulation of spontaneous forward mutations to Rif(R), nor was any functional interaction with MutS or MutL suggested in fluctuation experiments with mutants lacking combinations of the three genes. Nevertheless, the mutation spectrum observed in the rpoB gene in the Delta yshD strain has some characteristic features.

It was shown that polyploidization of quail cardiomyocytes occurs during the first 40 days after hatching and ends by the time growth is completed. In adult birds, the cardiomyocyte ploidy hardly changed at all. Interspecies comparison revealed that in the adult bird myocardium 2cx2 myocytes are predominant, accounting for at least 50% of the cell population. Multinuclear cells with three to eight diploid nuclei were widespread. The percentage of such cells was five to six times higher in precocial species than in altricial birds of the same weight. Myocytes with polyploid nuclei were rare. A significant interspecies variability of cardiomyocyte ploidy levels was observed. The most prominent differences were found between the precocial and the altricial birds. The mean number of genomes in cells correlated both with the body mass and with the growth rate of the birds. The differences between the precocial and altricial birds disappeared when a statistical method was used to eliminate the effect of the growth rate, but did not when the effect of body mass was eliminated. Among the altricial birds, which are generally immobile during growth, the cardiomyocyte ploidy levels also con elated more closely with growth rate than with body mass. The opposite was observed in the precocial birds, which are highly mobile from the first minutes of life. We conclude that the interspecies variability of bird cardiomyocyte ploidy levels is a result of changes in the balance between the cardiac functional load and the growth rate; this is manifested at the cellular level as a competition between the proliferation and differentiation of cardiomyocytes.

Diverse habitats were sampled in 160 lentic water bodies from different geologic areas, ranging from acid bog ponds to alkaline karst waters and from small temporary puddles to deep lakes. The altitudinal range comprised all mountainous regions from the montane (1290 m a.s.l.) to the alpine (2886 m a.s.l.) zone. Forty-four species were recorded, with the harpacticoids being the richest group. Although most species occupied a wide altitudinal range, some stenotopic mountain forms were restricted to alpine habitats. The most widespread taxa were Acanthocyclops vernalis, Eucyclops serrulatus, Bryocamptus rhaeticus, Arctodiaptomus alpinus and Cyclops abyssorum tatricus. All species found were listed along with notes on their distribution, ecology and patterns of coexistence. There was both a marked change in species composition and a decline in species richness from hardwater habitats in the Limestone Alps to softwater sites in the Central Alps. Copepod taxocoenoses were most diverse in montane limestone lakes and impoverished with increasing altitude. Copepods and sampling sites were ordinated using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), and copepod assemblages were defined in relation to physical and chemical parameters, habitat type and presence/absence of planktivorous fish. Planktonic species were largely absent from lakes with introduced fish. Although calanoid associations were common, coexisting diaptomids were rare, suggesting a strong interspecific competition between these predominantly filter feeders. Most copepods found are common eurytopic or cold stenothermal, but some exhibit peculiar disjunct patterns of geographical distribution, and others are apparently restricted to the Alps. Some species are discussed in more detail from a zoogeographical point of view. A complete checklist of copepods recorded to date from high-altitude sites in the Eastern Alps is provided.","Salzburg Univ, Inst Zool, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; Natl Inst Biol, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; Museum Nat Hist, Verona, Italy","Jersabek, CD (corresponding author), Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, Biodivers Dept, 1900 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA.",jersabek@acnatsci.org,"Stoch, Fabio/K-6093-2016; Schabetsberger, Robert/AAE-8038-2020","Stoch, Fabio/0000-0003-4535-3769; Schabetsberger, Robert/0000-0001-7859-6690",,,,49,41,43,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,,2001,453,1-3,,,,,309,324,,10.1023/A:1013113327674,,,16,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,499ZD,WOS:000172600200025,,,,,2021-09-21,

This paper highlights aspects of these principles that make them insufficient as a sound foundation for understanding and managing marine ecosystems, points out dangers of continuing to use approaches built on them, and presents alternatives which might be more appropriate and of lower risk. To do this, the paper considers variability of marine ecosystems on annual, medium and long-term time scales, highlighting that these scales correspond to less than, approximately equal to, and much greater than, the generation times of dominant predators in the systems. It also considers how each interval of variability may affect directly ecosystems which are controlled from the bottom up, top down, and middle outward, and how position and duration of forcing affect five types of responses: growth, maturation, recruitment, predation, and competition. Generally these five processes have manifestations at the scale of individuals, populations, and ecosystems, attention is drawn to which manifestations are the most significant for each duration and position of forcing. Effects of some combinations of duration of forcing and position of forcing can be explained reasonably well by conventional ecological theory. For other combinations, particularly forcing at time scales of predator generations on top-down or middle-out ecosystems, theory based on contest competition and equilibria are likely to be misleading. In these systems the major dynamics are transients, when many ecosystems are far from their carrying capacities, so scramble competition dominates, and the carrying capacity is not helpful in explaining the system dynamics. This review clarifies the sorts of questions that we should be asking, in order to begin to understand the transient behaviour of these non-equilibrium ecosystems. The answers to the new classes of questions may lead to great improvements in how ecosystems are managed, as well as how their variation is explained. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To better understand the role of body size and niche relationships in these syntopic species, 12 50- by 50-m plots were established in the Pisgah National Forest of western North Carolina. Trapping was conducted from August through November 1996 and from March through August 1997 using Y-shaped drift fences with associated pitfalls. Prey items and microhabitat components were measured to examine correlations with abundance of shrew species. Total shrew captures (n = 176) included 105 (59.7%) Sorex fumeus and 41 (23.3%) S. cinereus. Smoky shrews were significantly larger than masked shrews in both mass and body length. Stepwise multiple regression analyses determined that a combination of litter moisture, class 5 coarse woody debris (CWD), and number of invertebrates and mountain dusky salamanders (Desmognathus ochrophaeus) was the best predictor of S. fumeus abundance (R-2 = 92.8%), whereas S. cinereus abundance was best explained by a combination of litter moisture, leaf-litter depth, class 3 CWD, and invertebrate size (R-2 = 57.7%). Microhabitat niche breadth (MB) of S. cinereus (2.11) was narrower than that of S. fumeus (2.27). Linear discriminant function analysis revealed significant ecological separation between the 2 shrew species (D-2 = 0.62), despite high levels of microhabitat niche overlap (MO = 65.7%). The larger body size of smoky shrews may provide an advantage in that it can use parts of the microhabitat that are inaccessible to its smaller congener, thereby reducing interspecific competition.","Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Brannon, MP (corresponding author), Virginia Museum Nat Hist, Martinsville, VA 24112 USA.",pbrannon@vmnh.org,,,,,,54,31,33,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

It provides diverse microhabitats (allowing resource partitioning), and presents these in a complex mosaic, such that competitors may be spatially and temporally separated (promoting patch dynamics). The objective of our study was to assess the importance of patch dynamics for the maintenance of landscape-level nematode diversity. The spatiotemporal aggregation patterns in populations of five species of the bacterivorous genus Chronogaster were analyzed for a 0.7-ha riparian wetland, during four seasons, using geostatistical methods (spatiotemporal variograms, cross-correlograms, and log-normal kriging). We found that for the three most abundant species, aggregation was significant over distances of 13-39 m, with intraspecific aggregation stronger than interspecific aggregation. In addition, species patterns appeared to be temporally dynamic: local population declines alternated with local blooms at different sites and seasons. One species was consistently present at the same few sites, but the other species showed gradual temporal decreases and increases at different locations in the wetland. Combining nematode patterns with information on soil resource distributions and Chronogaster ecology, indicated that both soil resource patchiness and repeated, but largely unpredictable, disturbances caused by local soil moisture fluctuations could promote landscape-level Chronogaster diversity by providing ample 'probability refuges.' Local species populations, reduced by competition, predation and draught, could recolonize patches either through the awakening of local dormant 'seed populations,' or through limited passive dispersal by wind, water, and phoresis. We suggest that the spatiotemporal Chronogaster data provide preliminary evidence for the importance of patch dynamics in maintaining soil nematode diversity.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Ettema, CH (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Subdept Soil Qual, POB 8005, NL-6700 EC Wageningen, Netherlands.",,,"Coleman, David/0000-0003-0390-1501",,,,42,44,47,0,12,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2000,125,3,,,,,444,452,,10.1007/s004420000468,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,376DJ,WOS:000165442700016,28547340,,,,2021-09-21,

Traditional explanations for interspecific variation in home range size are based almost exclusively on analysis of northern hemisphere eutherian mammals. These suggest that variation in body size is the most important factor, while climate and diet are less important. The generality of these explanations is tested using a novel database on macropod marsupials (kangaroos and allies). 2. We found a 490-fold difference in home range size and a 50-fold difference in body weight amongst macropods. In agreement with studies on eutherians, female home range size was strongly correlated with body weight. 3. However, unlike the pattern in eutherians, climate was more strongly associated with home range size than was body weight: annual rainfall explained more than half of the variation, while group size (6%) and population density (8%) were minor explanatory variables, and female body weight explained no further variation. 4. When we used a phylogeny-based comparative method, annual rainfall explained 32% of the variation and body size a further 16%. 5. Sex differences in home range size were not explained by body size dimorphism, but were strongly related to rainfall and less strongly related to the degree of female home range overlap. Species with large sex differences in home range size lived in high-rainfall habitats where female ranges were small. 6. We suggest that climate has been a key factor in social evolution of macropods. In species inhabiting productive habitats, small female home ranges allow males to overlap with more females by increasing home range size. Males often compete for females by searching widely. In less productive habitats, males cannot further increase or defend their already large home ranges, resulting in similar-sized ranges in both sexes. Where female home range overlap is high, males need not increase home ranges as much, but this effect is secondary to that of climate. 7. In agreement with the theory that competitive searching by males is not necessarily related to body size, species with extreme size dimorphism had no sex difference in home range size, and species with extreme home range differences between the sexes showed no particular pattern of dimorphism. 8. Variation among macropod species in home range size and social organization is more closely correlated with variation in habitat productivity, and is less related to body size, diet, density and group size, than predicted by eutherian-based explanations.","Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Fisher, DO (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Zool, Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.",d.fisher@abdn.ac.uk,"Owens, Ian PF/F-1392-2010; Fisher, Diana O/C-1324-2010","Fisher, Diana O/0000-0002-4017-3710; Owens, Ian/0000-0001-6080-3321",,,,170,79,83,0,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Brook trout may displace Lahontan cutthroat trout through 2 mechanisms: interspecific predation and competition for food. To evaluate the evidence for these alternatives, we examined stomach content of 30 trout of each species captured in the North Fork Humboldt River, northeastern Nevada, to compare number, size. and taxonomic composition of prey. Taxonomic dietary overlap was high (81.4%) between brook and Lahontan cutthroat trout. Both species were nonselective in their feeding habits. Lahontan cutthroat trout consumed over 2.5 times as many prey on average, but brook trout consumed significantly larger prey. No trout of either species occurred in fish diets. Only a single fish, a Paiute sculpin (Cottus beldingi), was found in stomachs, and the majority (>90%) of prey consisted of insect taxa. Size and number of prey consumed were positively related to fish size for Lahontan cutthroat trout but not for brook trout. These results tio not provide compelling evidence to suggest feeding by Lahontan cutthroat trout is limited by presence of large numbers of brook trout in the North Fork Humboldt River. However, fundamental differences in each species' utilization of food in this system indicate that a better understanding of observed differences may help to explain the variable success of brook trout invasions across stream habitats in the Lahontan Basin and their potential effects on Lahontan cutthroat trout.","Univ Nevada, Biol Resources Res Ctr, Reno, NV 89557 USA; Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Dunham, JB (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Boise forestry Sci Lab, 316 E Myrtle, Boise, ID 83702 USA.",,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,28,18,18,0,23,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV,PROVO,"290 LIFE SCIENCE MUSEUM, PROVO, UT 84602 USA",1527-0904,,,WEST N AM NATURALIST,West.

In this paper, I discuss a variety of factors, in addition to competition, that influence the observed relationship between species distribution and the availability of suitable habitat. In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Pulliam, HR (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",pulliam@ecology.uga.edu,,,,,,61,900,941,4,500,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies. Our survey revealed 20 fragmentation experiments worldwide. Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) of particular species. Other important themes were the effect of fragmentation in interspecific interactions, the role of corridors and landscape connectivity in individual movements and species richness, and the influences of edge effects on ecosystem services. Our comparisons showed a remarkable lack of consistency in results across studies, especially with regard to species richness and abundance relative to fragment size. Experiments with arthropods showed the best fit with theoretical expectations of greater species richness on larger fragments. Highly mobile taxa such as birds and mammals, early-successional plant species, long-lived species, and generalist predators did not respond in the expected manner. Reasons for these discrepancies included edge effects, competitive release in the habitat fragments, and the spatial scale of the experiments. One of the more consistently supported hypotheses was that movement and species richness are positively affected by corridors and connectivity, respectively. Transient effects dominated many systems; for example, crowding of individuals on fragments commonly was observed after fragmentation, followed by a relaxation toward lower abundance in subsequent years. The three long-term studies (greater than or equal to 14 years) revealed strong patterns that would have been missed in short-term investigations. Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for elucidation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potential for changing responses to fragmentation over time.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ctr Biodivers Res, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Debinski, DM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, 124 Sci 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",debinski@iastate.edu; predator@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu,,"Debinski, Diane/0000-0002-7144-4640; Rodiles-Hernandez, Rocio/0000-0003-0355-5477",,,,82,897,948,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

From 1992 to 1996, I examined. in northern Switzerland, the relations between habitat factors and home range size of 33 radio-tracked middle spotted woodpeckers (Dendrocopos medius), an endangered species confined to mature oak forests. Stepwise backward multiple regression revealed that home range size decreased from winter to late spring; furthermore, range size was inversely correlated to the densities of large oaks (greater than or equal to 36 cm dbh) and of potential cavity trees. Neither intra- nor interspecific competition seemed to influence home range size. Jackknife and cross-validation procedures indicated good predictive capability of the habitat model. Therefore, both the availability of large oaks, being related to potential food abundance! and of potential cavity trees, being related to reproduction, appear to be used as proximate cues to determine home range size. Management decisions concerning the endangered middle spotted woodpecker have focused on the conservation and promotion of large oaks; in the future they should consider the supply of trees suited for cavity excavation as well.

Interspecific comparisons suggest an inverse relationship between sperm velocity and sperm longevity, but this trade-off has never been demonstrated within a species. Here I investigate how sperm velocity and sperm longevity influence the patterns of fertilization in the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. In the laboratory, I examined 11 male-female pairs of sea urchins for variation in sperm velocity and sperm longevity, and determined the correlations of these traits with the percentage of eggs fertilized with serially diluted sperm. Males with faster sperm had higher rates of fertilization than males with slower sperm. Within individual males, as sperm aged they slowed down and showed a reduced percentage activity and lower rates of fertilization. Across males, the average velocity of freshly spawned sperm was inversely related to sperm longevity. These results establish the possibility that sperm traits are adapted for varying conditions along a continuum from sperm limitation to sperm competition.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Levitan, DR (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",levitan@bio.fsu.edu,,,,,,19,210,213,0,52,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In this study, field experiments were carried out to examine recolonization and succession of macrobenthic infauna in defaunated sediments, and the time required for recovery from complete defaunation to a stable community. Trays (33 cm length x 25.5 cm width x 11 cm depth) of defaunated sediment were exposed at the subtidal of a pristine site in subtropical Hong Kong. Temporal changes of macrobenthic communities in defaunated sediment were analyzed by univariate and multivariate statistics, and compared with those in undisturbed natural sediment at the same site. Initial colonization of macrobenthos occurred rapidly. A total of 42 species was found, with an average of 258 animals per tray and 24 species per tray recorded in the first month. Abundance showed a small peak (496 animals per tray) after 3 months, reached a sharp peak (1154 animals per tray) after 6 months, and declined thereafter. Species number increased gradually, reached a maximum (68 species per tray) after 9 months, and then decreased. Recolonization was predominantly contributed by larval settlement rather than adult migration. Temporal changes in abundance, species number and diversity of the macrobenthic community in defaunated sediment resemble the spatial changes along a decreasing pollution gradient previously defined by other authors. Results of this experiment suggest that newly available sediment may allow more species to colonize (or coexist) than sediment pre-occupied by an established community. This is probably due to less interspecific competition in the former habitat. No significant difference in abundance or species richness was observed between defaunated and natural sediments after 15 months, suggesting that a stable community had been achieved, although minor variations in species composition were still discernible between defaunated and natural sediments.","City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Biochem & Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wu, RSS (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Biochem & Chem, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Wu, Rudolf/B-4203-2010",,,,,42,67,68,1,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Many simple theories predict that complex speciose communities should be less stable than simple ones. In contrast, stability of collective community attributes, such as functional groups, may be greater in more complex communities. We used aquatic microcosms containing microbial food webs to generate an experimental gradient of species richness. Biweekly counts of population samples permitted estimation and comparison of density, persistence time, and temporal variation in density for populations and trophic functional groups embedded in communities of varying richness. Densities of nearly half of the species declined as species richness increased, demonstrating broad community-wide density compensation that resulted from more abundant competitors and predators in species-rich communities. Persistence time, a measure of population stability, also declined with increasing species richness. Another measure of population stability, temporal variation in density, indicated that abundances of most species embedded in diverse communities varied no more than in less diverse communities. In contrast to results for individual species, temporal variation of entire functional groups composed of multiple species decreased as species richness increased. The stability of individual populations was not predicted by that of functional groups. Interspecific interactions and statistical averaging may both contribute to the reduced temporal variability of functional groups created by aggregating multiple species.","Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","McGrady-Steed, J (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",pjmorin@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,67,108,123,1,54,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2000,81,2,,,,,361,373,,,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,279ZM,WOS:000085077200007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Recent laboratory work has shown that disturbance may act to increase diversity in soft-bottom marine communities as predicted by the hypothesis. In this paper, we present the results of a field experiment which tested the impacts of physical disturbance on soft-bottom, intertidal macrobenthic communities. Five disturbance treatments were used, differing in the frequency of applied disturbance events: the highest frequency treatments were dug every week, lowest every eight weeks. The experiment was run for a total of 25 weeks over the winter of 1997/98. Our experiment controlled for differences in recovery time after disturbances. Abundances of Pygospio elegans, Macoma balthica, Hydrobia ulvae and Streblospio benedicti were all significantly reduced in high disturbance treatments, as was the total number of species. No species showed significant increases in abundance in disturbed treatments, and there was no evidence of an increase in diversity in any treatments. These results are discussed in the context of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Our results suggest that the interspecific competitive effects postulated by the hypothesis are not important in structuring this low diversity, intertidal community. However. unequivocally rejecting the hypothesis is difficult because it contains many ambiguities, and acts more as a conceptual model than as a falsifiable hypothesis.","Napier Polytech, Sch Life Sci, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland","Huxham, M (corresponding author), Napier Polytech, Sch Life Sci, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland.",,"Huxham, Mark/D-4427-2015","Huxham, Mark/0000-0001-7877-6675",,,,40,23,23,0,35,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",1434-2944,,,INT REV HYDROBIOL,Int.

Zooplankton exist in environments where food availability varies greatly over time, and success depends in part on the ability to store resources when food is abundant and to conserve them when food is scarce. This paper reports on interspecific differences in the size of stored reserves, and in respiration rate during food deprivation, of four species of planktonic rotifers. 2. The size of reserves varied from 42 to 71% of initial (well-fed) body mass. Interspecific differences in reserve size explained some of the previously observed differences in starvation time. 3. The initial response of respiration rate to food deprivation was quite variable between species. Brachionus calyciflorus was the only species to conserve energy by decreasing respiration rate in response to food deprivation. In contrast, the respiration rate of starved Asplanchna priodonta increased, while that of A. silvestrii and Synchaeta pectinata did not change, during food deprivation. 4. Theory predicts that temporal variation in resource level may facilitate the coexistence of competing species. This theory depends upon trade-offs between traits that confer competitive success in different environments. Although rotifers show a trade-off between competitive ability and maximum population growth rate, we found no evidence for trade-offs between either of those two traits and the size of reserves.","New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Biol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA","Kirk, KL (corresponding author), New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Biol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",klkirk@nmt.edu,,,,,,29,19,20,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

In the eastern Caribbean, dolphinfish are generally piscivorous, eating a wide variety of fish species including small oceanic pelagic species (e.g. flyingfish, halfbeaks, man-o-war fish, sargassum and rough triggerfish), juveniles of large oceanic pelagic species (e.g. tunas, billfish, jacks, dolphinfish), and pelagic larvae of neritic, benthic species (e.g. flying gurnards, triggerfish, pufferfish, grunts). They also eat invertebrates (e.g. cephalopods, mysids, scyphozoans), suggesting that they are essentially non-selective foragers. This appears to be typical of dolphinfish from other locations and of tropical oceanic pelagic species in general. Post-larval flying gurnards and flyingfish rank as the most important prey species overall. However, the diet varies with season, and mysids are a very important component from October to December. Diet also varies slightly with predator size (small dolphinfish eat fewer flyingfish and more squid than larger sized dolphinfish), and with sex (males take proportionally more of the active, fast swimming species such as flyingfish, squid and dolphinfish than do females). From these results and a review of the literature to determine the diet of other tropical oceanic species and the predators of dolphinfish, it can be seen that predator-prey relationships and interspecies competition for food clearly involve other commercially important species. As such, interactions between the surface trolling dolphinfish fisheries, the surface gillnet flyingfish fisheries, and the subsurface longline tuna fisheries in the eastern Caribbean can be expected.","Univ W Indies, MAREMP, Bridgetown, Barbados; Univ W Indies, Sch Grad Studies & Res, Bridgetown, Barbados","Oxenford, HA (corresponding author), Univ W Indies, MAREMP, Cave Hill,POB 64, Bridgetown, Barbados.",,,,,,,93,66,72,0,14,INST CIENCIAS MAR BARCELONA,BARCELONA,"PASSEIG JOAN DE BORBO, 08039 BARCELONA, SPAIN",0214-8358,,,SCI MAR,Sci.

Variation in resource allocation to egg size and number was investigated in seven sympatric species of Piophilidae that oviposit on carcasses or discarded cervid antlers: Liopiophila varipes (Meigen), Prochyliza xanthostoma Walker, Protopiophila latipes (Meigen), Protopiophila litigata Bonduriansky, Stearibia nigriceps (Meigen), and two unidentified species of Parapiophila McAlpine. 2. Following optimal reproductive allocation theory, relatively larger, fewer eggs were expected in (1) species that oviposit on antlers, where larvae probably experience lower risk of predation and greater competition than larvae in carcasses, and (2) species with aggressive males and male-biased sex ratios on the oviposition substrate, where risk of injury during oviposition may have favoured females laying fewer eggs. 3. Variation in reproductive allocation strategies could not be explained by known differences in larval or adult environment, but congeneric species clustered by reproductive allocation patterns. The Parapiophila species produced larger, fewer eggs than the other species, and egg number increased slowly with body size. The Protopiophila species did not deviate from expected egg sizes and numbers, and egg number increased steeply with body size. 4. An interspecific egg size-egg number trade-off resulted in a tight linear scaling of ovary volume to body size, suggesting common physiological constraints on relative ovary mass. 5. Within each species, egg size was nearly constant whereas egg number increased with female body size, suggesting species-specific stabilising selection on egg size.","Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Bonduriansky, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",russell.bonduriansky@utoronto.ca,,"Bonduriansky, Russell/0000-0002-5786-6951",,,,28,17,18,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Therefore, we predicted that fox would avoid lynx predation risk by niche segregation whereas we did not expect such a segregation between badger and lynx. As an approach for evaluating our predictions, we compared their diet, activity patterns, and habitat use in an area of Donana where the three carnivores are sympatric. Lynxes preyed almost uniquely on European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and though badgers and foxes were omnivorous, rabbits also were a major prey, resulting in high overlaps throughout the year. However, badgers preyed largely on small rabbits, whereas lynxes and foxes preyed mainly on medium-sized rabbits. There were also interspecific differences in activity patterns. Maximum levels of activity among lynxes were during sunrise and dusk (49-67%). Foxes were most active during dusk and night (34-67%), and badgers were mainly nocturnal (53-87%). Though there were seasonal differences in the amount of activity of each species, specific activity patterns changed little throughout the year. There was a strong difference in annual habitat use by the three species (P < 0.0001). Lynxes used mainly the Mediterranean scrubland during both the active (P-MAX) and the resting (P-MIN) periods. During P-MIN, foxes used the Mediterranean scrubland intensively (40% of locations on average), but during P-MAX, they used the pastureland much more intensively despite this habitat being poorer in their main prey (rabbits). As a consequence, foxes and lynxes exhibited segregation in their habitat use during the active period. Badgers also used the Mediterranean scrubland intensively, especially during P-MIN There were no seasonal differences in habitat use for lynx and fox, but there was for badgers (P < 0.015). Within the study area, the three species selected habitat suggesting they were sensitive to factors such as vegetation and prey abundance. However, in general, carnivore habitat use did not correlate with rabbit abundance. We propose that foxes avoided lynxes by using, during activity, habitats not frequented by lynxes, and that a low predation risk associated with the distinctive foraging mode of badgers may facilitate its coexistence with other carnivores.","CSIC, Dept Appl Biol, Estac Biol Donana, E-41013 Seville, Spain","Fedriani, JM (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Appl Biol, Estac Biol Donana, Avda Maria Luisa S-N, E-41013 Seville, Spain.",fedriani@ebd03.csic.es,"Delibes, Miguel/K-2744-2014; Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018; Palomares, Francisco/F-5327-2016","Delibes, Miguel/0000-0002-3569-567X; Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621; Palomares, Francisco/0000-0002-4655-7205",,,,65,153,168,0,64,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1999,121,1,,,,,138,148,,10.1007/s004420050915,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245WT,WOS:000083131600016,28307883,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Although major limiting factors for wild dog populations have been identified, including interspecific competition and diseases, such factors have not been translated into extinction risk. To assess wild dog extinction risks, we used individual-based simulations constructed from data from a 6-year field study in the Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania. Our simulations predicted that extinction risk for wild dogs was extremely sensitive to competition with lions. Extinction rates (for periods as short as 20 years) rose sharply to near 1.0 when lion populations exceeded moderate densities (approximately 110-140 lions/1000 km(2)). This prediction is remarkably consistent with, and highlights, ecological processes that may be responsible for recent patterns of extinction among wild dog populations. Infectious diseases that kill adults, such as rabies, also reduced population persistence if they increased mortality by greater than or equal to 0.3 and occurred at average intervals of less than or equal to 10 years. In contrast, diseases killing only pups, such as canine parvovirus, had weaker effects on persistence. Although persistence declined sharply for mean litter sizes less than or equal to 6, persistence was unaffected by increasing mean litter size above its normal range (i.e., 8-12 in Selous). Increasing mean pack size from typical levels reduced extinction risk, but reproductive suppression may set an upper limit on pack size. Although the risk of extinction for 20- to 100-year time frames was appreciable for many realistic ecological and demographic conditions, even low immigration rates substantially increased persistence probabilities. Active management to mitigate the effects of interspecific competition, facilitate dispersal among populations, or augment population size appears essential for wild dog conservation.","Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Montana State Univ, Dept Biol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Vucetich, JA (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",screel@gemini.oscs.montana.edu,,,,,,55,64,64,2,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Ordination by CCA analysis was performed to detect gradients in the graminoid species distribution, according to shading, distance from the reserve border and aspect. Interspecific associations among the species were tested. A total of 93 species were sampled, predominantly Poaceae and Myrtaceae families. Two alien grasses were found, Melinis minutiflora and Brachiaria decumbens, with very high values of importance. Light availability proved to be the most important analyzed environmental factor related to graminoid distribution, strongly correlated with the abundance of M. minutiflora. Both alien grasses were negatively associated with most native graminoids, suggesting they exert a strong competitive pressure on the native herbaceous community. Attention must be taken to the introduction of alien species in the country.","Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Pivello, VR (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Rua Matao,Travessa 14,Cidade Univ Armando Salles, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",vrpivel@spider.usp.br,"Pivello, Vania Regina/B-5118-2013; Meirelles, Sergio/B-2332-2013","Pivello, Vania Regina/0000-0001-8063-772X; ",,,,34,139,155,3,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Bosmina is another common anomopod zooplankter, but its body has a lower percentage of P than does that of Daphnia, and Bosmina might therefore be less susceptible to P mineral limitation. To test for this hypothesized interspecific difference in nutrition, Bosmina and Daphnia were raised on two food types: P-deficient or P-sufficient Scenedesmus acutus in two concentrations (0.2 or 1.0 mg C L-1). As predicted by its lower P content, Bosmina growth and fecundity were not affected by the P content of algal food, even though P-deficient food caused significant declines in these life history parameters for Daphnia. Results suggest that Bosmina has a lower P requirement than does Daphnia and that Bosmina may process phosphorus more efficiently or be better able to survive losses in body P content. The outcome of competition between Bosmina and Daphnia therefore might shift in favor of low-P-content zooplankton such as Bosmina under conditions of seston P mineral limitation.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Schulz, KL (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",,,"Schulz, Kimberly/0000-0003-1506-5694; Sterner, Robert/0000-0003-2292-6122",,,,64,57,60,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

This paper utilizes results from four locations of a vegetation control study that included herbicide treatments to control woody shrub and herbaceous vegetation. Age-5 average dominant height was predicted from first-year herbaceous cover, untreated first-year shrub cover, and fifth-year shrub cover. Dominant height increased 0.5 m for each decrease of about 30% in either first year herbaceous cover, untreated first-year shrub cover, or year-5 shrub cover. Lack of vegetation control on beds where vegetation was allowed to recolonize before planting reduced dominant height an additional 0.5 m. A competition index was constructed that estimates the difference between potential and actual age-5 pine height. Stand-level models were developed to link age-5 pine height and occupancy of competing vegetation to quadratic mean DBH, specific DBH percentiles, and stand basal area. The effects of interspecific competition on stand basal area and diameter percentiles could be accounted for through the effects of competing vegetation on dominant height except for treatments that did not control woody shrubs.","Auburn Univ, Glover Sch Forestry, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Lauer, DK (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Glover Sch Forestry, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",lauer@forestry.auburn.edu,,,,,,13,15,15,0,1,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Interpretation of field survey data can be difficult, however, because species numbers in any case change with time and location, as a result of density dependence acting through or together with changing levels of food supply, predation, parasitism, interspecific competition, migration, environmental variables, and so on. As a first step toward resolving these difficulties it is argued that single-species microcosm experiments are needed that establish the joint effects on populations of stress levels and population density. Inter alia these will show how carrying capacity changes with stress levels in the absence of variation in other physical and biotic variables. Until now population effects of stressors have generally been assessed experimentally by calculating population growth rates in Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs), but these are time consuming and labor intensive and have only been performed at low population density. It is argued that measurements made at low density may underestimate population stress responses. To undertake the proposed experiments, faster and more efficient techniques for measuring population growth rates and their associated confidence intervals are needed, and some suggestions are made as to hew these might be achieved.","Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Div Zool, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England","Sibly, RM (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Div Zool, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England.",,,"Sibly, Richard/0000-0001-6828-3543",,,,17,57,60,0,9,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In this study, microhabitat differences between sympatric ground-dwelling species were studied by distinguishing habitats on the basis of vegetation and types of litter. In all sites where two ground species coexisted, segregation occurred with each species showing preference for the microhabitat in which they were found. When they were in sympatry, one species was predominant in relatively wet and sheltered sites and the other in relatively dry and exposed sites. Although most species can live in both types of habitat, occupation by one species is inhibited by occupation by another. This suggests that competitive interaction between sympatric species caused segregation. Except for populations that have undergone interspecific hybridization, no examples were found of sympatric populations of two ground species sharing a similar shell colour. Species that were predominant in relatively wet and sheltered sites possessed shells with dark coloration and their colour patterns were mostly of one type. Species that were predominant in relatively dry and exposed sites possessed shells with bright coloration and their color patterns were polymorphic. Most populations from areas in which single species were distributed had shells with medium coloration. Microhabitat differentiation between sympatric species possibly caused diversification of shell colour, because bright shells are advantageous in sites where snails are largely exposed, and dark shells are advantageous in sites in where they are mostly sheltered from sunlight. In addition, frequency-dependent selection by predators hunting by sight may have operated to maintain colour polymorphism in the populations which are restricted to exposed habitats by competition with other sympatric species. This reveals the importance of interaction among closely related species as a cause of diversification in ecological and morphological traits.

The species was introduced to this subantarctic island by sealers during the 19th century. The rats are now widespread and abundant in coastal areas all around the island. The distribution of rat populations is divided into discrete units by the availability of suitable habitat which, in turn, is a consequence of the rugged topography, particularly on the west coast. Rats are found from almost sea level to 200-250 m a.s.l. and up to 1 km inland. They have adapted successfully to the rigorous climate and firmly occupy a habitat niche in an environment where food is plentiful, predators are few and interspecific competition minimal. The principal habitat, tall Poa foliosa tussock grassland, provides year-round shelter and food. Rats dig burrows in the peaty stools of the tussock plants and construct nesting chambers at the base of the dense leaf canopy. Predictably, this provides a warmer and more stable thermal environment than that experienced outside under the tussock canopy where the runs are located. Tussock grasslands are spreading under the influence of management control measures directed at the introduced European rabbit and possibly global warming. Management programmes are also directed towards the eradication of feral cats. In response, rat populations may be expected to expand in numbers and to occupy new territories. Without control this may, in the long term, have serious consequences for the island's avifauna, particularly the smaller, burrow-nesting species.","Univ Tasmania, Dept Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia","Pye, T (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Dept Zool, Box 252C-05,GPO Hobart, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",,,,,,,28,24,28,0,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0952-8369,,,J ZOOL,J.

The local top-predator community comprised c. 34 species of seabirds, two pinnipeds and eight cetaceans. It appeared that multi-species feeding associations (MSFA's),with rather low species richness and diversity, were commonly formed around fishing vessels, were attracted by or otherwise associated with cetaceans (MSFA's with a generally low but more variable species richness and moderate diversity) and occurred over natural resources, apparently mainly fish shoals (MSFA's with the highest species richness and diversity). Small, short-lived MSFA's were the commoner type, particularly those over natural prey (sandeels and small clupeoids). Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla acted as catalysts in these flocks, Common Guillemots Uria aalge and Razorbills Alca torda as diving producers, apparently driving up fish towards the surface. The specific role of all other species joining in is described in general terms. Typical associations with marine mammals were those in which the cetaceans (mainly White-beaked Dolphins Lagenorhynchus albirostris and Harbour Porpoises Phocoena phocoena) operated as 'beaters' for Northern Gannets Morus bassanus and Black-legged Kittiwakes. The functioning of MSFA's is decribed from two angles. First of all, MSFA's are prominent phenomena on the sea surface, guiding seabirds using visual cues for food finding. Secondly, perhaps more importantly, the differentiation of feeding methods deployed in MSFA's may facilitate seabirds to reach prey that would otherwise be unavailable for them. It is suggested that the frequent associations of Kittiwakes and auks are the most sustainable system, because commensalism is the underlying mechanism rather than competition. The participation of scroungers in these flocks (Herring Gulls Larus argentatus as common nearshore examples) normally ruined the MSFA formation in no time. Usually, a MSFA would usually collapse as soon as the auks gave up their synchronised feeding activities. This underlines the essential role of Alcidae in these formations. The MSFA's are common and prominent in the North Sea and they deserve further study in the context of when interspecific relationships and the structuring of seabird communities.","Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NIOZ, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; CSR Consultancy, NL-1794 BJ Oosterend, Texel, Netherlands; Joint Nat Conservat Comm, Aberdeen AB10 1UZ, Scotland","Camphuysen, K (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NIOZ, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands.",,,,,,,54,80,90,2,35,NEDERLANDSE ORNITHOLOGISCHE UNIE,ZEIST,"C/O PAUL STARMANS, OUDE ARNHEMSEWEG 261, 3705 BD ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0373-2266,,,ARDEA,Ardea,,1999,87,2,,,,,177,198,,,,,22,Ornithology,Zoology,314DB,WOS:000087038600001,,,,,2021-09-21,

The activity pattern is documented in detail for both wet and dry seasons based on observations conducted over the entire 24 h period. E, mongoz was found to be cathemeral throughout the year but exhibited shifts towards more diurnal activity in the wet season and more nocturnal activity in the dry season. The cathemeral activity pattern in the mongoose lemur appears to be coordinated with sunrise, sunset, and day length and modulated by an inhibitory effect of low nocturnal light intensity in the forest during the wet season, resulting in mainly diurnal activity. Temperature and rainfall may also influence the activity pattern. Few advantages to food-related behavior appear to derive from this activity pattern, although resource accessibility may be enhanced by nocturnal behavior in the dry season, leading to reduction in interspecific competition, Cathemerality may also represent a behavioral thermoregulatory mechanism allowing the mongoose lemur to conserve energy by being active during the cool nights of the dry season. In addition, nocturnal behavior in the dry season probably allows avoidance of predation by raptors at the time of year when least protection is afforded by vegetation. Am.

We used C-13 and N-15 natural abundance in earthworms, soils and plants to explore patterns of resource utilization by different species of earthworms in three tropical ecosystems in Puerto Rico. In a high altitude dwarf forest, native earthworms Trigaster longissimus and Estherella sp, showed less N-15 enrichment (delta(15)N = 3-6 parts per thousand) than exotic Pontoscolex corethrurus (delta(15)N = 7-9 parts per thousand) indicating different food sources or stronger isotopic discrimination by the latter. Conversely, in a lower altitude tabonuco forest, Estherella sp, and P, corethrurus overlapped completely in N-15 enrichment (delta(15)N = 6-9 parts per thousand), suggesting the potential for interspecific competition for N resources. A tabonuco forest converted to pasture contained only P, corethrurus which were less enriched in N-15 than those in the forest sites, but more highly enriched in C-13 suggesting assimilation of C from the predominant C-4 grass. These results support the utility of stable isotopes to delineate resource partitioning and potential competitive interactions among earthworm species.

Despite their distribution overlap, the differences in the distribution patterns of the species along the depth gradient were clear, with Plesionika ensis and Polycheles typhlops occurring at greater depths than Parapenaeus longirostris and Plesionika heterocarpus. Stomach content analysis revealed that all species were active predators of benthic invertebrates, while scavenging activity became more important at depths below 500 m. The species exhibited highly diverse diets, but dietary diversity was higher for those inhabiting shallower depths. Ontogenetic dietary shifts were pronounced, although dietary patterns were also significantly affected by season and depth. Interspecific dietary overlap was less than intraspecific overlap between size classes and between months. Feeding intensity was associated with the distribution patterns of the species and decreased with depth, thus it was significantly lower for the species at the deepest depths, P. typhlops and P. ensis. Dietary patterns of the species examined were quite similar and differences noted were more consistent with depth-related changes in available food resources than with changes in the position of the species in the food web. Since dietary overlap among the species when they co-occur was high, it is possible that competitive trophic interactions accounted for the low overlap in the bathymetrical distribution of the species examined. Such interactions may be of fundamental importance on the deep-sea bottoms in the Eastern Mediterranean since environmental parameters such as temperature and salinity are rather constant.","Univ Crete, Dept Biol, GR-71409 Iraklion, Crete, Greece; Inst Marine Biol Crete, GR-71003 Iraklion, Crete, Greece","Labropoulou, M (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Marine Res, Agios Kosmas, GR-16604 Iraklion, Greece.",mlabro@posidon.ncmr.gr,,,,,,63,31,32,0,4,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

A predictable variation in duration of postembryonic development was observed between specimens reared on pure or combined cultures, almost always corresponding to a reduction of duration in the combined cultures. The association with Ch. albiceps also significantly reduced the weight of mature Co. macellaria and Ch. megacephala. This decrease in weight, taken together with predation on Co. macellaria and Ch. megacephala larvae by Ch. albiceps larvae, caused a decrease in survival in all stages.

Species richness was not significantly different over 2.5 yr on stabilized oil and coal ash reefs compared to concrete control reefs. Of 19 species tested for significant differences in mean abundance, lane snapper was observed at significantly higher mean abundances on fossil-fuel ash reefs (stabilized oil ash/coal fly ash), while three reef species (hairy blenny, porkfish and gray snapper) were significantly more common on concrete control reefs. Further study is needed to determine whether contaminants (Cu, V, Ni and Zn) from stabilized ash blocks can cause abundance differences for some fishes. Plausible alternate explanations for the differences in mean abundance include both interspecific interactions (competition and predation) and differences in the attraction or retention of fish among reef replicates due to slight variations in reef dimensions.

The small eastern quoll, Dasyurus viverrinus, is preyed upon by owls and is aggressively displaced from carcasses by its larger competitor and potential predator, the Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus laniarius. Devils have no known predators but this specialized scavenger experiences intense intraspecific competition. I studied the vigilance behaviour of individuals of these species feeding on carcasses. (1) Eastern quells were more vigilant in the presence than in the absence of devils, suggesting that their vigilance functions to detect predators/competitors. (2) Devils showed a decrease in vigilance with increasing body size and age, and a trend towards a decrease with increasing group size. These are the same patterns expected if vigilance was in response to predation risk, although devils have no predators. Vigilance behaviour did not change in the presence of eastern quells, suggesting that vigilance is not directed towards interspecific competitors. (3) As expected from their greater risk of predation and injury from a larger competitor, eastern quells appeared to invest more in vigilance than devils did: they used vigilance postures that gave better visibility but disrupted feeding more.

Current hypotheses that address this issue are poorly defined and conflate several distinct theoretical positions. A model that predicts homogeneity in the extension of human growth periods is evaluated. This model is contrasted with two alternatives. The first alternative predicts heterogeneity in the extension of human growth periods. The second anticipates that human growth prolongation is the result of the uniquely derived insertion of a human childhood period into an ancestral ontogenetic trajectory. Allometric analyses of body mass growth data from 21 species of anthropoid primates suggest that human female and male ontogenies often depart from patterns established by other primates, but these departures are not uniformly exceptional. Comparisons imply that derived changes in human growth are heterogeneous. Relative to interspecific expectations, early growth periods are much prolonged, but later growth periods are actually reduced. Moreover the attributes of early growth periods, including growth rates, timing of growth events, and size-for-age, are highly variable across primates. Low correlations among growth periods suggest independence among growth phases. These analyses highlight minimal distinctions between competing models (heterogeneous extension and insertion hypotheses) that attempt to explain human growth prolongation. More important, the present study facilitates refinements of causal models that have been proposed to explain human growth prolongation. Specifically, human growth prolongation may be related to derived changes in patterns of brain development. Alternatively, metabolic factors may have exerted influences on human ontogeny However, models that predict long growth periods as a byproduct of metabolic factors do not adequately explain temporal retardation of human ontogeny.

Studied phenophases were dolichoblast vegetative growth (DVG), flower bud formation (FBF), flowering (F), fruit setting (FS), seed dispersal (SD), and leaf shedding of dolichoblasts (LSD). Considering the whole set of species, DVG, FBF and F took place mainly in spring, FS in summer, SD in autumn and LSD in summer and in autumn. Interspecific comparisons showed a wide variety of phenological patterns, which have been sorted according to the 'phenophase sequence index' (PSI). This index quantified the degree of superposition between DVG, FBF and F, and it constituted the basis for a functional classification of phenological patterns. Two groups were established. The 'type I' group was characterised by the concentration of phenophases in a short time in spring, while the 'type II' by the protraction and sequential arrangement of phenophases. Type I species performed most of their functions during a resource surplus period, but they have to face an intraplant competition between vegetative and reproductive demands. Type II species avoided intraplant competition but had to develop part of DVG, FBF and F during sub-optimal periods. It is hypothesised that type I species possess deeper roots, rely on predictable water sources and occupy mature stages of succession. Type II species, on the contrary, are expected to depend on more unpredictable water sources, to possess shallower root systems and to colonise earlier stages of succession. Intraspecific variability of phenology was found to be low among populations of the same species. Bud structure, which is a phylogenetic trait, may exert important constraints on plant phenology.","Inst Pirenaico Ecol, E-50080 Zaragoza, Spain; Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Geol, Area Ecol, E-28871 Alcala De Henares, Spain","Gabriel, MM (corresponding author), Inst Pirenaico Ecol, Avda Montanana 177,POB 202, E-50080 Zaragoza, Spain.",,"Castro-Diez, Pilar/L-4716-2014","Castro-Diez, Pilar/0000-0002-4841-5198",,,,37,23,24,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,NOV,1998,139,1,,,,,103,112,,10.1023/A:1009759318927,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,138DC,WOS:000076955300010,,,,,2021-09-21,

The use of five microhabitats by each bird species (the foliage of three tree species, shrubs and ground) and the availability of food in trees during the prebreeding, breeding and postbreeding periods of the birds' annual cycle were measured. All three tit species foraged mainly in the outer part of tree canopies (small branches and leaves or needles), Tit distributions between tree species matched food resource distributions irrespective of overall food resource levels, which varied four-fold between the study periods, and tit species. Tits also exploited secondary microhabitats (shrubs and ground) in periods of low food availability; Blue Tits tended to use shrubs, whereas Great and Crested Tits foraged on the ground. Between-trees distributions fitted that expected from an ideal free distribution, suggesting that food availability and intraspecific exploitative competition were the main factors governing tree use by tits, In contrast, patterns of use of secondary microhabitats (shrubs and ground) seemed to indicate a role for the species-specific morphological con figurations of each tit species since Blue Tits are better adapted to hang and tended to forage in shubs, whereas Great and Crested Tits are better adapted to feed on horizontal surfaces and tended to forage on the ground. No evidence of interspecific interactions was observed. Overall, the results pointed to an independent exploitation of Mediterranean mixed forest by each bird species, food availability and food accessibility being the main factors affecting microhabitat use by foraging tits.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim Vertebrados 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim Entomol 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Diaz, M (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,"Illera, Juan Carlos/C-6583-2014","Illera, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-4389-0264",,,,41,25,26,0,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,OCT,1998,140,4,,,,,654,660,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.1998.tb04711.x,,,7,Ornithology,Zoology,126RR,WOS:000076307500012,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

The interest has expanded to include ecologically significant groups and major biomass producers using mesocosm studies, emphasizing species interactions. This paper assesses the effects of UV-B radiation on dissolved organic matter, decomposers, primary and secondary producers, and briefly summarizes recent studies in freshwater and marine systems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) are degradation products of living organisms. These substances are of importance in the cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. UV-B radiation has been found to break down high-molecular-weight substances and make them available to bacterial degradation. In addition, DOC is responsible for short-wavelength absorption in the water column. Especially in coastal areas and freshwater ecosystems, penetration of solar radiation is limited by high concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter. On the other hand, climate warming and acidification result in faster degradation of these substances and thus enhance the penetration of UV radiation into the water column. Several research groups have investigated light penetration into the water column. Past studies on UV penetration into the water column were based on temporally and spatially scattered measurements. The process of spectral attenuation of radiant energy in natural waters is well understood and straightforward to model. Less known is the spatial and temporal variability of in-water optical properties influencing UV attenuation and there are few long-term observations. In Europe, this deficiency of measurements is being corrected by a project involving the development of a monitoring system (ELDONET) for solar radiation using three-channel dosimeters (UV-A, W-B, PAR) that are being installed from Abisko (North Sweden, 68 degrees N, 19 degrees E) to Tenerife (Canary Islands, 27 degrees N, 17 degrees W). Some of the instruments have been installed in the water column (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Kattegat, East and Western Mediterranean, North Atlantic), establishing the first network of underwater dosimeters for continuous monitoring. Bacteria play a vital role in mineralization of organic matter and provide a trophic Link to higher organisms. New techniques have substantially changed our perception of the role of bacteria in aquatic ecosystems over the recent past and bacterioplankton productivity is far greater than previously thought, having high division and turnover rates. It has been shown that bacterioplankton play a central role in the carbon flux in aquatic ecosystems by taking up DOC and remineralizing the carbon. Bacterioplankton are more prone to W-B stress than larger eukaryotic organisms and, based on one study, produce about double the amount of cyclobutane dimers. Recently, the mechanism of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria has been shown to be affected by UV-B stress. Wetlands constitute important ecosystems both in the tropics and at temperate latitudes. In these areas, cyanobacteria form major constituents in microbial mats. The organisms optimize their position in the community by vertical migration in the mat, which is controlled by both visible and W-B radiation. Cyanobacteria are also important in tropical and sub-tropical rice paddy fields, where they contribute significantly to the availability of nitrogen. Solar UV radiation affects growth, development and several physiological responses of these organisms. On a global basis, phytoplankton are the most important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems. The organisms populate the top layers of the oceans and freshwater habitats where they receive sufficient solar radiation for photosynthetic processes. New research strengthens previous evidence that solar UV affects growth and reproduction, photosynthetic energy-harvesting enzymes and other cellular proteins, as well as photosynthetic pigment contents. The uptake of ammonium and nitrate is affected by solar radiation in phytoplankton, as well as in macroalgae. Damage to phytoplankton at the molecular, cellular, population and community levels has been demonstrated. In contrast, at the ecosystem level there are few convincing data with respect to the effects of ozone-related W-B increases and considerable uncertainty remains. Following UV-B irradiation, shifts in phytoplankton community structure have been demonstrated, which may have consequences for the food web. Macroalgae and seagrasses are important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems (but considerably smaller than phytoplankton). In contrast to phytoplankton, most of these organisms are sessile and can thus not avoid exposure to solar radiation at their growth site. Recent investigations showed a pronounced sensitivity to solar W-B radiation, and effects have been found throughout the top 10-15 m of the water column. Photoinhibition can be quantified by oxygen exchange or by PAM (pulse amplitude modulated) fluorescence. Surface-adapted macroalgae, such as several brown and green algae, show a maximum of oxygen production at or close to the surface; whereas algae adapted to lower irradiances usually thrive best when exposed deeper in the water column. Mechanisms of protection and repair are being investigated. UV effects on aquatic animals are of increased interest. Evidence for UV effects has been demonstrated in zooplankton activity. Other UVB-sensitive aquatic organisms include sea urchins, corals and amphibians. Solar UV radiation has been known to affect corals directly. In addition, photosynthesis in their symbiotic algae is impaired, resulting in reduced organic carbon supply. Amphibian populations are in serious decline in many areas of the world, and scientists are seeking explanations for this phenomenon. Most amphibian population declines are probably due to habitat destruction or habitat alteration. Some declines are probably the result of natural population fluctuations. Other explanations for the population declines and reductions in range include disease, pollution, atmospheric changes and introduced competitors and predators. W-B radiation is one agent that may act in conjunction with other stresses to affect amphibian populations adversely. The succession of algal communities is controlled by a complex array of external conditions, stress factors and interspecies influences. Freshwater ecosystems have a high turnover and the success of an individual species is difficult to predict, but the development of general patterns of community structure follows defined routes. There is a strong predictive relationship between DOC concentration and the depth to which UV radiation penetrates in lakes. Since DOC varies widely, freshwater systems display a wide range of sensitivity to UV penetration. In these systems, increased solar UV-B radiation is an additional stress factor that may change species composition and biomass productivity. The Arctic aquatic ecosystem is one of the most productive ecosystems on earth and is a source of fish and crustaceans for human consumption. Both endemic and migratory species breed and reproduce in this ocean in spring and early summer, at a time when recorded increases in W-B radiation are maximal. Productivity in the Arctic ocean has been reported to be higher and more heterogeneous than in the Antarctic ocean. In the Bering Sea, the sea-edge communities contribute about 40-50% of the total productivity. Because of the shallow water and the prominent stratification of the water layer, the phytoplankton are more exposed and affected by solar W-B radiation. In addition, many economically important fish (e.g., herring, pollock, cod and salmon) spawn in shallow waters where they are exposed to increased solar UV-B radiation. Many of the eggs and early larval stages are found at or near the surface. Consequently, reduced productivity of fish and other marine crops is possible but has not been demonstrated. There is increased consensus, covering a wide range of aquatic ecosystems, that environmental W-B, independent of ozone-related increases, is an important ecological stress that influences the growth, survival and distribution of phytoplankton. Polar ecosystems, where ozone-related UV-B increases are the greatest and which are globally significant ecosystems, are of particular concern. However, these ecosystems are characterized by large spatial and temporal variability, which makes it difficult to separate out UV-B-specific effects on single species or whole phytoplankton communities. There is clear evidence for short-term effects. In one study a 4-23% photoinhibition of photosystem II activity was measured under the ozone hole. However, extrapolation of short-term effects to long-term ecological consequences requires various complex effects to be accounted for and quantitative evaluation remains uncertain. (C) 1998 UNEP.

The insecticide was directly lethal to insects and other arthropods, but indirect community changes mere also observed. For example, after exposure there was a remarkable (> 10-fold) increase in oligochaetes (Stylaria lacustris), probably caused by reduced predation and interspecific competition for food. When predators (insects) recolonized the system, the oligochaetes decreased in abundance and were replaced by ostracods (Herpetocypris reptans), which use similar food resources but are less susceptible to predation, The marked increase in these two taxa is probably explained by the mass death of arthropods, resulting in increased food availability.

Here, a spatially explicit, multi-species, process-based, object-oriented landscape simulation model (SHALOM) is described that is built upon major lessons from fields such as metapopulation dynamics and landscape ecology. Consistent with the current landscape ecology terminology, SHALOM has physical classes (landscape, habitat, cell, patch) and biological classes (population, species, community). Each class has functions and characteristics that are strongly based on ecological realism. Processes of SHALOM are modelled on local and global scales. At the local scale, populations grow continuously, and are affected by: (I) a community-level saturation effect (ratio between energy consumed by all populations in a patch and the energy offered by that patch); (2) a species-habitat match (match between a species' niche space and the patch's habitat space); and (3) demographic stochasticity (inverse population-size dependent residuals from deterministic birth and death rates). The global-scale processes of the model include fitness-optimizing migration and catastrophic stochasticity (disturbance) that can be controlled for its probability, intensity, and spatial range. The processes of the model use allometric relationships and energy as a common currency to bridge differences between species of different body sizes located in habitats of different productivities. These processes also allow both intraspecific and interspecific effects to take place simultaneously without assuming a specific relationship between the two. Hence, SHALOM, with its functions and procedures, opens new opportunities to study combined ecosystem, community and population processes. Simulation results given in the paper on species composition and diversity show that the integration of interspecific competition, demographic stochasticity and dispersal revealed different predictions when different combinations of these processes were used. One novel prediction was that the complex relationship between dispersal and demographic stochasticity caused the global extinction of the largest species. This, in turn, might have further implications for conservation. Overall, the model represents a synthetic approach that provides ways to explore high-level ecological complexity and suggests predictions for future studies of macroecological questions.

The main aim of this study was to determine whether these four species were segregated by habitat, size, sex and/or diet, thereby reducing the potential for intra- and interspecific competition. The densities of U. lobatus and T. personata were almost invariably greater in deep, offshore waters (20 to 35 m) than in shallow, inshore waters (5 to 15 m), while those of U. paucimaculatus were greatest in the southernmost region, irrespective of depth, and those of T. mucosa were highest at the single inshore site at which the water was deep. None of these species was segregated by either size or sex. The volumetric dietary compositions of the two Urolophus species, which consisted predominantly of various crustaceans, and those of the two species of Trygonoptera, which consisted mainly of different polychaetes, were significantly different from each other. The two Urolophus species initially fed largely on amphipods, mysids and carid decapods but, with increasing size, U. lobatus started to ingest teleosts and U. paucimaculatus commenced feeding on errant polychaetes and penaeid decapods. The contribution of errant polychaetes to the diets of T. personata rose progressively from 0% in the smallest fish to 90% in the largest fish, thereby accounting for a concomitant progressive decline in dietary breadth and for intraspecific dietary overlap typically to occur only between successive size classes. In contrast, the volumetric contribution of sedentary polychaetes to the diets of T. mucosa remained high (65 to 80%) throughout life, which accounts for the relatively low and constant dietary breadth of most size classes and a significant overlap in the diets of all but one pair of size classes. The diets of each of the four stingaree species occasionally differed between sites and sometimes underwent seasonal changes, presumably reflecting spatial and temporal differences in the types of prey in the environment. Since the ratios of benthic to epibenthic prey in the diets of the two Trygonoptera species were greater than in those of the two Urolophus species, the first two species apparently forage deeper into the substrate.

First, how can so many species coexist! There is evidence of niche partitioning, notably of physical space, but vast interspecific overlaps and trait plasticity seem equally common. It appears that coexistence of species with similar resource needs is made possible by small-scale disturbance and predation, which likely reduce local population sizes and interspecific competition. Regional processes such as dispersal, large-scale disturbance, and aggregation, which govern ecosystem level diversity, may also affect local species interactions and soil-core scale diversity. Second, what is the significance of having so many species, with so few trophic functions, for ecosystem processes! Focusing on bacterivore diversity, it is clear that species contributions to decomposition, likely to differ as a function of individual biologies, are concealed by the trophic group approach. However, considerable functional redundancy probably exists, which may explain why decomposition processes are maintained in highly disturbed soils despite the extinction of many species. Thus, soil nematode diversity is important for the long-term stability of soil functioning, and merits protection and further study.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Ettema, CH (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,91,100,103,0,33,SOC NEMATOLOGISTS,LAKELAND,"3012 SKYVIEW DRIVE, LAKELAND, FL 33801-7072 USA",0022-300X,,,J NEMATOL,J.

This study addresses the importance of habitat selection by recruits in establishing the local pattern of adult distribution in two sympatric Caribbean damselfish species, Stegastes dorsopunicans and S. planifrons. Both species inhabit shallow reefs but show little overlap in their distribution; S. dorsopunicans predominates in the reef crest and S. planifrons occurs primarily on the reef slope. Furthermore, S. dorsopunicans is associated with rocky substrate, while S. planifrons occupies live coral. The substrate cover follows a similar pattern with coral being much less common on the reef crest than on the reef slope. Monitoring recruitment every other day in reciprocal removal experiments and artificial reefs indicates that the observed pattern of local adult distribution is a product of habitat selection for both species. The presence or absence of conspecifics did not influence recruitment patterns for either species. Stegastes dorsopunicans recruited primarily to shallow, rocky areas, appearing to cue on both substratum type and depth. Stegastes planifrons recruited exclusively to coral substratum independent of depth. These results indicate that local adult patterns of distribution can be explained by habitat selection at recruitment, and that substrate type and depth may be important cues.","Univ Houston, Dept Biol, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Gutierrez, L (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Biol, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",Lgutierrez@uh.edu,,,,,,75,56,56,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1998,115,1-2,,,,,268,277,,10.1007/s004420050516,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW572,WOS:000074424700033,28308462,,,,2021-09-21,

Kawanabe also studied Buddhism by himself, and passed the examination to be a priest of his sect while still in high school. He studied zoology and ecology at Kyoto University and earned his doctorate under the guidance of Denzaburo Miyadi, a well-known Japanese ecologist, in 1960. During his academic career at Kyoto University, Kawanabe advanced to hold the chair of Animal Ecology as Professor in the Department of Zoology. Kawanabe's doctoral research concerned the social behavior and population ecology of the ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis, an amphidromous fish that lives in streams as adults and grazes algae. His research lead to the discovery that social structure changed from territoriality to schooling as population density increased, and also varied with changes in food and habitat. During this work, he pioneered the use of underwater observation to study ecology of freshwater fishes in streams. Kawanabe also observed ayu social structure from the northern to southern limits of their range, and advanced the theory that the more stable territoriality in the Lake Biwa population was a relic social structure to guarantee food supply during earlier glacial periods when productivity was lower. Additional work on stream fishes in central Japan and Okinawa Island led Kawanabe to propose that interactions among individuals affect interspecific relationships, and thereby, community structure. Discussions with Charles Elton, the famous British ecologist of Oxford University, strengthened Kawanabe's view that communities could be best understood as the whole of interrelationships' among organisms. Kawanabe advanced these ideas during a joint study he led with a host of Japanese and Zairean scientists on the fishes of Lake Tanganyika, beginning in 1979. This work, as well as additional research on Lake Biwa in Japan, led to a deeper understanding of the complexity of biotic interactions (including competition, predation, mutualism, commensalism, and indirect effects) that promote the high species diversity in these ecosystems. In addition to basic research, Kawanabe was part of research teams organized during the 1960s by D. Miyadi to study the effects of public works projects on natural environments and biota in Lake Naka-umi and Lake Biwa. During the late 1980s he expanded his network to an international venue, both by organizing and hosting important international ecological meetings in Japan, such as the Fifth International Ecological Congress, and by increasing his international activities to promote global biodiversity. In 1991, Kawanabe founded the Center for Ecological Research at Kyoto University to study the interrelationships among organisms and their environments. Recently retired from the University, he became Director General of the new Lake Biwa Museum in 1996, and continues to promote conservation of biodiversity worldwide through an international network of scientists and organizations.","Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5200105, Japan; Sakae, Wakayama 6492332, Japan","Yuma, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5200105, Japan.",,,,,,,0,2,2,0,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

This rarity is surprising, because cannibalism can confer important nutritional and competitive advantages to the cannibal. A general, but untested, explanation for why cannibalism is rare is that cannibals may be especially likely to acquire pathogens from conspecifics, owing to greater genetic similarity among conspecifics and selection for host specificity and resistance to host immune defences among pathogens. We tested this hypothesis by contrasting the fitness consequences of intra-versus interspecific predation of diseased and non-diseased prey. We fed cannibalistic tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) larvae diseased conspecifics, healthy conspecifics, diseased heterospecifics (a sympatric congener, small-mouthed salamanders, A. texanum), or healthy heterospecifics. Cannibals that ate diseased conspecifics were significantly less likely to survive to metamorphosis and grew significantly less than those that ate diseased heterospecifics, but none of the other groups differed. Tiger salamander larvae also preferentially preyed on heterospecifics when given a choice between healthy conspecifics and heterospecifics. These results suggest that pathogen transmission is an important cost of cannibalism and provide a general explanation for why cannibalism is infrequent in most species.

This suggests that there are basic ecological reasons for the wild dog's endangered status. We examined the effects of interspecific and interspecific competition, infectious diseases, foraging success, genetics and human activities on wild dogs. We present data from wild dogs in the Selous Game Reserve, and make comparisons with other populations to identify the limiting factors that are broadly important. The high density of wild dogs in Selous (40 adults/1000 km(2)) is associated with weak competition from lions and spotted hyenas. Across ecosystems, population density is negatively related to the intensity of interference competition with large carnivores. Predation by lions and hyenas accounted for 13% of known-cause deaths in Selous and 33-50% in other populations. Intraspecific competition caused 69% of known-cause deaths in Selous, through infanticide and fights between packs, although most of the victims were juveniles with low reproductive value. Infectious diseases and competition will generally interact because competitors harbor and transmit the diseases that affect wild dogs. Human activities caused 12% of deaths in Selous, even though it is large (43000 km(2)) and does not border large human or livestock populations. Humans were the major agent of mortality in some populations. Foraging success varied little across ecosystems and was not apparently limiting. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genotypes revealed clinal variation between Selous and distant populations have a genetically effective size (N-c) less than 500, so gene flow is necessary to maintain genetic diversity within populations.","[Creel, Scott; Creel, Nancy Marusha] Montana State Univ, Dept Biol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Creel, S (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Biol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",,,,"Frankfurt Zoological Society [1112/90]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN-9419452, IBN-9712613]; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; Rockefeller University","Our thanks to the management of the Selous Game Reserve, the Wildlife Division of the Ministry of lands, Tourism and natural Resources, the Council for Science and Technology, and the Serengeti Wildlife Research Institute for permission to work in Selous.

Removal of cached seeds was monitored on two Jeffrey pine foraging grids (each with 100 caches of five seeds buried 5 mm deep) and on two bitterbrush foraging grids (each with 100 caches of 15 seeds buried at the same depth). Under dry conditions, soil typically contained <0.5% water, whereas Jeffrey pine and bitterbrush seeds contained 4.37 +/- 1.46% water (mean +/- 1 SD) and 7.45 +/- 1.83% water, respectively. Under these conditions, rodents found a mean of 0.33% of available Jeffrey pine seed caches each day and 0.14% of available bitterbrush seed caches each day. After rains, soil moisture increased to as much as 8.5%, and Jeffrey pine and bitterbrush seeds contained 17.50 +/- 12.04% water and 28.04 +/- 16.35% water, respectively. When seeds and soil were moistened, the rate at which rodents removed caches increased dramatically; 8.8% of available Jeffrey pine seed caches and 2.1% of available bitterbrush seed caches were removed each day. Similar results were obtained when other foraging grids were artificially watered during a summer drought. Seeds are very hygroscopic, rapidly absorbing water whenever the environment around them becomes moistened. This moisture appears to trigger the release of odorant molecules from the seeds, which rodents can readily detect. Under dry conditions, release of odorant molecules is apparently reduced to the point that some rodents have difficulty detecting buried seeds. These results may have important implications for rodent-seed interactions, but more generally, they suggest that, for terrestrial animals inhabiting arid environments, variation in environmental water level may modulate olfactory sensitivity in many other contexts where olfaction is important, such as assessing food patch quality, social behavior, predator-prey relations, and interspecific competition.","Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; Univ Nevada, Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol Program, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Vander Wall, SB (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",,,,,,,28,120,132,2,49,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1998,79,1,,,,,233,241,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[0233:FSOGRE]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YR740,WOS:000071525500021,,,,,2021-09-21,

In 1995 we estimated the actual population size as well as reproductive success and chick growth in relation to population density and food choice. Furthermore, the methods of monitoring population size and breeding success recommended for the trilateral Joint Monitoring Project for Breeding Birds in the Wadden Sea were evaluated. To survey population size gull nests were counted on 50 randomly selected plots of 0.25 ha each ('stratified sampling'). For 1995 the estimation indicated a colony size of 13,449 Herring Gull and 1846 Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus) pairs settling on an area of about 245 ha. Highest densities were recorded in the northern dune area, where mean density was 126 Herring Gull nests/ha. Breeding biology was studied on two plots with different population density. One plot with 134 pairs/ha was located in the north of the island, and a second with only 65 pairs/ha in the south. Nests were visited every 3 days. In the southern dune area clutch initiation started significantly later than in the northern part of the island (p < 0.01; median: 11.-15.5. vs. 6.5.-10.5.). Whereas mean clutch size (2.8 eggs/clutch) was similar in the two sites, reproductive success was different. On the southern plot reproductive success was 1.5 fledged young/breeding pair, compared to 1.1 on the northern plot. The difference was mainly caused by greater predation by conspecifics, in particular predation on chicks in the more densely populated north of the island. During the first 4 weeks after hatching, the growth rate of chicks was nearly identical in the 3 years of investigation (1994-1996). Between day 5 and day 25 (linear phase of growth)body mass increased by 26.3 g/d. From day 30 onwards, the body mass of most chicks decreased, thus causing different body masses of the fledglings. At the age of 45 days the highest body masses were recorded on the northern plot in 1995, on average 781.7 g, the lowest masses in the southern dune area 1994 (552.5 g). The methods recommended for monitoring population size and breeding success in the international Wadden Sea seem also to be appropriate for recording spatial differences as well as temporal changes. Diet composition was examined by pellet analyses. The birds of both study plots fed predominantly on mussels. Whereas Macoma balthica was the main prey species of birds breeding in the north, Mytilus edulis dominated in pellets of birds breeding in the south of the island. Interestingly, birds of both plots, but in particular from the southern plot fed on terrestrial food, too. About 25% of the pellets from birds breeding in the south contained earthworms and/or miscellaneous refuse. Direct observations and radio tracking studies showed that birds from both plots regularly fed at the mainland coast, especially on refuse tips. A further increase of the Herring Gull population seems to be possible. Though reproductive success decreased with increasing population density, even a density of greater than or equal to 100 pairs/ha resulted in a high breeding success. In 1995 mean fledging success was estimated at 1.3 fledged chicks/pair. Only about 0.6 chicks/pair are necessary to maintain population size. On only about 20% of the colonized area has a density of greater than or equal to 100 pairs/ha been reached as yet. Furthermore, there are some potential breeding grounds on Mellum nor yet colonized. Though feeding conditions were good, it can be assumed for the future that feeding conditions can became one of the main factors limiting population size. Additionally, interspecific competition with the ever increasing population of Lesser Black-backed Gulls has to be taken into consideration.","Inst Vogelforsch Vogelwarte Helgoland, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany","Exo, KM (corresponding author), Inst Vogelforsch Vogelwarte Helgoland, Vogelwarte 21, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",exo@ifv-terramare.fh-wilhelmshaven.de,"Exo, Klaus-Michael/W-7664-2019","Exo, Klaus-Michael/0000-0001-9140-1835",,,,42,7,8,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0021-8375,1439-0361,,J ORNITHOL,J.

The model allowed immigration of five species of fishes from a nearby river into the constructed wetland system and allowed them to interact with each other as well as with the other biotic components of the wetland. Imported fishes included Micropterus salmoides: Lepomis macrochirus, Lepomis cyanellus, Cyprinus carpio and Ameirus natalis. These species were chosen because each is common in the nearby river and because each possesses physiological characteristics allowing survival in typical marsh conditions. Each species population was divided into three distinct ontogenetic stages and were graduated into the next ontogenetic stage as the normal consequence of growth. Modelled interactions included intra and interspecific competition; predation; feeding; reproduction; fish effects on system abiotic components (e.g., bioturbation) and mortality. The fish community underwent several major changes in structure during the first 4 years of its simulated existence, before establishing a stable structure. Under environmental conditions prevailing in the system, the fish community always evolved toward a stable state with a high-biomass population dominated by Cyprinus carpio and a smaller population of Amerius natalis. Ii the effects of suboptimal environmental conditions were removed, then the system always evolved toward a low-biomass state consisting entirely of Micropterus salmoides. The role of chance was also tested and resulted in significant short term modifications to the community structure; however, these changes decreased in magnitude and were insufficient to prevent attainment of either of the two alternate steady states. These results indicate that the fish community in wetlands has a strong self-design trajectory, tending toward almost complete dominance by Cypinus carpio unless typical wetland environmental conditions were significantly ameliorated.

House mice introduced into buildings generally became established and bred, while house mice introduced into woodland declined to extinction within three months. House mice in buildings radiated away from the stacks and some established in the surrounding grassland, while house mice in woodland rarely left the stacks. At buildings captures of house mice outdoors correlated negatively with captures of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). There was evidence of heavy predation by weasels (Mustela nivalis) on house mice in woodland, but not in buildings.

An examination of the distributions of the rodent species Clethrionomys glareolus and Microtus agrestis during a population cycle on forest clearcuts at Grimso, south-central Sweden, demonstrated clear changes towards less preferred habitats during the decline phase, particularly in M. agrestis. Intraspecific competition could be excluded as a cause since the numbers of both species declined simultaneously. There was no sign of overgrazing, while weasels, Mustela nivalis, invaded the preferred M. agrestis habitat during peak-decline. Predation thus appears more important for the local occurrence at early decline, rather than territoriality or other social behaviour.

In 1994 and 1995 I conducted a live-trapping survey at 152 sires throughout its potential geographic range. Detailed floristic, physiognomic, topographic and geology data from each site were used to develop a predictive model of bettong habitat requirements, using generalized linear modeling. Data from 62 spotlighting censuses and opportunistic observations were also used to assess potential threats to northern bettongs posed by introduced foxes Vulpes vulpes, while trapping and habitat data were employed to evaluate possible effects of rooting-damage from feral pigs and competition from rufous bettongs Aepyprymnus rufescens on northern bettong populations. The northern bettong was detected in only one area, the Lamb Range, where it was present at nearly half (33/70) of the sites surveyed. Sparse populations recorded previously at several other localities in north Queensland may have declined or disappeared. A multiple Poisson regression model indicated that northern bettongs were strongly associated with certain types of wet and mesic sclerophyll forests and woodlands, while rainforest and rainforest-invaded wet sclerophyll forests were avoided. Northern bettongs occurred only on infertile metamorphic and granitic substrates, and were never detected on richer basaltic or alluvial soils. This probably occurs because fruit-bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are a key food resource of northern bettongs, are most abundant on infertile soils. Foxes were never detected during the survey, and are unlikely to threaten northern bettong populations at present. Circumstantial evidence suggests that interspecific competition from rufous bettongs is also of minimal importance. Rooting damage by feral pigs, however, may be more significant; northern bettongs were rarely detected at sites with heavy pig damage, and this may be because pigs are also feeding on fungal fruit-bodies. At present, the greatest threat to northern bettongs is probably encroaching land development, especially in the crucial Lamb Range area. Northern Queensland is experiencing rapid population growth, and local shires are attempting to shunt residential development onto areas with infertile soils to avoid the lass of productive agricultural land. While normally a laudable practice, this is precisely the wrong policy in this specific region. A re-evaluation of the strategic development plans of local shires is urgently needed to protect remaining habitats of the northern bettong. Habitat management, especially regular burning, is also required in key bettong habitats. Burning will prevent further invasion of wet sclerophyll forests by rainforest vegetation, which renders the habitat unsuitable for bettongs, and also is likely to promote the local production of fungal fruit-bodies upon which the northern bettong is highly dependent.

Adult body mass varies by more than 10-fold, and body length (snout-vent length, SVL) varies by approximate to 2.2-fold. Predation and interspecific food competition are largely absent and can be excluded as potential forces explaining differences in body size among populations. This provides an ideal system in which to determine how proximate environmental factors affect adult body size, We compared the small iguanas from Genovesa Island (mean adult male SVL 250 mm) to the larger Santa Fe iguanas (mean adult male SVL 400 mm). Marine iguanas forage on intertidal algae pastures in scramble competition. Energy availability was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe, because of lower marine productivity on Genovesa. The length of grazable algal turf decreased with increasing sea surface temperature (SST). SST was approximate to 2 degrees C lower on Santa Fe than on Genovesa, implying approximate to 1.5 mm lower algae pastures on the latter. Genovesa showed a fivefold lower standing algal biomass and a twofold lower productivity of algae pastures than did Santa Fe. The smallest iguanas of each island had approximate to 1.5-fold higher bite rates during foraging, and their absolute food intake per day was 35% that of the largest iguanas. However, food intake per bite per gram of body mass was about twice as high for small iguanas as for large iguanas. Large iguanas of both islands showed a marked decline in body mass during the two study years, whereas small iguanas (SVL < 170 mm on Genovesa and < 320 mm on Santa Fe) increased in mass, Growth rates of SVL reflected these findings. A comparison of measured metabolizable energy with published field metabolic rates (FMR) suggested that iguanas above a threshold size were in negative energy balance, because energy intake scaled to body mass with a lower exponent (0.3) than FMR (0.97). Threshold body size was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe and differed between years: In the lean El Nino year (1991/1992), iguanas > 200 mm SVL on Genovesa and > 310 mm SVL on Santa Fe significantly lost mass; in the more productive year (1992/1993), thresholds were 230 mm and 350 mm SVL, respectively. Thus, food abundance (length and turnover of algal swards) explained differences in adult body length and mass between islands as a result of energetic limitation. On a given island, foraging efficiency (intake/bite) explained the negative energy balance of large compared to small iguanas. This also explained why, on both islands, the largest animals suffered higher mortality rates than did medium-sized ones when food was scarce. The finding that small animals outcompeted larger ones because of their higher foraging efficiency resembles the grazing succession in ungulate herbivores.","UNIV BIELEFELD, DEPT ANIM BEHAV, D-33501 BIELEFELD, GERMANY; MAX PLANCK INST BEHAV PHYSIOL, D-82319 SEEWIESEN, GERMANY",,,,,,,,64,70,71,0,48,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1997,78,7,,,,,2204,2217,,10.2307/2265956,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ789,WOS:A1997XZ78900023,,,,,2021-09-21,

Marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) populations in the Galapagos exhibit 10-fold differences in body mass between island populations. There is also strong sexual size dimorphism, with males being about twice as heavy as females. To understand the evolutionary processes shaping body size in marine iguanas, we analyzed the selection differentials on body size in two island populations (max. male mass 900 g in Genovesa, 3500 g in Santa Fe). Factors that usually confound any evolutionary analysis of body sizes-predation, interspecific food competition, reproductive role division-are ruled out for marine iguanas. We show that, above hatchlings, mortality rates increased with body size in both sexes to the same extent. This effect was independent of individual age. The largest animals (males) of each island were the first to die once environmental conditions deteriorated (e.g., during El Ninos). This sex-biased mortality was the result of sexual size dimorphism, but at the same time caused sexual size dimorphism to fluctuate. Mortality differed between seasons (selection differentials as low as -1.4) and acted on different absolute body sizes between islands. Both males and females did not cease growth when an optimal body size for survival was reached, as demonstrated by the fact that individual adult body size phenotypically increased in each population under favorable environmental conditions beyond naturally selected limits. But why did marine iguanas grow ''too large'' for survival Due to lek mating, sexual selection constantly favored large body size in males (selection differentials up to +0.77). Females only need to reach a body size sufficient to produce surviving offspring. Thereafter, large body size of females was less favored by fertility selection than large size in males. Resulting from these different selection pressures on male and female size, sexual size dimorphism was mechanistically caused by the fact that females matured at an earlier age and size than males, whereafter they constantly allocated resources into eggs, which slowed growth. The observed allometric increase in sexual size dimorphism is explained by the fact that the difference between these selective processes becomes larger as energy abundance in the environment increases. Because body size is generally highly heritable, these selective processes are expected to lead to genetic differences in body size between islands. We propose a common-garden experiment to determine the influence of genetic factors and phenotypic reaction norms of final body size.","UNIV BIELEFELD, DEPT ANIM BEHAV, D-33501 BIELEFELD, GERMANY; MAX PLANCK INST BEHAV PHYSIOL, ABT WICKLER, D-82319 SEEWIESEN, GERMANY",,,,,,,,106,149,152,1,114,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUN,1997,51,3,,,,,922,936,,10.2307/2411166,,,15,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,XM065,WOS:A1997XM06500024,28568579,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Phoxinus erythrogaster occurred at only six sites. Data assessed similarity among all sites and described microhabitat associations of P. erythrogaster. Five species, including Semotilus atromaculatus, Campostoma anomalum, Etheostoma whipplei, P. erythrogaster and Pimephales notatus, comprised 95% of the total number of individuals collected at P. erythrogarter sites. Standardized abundance (number per seine haul) for S. atromaculatus was consistently high among all P. erythrogaster sites, whereas standardized abundance for C. anomalum, P. erythrogaster and P. notatus varied from site to site. Increased standardized abundance of P. erythrogaster was inversely related to abundances of C. anomalum and P. notatus and was highest in the absence of C. anomalum and P. notatus. Thus competition among C. anomalum. If erythrogaster and P. notatus may be linked to the limited occurrence of P. erythrogaster in W-central Mississippi. A UPGMA cluster analysis of ichthyofaunal composition (chord distance) showed high similarity among the six sites where If erythrogaster was present. These sites were typically characterized as narrow meandering streams with gravel, pebble and sand substrata, slow-flowing pools with clear cool (22 C) water and steep banks. A discriminant function analysis indicated that the presence of P. erythrogaster is associated with stream reaches with high proportions of gravel, detritus, snag, pebble, small cobble and small boulder (Canonical R = 0.73, P = 0.018). A test of the reliability of the predictive model resulted in 87% of the cases being correctly classified (P < 0.01). Declining habitat quality due to erosion and increased urban development was evident at a number of sites including two historic localities where P. erythrogaster no longer occurs. Phoxinus erythrogaster abundance was low along degraded stream reaches and typically higher in areas where habitat has been less impacted. Clustering of sites where FI erythrogaster was present, based on habitat similarity (chord distance), was not as strong as similarity based on ichthyofaunal composition. There was significant congruence between the two dendrogram matrices (Mantel z = 314.69, P = 0.014) but the relationship between corresponding similarity values was low (r(cs) = 0.334). Thus, the ability to predict sites similar in ichthyofaunal composition based on habitat similarity was low. This suggests that although specific habitat features are important to P. erythrogaster, additional factors such as declining habitat quality and interspecific competition may be influencing the occurrence of P. erythrogaster in W-central Mississippi.",,"Slack, WT (corresponding author), UNIV SO MISSISSIPPI,DEPT BIOL SCI,HATTIESBURG,MS 39406, USA.",,"Darden, Tanya/B-6915-2019","Darden, Tanya/0000-0001-7295-7360",,,,47,4,4,0,5,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

However, recent studies of the dynamics of natural populations indicate that density-dependent population regulation probably takes place over many generations (Nt+1=f[N-t, Nt-1,...]). In this paper, explore the stability properties of interacting populations and contrast the predictions of discrete-generation models of population growth which do and do not include delayed density dependence. Relative to non-delayed models, inclusion of delayed density dependence changes the shape of population cycles (flip vs Hopf bifurcations) and decreases the range of parameters which predict stable equilibria. I also explore extensions of these models that include interspecific competition and coupling of spatially isolated patches. In both cases, delayed density dependence significantly changes the way in which demographic parameters scale to overall dynamics. For example, when delayed density dependence does not differ between two species, the asymptotic stability of both species is determined by a weighted average of the population growth rates of the two species. However, when species differ in time delay, some pairs of species that would both exhibit cyclical or chaotic dynamics in isolation can stably coexist. Analogous conclusions hold for the effects of deterministic spatial environmental variation among coupled patches. This implies that inclusion of delayed density dependence in investigations of population dynamics can dramatically change the inferences we draw from mathematical models and that further investigations of the effects of deterministic differences in demographic parameters and of delayed density dependence are warranted.

Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in influent wastewater for two of the SBRs (the Glucose 1 and 2 SBRs) resulted in optimization of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), and a bacterial population capable of increasing phosphorus (P) removals in response to increased VFA or P concentration. Another SBR not receiving VFAs (the Starch SBR) showed marginal EBPR and was incapable of either response. All three anaerobic/aerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) showed bounded oscillations in P removal that did not correspond to any operational or environmental change. The oscillations were probably associated with interspecies population dynamics intensified due to the periodic, unsteady-state, nature of the SBR process. The glucose SBRs also showed an additional type of variability associated with EBPR, probably from competition between poly-P and ''G'' bacteria for readily available substrate (i.e. glucose, VFAs) during anaerobiosis. The predominant bacterial isolates from the glucose SBRs were Pseudomonas and Bacillus while Aeromonas was isolated most frequently from the Starch SBR The relatively slow growth rate of Pseudomonas may have contributed to the high variability of EBPR observed. Fractal analysis indicated overall variability may have been chaotic, but was inconclusive.

The hypotheses tested are that interspecific differences in body size among desmognathines stem proximately from variation in age at first reproduction and that variation in the latter trait is positively correlated with variation in fecundity among species. It is shown that a correlation between age at first reproduction and fecundity, combined with a uniform rate of survival, based on available estimates of these parameters, will yield equivalent values of net reproductive rate (R(o)) among the species of a given assemblage. Such equivalence represents a form of life-history symmetry. Data from two assemblages are presented in support of the argument for symmetry. Such life-history symmetry may reflect uniformity in morphological specialization in desmognathines. Given the morphological adaptations to burrowing (head-wedging) in the subfamily, the relationship between adult body size and habitat preference in Desmognathus may reflect adaptation to the size of cover objects and composition of the substratum along the aquatic-terrestrial habitat gradient, I propose that these variables, in association with predation and competition, represent the selective factors responsible for body size diversification in Desmognathus.","HIGHLANDS BIOL STN, HIGHLANDS, NC 28741 USA","Bruce, RC (corresponding author), WESTERN CAROLINA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, CULLOWHEE, NC 28723 USA.",,,,,,,38,34,35,0,3,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,DEC 27,1996,,4,,,,,783,790,,10.2307/1447639,,,8,Zoology,Zoology,WA683,WOS:A1996WA68300003,,,,,2021-09-21,

There is, however, some debate as to the actual mechanisms producing these unhealthy trees. To investigate further some of the processes that may be contributing to this form of canopy dieback, two field trials were carried out in Olney State Forest, near Wyong, New South Wales. The study site contained Eucalyptus saligna (Sydney blue gum) with canopy dieback and was occupied by a large colony of bell miners. Close examination of the foliage revealed a large and diverse suite of phytophagous insects, including at least 16 species of psyllid (Hemiptera: Psyllidae). In the first trial, the use of bird exclusion cages over selected branches significantly improved leaf survival compared to leaves exposed to a relatively high density of bell miners. It is proposed thar colonization by bell miners may interfere with the efficacy of both other insectivorous birds (through aggressive interspecific territoriality) and the invertebrate predators and parasitoids. Interference with such regulatory factors may enable some phytophagous insect populations To rise to sustained damaging levels. In the second trial, an insecticide application combined. with reduced competition from the dense understorey and neighbouring trees was required to significantly improve trunk diameter and crown condition scores. After 12 months, neither treatment, by itself, significantly improved both growth measures. Possibly both treatments were required because the E. saligna trees were suffering from another source of stress (e.g. drought) in addition to the relatively high level of insect attack.",,"Stone, C (corresponding author), STATE FORESTS NEW S WALES,DIV RES,POB 100,BEECROFT,NSW 2119,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,34,29,33,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

IgG Abs specific for Gal alpha 1-3Gal have been postulated to contribute to host defense and to participate in the rejection of interspecies organ grafts. Our previous studies indicated, however, that IgM and not IgG anti-Gal alpha 1-3Gal Abs activate complement on foreign surfaces, and thus the physiologic role of IgG anti-Gal alpha 1-3Gal remains uncertain. We tested whether the IgG anti-Gal alpha 1-3Gal in a human serum might in fact compete with IgM for binding and thus modulate complement fixation by IgM. Several lines of evidence suggested such competition might occur. First, the functional avidity of IgG and IgM for Gal alpha 1-3Gal on cell surfaces were nearly within the same order of magnitude, and in some sera the molar concentrations of IgG and IgM anti-Gal alpha 1-3Gal were comparable. Second, binding of human IgM to Gal alpha 1-3Gal on cell surfaces was inversely correlated with the concentration of IgG anti-Gal alpha 1-3Gal in serum. Third, combination of IgG and IgM Abs specific for Gal alpha 1-3Gal demonstrated direct competition for binding. The presence of IgG anti-Gal alpha 1-3Gal, which was predominantly lgG2, attenuated by up to 80% the fixation of C1q mediated by IgM, presumably by competing for antigenic sites recognized by IgM Abs that fix complement. Thus, IgG Abs specific for Gal alpha 1-3Gal modulate complement activation by IgM specific for that structure and might in this way modulate the consequences that ensue when human blood is brought into contact with foreign organisms or xenogenic cells.","DUKE UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT SURG,DURHAM,NC 27710; DUKE UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT PEDIAT,DURHAM,NC 27710; DUKE UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT IMMUNOL,DURHAM,NC 27710",,,,"Yu, Paul/0000-0003-2145-4944; Parker, William/0000-0003-3644-9152","NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL052297, P01HL050985, R37HL052297] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NHLBI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [HL 52297, HL 50985] Funding Source: Medline",,,31,77,78,0,1,AMER ASSOC IMMUNOLOGISTS,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814",0022-1767,,,J IMMUNOL,J.

Methods: Three forms of the biological predator-prey model are estimated with two- and three-stage least squares and supplemented with a Bayesian updating test. Results: The predator-prey mechanism fits the German data well, even in a context of low coercion.

The convergence hypothesis predicts that similar abiotic conditions should result in similar adaptations in independent taxa. Because primates offer a unique opportunity among mammals to examine adaptations of independent groups to tropical environments, we collected information on body mass, activity pattern, diet and group size from all genera for quantitative rests of this hypothesis. We revealed a number of qualitative and quantitative differences among the four primate groups, indicating a lack of convergence in these basic aspects of life history and socio-ecology. Our analyses demonstrated that New World primates are on average significantly smaller than primates in other regions and characterized by a lack of species larger than about 10 kg. Madagascar harbours significantly more nocturnal species than the other regions and is home to all but one of the primates with irregular bursts of activity. Asia is the only region with strictly faunivorous primates, but lacks primarily gummivorous ones. The Neotropics are characterized by the absence of primarily folivorous primates. Solitary species are not represented in the New World, whereas solitary and pair-living species make up the majority of Malagasy primates. Lemurs live in significantly smaller groups than other primates, even after controlling for differences in body size. The lack of convergence among the major primate groups is neither primarily due to phylogenetic constraints as a result of founder effects, nor can it be sufficiently explained as a passive consequence of body size differences. However, because the role of adaptive forces, such as interspecific competition, predation or phenology in shaping the observed differences is largely unexplored, we conclude that it is premature to discard the convergence hypothesis without further rests.

Dens occupied by fox squirrels had smaller entrances and shorter distances to forest openings than cavities previously used by fox squirrels, but unoccupied when examined. Den sites of raccoons did not appear to be a limiting resource in winter because of a large number of unused cavities.

In vivo turnover studies indicated the metabolic basis was decreased particle fractional catabolic rate. The presence of enlarged triglyceride-rich particles with prolonged residence time in plasma implied defective lipolysis, but in vitro these particles were good substrates for purified lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In the current study we further characterize the metabolic properties of these particles. We show that expression of a mouse apoC-III transgene can also cause hypertriglyceridemia with a similar accumulation of a VLDL-like particle with increased apoC-III and decreased apoE. A vitamin A fat tolerance test was used to show that MoCIIITg and HuCIIITg mice had similarly delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich postprandial particles. Thus, the previously observed hypertriglyceridemia caused by human apoC-III transgene expression was not due interspecies incompatibility but a property of apoC-III. In further experiments we showed VLDL from apoC-III transgenic mice interacted poorly with fibroblast lipoprotein receptors and this could be corrected by adding exogenous apoE. In addition, control VLDL interaction could be decreased by exogenous apoC-III. Moreover, the hypertriglyceridemia of HuCIIITg mice could be normalized by crossbreeding with HuETg mice. Thus, a functionally significant reciprocal relationship of apoC-III and apoE exists, presumably due to competition for space on the surface of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Finally, VLDL from HuCIIITg and MoCIIITg mice showed decreased binding to heparin-Sepharose. This suggests an additional locus of the defect in these mice could potentially be in the binding of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to heparan sulfate proteoglycan matrix on the surface of endothelial cells in which LPL is embedded. This could explain the predicted functional lipase deficiency in apoC-III transgenic mice based on the observation of a prolonged residence time of enlarged triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.","ROCKEFELLER UNIV, BIOCHEM GENET & METAB LAB, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA; UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT MED, FIN-00290 HELSINKI, FINLAND; PARKE DAVIS PHARMACEUT RES, DEPT PHARMACOL, ANN ARBOR, MI 48105 USA",,,"Weinstock, Peter H/AAD-2297-2021; Breslow, Jan L/B-7544-2008; Smith, Jonathan D./H-9723-2013","Smith, Jonathan D./0000-0002-0415-386X","NHLBI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [HL33714] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL033714] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,43,99,100,0,5,AMER SOC BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY INC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3996 USA",0022-2275,1539-7262,,J LIPID RES,J.
